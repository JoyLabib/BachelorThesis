0,How This Entrepreneurial Couple Is Revolutionizing Brand Loyalty,"Apr 2, 2024",Dan Bova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-this-entrepreneurial-couple-is-revolutionizing-brand/471568,"
Entrepreneur Ventures is an early-stage venture capital firm partnered with Entrepreneur Media that is dedicated to backing passionate and innovative founders as early as day one. In this series, we are profiling the amazing entrepreneurs that Entrepreneur Ventures is working with to share their insights on building and growing a thriving business.Please tell us about yourselves and your business.Amanda Huh: Our company is called Amaze. It's a white-labeled self-service platform that creates memberships for brands. I'm the co-founder and CMO, and my husband Stephen George is the co-founder and CEO. Our partner Keith Hoerling is the CTO. Simply put, our platform allows brands to create digital membership cards that live in members' Apple and Google Wallet and allows them to give great perks, build their community, and capture powerful data. We're a super-lightweight tool and we create a frictionless experience for our customers and their members.What inspired the business?



Amanda Huh: During the pandemic, we noticed a lot of businesses shutting down. Stephen has a strong background in the customer loyalty space, and we wanted to build something that businesses could really rely on to create sustainable revenue and connect with their consumers in a more meaningful way.Stephen George: I was at Groupon so I've been in this loyalty and reward space for a long time. We started building our platform in 2023 and pushed it live to our first customers in December. We started by talking to smaller businesses in food, beverage, health, wellness and fashion. But similar to Groupon, every business in the world can benefit from using our platform. This isn't just a rewards card where customers are collecting stars or points. Those loyalty programs are passive — half of the time you don't even remember you're enrolled — and they're purely transactional. When a business has a membership, it creates a sense of belonging and community.

We chose to take advantage of those wallets' existing infrastructure and traction — they have two and a half billion users — rather than building a brand-new app. We also have a couple of customers who have decided to have a physical card printed on metal with a QR code on the back. Either way, the idea is that this card is something that people will show off, kind of as a humble brag. It can be to your favorite sports team, a non-profit you support, a cool barbershop, a high-end nightclub or a restaurant. The card gives you a sense of belonging and also allows businesses to offer access to things that a member actually wants. For example, we have a restaurant group that wanted to give its investors to feel like they're a part of something. So they gave them each an investor card that gives them priority reservations and a free bottle of wine once a month. Now, a high-end restaurant can take this concept and monetize it by having a VIP pay a thousand dollars a month for a membership card that offers them $500 in beverage credit or some other great perks.What is your business background?


Amanda Huh: My family is in the seafood industry. Our company is called Pacific American Fish Company and we're one of the largest import-export manufacturing and distribution companies in the United States. I built out our DTC line and then my brother and I started a family office focused on technology investments. So I came from the investor side and now I've got the founder hat on. So it's a very unique experience kind of coming from both sides.Stephen George: I started at Groupon as an intern. There were just four engineers at the company at the time and it was prior to when it was called Groupon. I stayed with them until the IPO. It was a great learning experience for me, obviously being just 20 years old and becoming Head of Global Operations in three years. I went on to invest in startups and have built a few companies over the past decade. I made my way out to LA from Chicago, which is where I met Amanda. We now have two kids and run our business from our home in the town that Amanda grew up in.Related: 'We're Curating Happiness': See How This Entrepreneur Is Transforming the Wellness Space Through MembershipHow did your experience as investors help your fundraising process?


Amanda Huh: It's a big help because I understand what investors are really looking for. When I was an investor, it really came down to how I connected with the founders as people. At the core, you are investing in somebody who's going to do the right thing. So on the founder's side, you want to communicate to investors that you're a compassionate person, that you're solution-oriented and that you have the tenacity to make this concept come to fruition.Stephen George: Amanda and I come from different business backgrounds. Her family business had been profitable I think for 40-plus years. They've never taken outside money. No debt. Nothing. I come from Groupon where we raised a billion dollars and relied on that outside funding. It was growth at all costs. So with Amaze, we try to balance that. We brought in a few customers who wanted to put some small checks in over the course of building the product, but really didn't take much funding. Now that we have a product, we have customers signing up, and a clear go to market strategy, we're raising money. And I think that gives us an advantage not having a huge burn pre-revenue and pre-product.Related: How to Pitch Your Company to Entrepreneur Ventures for InvestmentAny advice for those seeking funding?


Stephen George: For early-stage founders, the more you can prove that this is a viable business before you take funding will put you in a better position. I think that taking some money is fine, but make sure not to let fundraising take over your attention. Allowing yourself to focus on the business is really important. Put your energy into the problem you're solving and building the right solution.What does it mean to you to be an entrepreneur?Amanda Huh: For me being an entrepreneur is tied to my parents' immigrant story. They came over from South Korea back 1969, and built their business. So it is really about being a self-starter and creating a legacy for our kids and building something that is valuable to our community. And that's what Amaze is centered on: we're giving businesses the power to build better relationships with their customers.Stephen George: When you talk about success as a founder, we define that as having customers from year one who are still going to be able to really benefit from our platform in year 10. And my big advice to entrepreneurs reading this is to be patient. No matter what you are doing, it is always going to take longer than expected. And while you may need to pivot, change direction or regroup, you just can't give up.

1,Avoid These 9 Pitch Deck Mistakes When Asking Others For Money,"Mar 28, 2024",Kirill Gurskiy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/avoid-these-9-mistakes-when-asking-for-money/471559,"
Raising money is critical to a startup's success. It is essential to fuel growth, build infrastructure, attract talent, mitigate risks, access networks, scale marketing and sales efforts, and achieve milestones.A pitch deck is one of the most important documents a founder can craft in their career. By now, certain rules of what should and shouldn't be in a pitch deck have been established, shaped by decades of venture market history.Here are a few recommendations on what to avoid to make a successful presentation:



1. Lack of essential informationCertain information must be included in every pitch deck because all investors want to know it:the problem and solution your startup intends to addressthe timeline for the development of that product and your total addressable market sizeyour business model, unit economics and tractioncompetition landscape and peers' analysisyour team and its experienceHow can investors help you with all that? What is the amount you are raising and the use of funds?Skip any of these sections, and your chances of hearing back from investors decrease significantly.


It's always a plus if you have the demo version of your product to show how it works in action instead of describing it. Product demonstrations, videos and prototypes give your audience valuable hands-on experience. This approach allows investors to see the potential of your solution and creates a lasting impression that words alone won't achieve.Another addition to strengthening your pitch deck is to share your product's first metrics. Traction and evidence of market validation can instill confidence in potential investors. If you want them to feel even more positive about your solution, demonstrate the company's progress and achievements to the current or future date with a strict roadmap.Related: Watch Out for These 9 Seed Funding Gotchas2. Hard-to-follow overloaded slidesPrioritize clarity — avoid overstuffing slides and keep them clean. Each slide should contain a single, clear message so that your audience grasps the ideas quickly and remembers them long after the presentation. Also, avoid jargon, overly technical terms or convoluted explanations.


3. Outdated numbers and dataInvestors expect to see a lot of numbers in a deck, including market size, market research, peers' data and your own metrics showing traction. All these numbers must be fresh and regularly updated. No investor would take you seriously after receiving a pitch deck with 2022 market data in April 2024.4. Messy materialsA book is judged by its cover. Apply the same rule to pitch decks. Investors see tons of decks daily, so it is crucial that your pitch deck stands out amongst them and is remarkable. To achieve this, use visuals, concise text, and memorable images (not the stock ones) to convey your points.Related: 8 Things Your Pitch Deck Needs5. Pulling the wool over investors' eyesSometimes, companies focus more on ""advisors"" instead of team members directly involved in product development in their pitch decks. Or mention projects in which they were involved indirectly or for a very short period.


It's in people's nature to desire to associate themselves with big and renowned projects or market leaders. However, that is a losing tactic since investors usually have wide industry connections and can easily check that information. Show your real strengths and weaknesses honestly to give investors the right expectations and build strong and trusting relationships.In the section about your team, highlight experience as evidence of what you are all capable of. Show specific projects that team members worked on and what they were responsible for on those projects. Also, it will be great to note the achievements that they gained during these projects.Related: Craft a Winning Pitch Deck That Wows Investors6. Too many slidesIdeally, a deck should consist of 10-15 slides. An important purpose of a deck is for the founder to show that they can present their ideas clearly and structuredly. Cut off all unnecessary and general details to keep your deck down to business.


7. Lack of market validationNeglecting to include information on market research, customer feedback, or competitive analysis is a critical mistake. Investors and potential partners want to see the evidence of a demand for your product in the market.Include data on your target market's size, growth potential, and any early market traction you've gained. Testimonials, partnerships or customer feedback help validate your business concept.8. No call to actionEnd your deck with a clear and compelling call to action to make it more memorable and actionable. Indicate how much you are raising to let investors know what you want from them right away.Remember to explain how you plan to distribute that amount to help investors understand how their funds will be used. Define your value proposition, objectives and exit strategy upfront and make evident how your proposal can benefit investors.

Rehearse your presentation multiple times to ensure smooth and confident delivery. Seek feedback from mentors, advisors, or peers to identify areas for improvement. The more polished your pitch is, the more likely it is to be remembered for the right reasons.Update and improve your pitch deck after getting investors' feedback. Look for professional analyses of pitch decks on related services.

2,31 Ways to Market Your Business on a Budget,"Mar 28, 2024",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/no-money-no-problem-30-low-budget-marketing-ideas-for/327097,"
As the old adage goes, you have to spend money to make money — so if you want your business to grow, you need to devote resources to marketing and advertising. But if you're on a tight budget, you don't have to wait until your coffers are full. Instead, use these 31 low-budget marketing and advertising ideas to get your name and product out there without breaking the bank. Be sure to read on for key tips from advertising experts about how to scale your promotional efforts. 1. Hone Your PitchYou never know who you'll run into, so always be prepared to market your business. The most effective way to do this is by having a compelling elevator pitch — something that you can break out in a moment's notice without it feeling too rehearsed. It's not easy, especially because most people have short attention spans. 



How can you perfect your elevator pitch? A few tips: Know what motivates your audience.Tell a concise story that shows your expertise.Anticipate key questions about your competitive advantage.2. Get Involved in Your Community When people think of marketing, they often think of large-scale national campaigns. But sometimes it's best to think small and see what's happening at a local level. Sponsor a 5k race or a Little League team, set up a table at a local event or print bookmarks and leave them at the library. Your own community is probably more dynamic than you think, so don't overlook ways to grow your business right at home.3. Ask for ReferralsReferrals are among the most effective — and cost-effective — ways to generate new business. The problem is, people often feel uncomfortable when asking for referrals. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways to do it without having to feel awkward or desperate. Here are a few of ideas to get you started:Ask for referrals via email, in person or at the bottom of your invoices.Focus on your best client or customers.Offer incentives like a gift card, discounts on future work or small gifts.Make it easy. Use email scripts or plugins on your site.Give referrals yourself. Paying it forward builds goodwill. 4. Join In-Person Networking Groups and Events Networking is key. After all, it's one of the most effective ways to build meaningful relationships that can help grow your business. If you haven't already, join face-to-face networking groups in your community, such as your local chamber of commerce. These organizations frequently hold business mixers and other events that will help you connect with potential customers. Check out local business events on Meetup.com, or see what events your local chamber or small business association is hosting.You can also become a member of business organizations, like Business Networking International, the Young Entrepreneur's Council, the Entrepreneur's Organization, or SCORE. It's also worth keeping an eye out for industry-specific trade shows, which can be great sources of information and lead to important connections. 


5. Apply for Business AwardsIt's common for industries and organizations to give awards honoring the best businesses for customer service, overall value, community impact and more. In many cases, you just need to apply to be in the running. If you win, it will boost the credibility of your business. Many local newspapers and magazines will also give these awards annually, and when there are reader's choice categories you can encourage your network to vote for you. 6. Target InfluencersWith the dominance of social media, working with influencers has become a popular method of marketing. Influencers can promote products to audiences you might not reach with traditional advertising strategies — just make sure you find an influencer specific to your industry (you don't want to work with someone who is reaching the wrong audience), and offer that person free products or services in exchange for a review. 7. Practice Cold Calling and EmailingEven in today's world, cold calling and emailing can still be effective ways to obtain new business — and the practice doesn't cost you anything but time. Of course, there's more to it than just picking up the phone and calling someone, or sending them an email. Here are some pointers:Don't focus on the sale. The idea is to create an opportunity for you to make your pitch.Prepare an effective opening statement that includes greeting, introduction, the benefits of your product/service and a transition to a question or conversation.Prepare a script so that you can answer any questions or concerns.Set up an appointment — you can share your calendar with them so they can see your availability and select a time that works for them.Always be pleasant to whoever picks up the phone or responds to your email.Be persistent. It may take three or four contacts to set up an appointment.8. Offer to SpeakThere are plenty of opportunities for you to speak in front of an audience. In fact, industry conferences, volunteer organizations, local business groups, community colleges and libraries are usually in need of speakers. As a result, you'll get some name recognition, contacts and publicity. You could also offer to host an event or class, which would broaden awareness of your business and connect you with potential customers. 9. Publish Top-Notch ContentOne way to get your business noticed is by writing content that readers find valuable. To that end, consider adding a blog to your business website and publishing useful advice about industry trends, product-specific updates and behind-the-scenes looks at your business. Share the content on social media channels and you can grow an audience of potential customers. You can also write for industry publications and build a reputation as a subject-matter expert in your field. Reach out to industry organizations or publications that accept contributor posts, build a relationship with editors and prove your expertise. 


10. Repurpose Your ContentDo you have old content out there? If so, you may be able to recycle it and grow your audience on additional platforms without having to create brand-new assets. For example, you could take a study you conducted and make it into an infographic, you could take a collection of blog posts on a specific topic and create an eBook or the podcast you just taped could become a YouTube video. You don't have to start from scratch each time you produce content, but you shouldn't merely reuse content without tweaking or refreshing it for the appropriate audience. 11. Collect Email Addresses and Start a NewsletterEmail is a huge player in online content marketing and advertising. Make sure you're growing email lists and managing your outreach with an email-marketing program like Mailchimp, HubSpot or others. When you publish content, send it to your email lists via a newsletter. This will keep potential customers tuned into all the valuable information you're publishing — which will strengthen your business reputation — while also keeping them apprised of special discounts, events and business updates. 12. Host Webinars on Your SiteHosting webinars can be costly; however, some companies offer free or low-cost options for small business owners. Some cheap options are MeetCheap. If you are looking for an even cheaper option, YouTube Live Streaming is 100% free, provided you have a verified YouTube channel.13. Run an Online ContestPromotional giveaways and contests can be effective ways to build awareness and introduce your business to potential customers. Ideally, your contest or giveaway should contain your products or services, such as the chance to win a free subscription to your service or a recently released product. Promote the contest on social media and don't forget to announce the winner. Just be sure that you abide by your state's rules for running a contest. 14. Give Your Product Away This may sound counterproductive, but don't hesitate to offer people a free trial of your service or a free sample of your product. If they like what you're offering, they may well purchase more of your products or services. You can also offer coupons to get customers in the door for the first time and, hopefully, keep them coming back.It might also be worth designing swag — keychains, water bottles and shirts — with your logo and giving it away at events. This free branded merchandise can raise the profile of your company and help it become more of a household name in your market. 15. Create a Free Google My Business AccountIf you want your business to show up in local search, a Google My Business account is a necessity. This will ensure your business is visible not only on search but also on Google Maps.


16. Create a Free Yelp ListingIf you are a local business, consider adding your business to Yelp. It's free, and can be a great way to increase your visibility in the search engines.17. Secure Your Online PresenceHopefully, you've already listed your business on search engine local directories, as well as created pages on Facebook, LinkedIn and other social media platforms. Even if you don't intend to use social media often, it's smart to future-proof your business name by securing social handles. The same is true for your website: You should secure your domain name as soon as possible, and make sure you stay up to date on renewals. You can confirm your information – such as your website, business owners and contact information – are correct and current by using tools like Yext.18. Get Free PR with HAROHow does free PR in national magazines and websites sound? Create a free account with HARO. (Help a Reporter Out) and respond to relevant media queries.19. Create Business Cards and Other Materials It's very easy to design and order your own business cards these days. Keep them handy wherever you go and don't be stingy about giving someone your card. Doing so will help you broaden the reach of your business. Other materials — like informational one-sheets or postcards — can also be effective ways of marketing your product or services. If you attend events, you can hand those materials out and connect with new audiences.20. Start a PodcastStarting a podcast doesn't have to be expensive — you just need to purchase a microphone, understand the basics of hosting and learn how to edit audio (or hire someone to edit for you). With consistency over time, your podcast can build awareness of your business, showcase your knowledge and humanize your brand. 21. Make Your Outreach PersonalIf you have existing customers, take the time to show them how much you appreciate their support. You could do this by writing them a handwritten ""thank you"" note or giving them a shout-out in a video or podcast. This goodwill is likely to make an impression, and may even lead them to tell others how you went above and beyond to make them feel important. 22. Make the Most of Employee Email SignaturesThis is a simple and cost-effective way to market your business. Just have your team add a short sentence with a call to action in their email signatures along with your logo. Now, whenever they send out an email, there's an unobtrusive marketing message being seen by potential customers.


23. Respond to QueriesTake the time to answer questions in places like Google's business reviews, social media comment sections, or sites like Quora. Monitoring online forums that are relevant to your industry is also a great place to respond to potential customers. This is a simple and cheap way to build trust and potentially get noticed by a new audience. 24. Get Serious About Social Media It takes time to be active on social media and grow your audience, but if you know what you're doing, you can have a real impact without having to spend much money. Create a Facebook Group and invite people to follow it, launch an Instagram account and post pictures or videos of your product, start connecting with people on LinkedIn and consider even making a TikTok account. If you have a limited advertising budget, it could be worth spending money on social media to build a following. 25. Embrace ""Guerilla Marketing"" and Other Unusual IdeasEffective advertising and marketing involves putting in more effort than your competitors. Don't be afraid to pound the pavement and put hangers on doorknobs, place flyers under windshield wipers or brand your vehicle. Guerilla marketing involves doing the things others might not expect, like creating an installation of street art, projecting your logo onto the side of a building or even planning some type of publicity stunt. There are many ways to get people's attention – becreative. 26. Take advantage of Facebook and Google's free ad creditsFacebook and Google are always giving away free ad credit vouchers. When you are signing up for services like web hosting or Google Ads, take advantage of the free vouchers they offer and take PPC (pay-per-click)_advertising for a test drive.27. Spend on Advertising for Key Demographics If you're trying to advertise with a limited budget, you need to make sure you're getting high value out of your spend. One key way you can do this: target your advertising spending based on audience demographics. Use tools like Google Analytics and social media data to figure out the demographics that define your customers. Maybe most of your customers are college educated and between the ages of 31 and 45. Use that information to target your advertisements on various platforms. It's also worth looking for promotional credits. Digital campaigns can get pricey, but you may be able to find discounts from Google or social media sites that offer incentive programs for first-time advertisers and allow you to target specific demographics. 28. Collaborate with Affiliates and Other Partners Teaming up with another business related to your industry is a great way to introduce your product to a new audience. You can do this by collaborating online — by hosting a webinar, for instance — or by hosting exclusive in-person events together. You could team up with a local brewery for a networking event, or host a customer appreciation night in conjunction with a business with whom you share referrals. If you offer a digital product (like an ebook), you can also look into affiliate or agencies and resellers, which earn a commission by marketing your product and generating leads. However, you'll need to make sure your pricing structure takes into account their fees.


29. Take Advantage of Audio Advertising According to the World Advertising Research Center, there is a big gap between time spent with audio and its ad spend — meaning there are huge opportunities for advertising on podcasts, radio shows and elsewhere. Programmatic audio advertising (the automated selling and insertion of ads) enables a data-driven approach that produces efficient targeting and measurement. Audio hosting platforms like Spotify, SoundCloud, Pandora and others rely on a process called dynamic ad insertion, which advertisers can use to serve ads in both live and on-demand content. 30. Consider Advertising Outdoors Advertising outdoors is one of the original forms of business promotion. In the industry, it's referred to as out-of-home advertising, but the concept — which includes billboards, yard signs, digital projections and other creative approaches — is a relatively simple one. Before you start thinking it's outdated, data suggests out-of-home advertising is still effective. Plus, with detailed analytics now available — movement patterns, audience saturation and more — you can optimize outdoor campaigns beyond previous capabilities. 31. Don't Forget Newspapers and MagazinesWhile print media isn't as strong as it once was, newspapers and magazines can still offer valuable advertising opportunities — especially at the local level and for those trying to reach an older audience. The costs will vary based on several factors: the publication you choose, the size and color of your ad, the frequency and whether or not it will also run online. Print media with larger circulations will be more expensive, but don't overlook community bulletins or local media where you can still get good value for cheaper. Bonus: Advertising Principles to Follow from David Ogilvy David Ogilvy, often referred to as the ""father of advertising,"" was a British executive who ran one of the most successful ad agencies of the twentieth century. His clients included Schweppes, Rolls-Royce and Shell, and his principles have been studied by marketers for decades. In Craig Simpson's book, The Advertising Solution, Ogilvy's principles are outlined as follows: Creative brilliance: Marketers need to come up with concepts that not only catch their best targets' attention, but also sell them on the product. Ogilvy was a proponent of the ""big idea"" — a concept that cap­tures the imagination of your audience and puts your product (or yourself) on the map.Research: Ogilvy didn't believe in blowing smoke. His copy was meticulously based in fact, and he did careful research about a product that he could then build a campaign around.Actual results: Ogilvy was a strong believer in judging the quality of an ad by its success at selling the product. Always test the outcome of an ad, and if it isn't selling, make changes.Professional discipline: Advertising executives were not dabblers in the creative realm. They needed to hone their craft and develop programs to train the next generation of adver­tisers. Three Rules for Shameless Success Debbie Allen, an entrepreneur, business mentor and author, has published several books about the importance of sales, marketing and advertising. In Success Is Easy, which she published in 2019, Allen writes about the importance of self promotion.""It's easy to promote yourself when you believe in the value of what you offer,"" she writes in her book. ""To move to a higher level of success, you must practice promoting and selling in ways that may feel uncomfortable at first. Next time you experience a feeling of discomfort in self-promotion or the feeling of rejection creeps in, move toward it instead of away from it.""Allen offers the following three rules for shameless success: 


Have your own personal style. Dare to be differ­ent.Never give up even when others don't believe in you or your ideas.Stand out. Position yourself in front of the right people to get noticed.Now that you're armed with these marketing and advertising ideas and you've heard from the pros, it's time to put these lessons to work. Pick a handful of approaches to try first, create an advertising plan and work with your team to spread the word about your venture. Even if you don't have a huge promotion budget, with creativity and a thoughtful strategy, you'll reach an engaged audience and grow your business prospects.

3,4 Steps to Take Before Asking Investors for Money,"Mar 20, 2024",Liam Gill,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-determine-the-amount-of-investor-money-to-raise/471044,"
The primary objective for any entrepreneur is to ensure that their company has sufficient capital. For many businesses, this can be achieved through revenues, but for others seeking high growth, this requires raising venture capital.The amount of capital that you seek to raise is a key part of the deal when raising venture capital. Investors need to know that you are raising the right amount of capital for the business. This is often determined based on a milestone you promise to hit using the newly invested funds. Investors want to clearly understand that when they invest in your company, they will hit a specific key performance indicator such as a revenue target, user target, intellectual property development goal or other tangible milestone.There are specific best practices for determining how much money to raise. First, investors will want to see how achieving your milestone will increase your company's value. Second, estimate the cost of achieving that milestone. Lastly, determine if you can raise enough money to cover costs at a valuation that doesn't overdilute you or make it hard to raise again. While no one knows precisely how much money they need to build their company, these practices can help establish a realistic target for raising funds.



Related: 99% of Investor Pitches End in Failure. Here's How to Make Sure You're Part of the 1% That Succeed.Step 1: Select milestones achievable with the funding roundTo secure investment from VCs, creating a convincing story of how their money will be used to increase your company's value is important. These goals, referred to as ""accretive milestones,"" will differ between businesses, with examples including reaching product-market fit or achieving cash-flow break-even. When setting these goals, it's essential to consider whether they will enable you to raise your next round on a valuation twice as high as the current round or to become profitable enough to avoid the need for further VC funding and limit dilution of ownership.


Step 2: Determine your burn rateOnce you know the milestone you aim to hit, you need to focus on your burn rate (the amount of money you will spend) to achieve it.Burn rate is the amount of money a company loses monthly after accounting for revenue. For startups without income, the burn rate is simply the money spent each month. The burn rate can help determine the amount of money needed to raise, referred to as the operating runway. The runway is calculated by dividing the bank balance by the monthly burn rate and multiplying by the number of months being calculated.It would be best if you aimed to have enough money so your company can continue operating for at least 12 months, ideally 18-24 months after raising a funding round.Entrepreneurs need to set realistic goals for their company and not overestimate what they can accomplish in a certain period. To do this, they should consider what meaningful progress they could realistically achieve within the next 12-24 months and create a list of the people they would need to hire to accomplish those goals. By doing this, entrepreneurs can ensure that they have a clear plan for using the funding they raise from investors and can avoid setting unrealistic expectations.


Related: 4 Signs That Your Small Business Needs FundingStep 3: How much to raiseAs a general rule, you should likely raise at least 20% more than you estimate you will need but less than 2x what you estimate.While the downsides of running out of money are significantly worse than the downsides of having too much, it remains true that there are negative consequences of overraising. Taking too much money can set unrealistic expectations for your team, putting you under more pressure to perform. It can also lead to wasteful spending, creating a culture and habits that eventually lead to the business's downfall.Step 4: Determining your valuationGenerally, once you've decided how much to raise, your valuation will end up being 4-5x the amount you are raising, as most companies are requested to give up 20-25% of their shares in any investment round. The truth is that there is no clear guide we can give on deciding your valuation as there are too many factors, including your market, the economic conditions, etc. The best advice is to focus on two things when determining the valuation.


First, in the current market, look at other companies with similar deals and see what their valuations are; remember that venture capitalists are looking to make the best bet possible, so you don't want to price yourself so highly that the risk/reward doesn't make sense.Second, set a target number of shares you are willing to sell. Make sure to chart out your dilution over the next few rounds. Determine whether you are willing to give away 15% or 25% of your business at this stage and base your valuation on that figure.

""I didn't see myself reflected in the fragrance industry,"" says Brianna Arps, founder and CEO of MOODEAUX, on why she decided to start building her business back in 2017. ""I remember watching these commercials with a half naked man running across beaches and other advertising gimmicks that didn't always make sense.""Arps started her career as an investigative journalist covering beauty, fashion and lifestyle beats. In 2018, she found out she was let go when she opened her company laptop to discover her email access had been revoked. ""The pressure to make a name for myself in this industry had consumed me for years,"" says Arps. ""I didn't realize that my self-worth became tightly entangled with my career until it was too late.""She recalls the panicked train ride back to her apartment on the day of her layoff. The panic evolved into depression, which worsened the longer she spent unemployed. She credits her self-care rituals — finding comfort and healing with fragrance — which helped her through this difficult time and also became the moment MOODEAUX was born.



""The layoff redirected me to what I was meant to do next, and that was to build MOODEAUX,"" Arps says. ""And of course I had doubts along the way. What qualifies me to build and run a business? I had to quiet that inner critic and say, 'I am going to qualify myself to do this and build this.'""For Arps, buying and wearing fragrances has always been an affirming act that brings joy, excitement and comfort with each spritz. MOODEAUX leans into educating consumers and creating scents to help ""flaunt how you feel."" As a child, Arps recalls trying all the fragrances her mother and grandmother had on their dressers. ""I've been into fragrance since forever thanks to the most important and best-smelling women I know: my mom, Cynthia, and my late grandma, Minnie. They took tremendous pride in creating routines centered around their entire well-being.""


As she continues to grow and scale her company, here's the advice Arps has to share with other aspiring entrepreneurs.Related: She Maxed Out Her Credit Cards and Sold Her Engagement Ring to Start a Business. Now She Has $25 Million in Funding — and Smart Advice for Fellow Black Women Founders.Image Credit: Risa Dexter1. Understand that small mistakes can lead to big setbacks in the future""MOODEAUX wasn't always our company name. It used to be 'Moode Beaute,' until my previous trademark attorney shared some bad news,"" says Arps. ""When we went to file for registration in late 2019, she discovered another entity with similar spelling had beaten us to the punch by a mere few days. I cried like a baby — primarily because, by that point, I spent thousands of dollars on branding we could never use.""


Arps continued to spend more time brainstorming and working with her trademark attorney, before finally settling on the name MOODEAUX. It was an important reminder for her to not neglect the legal matters of your business. She reminds founders to make sure you can claim trademark rights by filing for them in a timely manner, and hiring a trademark attorney with expertise you may not have. ""Small mistakes or oversights, like not trademarking your name early on, can lead to big setbacks and challenges in the future if you're not careful.""2. Get comfortable receiving lots of no's, the yes will come""Be prepared to get more no's than the yes you are waiting for,"" Arps says. ""Out of hundreds of conversations, meetings and applications on the road to get more funding for MOODEAUX, I received about 10 yeses."" Arps encourages founders to build up their internal fortitude, lean on patience and persistence, and prepare for the potentially long road ahead. She also acknowledges that most women of color have to work harder than their peers to get that yes. And each no helped her to reflect and redirect her energies to reaching out to individuals who would believe in her, celebrate her and support her vision for MOODEAUX.""I would meet with venture capital funds who would say no for now, and say, 'Come back to us when you launch in this retailer, then we will invest,'"" Arps says. ""Then we would launch in that retailer, then they would say, 'Okay, come back again when you hit your sales target.' The goalpost they set kept changing, moving again and again. It was like I would never be good enough for them, and I had to work hard not to internalize that.""Related: This Black Founder Was Gaslit By Her Doctor During Pregnancy. The Experience Drove Her to Create a Community for Expectant Moms.


3. Expand your thinking when it comes to fundingArps reminds founders that there are so many different ways to fund and scale your business. While traditional venture capital funds were impressed with the trajectory of MOODEAUX, some weren't convinced. ""I was tired of feeling like I was on that hamster wheel, and needed to think about different ways to fund the business,"" Arps says. ""I didn't need that splashy press release to say we were working with some big fund, I needed cash to scale. I needed money in the bank.""Arps focused on raising money in an unconventional way: through accelerators and competitions where grants are given out. ""Accelerators are a great way to also learn and help you level up your business,"" Arps says. ""You not only get a cash infusion but you are also learning. When you are finished, you are undeniable."" She also encourages founders to consider a small bank loan and to not be ashamed or afraid to ask friends and family to invest in your business.""I don't feel inclined to chase that fancy headline and that spotlight,"" says Arps. ""I'm always going to go where I am celebrated, where people embrace Black ambition and understand the trajectory of MOODEAUX, plus our ability to bring forth positive change within the fragrance industry.""

      Key Takeaways    



        As someone who's pitched investors — and been declined — and now a venture capitalist, I have a unique understanding of investors' minds. 
      


        Here are seven common reasons VCs say no to startups and how you can prevent it from happening to you.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""No.""This one little word can be the most excruciating thing to hear for entrepreneurs desperately seeking funding for their dream venture. Unfortunately, most entrepreneurs will hear ""no"" often. According to a study published in Harvard Business Review, only 1% of meetings with potential investors turn into a partnership.While it was challenging to hear investors decline my pitches as an entrepreneur, I find it just as difficult to turn down budding startups now that I'm on the other end of the spectrum. Luckily, my years of experience in both capacities have helped me better understand the minds of investors. That's why I want to share seven reasons investors might reject your business pitch.



Related: Venture Capital 101: A Comprehensive Guide for Startups Seeking Investment1. Your numbers don't line upPart of meeting with potential investors is sharing the raw numbers of your business. For some, this isn't a problem, while others feel some trepidation and may even consider making things sound better than they are. It may have been an honest mistake. Either way, venture capitalists are savvy and will always spot incongruencies, especially when they do their due diligence — which they will.


If they find the numbers you presented aren't accurate, they'll call you on it. Integrity and competency are vital for solid business partnerships, and a failure in either area could put your reputation at stake.2. Poor consumer perceptionThis may seem obvious, but if your target audience isn't buying what you're selling, neither will investors. Even if your sales numbers are considerable, if your customers aren't happy with your product or service or there's a consistent theme of discontent, that's a clear signal to step away from the table.Venture capitalists need to know that you're doing everything possible to ensure customers are satisfied and cared for. Not only are happy consumers more likely to remain loyal to your company if they're happy, there's a higher likelihood they'll share your product or service with others.3. Your company lacks diversityCulture matters. It's what drives good organizations to become better ones. A crucial part of developing a solid culture is embracing and hiring people from different backgrounds with various perspectives. This is how innovation thrives.


A lack of diversity in your company now may tell investors that building a diverse culture will become a problem as the organization grows later. One caveat: Don't make it about meeting some ""quota."" It should come from a genuine desire to expand your horizons and create positive change for your company and industry.Related: Serial Entrepreneur Turned VC Reveals 4 Numbers You Need to Know to Scale Your Company4. You seem difficult to work withEven if they believe in your business, most venture capitalists won't just hand you a check and pat you on the back. No, it's more about forming a lasting partnership to ensure the company's long-term success.That means that while it's the company you built, you're still open to new ideas or suggestions for improving it. Investors know what works and what doesn't and want to pass that on — but only to someone willing to listen. If you come off as an entrepreneur who must have everything done your way, you'll be hard-pressed to find willing suitors.


5. Your business won't stand outYou can have a solid business model with a quality product or service, but your company will blend in with the rest if nothing differentiates you from what's out there already. In a market likely saturated with similar ideas, investors want to see something that will make your idea stand out. How is what you offer innovative from what currently exists? If it's not, they won't be interested.Successful entrepreneurs know their market and customer base inside and out. They have done extensive research on what others are doing so that they can deliver something special.6. You're underpreparedSimply getting a meeting with venture capitalists is a feat in itself. With hundreds of proposals and pitches coming at them, their time is a finite resource. There are no second chances.If a question from an investor catches you off guard or you don't have a satisfactory answer at the ready, you're not likely to gain their confidence and support. I know you're likely putting in 20-hour days just to keep your dream alive, but you can't afford to be off when you have a shot like this.


It's a lot of pressure to be under, but it's also an excellent chance to show investors you can handle it. Despite everything you're going through, coming prepared for every possible scenario or challenge speaks volumes to your ability to lead a successful business.Related: Embrace Change or Miss Out On Money — 5 Trends to Know in Venture Capital This Year7. It's just not a good fitRejection isn't always something wrong with your business. Sometimes, investors say no because your company doesn't fit well with their investment portfolio. Every venture capitalist has a specific investment strategy that they adhere to. It's how they became successful in the first place. They'll occasionally take a chance on a business idea outside their realm, but that's only if they feel confident it's a can't-miss opportunity.For some, it might be less about the industry or market and more about your company's growth stage. Regardless, do your homework on the investors and firms you're meeting with. What's their typical profile? What markets do they usually go for? Do they tend to invest more in Series A funding or other rounds? Like any other interview, you need to know who you're talking to and have your questions ready.


These are just a few examples of why you might not get the support you're hoping for from investors. It can come down to countless factors, some within your control and others not. The best advice I can give you is to use every rejection — every ""no"" — as fuel to improve your business, your product, and yourself until you find that one ""yes"" you're looking for.

6,"How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did It","Mar 8, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/advice-to-turn-your-side-hustle-into-a-7-figure-business/470819,"
More than half of Gen Zers and millennials have a side hustle, and 80% of them say they need the extra cash due to the state of the economy, according to a recent survey from LendingTree. From driving for rideshare services to teaching courses online, operating cotton candy vending machines, turning your backyard into a dog park, and so much more, there's something for everyone hoping to diversify their income streams — and anyone who might want to launch into full-time entrepreneurship, too.Sometimes, successful side hustlers grow their earnings to the point where they outpace the salaries from their full-time jobs, and it only makes sense to go all in on their new venture. But even people whose side gigs see less initial return might have an entrepreneurial spirit and clear vision that motivates them to commit in full, and with the right strategy and mindset, those businesses can also become highly profitable, hitting six- or even seven-figure months.Below are three women who did just that: Katherine Watercutter, founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge; Julie Berninger, co-founder of e-printables curriculum Gold City Ventures; and Danielle Cohen-Shohet, founder and CEO of booking and payments platform GlossGenius. Their journeys and areas of expertise are different, but they all know what it takes to go from a side hustle — maybe lucrative, maybe not — to a thriving multimillion-dollar business.

Katherine Watercutter: Gold HingeKatherine Watercutter is the founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge. When Watercutter was 23 and worked as a sales representative for a distribution company working with kitchen and bath designers around Indiana, she started the business as a side hustle. Lack of funding proved a major hurdle in the beginning, but today, Gold Hinge counts celebrities including Kristin Cavallari and Kaitlyn Bristowe among its fans. The brand also went viral during TikTok's ""RushTok"" trend, garnering 40 million hashtag impressions and sales in the multi-millions.Watercutter's advice: ""My advice may sound as cheesy as it gets, but don't give up. People in this day and age are impatient and sometimes quick to give up when they feel like they keep failing. There were a few times when I thought I hit 'rock bottom' and exhausted all options, but I found a way around it. I felt like I was failing consistently for three years, and I know many would have given up by then, but business is all about problem-solving.""Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.Julie Berninger: Gold City VenturesJulie Berninger is an Etsy shop owner and co-founder of Gold City Ventures with Cody Berman. Berninger worked as a project manager for large tech companies and planned to be in the industry long term, but the ""financial independence, retire early"" (FIRE) movement inspired her to start a side hustle. She opened an Etsy shop focused on the bachelorette party niche, then co-founded the online course business that teaches other entrepreneurs how to find success on the platform. She quit her 9-5 in 2021 when the income from her ventures replaced her salary.


Berninger's advice: ""Don't start a business by yourself! Pick a business partner and scale faster! Also, don't waste time trying to piece information together on YouTube. Pay for a step-by-step program or a business consultant because your time is valuable.""Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a MonthDanielle Cohen-Shohet: GlossGeniusDanielle Cohen-Shohet is the CEO and founder of GlossGenius, an all-in-one booking, payments and point-of-sale solution that helps beauty and wellness professionals drive bookings and grow their business. In college, Cohen-Shohet did freelance makeup out of her dorm room, and she and her twin sister also collaborated on a digital receipts payments venture. Ultimately, she'd pull from those experiences to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses — and build a software company worth over $510 million in the process.Cohen-Shohet's advice: ""Be fearless. Don't take no for an answer. And, importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.""

7,How to Identify and Address Dysfunctional Venture Capital Relationships in the Startup Ecosystem,"Mar 6, 2024","Jena Booher, Ph.D.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-navigate-dysfunctional-founder-investor-relationships/469424,"
The venture capital (VC) world has long been characterized by its tight-knit and somewhat private community. Founders typically maintain a low profile regarding what transpires behind closed doors, largely due to their significant financial reliance on the investor community.Understanding the dynamics within this community can be challenging without direct exposure or day-to-day interactions with investors or founders. Over the past two years, my increased involvement in the VC community has brought to light both commendable individuals and concerning trends that have direct implications for founders.In the realm of venture capital, there are VCs who genuinely support founders, but there are also those who exhibit behaviors that can hinder entrepreneurial success. Despite a shared desire among all stakeholders for optimal business performance, founders and VCs occasionally grapple with misaligned incentives. While investors may have the intellectual intention to support their founders, there exists a challenge in fostering an environment where founders feel comfortable being open about what is or isn't working in the founder-investor relationship.



Drawing from my expertise as a business psychologist, I have observed the financial repercussions of founders becoming sidetracked by managing investor relationships at the expense of their businesses. My aim is to shed light on these observed issues and encourage VCs to reflect on their actions. Projecting emotional or mental health issues onto invested founders not only risks financial returns but also exacerbates challenges for entrepreneurs already facing significant obstacles.Related: 5 Tips for Navigating the Entrepreneur/Investor Relationship


Three prevalent dysfunctional VC archetypes emerge1. The Bully:The Bully archetype within the VC landscape often presents as an investor with an initially charismatic and supportive demeanor. However, this façade quickly transforms after the ink has dried on the contract. These VCs may lack substantial operating experience as CEOs, leading them to impose their subjective views on what it takes to be a successful CEO. Criticism often targets the founder's decisions and sometimes questions their character, suggesting they are ill-suited for the role or negligent in their fiduciary duties.The Bully employs vague strategic advice intentionally, creating ambiguity to make failure more likely. This lack of clarity allows the Bully to seize opportunities to point out the founder's supposed incompetence, negatively impacting the founder's self-esteem and decision-making. The unpredictable nature of interactions with such VCs further contributes to an unhealthy founder-investor dynamic.Bully archetype snapshot:Qualities: Lack of operational experience; emotional volatility; creates ""gotcha"" scenariosImpact: Harmful for founder self-esteem; insecure attachment; relationship between founder and investor leads to lack of trust2. The Daddy:The Daddy archetype is characterized by a patronizing attitude and a hero complex. These investors leverage their initial belief in the founder as a tool for manipulation, reminding the founder of their unwavering support. This dynamic can lead to breaches of professional boundaries, with the investor overstepping by providing unsolicited advice. The fragile ego of the Daddy investor is highlighted, revealing a need for constant validation from founders to maintain their perceived relevance and importance. This emotional reliance distracts founders from their primary responsibilities, creating an imbalanced power dynamic detrimental to business success.


Daddy archetype snapshot:Qualities: insecure; manipulative; breach of professional boundariesImpact: imbalanced power, as the founder may find it challenging to assert independence or make decisions without the constant approval of the Daddy investor.3. The Neurotic:


The Neurotic archetype enters the VC community, often through familial or friend connections, with a potential lack of resilience for the roller-coaster ride of startup life. While these VCs may possess impressive intelligence and academic credentials, they struggle to endure the inevitable ups and downs of the startup ecosystem. Their inability to weather challenges prompts excessive involvement in their portfolio companies, seeking regular updates on performance. This behavior is driven by a lack of thick skin for the job, leading them to emotionally lean on founders during tough times.While their intentions may be well-founded, the Neurotic archetype needs to cultivate greater resilience. Instead of emotionally dumping on their founders, seeking external support for managing anxiety over their portfolio's performance is crucial for maintaining a healthy investor-founder relationship.Neurotic archetype snapshot:Qualities: excessive involvement; need for constant reassurance; lacking resilienceImpact: poor emotional boundaries; looking for the founder to relieve their distress, which leads to founders becoming distracted from core business problemsRelated: The Relationship Between Founders and Investors Transcends Beyond CapitalCharting a course forwardThe venture capital industry operates under immense pressure, leading to stress, anxiety and a fear of failure. Nonetheless, founders can't bear the brunt of VC stress, and if you identify with one of these archetypes, it's essential to address the core issues.If you find yourself exhibiting Bully or Daddy behaviors and feel the need to assert power over others, it's likely that someone wielded power over you in your past. That is a wound that has gone unaddressed and unhealed. Without judgment, find a way to explore that core wound with a trusted therapist to diminish emotional projections.


If you're displaying behaviors exhibited by the Neurotic archetype, you should be aware of your challenges, surround yourself with supportive individuals who can model emotional regulation, and utilize tools for anxiety management like mindfulness, therapy and nervous system regulation.If you're a founder facing a contentious relationship with investors, especially if it verges on an abusive situation, my advice to you is to stop blaming yourself for not ""figuring this out"" sooner. In my experience, founders blame themselves first and then internalize the stress and shame. Also, look to establish boundaries, keep business discussions within scheduled meetings, and consider bringing others to meetings for support. People can show up better when there are more folks in the room.Investors and founders alike should schedule periodic sessions to openly discuss the dynamics of their relationship. Just like any interpersonal connection, it's crucial to approach these conversations with care, ensuring they are structured to focus on the health and effectiveness of the overall partnership.Navigating the founder-investor relationship is tough, but it's crucial to remember shared interests. Choose differently to avoid making the startup journey harder than necessary. In the startup world, where the odds are always against you, how you choose to turn those odds around matters.

8,Big Businesses Take Forever to Pay Their Small Suppliers. These Founders Did Something About It: 'Nobody Had Seen Anything Like This',"Mar 6, 2024",Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/these-founders-help-small-suppliers-get-paid-quicker-from/470341,"
It should have been a celebratory lunch — the kind where you order french fries and cheesecake, then go home to nap and don't even feel bad about it.Instead, Stacey Abrams and Lara Hodgson were sitting in an Atlanta restaurant, dazed with disappointment, talking in circles, returning again and again to the same confounding question: How did we not know this?It was 2010, and three years earlier, the women had cofounded a company called Nourish, which made grab-and-go baby bottles filled with premeasured, purified water for easy formula mixing. The company had been finding its legs, one wobbly step at a time. Then, Whole Foods placed a huge order of their product.



""It was, like, orders of magnitude bigger than anything we'd done before,"" Hodgson says. They were ecstatic. This is what they should've been celebrating. But then they read the payment terms. ""We discovered that we weren't going to get paid for three to four months. I mean, no small business can handle that.""The women had run headlong into an unspoken rule: the bigger the buyer, the longer they take to pay. And it didn't even matter what the official payment schedule was. ""If your invoice says net 30 or net 60 or net 90 — that's just a suggestion,"" Hodgson says. ""We know now that the average net 30 invoice pays in 54 days. But back then, when we realized all this, I just remember thinking, like, Was I sick one day in business school? Why does no one talk about this?""Related: 10 Small Business Marketing Strategies That Actually WorkThey had more questions, too. Why was this the status quo? Why did no one seem to think it was a big deal? And why — in a country that calls small businesses the backbone of the economy — had no one bothered to create a better solution?Suddenly, they couldn't stop talking about it. They talked with each other, and then with other small business owners, and then with academics and investors. And eventually, they decided to do something about it.Later that year, the duo cofounded NowAccount, a novel business-to-business financing solution that lets small business owners get paid for invoices right away, with low, flat-rate fees, while building up their credit and outsourcing the time-consuming task of tracking down payments. Since its inception in 2010, Now has fast-tracked almost $1 billion in payments for nearly 1,000 businesses, and in the past two years, more than doubled in growth.But getting to this point took a long time: years of asking, and listening, and explaining, and insisting that something could and should be done.""We had to convince people we could solve the problem,"" Abrams says, ""because it sounded like magic.""


Hodgson and Abrams met at a leadership program in Atlanta — but they might not have connected so fast if Abrams hadn't fessed up to her audacious ambition.It was 2004, and they were both enrolled in a tough session: The facilitator had researched attendees ahead of time, and made it his mission to target their insecurities, in order to prompt deeper conversation about biases. Hodgson is an extrovert who loves to talk — so the facilitator didn't let her do that. ""At the end of the weekend, he told me he needed me to know what it felt like to have no voice,"" she says. ""I did not like that.""Abrams is an introvert, so the facilitator treated her the opposite way — constantly pressing her to speak. Eventually, he asked Abrams a direct question: ""What is one great ambition you've never wanted to say out loud?"" She paused, then said she wanted to be president of the United States. Across the room, Hodgson remembers thinking, I always said that as a little girl, and girls don't say that out loud! When they broke for lunch, Hodgson made a beeline for Abrams in the buffet line.Related: 9 Tips To Grow Your Small Business With Social Media MarketingThe women were assigned to the same study group. ""We found that while we had different approaches to problems,"" Abrams says, ""we almost always aligned on solutions."" They became friends, and a couple of years later, founded a consulting company together, making use of Hodgson's business connections and Abrams' knowledge of local tax law. Then they founded Nourish. And that brought them to that bleak lunch in 2010, agonizing over how to get the money for their Whole Foods order. They were searching, once again, for an answer.They'd scrambled to find conventional bridge-funding solutions — a bank loan or invoice factoring — but found the first inaccessible, and the second predatory. Bank loans are hard to get for small business owners without solid credit, or for anyone who doesn't feel comfortable with personal guarantees. Recourse-factoring companies, which buy invoices from small companies, charge variable fees, along with additional accruing fees for late payments (which the small businesses can't predict or control), and often use invasive tactics like collecting money from the business's bank account on a daily or weekly basis. Plus, if a payment falls through, the small business is on the hook for the full payment plus late fees, which leaves a liability on its balance sheet for months.The best option Hodgson and Abrams had found — ""a creative factoring agreement from a community bank"" — also came with personal guarantees. This was uncomfortable for both women. Hodgson had a new baby and worried about losing her house because of the loan, and Abrams had a mortgage and a lot of student debt. Plus, she was financially responsible for her parents and niece.To both women, this situation just felt wrong. They knew they couldn't be the first entrepreneurs to find themselves suddenly ""growing out of business.""""When you encounter a massive problem that's been around forever,"" Abrams says, ""you tend to think, I can't possibly be the first one to see it. So you assume what's happening is your fault, or that the problem would have been solved if it could have been. And you usually stop there. But instead of critiquing ourselves, Lara and I decided to ask: OK, but why hasn't it happened?""


Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaWhen Abrams and Hodgson began talking about solutions, the first thing they thought of was simple: What if Whole Foods could pay them with a credit card? In this case, Nourish, the seller, would be charged the flat 3.5% transaction fee, and get paid right away. Then Whole Foods, the buyer, would pay down the balance on their own time with interest.But therein lies the dilemma: Whole Foods doesn't want to pay its suppliers right away — and certainly doesn't want to pay interest. And because it's a giant company, it doesn't have to. That's the way the capitalist cookie crumbles. Bigger companies set payment terms, and the smaller companies accept them — until they prove critical enough to negotiate.But what if Hodgson and Abrams created something for small businesses that was like being paid with a credit card?This is the idea that eventually became NowAccount: Small businesses would apply to be Now's clients, and pay an annual membership fee of $750. When clients received an invoice from a new buyer, Now would assess the buyer's risk, and if they approved, the client could start uploading invoices. Now would vet each invoice, then pay the client the full amount almost immediately, minus a flat fee based on the payment terms (ranging incrementally from 3% for a net 15 invoice, to 8% for a net 120 invoice). And Now would be reimbursed when the payment is made.Related: 5 Things Not to Do When You're Running a Small BusinessThis would shrink the payment schedule from a few months to just a few days. In the case of Nourish and Whole Foods, it would have looked something like this: If Whole Foods placed an order of, say, $50,000 worth of goods from Nourish, with 90-day payment terms, Nourish would take that invoice to NowAccount, who would confirm its validity with Whole Foods, and then pay Nourish $50,000 right away (minus the 7% fee for a net 90 invoice). Then Now would be reimbursed in, say, 117 days, or whenever Whole Foods actually paid.For a small business owner, the advantages of this setup are numerous: No added interest for late payments you can't control, no liability on your balance sheet, no unforgiving credit checks or invasive debt collection strategies, and no personal guarantees. Unlike factoring companies, which hold you responsible if a payment falls through, NowAccount absorbs the risk of every invoice it accepts. In this way, Now acts as a kind of insurance for their clients.Hodgson and Abrams knew their concept was groundbreaking.Unfortunately, at first, the people they needed to join them were not convinced. Part of the problem was that the concept didn't lend itself to pithy, 30-second elevator pitches. ""It's complicated to explain,"" Hodgson says. ""And because nobody had seen anything like this, when they heard 'get paid fast,' their brains immediately went to, 'Is it a loan? Is it a payday loan? Is it factoring?'""From the finance side, there was also some confusion about why this was even a problem. What's stopping any small business owner from going down to their local bank to get a loan at a lower annual interest rate, or negotiating better terms with their factoring company or buyer?


What financial institutions often overlook are the countless variable barriers for small business owners. Many are becoming entrepreneurs for the first time, figuring it out as they go, without a lot of financial education or resources.Patricia Wilson is a NowAccount client who worked in technology for 20 years before deciding to start her own consulting business, Online Media Interactive. When she started out, she says, ""Honestly, going after a bank loan didn't even occur to me. I was still trying to feel out what I wanted to do from a business perspective. And with traditional factoring companies, I was very intimidated by the aggressive nature of how they collect the money. I just wanted a way to have consistent income coming in.""Another Now client, Mike Riordan, is the founder of Freeze Sleeve, a cold/hot compression therapy he developed for his daughter, a pre-Olympic gymnast. Riordan had previously run a struggling construction company that tanked his credit, so he couldn't get a bank loan for Freeze Sleeve. And he was put off by the ""loan-shark mentality"" of factoring companies.""I think there's a kind of business amnesia that occurs in the financial sector,"" Abrams says. ""The people making these decisions forgot what it was like to be a small business owner."" Moreover, Hodgson thinks there's a misconception in the finance world that you can take funding solutions for large companies and ""miniaturize"" them. ""I tell people, 'Small businesses are not miniature large businesses. You can't just, like, shrink a solution,'"" she says. ""Think about it: If I'm a small business selling to, say, Walmart, and they're demanding net 90, that means they might actually pay in 120 days. So I'm essentially Walmart's free bank for 90-plus days. My cost of capital is way higher than Walmart's, so efficient economic theory suggests the best solution for Walmart is to borrow money really cheaply, pay me faster, and get a discount. But anyone who's tried that knows a large company will just take the discount and still pay you late.""Related: This Is the Unseen Advantage Your Small Business Might NeedIn fact, Hodgson tried this kind of dynamic discounting with one large retailer when they were running Nourish. She'd offer, say, a 2% discount on a net 30 invoice if they paid her in 10 days. But in the end, she says, the retailer just took the discount and still paid her late.""What am I going to do, sue them?"" she says. ""My legal bill would be way more than the 2%, so it's not worth it. I could threaten not to sell to them again, and they'd be like, 'OK, move over! There's a line of people who would gladly take your shelf space.' When you have an imbalance in power, efficient economic theory just doesn't work.""Dr. Richard Bliss, a professor of finance at Babson College and the national academic director for Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses, confirms this. ""It's the classic 'because they can,'"" he says. ""There's a huge power dynamic, and big companies just take advantage. I often hear stories from small business owners who are so excited they got this big contract, but they lose sight of the fact that they still have to make this positive from a financial standpoint. A lot of them don't have the rudimentary forecasting tools to plug in their new contract, look four months down the road to say, 'Holy smokes, we're gonna run out of money.' By the time they realize the predicament they're in, there are very few options.""Slowly but surely, investors began to hear Hodgson and Abrams' message. First came credit unions, then equity investors, and finally Goldman Sachs. Taking different types of funding presented some tension, Hodgson says, but she thinks it made the business more sustainable. ""Equity investors usually prioritize growth more than profitability, whereas lenders want you to be focused on profitability. So at times, I was like, Oh my gosh, I can't make everybody happy! But in hindsight, I think it forced a kind of discipline.""The thing about discipline is that it doesn't exactly lend itself to meteoric change. It's an act of faith that, eventually, the baby steps will get you somewhere.


""You know when your shoelaces are tied together, and you can't take a step that's longer than the shoelace or you fall on your face?"" Hodgson asks. ""That's the image that comes to mind about starting and scaling NowAccount. We had to go get capital and then get some customers, then we needed more capital and then more customers. And if I tried to do either of those too big, I'd fall on my face. So we just sort of trudged along, little by little.""NowAccount's investors were pulling on one shoelace, and clients were tugging on the other. Small business owners didn't need convincing that there was a problem. But they did need some convincing that these two nice Southern ladies weren't selling them some fanciful money ""magic,"" as Abrams says, ""or worse!""Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big Brands""The first question we'd get from small business owners is, 'Why would you give us this money?'"" Abrams says. ""They were trying to understand: 'If this other financial institution wants to charge me 30% on my entire inventory, or this one wants my DNA swab, or to mortgage my house, why would I trust you?' Entrepreneurs are trained to believe no one is coming to help them, so we were trying to convince people we could untie their shoelaces when they'd gotten used to walking that way"" — restrained, cautious, and slower than they should have to.But once NowAccount started delivering on its promises, they started getting more applications than they could accept. This was partly because they needed more funding, and partly because they needed to mitigate risk. ""We wanted to serve more businesses, because that's why we existed,"" Hodgson says. ""But if we went too far, someone's going to take the dollar and run. So in the early days, it was a lot of learning, like, what are the signs? And analyzing data to tell us if certain industries or company profiles are more prone to risk.""Now learned to spot certain ""behavioral indicators."" For example, if someone has a Gmail account instead of a business email, it's worth a closer look. Maybe it's a fly-by-night operation, or maybe it's a new business that just hasn't set up its website yet. But with each invoice Now processed, its system became more informed. ""Every data point we have about a customer and who their buyer is, and when they pay, that just makes the system incrementally smarter,"" Hodgson says. ""So mistakes happen less and less as we grow.""And this practice of mitigating risk isn't just for Now's benefit. It's also become a crucial service for clients.Riordan, the founder of Freeze Sleeve, says the buyer-vetting that NowAccount does is invaluable. In addition to being able to sell to big companies that are ""horribly slow"" at paying, Riordan says, ""We also use NowAccount almost like our credit check people. Every time somebody wants to come on board, I send them over to Now, and they do their due diligence on the company. One time we had a cryotherapy business that wanted to go national with our products, and they gave us a very substantial order. But Now wouldn't approve them. We were frustrated because it was a big order, so we ended up doing it on our own. Well, guess what? That company went out of business and left us with a big hole.""Meeting with team members Archie Jones and John Hayes in 2015, in an antiques shop next to their office.Image Credit: Courtesy of Stacey AbramsNow was always intended to serve small businesses. But a few years in, something surprising happened. ""We got a call from Coca-Cola's chief procurement officer,"" Hodgson says, ""who was like, 'This seems to be a huge benefit to suppliers. Maybe we could partner to make sure more of them know about it.'""


Coca-Cola had been trying to diversify its supply chain to include more women and people of color, but its payment terms made it impossible for many of these businesses to work with them. ""They're going to take 90 days to pay, and if that's going to kill you, they can't give you the contract,"" Hodgson says.But with Now, Coca-Cola saw an opportunity: If there was a small business they wanted to buy from, but the supplier couldn't afford their payment terms, they'd send them to NowAccount. That way, the small business didn't have to worry about how long it would take to get paid, and Coca-Cola would know they had the capital to deliver. It was a win-win for everyone.Not long after, the city of Atlanta began a push to boost the local economy by connecting Atlanta-based corporations with local small business suppliers. Now was perfectly positioned to partner with the city to make these connections.Then, in 2020, the George Floyd protests happened, and corporations across the country started making public pledges to spend more with minority-owned businesses. At that point, Now realized it was sitting on a goldmine of data.Sure, there are plenty of business databases out there — but only Now has years' worth of invoice data, giving them visibility into which suppliers can deliver at what level.Related: 7 Strategies to Scale Your Small Business and Achieve Sustainable Growth""If you're a procurement person, and you've bought a database of businesses, and you're looking for one with a Latina founder, there are probably hundreds of them,"" Hodgson says. ""How do you pick? And most importantly, how do you know which of those hundreds can do a million-dollar contract versus a $5,000 contract? Because that matters. If I give you a contract that's too big and you don't have the staff to deliver, neither of us win.""What if they created a curated platform that helped big businesses find diverse suppliers capable of meeting their needs? It would be free for the small businesses to join, while the big businesses paid a membership fee. And that's how the next Now product — NowNetwork — was born.When Hodgson and Abrams talk about Now, people often ask: Why is it like this? Why don't these big businesses just pay their suppliers faster?Hodgson likes to tell a story about a conversation she once had with a Fortune 500 CFO. They were talking about NowAccount, and the CFO said, ""You know, this is fascinating, but I could probably just pay my suppliers immediately for cheaper than you can.""


""Well for sure you could,"" Hodgson replied. ""You're a Fortune 500 company and we're a startup. But you won't.""The CFO paused for a moment. ""You're right,"" she said. ""I won't because if I turn around and paid all my suppliers immediately, Wall Street would take me down.""What Hodgson and the CFO were acknowledging is how common it is for corporations to beef up their capital stacks by leaning on ""accounts payable"" — the money owed to suppliers but not yet paid.""Take any public company and look at their financials,"" Hodgson says, ""If you look at their short-term debt, like what they're borrowing from the bank, compared to their accounts payable — what they owe suppliers — their accounts payable are almost always two to three times what they owe the bank. Because there's a smart CFO who knows he can delay payments for free versus borrowing money at some cost greater than zero. If you yanked that away, they'd have to turn to more expensive capital, their net earnings would drop, and Wall Street would kill them.""This notion — that it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments — is provocative. But each year, the consultancy firm The Hackett Group does an annual analysis of something called Days Payable Outstanding, or DPO. It's an accounting measure that calculates the number of days it takes for a company to pay suppliers. And it sheds light on the pattern.Of the top 1,000 publicly traded U.S. companies, for the decade running up to 2021 (when payment terms started to shorten due to pandemic supply chain pressures), ""DPO was consistently increasing — around 5% year after year — which is significant,"" says Shawn Townsend, a director in Hackett's finance transformation practice. ""On a compounding level, that adds up to a 32% increase [in how long suppliers are waiting to get paid]. And you would assume the same trends are happening to an even greater extent to smaller companies, because it's about leverage.""Townsend says DPO can't distinguish between long payment terms and late payments. But when asked if it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments, he says, diplomatically, ""It does happen. We hear some companies saying, 'This month, we told the accounts payable people, pay a certain group of suppliers, don't pay the others.' The most critical suppliers are always the first to get paid. And then the other ones, you know, they just stop the payments until the following month. It's very anecdotal, obviously, because nobody's going to admit that.""But Now's data is not anecdotal. They have unprecedented visibility into exactly when the biggest companies in the U.S. say they'll pay, and when they actually do.Related: 5 SEO Tips to Grow Your Small Business""We know what the normal behavior is for certain companies and certain industries,"" Hodgson says. ""I was talking to someone at a major bank and they said, 'Well, we typically pay in X days.' And I said, 'No you don't.' They said, 'Well, that's our policy.' And I said, 'But that's not what you do! I know because I've been watching you pay invoices for over a year.'""


More recently, the Now team has been asking what they can do with all this information. ""Could we partner with someone like Hackett, or start doing our own reports?"" Hodgson wonders. ""This data could be incredibly interesting to investors, because if you're investing in a company, and they are continuously paying very late, there may be a weakness in its business model. Or if you're a small business who wants to sell to the airline industry, and they're saying they pay in 45 days but they really mean 60, that could be the difference between making a payroll and not. It won't change reality, but you can plan for reality. And that's what got Stacey and I into all of this trouble in the first place.""Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaA lot has happened since that fateful lunch in 2010. Abrams kept working at NowAccount during her tenure in the Georgia House of Representatives, but left the company in 2016 to pursue those two runs for governor. (Or as she says, ""I had this other job I was interested in applying for, but my application was rejected."") After that, she and Hodgson decided that NowAccount and NowNetwork should be separate companies, which act as partners with service agreements. Hodgson will run NowAccount, and Abrams will run NowNetwork.Unlike Hodgson, who's had a long career in business, Abrams admits she never really wanted to be an entrepreneur. ""I liked paychecks,"" she says. ""It was a frightening idea to be solely reliant on my own efforts.""The thing that changed her mind, though, was meeting Hodgson.""We often believe we have to be the leaders,"" she says, ""but having a partner challenges you. It helps you grow, sharpens your mind, gives you a different perspective. Lara and I have always been curious about what the other person knows.""Curiosity, more than anything, is what brought the friends to this place. And it's what will guide them toward whatever's next. ""Curiosity is about more than simply seeking information,"" says Abrams. ""We want to know: Are we asking the right things?""Related: 7 Networking Groups Every Small Business Owner Should Be Involved In

9,Embrace Change or Miss Out On Money — 5 Trends to Know in Venture Capital This Year,"Mar 5, 2024",Alexander Galitsky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/5-trends-to-look-out-for-in-venture-capital-this-year/470158,"
There are a lot of words to describe 2023, but ""predictable"" isn't one of them. Factors that range from broader public funding to the surge in AI capabilities have caused tectonic shifts in the venture capital landscape. It's time to explore this new world and draw a map of new challenges and opportunities. These are the trends that will be the most influential in 2024.Related: You Need to Do These 5 Steps If You Want to Survive the Difficult Funding Market1. Quality will trump quantityStart-ups have more funding choices than ever. Venture capitalists must compete with cryptocurrency and crowdfunding when looking for start-up partners. According to recent surveys, only about one in 20 new firms depended on venture capital for their start.



VCs can only bet on a few companies, hoping one will succeed. Instead, VCs must be choosier, limiting themselves to the most innovative companies. There will be greater competition, especially at the pre-seed stage. Some firms that, at an earlier age, might have gone the VC route will go directly to the audience they want to serve.Venture capital investors must show firms why they are the right choice for a partnership. Show a history of good guidance and trust to help them choose you.


You, of course, need to be just as selective with your offers. Since there is more competition, there will likely be fewer opportunities to go around. You need to be sure you are picking the winners. Luckily, the other four trends on the list will help savvy VCs come out on top.2. Public web dataFinding quality companies that need a flush of outside funding can be challenging. The wealth of data now available can help VCs winnow through the stacks. Public web data can be used to build models to predict a product or company's potential. It can track a firm's rising or falling popularity.Data, including social media posts, job postings, satellite imagery, and more, can all contribute to a landscape picture. VCs no longer need to make their best guesses based on traditional assets like press releases and financial statements.Understanding how to gather and translate this data into a narrative and predictions for the future is vital.


3. Automation and new tech adoptionAutomation technology makes new firms more efficient than ever. And consumers are always happy to find solutions that make their lives easier.The result is a boom in service areas like fintech and office technology. Consider the changes during the pandemic shutdowns: people were limited to online baking and remote work or learning. Solutions that people were wary of before are now familiar. This can mean new opportunities that build on those technologies.Related: From Mundane to Magic: The Incredible Benefits of Automation for Small Business Owners4. Think zebras, not unicornsWho wouldn't love to find a unicorn? Everyone is looking for those companies that, with some innovation, can become a billion-dollar business. But that's the problem: everyone's hunting for unicorns. The competition is so steep it can contribute to unicorns being overvalued.


Instead, look for zebras. These companies are worth under a billion, but they show the potential for sustainable income for years. This sustainable nature means you can diversify your strategies and create more income.5. Greater diversificationKeeping profitable will mean looking into new areas globally and in a broader range of companies.The digital world means we are not limited geographically the way we once were. Communication with partners in every corner of the planet is now possible. Instead of being stuck in Silicon Valley, you can work with firms anywhere from São Paulo to Nairobi.Explore different niches. Learn all you can about new industries. By expanding your range of knowledge, you'll increase your ability to identify potential winners. Bonus if you are looking at new firms that have yet to attract the attention of other VCs.


Look at different firm sizes. There is room for unicorns when you find them, but also for zebras. A mix means more opportunities to see the ones that will be a big success.The venture capital sphere has seen significant changes in recent years. There is no reason to expect that 2025 will have any fewer surprises. The landscape is changing, and the successful investors will be the ones who embrace the change and move with it. Putting everything we've learned into play allows us to open our eyes to new possibilities and find new opportunities for success.

10,6 Alternatives to Venture Capital You Need to Consider,"Feb 29, 2024",Liam Gill,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/understanding-the-6-different-types-of-startup-funding/469760,"
The relationship between venture capitalists and startups is well-known throughout society. In fact, it is the source of much debate, controversy and comedy, from the battle between politicians and venture capitalists when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed to the satirical representation of the relationship on the hit TV show Silicon Valley.Many first-time startup founders and people outside the startup ecosystem don't recognize that venture capitalists aren't the primary source of funding at the early stages of a startup. Today, we will explore the alternative funding sources that most early-stage startups turn to and discuss the pros, cons and risks of seeking capital from each source.Related: You Can't Get VC Funding for Your Startup. Now, What?



1. Accelerators and incubatorsAccelerators and incubators are organizations that provide a mix of resources and cash in exchange for equity in a startup.Pro: For first-time founders, mentorship and advice from accelerators and incubators can help avoid many common pitfalls. These organizations work with dozens to thousands of startups per year, so they are experts at helping early-stage companies. Another significant benefit for all founders is the network effects of an accelerator or incubator. YCombinator is the most famous accelerator; its network allows participants access to many of Silicon Valley's most influential companies, people and investors.


Con: Accelerators and Incubators often provide lower valuations for a startup than other investors. This means you receive less money and give away more equity than if you pursue other investors.Risk: The most significant risk with an accelerator is failing to properly value the non-monetary benefits of mentorship, advice and networking. If you undervalue these benefits, you might turn away an accelerator that could have propelled your growth. If you overvalue them, then you'll accept a deal that undervalued your company.Related: How To Choose the Right Funding Model for Your Startup2. Angel investorsAngel investors are individuals who provide capital to startups.Pro: Many angel investors have expertise in some area, whether design, product development, law, accounting, etc. This means they can provide crucial advice and insights that you might otherwise have needed to pay significant amounts for in addition to capital.


Con: Angel investors often write small checks; if you raise a significant amount of money and angel investors fill the round, you may end up with dozens of individual investors in your company. Each investor will require your attention as you grow the company, potentially distracting you from your day-to-day obligations.Risk: There are two primary risks with angel investors. First is an angel investor who promises to provide expertise but fails to do so. Second is an angel investor who is too hands-on and consistently interferes with your management team.3. SyndicatesSyndicates are groups of angel investors who invest together in a group.Pro: Syndicates can provide significant network effects. The investors in these groups are generally successful in their fields and can provide unique and specialized insights.Con: Syndicates can be slow to invest. Once a syndicate lead decides they want to invest in you, they need to present the deal to their syndicate, determine how much they want to invest, create a special purpose vehicle, collect the funds, and then invest. This depends on the syndicate, but I've seen these deals take so long that founders give up after 6-9 months and look for alternative funding.


Risk: Syndicate leads tend to be people with high social capital. This gives them a level of authority and power within your company that can become counterproductive if your vision doesn't align with theirs.4. Family and friendsPeople with whom you have a personal connection.Pro: They will invest in you and not your idea. That means you can get capital before you've proven that the business works.Con: They are investing in you. You have a personal relationship with these investors. You are putting your own personal relationships at risk based on the performance of the business.


Risk: Many family and friend's investments are not properly documented. This can create issues around ownership when you go to raise further rounds.5. CrowdfundingRaising from the general public online.Pro: You can raise directly from your customers. Crowdfunding works best when your future customers are willing to invest in your company to help you build the solution to their problem.Con: Before you can raise a crowdfunding round, you'll need to go through the process of being accepted by a crowdfunding platform and registering your raise with the SEC. These legal and financial filings can be expensive, and most platforms charge a fee of around 7% of the total funds raised.Risk: The most obvious risk is failing to hit your target. In this circumstance, not only will you lose the money invested to begin the crowdfunding process, but you'll also have an online record of the company's past failure, potentially impacting your future ability to grow or raise funds for the company.


6. VC ScoutsVC Scouts are individuals given funds by venture capitalists to invest in early-stage companies.Pro: You will receive investment from someone well-connected to funds that could provide funding in future rounds.Con: The person providing you funding is not investing their own money. This means their thesis and risk/reward proposition will likely differ from most other investors. They are potentially misleading you as to the viability of your idea.Risk: If you don't receive follow-on funding from the VC associated with the VC Scout, this will be a major red flag for all other investors and make raising any future funds very difficult.

11,"Want to Start a Billion-Dollar Business? Look to These Two Industries, Which Have the Most Unicorn Growth","Feb 22, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/want-to-start-a-billion-dollar-business-look-to-these-two/470089,"
Cybersecurity and artificial intelligence stood out last year as the best-performing industries for unicorns or billion-dollar startups.The Morningstar PitchBook Global Unicorn Vertical Indexes estimated that the value of cybersecurity unicorns grew by 24.3% in 2023, while AI unicorns rose by 22.9%.The growth in cybersecurity could be due to notable startups hitting startlingly high valuations, such as Wiz reaching $10 billion in valuation in February. The indexes determine valuation growth or decline by using a model based on comparable public companies and prices for private startups.



On the AI front, the rise of generative AI saw a corresponding interest in funding. OpenAI raised $10 billion from Microsoft, for example, and Anthropic received $4 billion from Amazon. Of all the new unicorns that came onto the scene last year, 44% focused on AI and machine learning.RELATED: He Started a Side Hustle in His Parents' Basement and Won Big on Richard Branson's TV Show.

Partake


""When you look at the statistics when it comes to Black women founders, yes, I am an anomaly,"" says Denise Woodard, CEO and founder of Partake Foods. ""If Marcy Venture Partners hadn't invested in us, we wouldn't be where we are today.""Companies led by Black women typically receive less than 1% of all venture capital funding, according to Crunchbase. During the Diversity Tipping Point in May 2020, the period when corporate America acknowledged that Black Lives Matter, there was a significant investment in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. It also correlated with an uptick in VC funding for Black-founded and led start-ups. Then the ensuing DEI backlash happened, so the investments didn't last long. According to Crunchbase, financing for Black founders dropped 45% in 2022.Since founding her business in 2016, Woodard has raised more than $25 million in capital. In the past two years, Partake Foods, a consumer products goods brand offering delicious and better-for-you snacks free of the top nine allergens, has achieved 69% revenue growth. The company has increased distribution from 6,000 doors to 14,000 doors. She has built an incredible business, receiving industry accolades, a loyal consumer following, high-profile partnerships and more investors knocking on her door. And yet, Woodard knows this isn't the case for many Black women founders.



""It's clear that in my ecosystem, there is a deprioritization of DEI efforts over the last year. So, yes, I'm a Black and Korean American woman who's raised more than $25 million for my startup, but there is still underwhelming, limited access to capital for Black and brown people,"" Woodard says. ""Less than 1% of all VC funding went to Black and Latina women in 2022. We are consistently over-mentored and under-funded.""As she continues to grow and scale her company, here's the advice Woodard has to share with other Black women starting businesses.Related: Her Daughter's Food Allergies Made Finding Healthy Snacks Impossible, So This Mother Quit Her Corporate Job to Change That1. If you can't stop thinking about your business idea, it's time to go all in""If your business idea keeps you up at night and pushes you out of bed in the morning, it's time to go all in,"" Woodard says. ""Building a business can be soul-crushingly hard. So you have to believe in your capabilities and have an unwavering commitment that this business is going to solve a need and make an impact.""Image credit: PartakeWoodard went all-in when it came to Partake Foods: She maxed out her credit cards, emptied her 401k and even sold her engagement ring. Building this business was a dream she couldn't let go of. She decided to devote all her time, energy and resources to making it a reality. She also said she never once thought of quitting. ""I would quit if the business concept no longer made sense or something had drastically changed. And I wasn't going to quit just because things got tough. I want my daughter to know that persistence and patience are key and are, quite frankly, underrated qualities that more leaders need to embrace.""


2. Stay focused — you can't do everything wellDuring the pandemic, more and more consumers were baking at home. So Woodard and her team decided to launch a line of baking products. She said she and her team are now course-correcting to focus on packaged cookies and other pantry staples. She recognized that they could have spent more time talking to consumers and studying the total addressable market.""It's easy to get distracted by shiny objects,"" Woodard says. ""The reality is you can't do everything well. I look at Chobani, which is a mission-driven company focused on its core product of yogurt. It's a reminder to continue to build your core business while slowly testing and trying what else you may want to build.""Partake Foods recently launched Classic Grahams, which Woodard says are resonating with consumers, who use them for snacking and as an ingredient. In my family, my sister-in-law uses the Classic Grahams to make crusts for her assortment of delicious pies.Related: Here's the Biggest Way You Can Show Up for the Black Community Beyond Black History Month


3. Know your numbers inside and out""Unfortunately, I still see investors who rely heavily on pattern matching when meeting founders. Investors may use experiences or patterns from their past to make decisions about future investments,"" Woodard says. ""While they may think this helps them make better decisions, there's a risk they increase bias in the process. If they have never seen someone who looks like me, who is solving a problem they have never faced or heard of before, they may discount me and pass up an incredible investment opportunity.""Woodard encourages founders she mentors to know their numbers inside and out. She acknowledges that many founders wear multiple hats like she has and will have a strong understanding of what's working and what's not. She had to learn it all: basic accounting, the return on investment in marketing and the details of what was happening with different customers. And yet, she knows the bar is different for Black women founders when it comes to raising capital, growing and scaling their businesses.""My biggest piece of advice: Use your difference as your biggest source of advantage. Find the investors, customers and individuals who are aligned with your vision and mission and believe in your capabilities as a founder. Surround yourself with a community who will help you unlock the potential of your business.""

Entrepreneur Ventures is an early-stage venture capital firm partnered with Entrepreneur Media that is dedicated to backing passionate and innovative founders as early as day one. In this series, we are profiling the amazing entrepreneurs that Entrepreneur Ventures is working with to share their insights on building and growing a thriving business.What's the elevator pitch of your company?My name is Raina Kumra and I am the founder of Spicewell. Salt and pepper haven't been upgraded in over a hundred years and we're at the very beginning of a clean food and food-as-medicine movement. And so seeing these two things, I wanted to create the perfect product for the times. Spicewell is superfood seasonings — with our salt, you get 10 percent of your daily vitamins from twelve organic vegetables in a pink Himalayan salt that is low in sodium. Our black ground pepper blend is mixed with turmeric and 12 organic vegetables to give you 10 percent of your daily vitamins.

Now These Founders Run a $100 Million Cold Plunge Business.Both have been clinically studied for anti-inflammatory diets and are very good for digestion. These are Ayurvedic, a traditional Indian medicine system, so there are about 5,000 years of studies backing up why and how we use these combinations.


What inspired you to create it?I was always in tech and I was investing out of a small fund I helped run in L.A. I realized I wanted to be a founder again, so for about eight years, I was actively looking for ideas but I didn't find anything I liked. And then during the pandemic, my husband had knee surgery and I was preparing to do everything he needed because he couldn't get out of bed for two weeks. Well, about seven hours after bringing him home, my five-year-old daughter broke her collarbone in a bike accident. It was completely bananas! So I started to tap into Ayurveda, which helped me heal quickly when I had broken my elbow in a bike accident. I healed three weeks faster than my orthopedic surgeon expected, and I had just eaten so much kale, spinach and turmeric and ginger. So for my family, I went a little overboard. I went into the garden, chopped kale and broccoli, dehydrated it. My husband and daughter also got better superfast, about 50 percent faster than their doctors expected. So not only did I have 5,000 years of studies, I had my personal experiences that showed me that this works.Related: How to Pitch Your Company to Entrepreneur Ventures for InvestmentWhere did you go from there?


I began studying food and health and learned that 94 percent of Americans have a nutrient deficiency of some kind. That nutrient deficiency is the gateway to chronic illness. And then I started reading labels and then became this label hawk. I was so angry about things I had been routinely feeding my children and trusting the marketing that said ""It's so good for you!"" But in reality, this stuff was full of crap. People have no idea what they're eating. There are four extra ingredients in most table salts — one of them causes gastro problems, rashes, and allergic responses. And I cannot tell you how much pepper that is in the supermarket today is full of toxic heavy metals. so I took a course at Cornell and got a certificate in plant medicine. From there I began developing Spicewell's salt and pepper.Credit: SpicewellHow did you get your product on store shelves?


That was the big learning for me. Retail is a really messed up industry — the buyers have a lot of power to make or break you. And if they do take you, it's like a blessing and a curse because your margins are just slashed because there's a broker fee, a distributor fee, and then the retailer needs their 40% to 50% margin. So it's a really hard business that will only work in volume. We got lucky pitching our first retailer, then we got into Erewhon Markets, and then we got into The Fresh Market, which are in over twenty-five states with 161 stores.Related: This Founder's Platform Is Unlocking the Secrets of Living Longer Through Personalized NutritionHow did you get that first meeting?Joining the Naturally Network was huge. In my case, it was Naturally Los Angeles. It is a nonprofit group that has a bunch of resources for new people in the food industry. Because here's the thing: new people are what the food industry needs. It needs new ideas, it needs new products that are not coming from Big Food. So they're sort of a support system and they set up this pitch day with Gelson's Markers. I gave my pitch, the buyer loved it, put an order in and that was done. The opportunity only came because of the Naturally Network.


Besides the obvious things about understanding your numbers backward and forward, what is something that people pitching investors should know?You have to really understand psychology. If you are not creating urgency and FOMO and making anyone you talk to understand that this is a very limited special time to be involved in this company, I don't think it's easy to be successful. An investor might say they're interested, but it's on the person pitching to force that relationship to move forward — let's get this done. Because if not, it can go on forever.Related: This Company Is on a Mission to Tackle the Concussion Crisis in Football. They're Now in 14 NFL Locker Rooms and Growing.You have raised a lot of money over your career. What is one thing that is important to you in an investor besides their dollars?


There's no ""dumb money"" on my cap table. Since my first startup, I've raised about seven and a half million dollars. I wouldn't say we had dumb money, but we had kind of unengaged investors who gave money — which is great — but they really didn't give their time, interest or connections. You want investors who are essentially saying, ""Let us be part of your team.""What does being an entrepreneur mean to you?Being a true entrepreneur means you just cannot stop yourself from building. I have to create something that doesn't exist that the world needs that only I see. And if I don't do it, someone else is going to. And they'll either do it more poorly or they're going to do great and I'm going to get really pissed off because I didn't do it!Entrepreneurship has no guarantees for success. How do you cope with uncertainty?


There are a lot of people who are true entrepreneurs but they are held back by fear. I think you have to look at that fear and analyze it. Is this fear of missing out on income? Is this fear of failing? All super valid concerns, but then you have to look at that fear and you have to compare the opportunity that lies ahead and ask yourself, ""If I don't do this, it would be much worse than me giving into my fears right now?""What is a quote that motivates or inspires you?I love the quote ""Everything is a phase."" And it is actually from some parenting book I read. During the early days of being a parent, there are times when you're like, ""What is going on?!"" But those times will pass. Same thing with a business. Right now, this business is two years old, so it's a toddler. There'll be some tantrums and confusing moments, but this isn't going to be the permanent state. Entrepreneurs need to know that time and your business will continue to move forward. And I have found that when you put a product out in the world, it takes on a life of its own. And every day it kind of comes home from school and says, ""Hey, I did this today!"" Every single day there is another opportunity that I never saw coming.

15,7 Ways to Fund Your Startup in 2024,"Feb 8, 2024",Kimberly Zhang,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/7-ways-to-fund-your-start-up-in-2024/469482,"

But creating a successful business is one of the hardest things entrepreneurs will ever do. How do you go about funding your startup?One of the biggest challenges for new small businesses is a lack of financial resources. If you find yourself in the same boat, don't give up just yet.

16,How This College Dropout Raised $29 Million for His Online Education Platform and Landed the Biggest Investor of All — Shaq,"Feb 7, 2024",Dan Bova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/shaq-backs-campus-initiative-for-debt-free-degrees/469310,"
Here's a report card no one wants to bring home: Nearly 40 percent of students who start at a community college will abandon higher education within their first year. And that percentage rises to over 50 percent when you focus on lower-income first-year students.Tade Oyerinde wants to turn around that failing trend — and he has a vision to do so. The online community college he founded Campus (which launched originally as Campuswire in 2016) offers students access to live classes with world-class teachers from institutions like Princeton, Spelman, NYU and Vanderbilt. Oyerinde was homeschooled growing up and attended Leeds University before dropping out to pursue entrepreneurship, so he is very aware of the power of online learning.A significant perk of enrolling at Campus is that tuition is less than the maximum Pell Grant amount, meaning that many students can get their associate's degrees essentially for free. Federal Pell Grants provide tuition assistance to low-income students who ""display exceptional financial need,"" and unlike student loans, they do not need to be repaid.



Related: 9 Powerful Shaq Quotes on Entrepreneurship and SuccessCampus has received top marks in the funding world, garnering $29 million in its Series A funding round from prominent investors like Discord founder Jason Citron, OpenAI founder Sam Altman and Bloomberg Beta. And just recently, Campus announced that the company landed its (literally) biggest investor yet: Shaquille O'Neal.


Entrepreneur spoke with Oyerinde and O'Neal about the business's mission and how a 30-year-old college dropout was able to connect with, pitch and eventually bring the big man to Campus.Can you give us the elevator pitch for Campus?Oyerinde: We've created a new kind of community college where anybody who enrolls in Campus can learn from professors who teach at top universities like Princeton, UCLA, NYU, Howard and Morehouse. They complete their first two years of college, get their associate's degree, and then we help them transfer into a four-year school to complete their bachelor's degrees. We've done everything in our power to ensure that our tuition is low enough that most students don't have to pay anything out of pocket. Government Pell Grants cover their full tuition cost, and we supply laptops to any student in need of one. We're trying to do everything needed for the students to succeed. Getting into college is a great accomplishment, but getting your degree is really what this is about.How did you connect with Shaq?


Oyerinde: After our initial success with fundraising, Forbes did a story on us. Someone on Shaq's team saw it, and they reached out. Honestly, I thought the email was fake, but we followed up, and it was real. The rest is history.Shaq, what did you see in Tade and Campus that made you made you want to invest?O'Neal: Well, you know, back 15-20 years ago, I heard Jeff Bezos say, ""If you invest in things that are going to change people's lives, you always have a great outcome."" So, I met with Tade at an event in Vegas, and we had a great conversation. There are three things I look for when I'm investing: passion, wanting to change a person's life, and the exit strategy. I tried to throw him off a little bit, but he just kept giving me great answers. When he said ""debt-free degrees"" and mentioned all of the incredible teachers he had access to, I was in. I'm not smart enough to go to NYU, but I would love to learn from that teacher. So it all made a lot of sense to me.Related: Shaquille O'Neal Reveals His 3 Secrets to Success


You've reached a level of success where you could just sit back and drive around in nice cars, travel the world and mess around with Charles Barkley all day. Where does this drive to do things in business come from?Oyerinde: He can't fit in a nice car. [Laughs]O'Neal: There are a few reasons. One, I have seven children, and I have millions of children who look up to me. My parents were big on telling horror stories, and one they always told me was that professional athletes go broke. So they told me to go back to school and get my bachelor's, get my master's. I have two PhDs. They told me to keep learning, and that's what I tell my kids: ""We don't need another basketball player. I would like to have a surgeon."" And the best way to teach is to show by example. You know, a lesson I learned came from Miami Heat owner Micky Arison. One day, I was shooting around and saw his son cleaning the locker room. I'm talking about picking up jocks, mopping the bathroom. I asked Mick about it, and he said everybody needs to start at the bottom and work their way up as they learn. That really stuck with me, which is why I'm so into this education thing.Related: How Shaq Is Bringing Fun Back to Papa John'sWho would make a better classmate on a group project at Campus: You or Charles?O'Neal: Oh, me! I went to LSU. Charles went to Auburn.Tade, walking into a pitch meeting with anyone is nerve-wracking, and you have met with and secured funding from some serious heavy hitters. How do you prepare yourself and stay calm?Oyerinde: Honestly, I say a prayer or two, and for the really big meetings, like the one with Shaq, I listen to ""Lose Yourself"" by Eminem. I also take a lot of inspiration from great athletes. My favorite is Kobe [Bryant]. Sorry, Shaq! [Laughs] It's just tapping into the killer instinct and knowing you can't choke. And the biggest piece of advice I ever got was from Sam Altman, and I was already following his advice before he said it. He told me, ""You've got to work on big, important problems. That's what gets powerful investors excited.""


Shaq, any parting words of advice?O'Neal: I always tell people to take advantage of the access to information that's out there. When I was at the Lakers, a guy named Bill Bertka was the assistant coach, and he told me, ""I coached Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar] and Wilt Chamberlin."" So I started listening to him, and he brought my game to the championship level. Same thing in business. I wish I was 16 years old now just because of all the information that's out there. Back in the day, when we had to do book reports, I had to go to the neighbor's house to borrow their encyclopedias. That was my only way of getting access to information that wasn't in school books. Now everything is instantly accessible. If I had that when I was young? I would be a genius right now. Almost as smart as Tade.

17,How to Understand Limiting vs. Productive Attitudes Among Day Traders,"Jan 31, 2024",Ross Cameron,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-understand-limiting-vs-productive-attitudes-among/468701,"
The requirements for day traders are straightforward:You need knowledge of the profession. There's indeed a lot to learn, but it's not mystical. If you put in the hours, you can acquire a solid foundation of knowledge over some months.You'll need basic computer gear. When I was a day trader cub, I thought it was cool to have ten monitors and a powerful computer tower. I discovered it was overload. Now, I use a standard laptop and just three monitors.You need a day trading brokerage account. U.S. accounts require a minimum of $25,000 to be maintained in the account, but you can open a foreign one with $500.This brings us to the last requirement: the right applied attitude.When I say ""applied attitude,"" I mean you can have the best attitude, but if you don't take actions consistent with that attitude, you'll fail. For example, if your attitude tells you that you need to be done with trading for the day because of the mistakes you just made — but you decide to take just one more trade — you will soon be toast.



What are examples of trading attitudes that harm or help? Here are four:1. Fear as a brake vs. fear as a motivatorMy inspiration for working hard to become a successful day trader had nothing to do with seeing myself driving a Lamborghini. It had to do with seeing myself homeless if I didn't find a solution, pronto.


I lived in a modest house in Vermont with my dog. My trading account was down to the $25k minimum, and I had $30k in credit card debt. I was also down to the last few things I could sell on Craigslist to raise cash.Fortunately, I had kept a trading journal. As a last gasp before taking up some other profession, I analyzed my winning and losing trades and found certain patterns. Long story short, I turned my trading around. If that fear had led to inaction, it would have ended my trading career.Related: Want to Make Enough Money to Live A Great Life? Start By Setting Your ""Freedom Number""2. Scarcity vs. abundanceA close cousin to a fear mindset is a scarcity one. The first saying I ever learned was: ""A penny saved is a dollar earned."" Money was always tight, as we were continually reminded.


I learned about my great-grandfather, who was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929 on the day of the crash. He lost everything. That trauma rippled down through the generations to me. I had the feeling not only of scarcity but that you couldn't depend on others for job security. That was reinforced by what happened to my mother: After four decades of working at a hospital, she was laid off.Years later, I learned about my great-grandfather's brother-in-law. He started an investment company following the Great Depression, and he made millions.Here we have a member of my extended family, in the same enveloping Great Depression, who engineered a vastly different outcome. I was intrigued by how this branch of my family did not have a scarcity mindset. It opened the door in my mind to the possibility of thinking differently.Let's jump to today. Not only have I turned $583 into more than $10 million by day trading, but I've had the privilege of working with thousands of other people on their own day trading journeys. I see two other attitudes at work in some of them.


Related: 3 Simple Strategies for Success When Money Is Scarce3. ""My situation is different"" vs. ""How can I make this work?""In one sense, of course, we are all unique. But this characteristic can be taken to an extreme — it can invalidate any advice.Let's say you're reading about a successful franchise owner. You love how this person overcame many obstacles to get where she got. Then you have a choice:You can look for reasons why your circumstances are different and her situation does not apply. For example, you might think: ""It's easy for her to succeed, but English is my second language."" Or ""It was easy for her because she benefited from the whole pandemic hysteria, and we're now over that.""


If you look hard enough, you can find endless reasons why someone's success differs from your circumstances.Or you can look for handholds.Think about rock climbers: At any moment, there are a hundred ways not to move up the wall, but they look for one little spot to grab to pull themselves higher toward their goal.The path of least resistance is to look for reasons why someone else's success does not apply to you. The path of progress comes when you find what you can use from that person's example.

But when you are learning a skill, the time to show how unique you are is after you've mastered the skill.There are three types of cooks: those who wing it and are happy, those who read a recipe but don't follow it, and those who follow the recipe. If these people try day trading, only one has a hope of succeeding.If you wing it, come across a hot tip, open a day trading account and have at it, you will be slaughtered in minutes.If you study successful traders but decide that you can modify their advice, you're doing so with no experience. Your days are numbered.If you first follow their instructions, this allows you to stand on their shoulders and learn their discoveries. In time, you can then modify their principles to match your experience.Day trading for beginners is difficult enough without hobbling yourself with ineffective methods. The right mindset is a foundation on which to make effective decisions. Those moment-by-moment decisions will determine your success in this wonderful but challenging profession.

18,"A Former McKinsey Consultant Used This Not-So-'Sexy' Mindset to Take Her 'Healthy Indulgence' Snack Brand From Her Kitchen to 4,000 Retailers","Jan 31, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-deuxs-founder-uses-a-tech-mindset-for-massive-growth/468958,"
Sabeena Ladha, founder and CEO of the ""good-for-you"" snack brand DEUX, has a ""pretty deep relationship with junk food."" That's ""kind of a funny thing to say,"" she admits, but her childhood in the small town of Euless, Texas, where her father ran a gas station and convenience store, kicked off the passion for snacks that would help shape her professional endeavors.""My parents worked 24/7,"" Ladha recalls. ""They're immigrants, so they had that hard work ethic built in them. So he was working 12-, 14-hour days, six, seven days a week, and on the weekends, my sisters and I would go to the gas station, and we would get to pick a snack. I always picked one salty and one sweet snack."" They weren't necessarily the most healthful choices, but at the time, those products weren't quite as ""villainized"" as they are today, she says.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX. Sabeena Ladha. 



Although Ladha ""looked healthy"" as a high school athlete who played basketball and ran track, she quips that her ""insides were made of partially hydrogenated oil and trans fats."" It wasn't until college that she dove into health and wellness, even starting a blog ""before it was cool"" to unpack juice cleanses and cryotherapy.Related: After Being Diagnosed With Cancer, She Created a Cookie That Would Help Her Eat Cleanly and Satisfy Her Sweet Tooth. Now, Her Products Are Sold in 25,000 Stores.


""Not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""""[I was] trying to make the scary world of wellness a little bit more approachable for Sabeena in Texas,"" Ladha explains. ""Not everyone lives in Los Angeles and has access to 18 farmers markets on a Saturday. That's just not realistic. And not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""Answering that question ultimately led Ladha to the ""healthy indulgences"" concept of DEUX. The hot-pink brand offers cookie doughs, dessert spreads and donut holes that are vegan, gluten- and preservative-free and contain ""functional ingredients"" like vitamin B12 to support sustained energy and L-Theanine to help with cognitive function and mental focus.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX


Ladha was ready to ""break the rules"" and innovate in the snack space, but she credits much of her success with the fact that she learned those rules before she broke them. Her previous experiences working on Frito-Lay at PepsiCo, managing a P&L at Diamond Foods, consulting at McKinsey & Company and launching brands in venture capital helped build a strong foundation for her entrepreneurial journey.Related: The Founders of This Paleo, Gluten-Free and Vegan Brand Say It Succeeded Because of Its Restrictions""[Experimenting with scale] required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that.""Ladha started experimenting with chocolate chip cookie dough in her kitchen in June 2020, when the pandemic was well underway, and many people wanted to graduate from the ""sourdough and wine phase"" and indulge in healthier ways, she says. Today, all of DEUX's cookie doughs have a similar base, incorporating oats, nut butter, flaxseed and coconut sugar.


But one of the biggest challenges in those early days was figuring out how to scale DEUX's perfect recipe with a manufacturer. ""You would think it's [just] math, right?"" Ladha says. ""Like, you just scale up the recipe into making 3,000 pounds instead of one pound. And it really did not work like that. It got drier; it got a little bit more dense. It wasn't as sweet. So you have to then go through iterations, and that required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that too.""Related: This Entrepreneur Believes Courage Is the Key Ingredient for SuccessInitially, Ladha didn't want to raise capital; she put $20,000 of her own money into the business and resolved to test the product first. Ladha was more than willing to pivot if the idea didn't gain traction, noting that she ""wanted an idea that would work"" rather than one that had to be ""force fit"" into the market. But DEUX was ""profitable on first ship,"" and once Ladha realized the serious potential there, she decided to raise.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX


To date, DEUX has raised about $6 million. The company's first fundraising round kicked off in January 2021, and Ladha says that capital — and the ability it gave DEUX to produce at a significantly higher volume — made it possible for her to appear on Shark Tank after its producers reached out. Ladha didn't land a deal on the show, but DEUX has continued to see tremendous growth in the years since.""[If you] take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit.""DEUX has transitioned from an exclusively direct-to-consumer (DTC) brand to one with a significant retail presence in Target, Whole Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets and more. DEUX hit 1,000,000 units sold last year and more than doubled its store count to 2,600 in 2023. And in the first half of 2024, DEUX will see that figure skyrocket again with the launch of donuts at major retailers nationwide, totaling more than 4,000 stores across its three product lines.Ladha says that retail will make up the ""lion's share"" of DEUX's revenue this year but stresses that DTC remains important for the brand for two reasons: data collection and marketing opportunities. The former helps the business understand who its customers are and which flavors resonate with them, and the latter has allowed it to explore brand collaborations, like its recent Buttercream Sugar Cookie with The Skinny Confidential.

It Failed, But He Pivoted to Build a $1.5 Billion Business.Now, Ladha is focused on making DEUX a household name — ""full stop."" She envisions it as a ""better-for-you Nestlé"" with a modern twist and says a not-so-""sexy"" ""tech mindset"" is helping it get there.""It sounds much cooler to be like, 'You know, I was just making this cookie dough for my friends and family, and then I went to a farmer's market, and Whole Foods discovered me, and now I'm at Whole Foods now nationally,'"" Ladha says. ""That's a cooler story, right? But if you can collect data and test and learn and take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit. That's why I joke, 'Don't do it — but see if you should do it.'""

For countless entrepreneurs, the tried-and-true way of finding funders and staffing a startup is through cross-class connections — yet too few of them are properly focused on continually broadening their networks.There are plenty of other important steps along the way to startup success: revenue growth, hiring the right talent, market knowledge, the list goes on. But there's one metric that deserves considerable attention in that process: broadening your answer to the age-old adage, ""It's not always about what you know, but who you know.""The ""who you know"" often includes the support systems that come pre-embedded among those in wealthier economic classes. These successful entrepreneurs have navigators — successful relatives who can offer introductions, former professors or classmates who can review business proposals, etc. — that lower-income entrepreneurs without robust social networks typically lack.



It's probably true that entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk are so singular that they would have succeeded no matter how they started out. Yet entrepreneurs who don't come from privileged backgrounds can't retroactively go to a top-tier school or land an entry-level position at a promising company. They can't turn back time and ensure their social circles include people as successful as they hope to be one day. What they can do is focus on what's in front of them. Most importantly, they can intentionally build their social capital.Related: When 'Who You Know' Can Actually Hurt Your Entrepreneurial Success. Here's Why.


Thankfully, at the same time that there's an acknowledgment that many founders lack access to the right form of social capital, I've seen that more of those who possess it are finding ways to share it or provide it. One example is Vimenti's Project Makers, one of my company's projects, which seeks to develop entrepreneurial skills in young workers.The benefits of programs like this and many others go far beyond sharpening a potential business idea. They speak to the heart of social capital, which is the development of trust between talented entrepreneurs who may be lacking in opportunities and established funders, mentors and collaborators who can help them try to get to where they want to go.That trust is vital for entrepreneurs at all stages, but particularly early on. As most of them well know, they are seeking not just money, but direction — the kind of business-shaping advice they can only get from those who've done it themselves, and are therefore in a social strata they would not otherwise interact with.Think about a community and a person who only knows the people in their immediate surroundings. If they are unable to incubate the trust piece — how to build trust and how to create environments where trust can be developed — they're never going to get to the part where that priceless asset becomes part of their social capital.


Many government programs have attempted to bridge the divide in cross-class connections. But as I see it, these initiatives only underscore the need for entrepreneurs themselves to take greater ownership of network-building solutions.Related: How Cultivating Relationships Helps You (and Your Company) ThriveConsider the federal government's Recompete Pilot Program, for example, which offers up to $200 million to communities that have a prime age employment gap far behind the national average. It's a worthy program that my organization hopes to leverage, but it can't unilaterally remedy longstanding inequality gaps. An injection of financial capital is important, but it does little to solve the issues of those who really need social capital on its own.Academic research on class connections suggests that, for every dollar in real capital brought into struggling communities, an equal amount needs to be invested in the form of social capital. This isn't theoretical; for instance, Jobs for the Future is a nonprofit that strives to transform the U.S. education and workforce systems and boost equitable economic advancement. But it's essentially a form of social capital: a program to increase the cross-class connections of prospective job hunters from low-income backgrounds that includes better schooling, coaching, mentorship and, most importantly, exposure to the sorts of already-accomplished people job hunters might never have had previously.


There is no quick fix to this issue. Class is the great divider across most countries, not just the most entrepreneurial ones like the United States. Tackling this issue can be a low-cost way to address a startup's ongoing hiring needs and help bolster economic opportunity and mobility. That's important on a broad scale because entrepreneurship is typically how economic mobility is created.It's a statement I feel confident saying in part because, as an executive of an organization that supports a job accelerator, job training center, school programs and a health clinic in Puerto Rico, we're at work on similar attempts to increase social capital, too.The gap between what those in wealthier communities take for granted and what those in low-income communities lack is starker in my work. I'm constantly confronted with the trauma, guilt and shame associated with poverty. I see how the barriers to mobility are as psychological as they are physical, and how the traps that keep poor people poor can only be overcome by exposure and connection to those who've never known those confines.Especially for small businesses without a lot of resources, being able to join groups that are intentional about connecting to entrepreneurial mentorship can be formidable. It's not only about immediate feedback on marketing, sales or production. The hoped-for outcome is an entrepreneur who has expanded their capacity to do business because their network is growing and hopefully will continue to grow.


It's this last mile of entrepreneurial economic mobility that's most important to achieve and hardest to accomplish. That's what I know — and it's based on who I know, too.

20,5 Goal-Setting Guidelines That Drive Success,"Jan 30, 2024",Brian Will,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-goal-setting-strategies-that-drive-success/468649,"
In the fast-paced world of entrepreneurship and business, goal-setting is the compass that guides us toward success, but there are a lot of misconceptions about how our goals should be set. In this article, we're taking a fresh perspective on the ""foundational"" truths of setting business goals and finding a practical and effective solution that will help you achieve remarkable growth without unnecessary stress.Read on to find out the five essential guidelines for setting goals.Rejecting common goal-setting adviceIt's great to seek guidance when you're trying to set the right goals for your business, but unfortunately not all commonly shared phrases align with practical success strategies.



These common phrases about goal-setting sound good on paper but not so much in practice. Let's find out why:Common Phrase #1: If your goals don't scare you, they aren't really goals.


While the sentiment here is to encourage ambitious goals, the right goals should not induce fear. They should ignite your passion and determination, propelling you forward with enthusiasm rather than causing paralyzing unease.Common Phrase #2: If you can conceive your goals, they are too smallIf you have no idea how to reach your goal, you'll likely never get there. While they should be challenging enough to foster growth, setting goals beyond your understanding or capabilities can lead to frustration and failure. Strive for goals that are ambitious and achievable, providing a clear path for progress without unnecessary obstacles.Related: The 5 Golden Rules of Goal-SettingNow, let's get down to the real business of goal-setting for success. Before you read through these five essential guidelines, you have to understand that success is a progression of thoughts, ideas and execution, and it doesn't happen overnight.Now, here's how to set goals that drive success:


1. Start with realistic timeframesGoing from $0 in profits to $500,000 in a single year might sound thrilling, but is it feasible? Set your goal up for success by creating a realistic timeline to complete it. Consider whether your goal is achievable in one year or a longer timeframe, such as three years, would be more realistic.2. Choose the right vehicleDetermine if your current role or business has the potential to reach your overall profit goals. Evaluating your current situation and identifying whether it can realistically lead to your goal is a crucial starting point in goal-setting. If where you are now can't get you where you want to be, it's time to explore other options.Related: The 10 Golden Rules of Effective Management3. Create a detailed P&LIf you don't know your numbers, how can you know what they'll be down the line? Building an accurate Profit and Loss (P&L) statement for your business is essential, as is breaking down revenue, expenses, sales, leads, and overhead. This provides a detailed financial roadmap, shows you the progress you're making as you go, and allows you to assess the feasibility of your income goal.


4. Back it up and cut backTake your ultimate goal and cut it back into smaller milestones. Say you're making $100,000 a year now, and your goal is to make $500,000. Break that larger goal into milestones of $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, and finally, $500,000. Now you have a four-step progression, and you can create a realistic timeline for each, let's say one year. Breaking your long-term goal into shorter, more manageable milestones helps you maintain motivation and track progress effectively.Related: 16 Actions to Take to Achieve Any Goal5. Set short-term obtainable goalsAdding onto the previous point, once you've broken down your ultimate goal into one-year increments and created a roadmap for each year, take it a step further and create 30-day action plans for each month. Stay focused on daily and weekly targets, and get specific with your short-term goals. This allows for the most accurate measurement of your progress and guarantees you'll stay accountable for your long-term goals.The power of progressionThe progression of short-term goals works like building blocks. Adding one block at a time is more accessible than stacking ten blocks simultaneously. This method keeps you motivated, ensures consistent wins, and prevents constant failure because these short-term goals allow you to see progress, build confidence, and ultimately achieve your desired long-term success. By setting achievable, realistic and motivational goals, you're on the path to reaching new heights in your business.


Related: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Building a Successful BusinessConclusionIn the fast-paced world of business, goal-setting is often misunderstood. Setting overzealous goals that leave you in fear of failure isn't the answer; it's about crafting motivating, realistic, and achievable goals. The path to success is a progression of thoughts, ideas, and actions, taking one step at a time. Start with practical timeframes, assess your vehicle for success, create a detailed roadmap, break your ultimate goal into smaller milestones, and set short-term, attainable targets. This progression leads to constant motivation, and before you know it, you'll reach the pinnacle of success, one goal at a time.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Elise Whang and Emily Erkel, co-founders of B2B marketplace platform LePrix, which offers a curated space for sourcing pre-owned luxury items from top suppliers around the world.LePrix has done more than $100 million in topline gross merchandise value since launch. It has raised $15 million to date and is the largest B2B pre-owned luxury platform globally, with over 150,000 units of pre-owned luxury at wholesale prices per month, according to the company.How did your corporate careers prepare you to launch the side hustle that would become LePrix? 



Whang: Early on in my legal career, I had the opportunity to meet entrepreneurs from mega-corporations who had built their businesses from scratch. Their journey was fascinating and inspiring to me; however, I quickly realized entrepreneurs are often over-glamorized. Lawyers see all the blemishes and the challenges and hardships business owners face as well. This experience helped me take the proverbial leap with my eyes wide open. Importantly, being a lawyer also trained me how to write thoughtfully, be persuasive and take measured risks. I also learned that what I enjoyed most about being a lawyer would carry over to being an entrepreneur — helping people and fixing problems.Erkel: My career in retail strategy consulting prepared me for the launch of LePrix in so many ways. Each project was a different opportunity to help a client overcome a challenge and succeed — whether it was launching a large Japanese fast-fashion retailer in the U.S., helping a women's specialty retailer go omnichannel or [helping] an iconic luxury brand house known for its handbags expand into other categories. The skills I learned to quickly identify the problem, be creative with the solution and help the retailer execute helped me learn the skills that every entrepreneur needs: strategy, execution, grit and adaptability.

It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.When did you start the side hustle that would become your company, and what was the inspiration behind it? Whang: When that first amazing business idea dawns on you, it is like a bright light bulb going off in your head. It first lit up when I was standing in line for coffee before work knowing I had to work over the weekend. What I really wanted to do over the weekend was go to my favorite consignment stores with my sisters, but these stores all closed at 7 p.m., and I could not get there. So why not bring all these wonderful designer consignment stores online? This first iteration of our business was consumer-facing, aiming to aggregate the best designer consignment stores online in one platform. This laid the groundwork for our present business model, focusing on business-to-business (B2B) pre-owned luxury wholesale.In the early days, I juggled my entrepreneurial pursuits with my demanding role as a lawyer. My side hustle typically unfolded between 8 p.m. to 2 or 3 a.m. and consumed weekends for several years. Fast forward — the light bulb went off again when we saw that our stores were buying from each other more and more on our platform. We realized they needed a way to source pre-owned authentic handbags and jewelry from other trusted businesses online. We then launched the first B2B pre-owned luxury wholesale auction houses from across the globe to retailers in the U.S., and it grew from there.


At which point did you decide to leave your corporate jobs to focus on LePrix full-time, and what motivated you to take the leap? Whang: I was eight months pregnant, happily married, with a great job as a lawyer. I was patting myself on the back for being the first female lawyer in our family. But I was also panicking that life was going by at warp speed, and if I didn't take the leap soon to work on this great business plan, it may never happen. In hindsight, I was probably going through a midlife crisis. We applied to an accelerator program and got in, but they required only full-time founders, which meant I had to quit my day job. I was scared about what our immigrant parents, who worked their behinds off to give us the American dream, would think. My husband asked me what I was going to do — and I said I wanted to take a bet on this business; otherwise, I'd regret it on my deathbed (I know, dramatic). I popped out my baby and then started my entrepreneurial journey. I haven't looked back since.Related: Being 'Lazy' Paid Off: Her Failed Side Hustle Led to a Business That Brings in Over $100 Million a YearErkel: At the time, I had been at a large specialty retailer, working with the leadership team on different strategies, from growing their new baby business to exploring ways to shorten lead time from design to delivery. It was an amazing experience and a great team, but part of me yearned to build something that was more aligned with my passion growing up. When I was younger, I was obsessed with fashion, especially luxury and vintage. When my co-founder and sister, Elise, approached me with the idea of launching this as a side hustle, my gut reaction was an immediate yes. Once we started gaining traction and growing quickly, I knew it was time to go full-time, but I was nervous. Innately, I am more risk averse, but the numbers (and Elise) are very convincing. Would I rather be a cog in a wheel or chart my own course and try something new and exciting that there was clearly a market demand for? The answer was clear.


What have been some of the biggest challenges you've faced over the course of your founding journey so far, and how have you overcome them? Whang: One of the significant challenges we faced was securing funding from venture capitalists (VCs). The reality of less than 5% of female founders successfully raising funds from VCs is real. Our company deviates from the conventional VC company profile; we're far from resembling the stereotypical characters depicted in the HBO show Silicon Valley (one of my favorite shows). Notably, our team is 60% BIPOC, with two female founders, and we take immense pride in this diversity. We have, however, successfully secured funds from private investors and early-stage VCs who wholeheartedly believe in our vision, the business, its potential and our team.Erkel: Another challenge was the pivot from B2C to B2B. It was clear that the way to help our stores was not selling but sourcing. For businesses, sourcing pre-owned luxury is difficult, risky and expensive because the wholesale industry for luxury resale is highly fragmented. As our B2B business continued to take off, Elise and I knew it was time to sunset our B2C business. It was a decision we thought very carefully about as the B2C business was not only our first baby, but we had also built a pretty successful business. However, the growth of the B2B business was immense, and with limited resources and time, we knew it was time to double down on B2B.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business. Here's What I Learned.What are you most excited about as you look to LePrix's future? Erkel: As the leader in the B2B pre-owned luxury industry, we are most excited to be the driving force making luxury resale accessible to retailers globally. We have the opportunity to change the industry, help retailers meet consumer demand and, most importantly, make a sustainable impact.What's your best advice for other side hustlers who hope to turn their gigs into full-time ventures?Whang: Don't quit your day job until you have some data or traction. DO build out a business model with your data and make an informed decision to take the leap. Don't obsess about hyper growth anymore, but DO build a profitable business — it's still a business. Don't kick yourself for failing. DO learn from your mistakes and quickly pivot.


Erkel: Don't be scared to take the leap. Life is short, and time is limited. If your side hustle shows traction and the only thing that is holding you back is fear, overcome it. Don't let fear dictate your life and stop you from moving forward. Life is more fulfilling if you're doing what you love.

22,10 Reasons Your Capital Raising Strategy Is Failing,"Jan 16, 2024",Simone Grimes,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/10-reasons-your-capital-raising-strategy-is-failing/468055,"
If your capital raise strategy is failing, it's essential to identify the potential reasons for the lack of success and take corrective actions.Here are some common reasons why capital raise strategies may fail and steps to address them:1. Lack of clear value propositionProblem: Investors crave a compelling value proposition. A pitch lacking in articulating what makes your company unique or the potential for a high return on investment can lead to swift rejection.



Solution: Refine your pitch to explicitly outline unique selling points, market opportunities and the benefits investors can anticipate. A coherent and captivating narrative, backed by quantifiable data, is vital to reinforce your claims. According to CB Insights, the top reason startups fail, cited by 42% of respondents, is a lack of market need. Therefore, emphasizing the market need your startup addresses is crucial for attracting investor interest.Related: How to Get Funding: The Dos and Don'ts of Raising Capital From Investors


2. Inadequate market researchProblem: Investors demand thorough market research. You must demonstrate a deep understanding of your target audience and competition to maintain your business's credibility.Solution: Utilize comprehensive market research to gather data and insights. It not only instills confidence but also showcases your commitment to informed decision-making. Numbers speak volumes; incorporate relevant statistics to bolster your case. Forty-two percent of startups fail because they need help finding a market need for their product or service, often due to inadequate market research. Thorough market research helps align your offerings with actual market demands, reducing the risk of failure.3. Weak financials and projectionsProblem: Investors meticulously scrutinize financials to evaluate potential returns. Weak or unconvincing financial data can be a significant deterrent.Solution: Strengthen your financial models and projections, ensuring they are realistic, grounded in sound assumptions, and credible. Seek advice from financial experts, leveraging their insights to fortify your financial narrative. Research by Professor Noam Wasserman of the Harvard Business School indicates that 65% of startups fail due to financial mismanagement. Demonstrating a solid financial plan attracts investors and mitigates one of the most common causes of failure.


4. Ineffective networkingProblem: Building relationships with potential investors is pivotal. Ineffective networking or a lack of access to the right investor networks can impede your capital-raising efforts.Solution: Active participation in industry events, joining startup networks and utilizing platforms like LinkedIn is vital for effective networking. Quality trumps quantity; cultivate relationships over time, emphasizing mutual value. A survey by Startup Genome found that companies with solid networks raise significantly more funding than those without. Networking is not just a formality but a strategic necessity for fundraising success.5. Poor timing or market conditionsProblem: External factors like economic conditions or industry trends can impact capital-raising efforts. Raising capital during unfavorable conditions may lead to failure.Solution: Monitor market conditions closely, and adjust your capital raise timeline accordingly. Consider alternative funding sources or pivot your business strategy if needed. Agility in response to market dynamics is critical. During economic downturns, investors tend to be more risk-averse. According to PitchBook, global venture capital deal activity dropped by 12% in 2020 due to uncertainties caused by the pandemic. Being attuned to market conditions is vital for strategic fundraising.


Related: 5 Innovative Ways for Entrepreneurs to Raise Capital in Today's Market6. Ineffective pitch deckProblem: Your pitch deck is a crucial tool for engaging investors. A poorly structured or unconvincing pitch deck can result in rejection.Solution: Create a compelling pitch deck that succinctly communicates vital information about your business, team, market opportunity and financials. Seek feedback from mentors or advisors to enhance its effectiveness. A DocSend study found that a pitch deck's optimal length is around ten slides. Going beyond this can lead to a decrease in investor engagement. Crafting a concise yet impactful pitch deck is essential for maintaining investor attention.7. Insufficient due diligenceProblem: Investors conduct due diligence to verify claims made during fundraising. Lack of transparency or failure to address investor concerns can lead to rejection.


Solution: Meticulously prepare for due diligence by organizing all necessary documents. Proactively address potential red flags and provide accurate, complete and transparent information. Upholding transparency is paramount. According to one startup mentor and consultant, many investors reported finding a misrepresentation in a startup's pitch. Thorough due diligence is not just an investor expectation but a prerequisite for building trust.8. Limited investor outreachProblem: A narrow outreach to potential investors can limit fundraising opportunities. Relying on a small network or failing to cast a wide net can hinder success.Solution: Expand your investor outreach efforts by targeting various investor types, including angel investors, venture capitalists and crowdfunding platforms. Diversifying your outreach can open new avenues for funding. Data from NFX indicates that startups benefit from a diversified investor base. Those with more investors experienced higher success rates, emphasizing the importance of casting a wide net during fundraising.9. Inflexibility and resistance to feedbackProblem: Rigidity in your approach and resistance to feedback can hinder your capital raise efforts. Investors value entrepreneurs who are open to input and can adapt to changing circumstances.


Solution: Embrace constructive feedback and be willing to make necessary adjustments to your strategy, pitch or business plan. Demonstrating flexibility can enhance investor confidence. A startup's ability to adapt is a valuable asset. According to a report by CB Insights, the second most common reason for startup failure is the inability to adapt to market needs. Being receptive to feedback is not just a trait investors appreciate; it is a strategic imperative for sustained success.Related: Here's What's Brewing in the Minds of Startup Investors10. Inadequate team and skillsProblem: Investors scrutinize the capabilities and experience of the founding team. A lack of critical skills or experience can raise concerns.Solution: Evaluate your team's strengths and weaknesses. Consider augmenting it with members or advisors possessing relevant expertise. A well-rounded team enhances investor confidence in your startup's ability to execute the business plan. A study by Harvard Business Review revealed that 80% of startups fail due to hiring the wrong team. Building a skilled and experienced team is not just a recommendation but a fundamental requirement for investors.


If your capital raise strategy is failing, it's essential to reassess and make improvements based on the specific challenges you're facing. Seek guidance from mentors, advisors or industry experts who can provide valuable insights and support in refining your strategy. Fundraising can be challenging, and persistence and adaptability are often crucial to eventual success.

24,A 5-Step Survival Guide to Fundraising for a Niche Industry,"Jan 12, 2024",Kirill Gurskiy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/a-5-step-survival-guide-to-fundraising-for-a-niche-industry/466005,"
The global venture capital (VC) market is going through an undeniably rough phase caused by a seemingly unending stream of economic and geopolitical issues, simultaneously occurring across all corners of the globe. According to KPMG's ""Venture Pulse Q3 2023"" report, worldwide VC investment dropped to a sixteen-quarter low in Q3 2023. Many market players feel concerned by the historically high number of down rounds, the overall slowdown in the speed of VC deals and the protracted lack of exit opportunities.Based on CB Insights' ""State of Venture Q3 2023"" report, 9M of 2023 showed the lowest results in the amount of funding received by startups since the same period in 2019. The number of deals is also slightly lower: 21,216 deals during 9M of 2023 versus 22,992 deals within the same time frame in 2019.The same report states that during 9M of 2021, investors injected an astonishing $465.6B into startups, while during 9M of 2023, startups received only $193.6B. So, 2021 was a peak year for startup funding, while the current market has shrunk to less than half its size.



With no end to market challenges in sight, today's investors are much more cautious. The good old venture market that we knew prior to 2022 no longer exists. With that in mind, here are 5 pieces of advice that we'd like to share with all companies seeking VC funding in 2024.Related: VCs Want to See Product-Market Fit: Here's How to Prove It


1. The idea is not enough! Show VCs the first metrics and tractionIn the current financial climate, it's much more difficult to sell just a lofty idea or a talented team to investors, no matter how good your previous achievements and your concept are. Nowadays, everyone is looking for something more solid, like initial engagement figures. Most VCs will want to see the first metrics or a prototype of your product right away to confirm its potential. Focus your effort on that to make your pitch convincingly stand out.Also, you should deeply understand your market and its trends. Comprehend your competitors, envision their development trajectory, and clearly convey your thoughts on where you overlap, where you are better and where you have the potential to outpace them.2. Work out your marketing strategy and the path to customers from the very beginningCultivating your customer base should begin as early as possible. Talking to potential customers is a great way to validate your concepts. Their approval and insights gained from these conversations can prove to investors that your startup is on the right track. Beyond that, a startup that is already earning money gives more freedom to its team and looks better in the eyes of potential VC investors. The venture capital landscape has led to increased demands from funds to startups. What matters now is the fundamental strength of the business, not just its potential. Investors are now looking for not just growth but profitable growth. They want to invest in growing companies that are close to self-sufficiency.Today's market is oversaturated in many ways. The competition for the attention of consumers, talent, and investors is at an all-time high, and the flow of information is broad and intense. You need to figure out in advance how you will be breaking through all that noise to connect with your customers.


If your company serves a niche market, try reaching out to communities within that space. Perhaps your best strategy would be collaborating with micro-influencers or using highly targeted ads on social media platforms. Try exploring specific social networks and ways of communication that are typical for your niche (like games and Discord). For some niches, building reach offline rather than online may be better.Related: Venture Capital 101: A Comprehensive Guide for Startups Seeking Investment3. Start working with your community as soon as possibleOne of the most crucial aspects, and a sign that all investors consider a positive indicator of business health, is proof that your product is in demand by customers. The more traction you show in this area, the higher your chances of being funded and the better valuation you may receive. Start building your future fan base as early as possible to prove that you've figured out the path to your target audience. On this front, your community stands above all!Use all tools possible: launch YouTube or Discord channels, Twitter, Threads, Facebook groups and a Reddit thread for your startup with up-to-the-minute updates. Consider branching out into new platforms and become an early adopter. Every opportunity to keep your audience informed and engaged matters.


4. Think in advance and build your dry powderFundraising looks set to be an uphill battle in 2024. Few things are certain, least the time frame needed to secure an investment. Consequently, your best strategy would be securing a reserve fund for 12-18 months of runway. It can help to weather the ongoing storm still ravaging the markets.Start the process of fundraising at least six months before your funds are projected to run out. It widens your opportunities in terms of sources of capital to raise and decreases the chance of being knocked out by unforeseen circumstances. Also, in the current situation, it's better to reduce operational costs as much as possible to continue working on a project.Related: We Can't Rely on Venture Capital Funding to Build a Just and Thriving Entrepreneurial Economy. Here's What to Do Instead5. Try to discover as many investment options as you canPlan out the fundamentals of your fundraising strategy as early as possible. The wider the net cast towards potential investors, the higher your chances of securing the deal on terms favorable to you. Relying on a single funding source can be risky while diversifying your funding sources can help ensure stability and resilience.


Explore grants and individual donations within and beyond the angel investor community. Corporate partnerships and other options that align with your mission are worth investigating, too. Today, many countries are trying to develop their tech market by attracting companies and talent from abroad. They often offer special terms to startups, like lower taxes or even freedom from paying taxes for a couple of years. Think outside the box! For example, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are very enthusiastic about accommodating startups, including games and tech companies. Bringing in innovation is a core part of their economic strategy.Ultimately, even though the VC market is going through a rocky period, it's still possible to secure funding, so long as you can prove your product viable. The trick is to show a strong understanding of how your product fits into the market. Provide community metrics, work out your unique selling points and marketing strategy from the inception, prepare your investor pitch thoughtfully and be ready to put more effort into the fundraising process than was required in the past.

25,How to Network at Events Like a Pro and Watch Your Startup Soar,"Jan 12, 2024",Lirone Glikman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-network-like-a-pro-and-watch-your-startup-soar/466539,"
We, as entrepreneurs, have a goal: to grow a startup — a brand — that impacts many people with our solutions and services. This entails numerous tasks, from building a product, managing and hiring a team, finding investors and establishing a client base. With that in mind, who has the time to network and attend events? And on top of that, do you know why most people hate networking at events? Because they rarely meet relevant people for them, and it often feels like a waste of time.Do you know why it feels like a waste of time? Because they never took the time to set their goals for the conference or meetup and define who they came to meet, and instead leave it up to luck or chance.I always say that no one teaches us how to network for results, and that's why I took on the task over a decade ago to build my expertise and run workshops to teach professionals all around the world how to network — and that includes at conferences.



To help you make the most of your next meet-up or conference, I would like to share some of my top practices. Once you do them, you will surely look at networking events as a source of opportunities rather than a time waster.Related: 3 Ways to Get More Business at Networking Events


1. Remember: Networking is uncomfortable for all of us, not only youWhy are we so uncomfortable next to strangers at conferences? Once you crack that, you can work the room so much better. I hope this info will make you feel a bit better: Based on public speaking statistics for 2020 from Orai.com research, 77% of the U.S. population feel some anxiety when it comes to public speaking, and 90% report some ""shyness."" This means most people who come to the event will feel the same as you do — uncomfortable and insecure. However, in most cases, they will put a ""mask"" on and won't show it.Various studies and concepts in social psychology and cognitive neuroscience also found that when we meet new people, our brains subconsciously assess whether they like us and whether they pose a threat. It happens in split seconds, and that's why a positive first impression is so crucial.What can you do to connect well with all the people you meet? Be proactive and initiate the conversation instead of waiting for them to do so. Show them that you are open to meeting them through open body language, a smile and a warm look in their eyes. It's so simple and non-verbal, can make a better experience for both of you and could be the beginning of a great friendship or business partnership.2. Set your ""people's goal""As said, most people don't feel networking events work for them because they don't set a goal for those they want to meet with. Several years ago, a global businessman I followed came to Berlin for a conference while I was there. I sent him a LinkedIn message a few days earlier, stating that I saw he would be in town and expressing my wish to meet with him. We set a time for our meeting, and when I arrived at the conference at that designated time, I met him and left. Mission accomplished — and it was short, precise and time well spent.


Before going to a conference, check if the topic, speakers and type of participants are people in your industry whom you wish to get to know. Then try to find out who will be there and set a goal of at least two people you must meet at the conference. Make sure you do what is needed to meet them and ensure you won't leave the room before you do so. Then, by the time you leave the conference, it should feel like time well spent. Don't forget to follow up after and continue the conversation with those you met.Related: The 10 Commandments of Networking3. Create your ""events squad""Usually at conferences, we may know some people from the past, meet new people and even attend with another ""wingman/woman."" To meet the people you wish to get to know, you need to be everywhere and see everything. But how? By creating your own ""event's squad"" that will increase the chances of getting connected to the right people.You can do it with a bit of planning, a lot of goodwill and two stages. It goes like this:


Stage 1: Every person you meet, whether a new acquaintance or an old friend, at some point in the conversation, ask them: ""Who are you interested in meeting at this conference? I might see/know them and can introduce you two.""Stage 2: Then, they may ask you the same question. If not, just say: ""By the way, I'm looking to connect with people in [sector] if you come across anyone please introduce us."" They usually will say ""Yes, sure!""Now what? If you get to meet someone they're looking to meet as well, please introduce them during the event or after. Some of them will do the same for you, and this way, you build a team that thinks of your needs — just as you think of theirs — and increase your chances for relevant introductions during and after the conference. That's actually what networking is all about: a mutually beneficial relationship that helps each side grow.Related: How to Network For Those Who Hate to Network


In conclusion, mastering the art of networking at conferences is not only about attending events but strategically planning your moves and setting clear goals. By being proactive, initiating conversations and connecting with others, you can transform networking from a perceived time-waster into a powerful tool for professional growth.Remember: Everyone at the conference, like you, seeks meaningful connections. With a thoughtful approach, you can make your conference experience truly impactful. Embrace these techniques, and may your future conferences be not just events, but stepping stones toward your professional success and company's growth.

While embarking on an entrepreneurial journey in the diverse worlds of finance, commodities and the burgeoning realm of cryptocurrency, I've navigated a spectrum of challenges and breakthroughs. This journey, more than a business venture, has been an odyssey of learning, adapting and overcoming.It's about facing the tidal waves of market volatility, steering through the intricate corridors of compliance, and embracing the unpredictability of global finance. Each chapter of this journey has sculpted my business acumen and enriched my understanding of the delicate interplay between risk management and strategic foresight.Related: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Taking Calculated Risks



Lessons in risk and market dynamicsMy initiation into finance was marked by an ambitious foray into commodities trading. A venture that seemed promising initially taught me a valuable lesson when an unexpected market downturn resulted in significant losses. This experience was my first real brush with the unpredictability of financial markets and the importance of rigorous risk analysis.In contrast, my entry into the cryptocurrency market was driven by intrigue and the allure of a rapidly evolving sector. However, my initial underestimation of the regulatory complexities soon led to a precarious situation that nearly skirted legal boundaries. This experience was a crucial lesson in the importance of compliance, particularly in a domain as nuanced and dynamic as cryptocurrency. It highlighted the need for constant vigilance and adaptation to regulatory changes.

A notable incident involved unraveling a series of complex international transactions that had inadvertently triggered AML alarms. Navigating this labyrinth required meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of AML regulations. The successful resolution of this case not only averted potential legal complications but also underscored the importance of proactive compliance measures.In the banking sector, I faced challenges that tested my strategic and negotiation skills. One particular episode involved securing a substantial loan for an ambitious project. The process was fraught with intricate negotiations and rigorous financial scrutiny. Successfully navigating this process taught me valuable lessons in financial diplomacy and the art of presenting compelling business cases to financial institutions.Another enlightening experience was a venture into a new international market, which, despite comprehensive research and planning, encountered unforeseen regulatory roadblocks. This setback served as a stark reminder of the volatility and unpredictability inherent in global finance. It emphasized the need for agility and the ability to pivot strategies in response to changing market and regulatory landscapes.

Here Are Some Lesser-Known Tactics I Use to Win.Team dynamics, global partnerships and unexpected learningsThe strength of my journey lies in the diverse team I've had the privilege of leading. Comprising legal experts, financial analysts and tech innovators, this team has been the backbone of our success. One instance where this diversity shone was during a high-stakes project with a tight deadline. The team's collaborative effort turned what seemed like an impossible task into a remarkable achievement, reinforcing the power of collective expertise and teamwork.Our global partnerships have been equally instrumental, providing invaluable insights into local markets and cultural nuances. These collaborations have broadened our operational scope and enriched our understanding of global market dynamics. From navigating complex negotiations in the Middle East to adapting business models to Asian markets, these experiences have been integral in shaping a comprehensive global strategy.Conclusion and future prospectsAs I reflect on the rich tapestry of experiences that have defined my journey, I am struck by the resilience, adaptability and continuous evolution that have been its hallmarks. With its myriad challenges, the world of finance and compliance has been an extraordinary teacher. It's not merely about steering through the complexities; it's about extracting valuable lessons from each challenge and transforming these experiences into stepping stones for future growth and success.


Looking forward, the horizon is filled with possibilities and opportunities. The excitement for what lies ahead is more than just anticipation — it's a fervent eagerness to explore uncharted territories, delve into untapped markets, and uncover hidden potentials. Each new venture brings the thrill of discovery and the chance to break new ground.Armed with a wealth of experience, backed by a team of experts whose skills and knowledge span the globe and supported by a network of global partners, I feel well-equipped to tackle the challenges that await. This journey through the evolving landscape of finance and compliance is far from over. In fact, it feels as though it's just beginning.

Networking looks different this year than at any other time in the history of the business universe. We can engage in new business relationships with the push of a button. From joining MeetUps to engaging in social audio to live streaming, we, as entrepreneurs, can build our online reputation with little effort. Networking in 2024 will be efficient and modernized — yet it will remain the same. We must understand where powerful connections lie and how to present ourselves in a digital world.While the platforms differ, connection and engagement are crucial to growing a business. While new tools and technology are being lobbed at us left and right, the truth is the most powerful thing we have as business owners is building relationships that matter.Related: 8 Tips Introverts Need to Start Networking Like a Pro



Building relationships on social mediaI know I may receive kickback for this next comment, but, in my opinion, the past decade has been seeped in a collective attempt to brainwash us. We are fed the notion that social media is the way to make it big in business. Social media is the lowest-hanging fruit for most of our competitors. Social media provides democratized access to potential audiences. The problem is that you have to pay to play in most situations. These platforms' algorithms do not allow average businesses to get in front of their desired avatar unless they invest money.Think about the last time you spent money directly from a post on social media. What were the factors that led you to make the purchase?In most cases, it was because of one of the following factors:You were referred to the product or service,You knew the service provider or product provider personally,You engaged in an impulsive buy,You follow and respect an influencer marketer,You were transfixed by the repetition of paid ads and testimonials.While social media is necessary, it cannot be your only connection to a potential networking opportunity. Social media is a powerful tool to build your overall brand reputation because it offers a high domain authority. However, you do not own any of the content that you post on any of the sites like Instagram, Facebook, X (Twitter), LinkedIn or TikTok. If social media is the cornerstone of your business growth strategy, you must focus on engagement. Without authentic communication and engagement, social media is an exercise in futility.Related: Unlocking the Power of LinkedIn: How Entrepreneurs Can Leverage the Platform for Growth and SuccessThe networking pitchDo you know how to articulate your brand, product or service in two sentences? Would the sharks on Shark Tank invest millions of dollars in your idea? Before you walk into any networking space, be confident you can answer this question, ""What do you do?"" This open-ended question is the typical icebreaker in any networking situation. If you cannot answer this question, ask yourself this:


What product or service do you offer?How are you different than anyone else?What problem do you solve?Networking is a personal exercise in sharing your stories and ideas and active listening with a dash of vulnerability. There is nothing as offputting as someone who walks into a room, pitches their brand, and is on to the next person. The opposite approach, which offers value at a networking event, can create more business opportunities. When we expect immediate returns in a networking conversation, our expectations will not be met.In 2024, digital networking will be essential to any networking strategy. Your best qualities must be transmuted on video, and you confidently present yourself. Optics are everything. Understand that your body language is everything. Arms crossed, it suggests that you are closed off to ideas. Eyes looking left and downward suggest you are sharing untruths.Related: How to Tell If Someone Is Manipulating You Based on Their Body LanguageMy go-to platform for online networking is MeetUp. Meet-ups have been around for a long time, and many businesses have been built on the power of consistent, interactive meetings. Chirs Krimitsos, the founder of Podfest, a conference for Podcasters, began his business at a local Denny's in Florida. He met with podcast enthusiasts on a regular basis, and now his business and conference are two of the largest in the country. The one thing I love about holding MeetUp is that the platform does all the marketing for me. When I schedule a meeting, the MeetUp platform algorithms promote my events and send participants my way.


Live networkingThe power of live networking events is super powerful. The post-pandemic has left a large section of business people hungry for more face-to-face interaction. This year, I scoured the internet for conferences in which I could create powerful connections. VeeCon, the annual conference hosted by Gary Vaynerchuk, was oozing with entrepreneurs and creatives who were hungry for the handshake. I left that conference with a dozen powerful connections that grew into collaborations and partnerships.Carve out a budget to attend a live conference in 2024. Or better yet, start your live networking event. You can network wherever you go. The library is a great place to offer value or start your own networking event. Create your own live MeetUp, and find a local venue to meet and greet. The options are endless — and the rewards are exponential.

28,7 Things That Set Angel Investors Apart From Other Early-Stage Investors,"Dec 28, 2023",Allison Murn,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/7-things-that-set-angel-investors-apart-from-other/466033,"
I have had the honor of working with New York Angels for the past year, and I honestly didn't know much about angel investing prior. I had helped sell Cameron's Coffee to private equity, so I was familiar with that process and I read a lot about VCs, but angel investing was foreign to me. I added New York Angels to my consulting portfolio as another client, but I had no idea what it would be like. Admittedly, I historically grouped all investors into the same bucket, and I didn't understand the differences between each stage of funding.But like any other role I've had, I spent the first 90 days learning as much as I could. I read Angel Investing: The Gust Guide to Making Money and Having Fun Investing in Startups and What Every Angel Investor Wants You to Know. I sat in on as many meetings as possible with members and founders. Over the last year, I connected with more than 100 angel investors and founders, and I learned how significantly different angel investing is from other early-stage investments.Related: 7 Important Differences Between Angels and VCs You Need to Understand



1. Angels invest for the exitMost angels are looking for startups with exit potential, not just a stake in a high-profit, high-revenue business. Consequently, angels will tell you if you will be more successful as a lifestyle business vs. one working towards an exit. Also, founders often start their businesses because they don't want to answer to someone else. Angels will be the first to say that if you don't want to answer to someone else, don't fundraise (since you will be answering to them as shareholders).That being said, angels usually will not interfere unless you want them to, but angels do expect an exit. If an exit is not likely possible, angels will guide you to consider continuing to fund your company yourself. Sometimes bootstrapping is the best idea; just ask Sir James Dyson and his £6.5 billion later.


2. Valuations can make or break a deal for angelsAngels are very sensitive to valuation because as many companies fail, angels need successful investments to produce 20x. Valuations can be extremely difficult to determine for early-stage companies because oftentimes there are no real benchmarks. Inevitably, the founder believes the company has a higher valuation, while investors will negotiate for a lower one.The reality is whatever the valuation is, it must align with the company's traction for founders and investors to agree and close the deal. Bigger also isn't always better — a smaller valuation with a higher likelihood for a 10x multiple at exit is much better for all parties than a larger valuation with a minimal multiple or a lower likelihood of exit.3. Angels hope for unicorns, but they don't start out looking for themFrom the outside, we often hear about the unicorns, but realistically, that's not what angels look for when they invest. No one actually knows which company will become a unicorn. Most angels manage a diverse portfolio and invest in startups that have proven some sort of traction to greatly reduce their failure rate. Unicorns are called unicorns because they rarely happen. When they do, it has a lot to do with luck.Related: 6 Ways Angels and VCs Think Differently


4. Angels are incentivized to help their founders be successfulAngels not only want you to succeed, but they relish being in the trenches with you (if you want them to) to help you succeed. Angels will often make themselves available to talk through issues 24/7, while others will serve on the board, sharing their advice, experiences and contacts. They can also be most helpful to founders through tough times because angels have seen permutations of the same issues across other companies in their portfolio or they have experienced these issues themselves in their personal ventures.5. Angels invest for the payout result, but they often most enjoy the mentoring along the wayAlmost every company goes through a major pivot at some point. When angels invest, they don't know exactly what the company will become, but they do know the founder they are investing in (leading to the adage of investing in the jockey as opposed to the horse). Angels want to like the founder, and they want to work with them.Mentoring is almost like a continuation of their own careers, as many angels have made their money by being successful founders themselves, like Marc Andreessen, the top angel investor, who founded Netscape, which was bought by AOL in 1998. In the final analysis though, if an angel can't envision the reasonable possibility of a significant return, they won't invest.6. Angels are not playing with someone else's moneyWhen angels write a check, it's their own money. They weren't hired as part of an investment firm to use the firm's money — every penny is their own. Angels also hope that when they do invest, founders treat it like their own money, too.


Related: How to Fund Your Business With Angel Investors7. Angels look for diversity in founders but those who share similar valuesInvestors look for founders with a diversity of backgrounds because that leads to diversity in thinking and ideas. The angels who I have met are humble yet confident, hardworking, smart as hell and adaptable — all things that they similarly value in founders. Angels also are incredibly positive yet realistic, which is what founders need to be throughout the ups and downs of their business.After talking with many founders who have exited or raised their next series, they often say they are so thankful for their angel investors. Angels gave them the first shot, frequently when no one else would.Google recently celebrated its 25th birthday. In 1998, four angels (Andreas von Bechtolsheim, Kavitark Ram Shriram, David R. Cheriton and Jeffrey Bezos) invested in this early-stage startup that is now the eighth-largest company in the country. Google wouldn't be Google today without angel investment. All in all, the most important takeaway that I've had from watching angels, is that angels are not just investors — they can be real-life angels.

Every day, dozens of startups go through the Vibranium.VC funnel; some don't pass the first scoring, while others move to the next stage towards potential investment. Drawing from my entrepreneurial background, I can confidently say that advice I received in the past from professionals in specific fields helped me be well-prepared and aware of the nuances that come along with the entrepreneurial journey.Advice for startup founders is crucial at the beginning of their journey as it provides invaluable insights and guidance from experienced individuals who have navigated similar paths. This advice can help founders avoid common pitfalls, refine their strategies, and make informed decisions, ultimately increasing their chances of success. The early-stage startup founders are often filled with uncertainties, and seeking advice from business role models can offer clarity and direction to set a solid foundation for the entrepreneurial journey.Related: Why Investors With an Entrepreneurial Past Are Crucial to Startup Success



Secure your runwayBegin your search for investments at least six months before your funds run out, ensuring your runway remains at 6-8 months. If you are raising seed, anticipate that this funding will sustain your runway for two years. Approximately a year or 1,5 years, you can move towards the Series A fundraising process. This timeline implies that you should attain Series A metrics within one and a half years, providing a six-month buffer while concluding the round with the next-level investors.Series A financing refers to an investment in a startup after it has shown progress in building its business model and demonstrates the potential to grow and generate revenue. It often refers to the first round of venture money a firm raises after seed round and angel investors.


A healthy runway, representing the number of months a startup can operate before running out of cash, demonstrates financial stability and responsible financial management. Investors are more likely to be interested in companies that clearly understand their financial standing and can sustain operations over the mid to long term.A longer runway enhances your negotiating position: It reduces the urgency for immediate funding, giving the startup more negotiating power when discussing valuation, terms, and other aspects of the investment deal. This can result in more favorable terms for the startup.Additionally, a sufficient runway provides the startup with ample time during fundraising. This time is essential for due diligence procedures, negotiations, and other steps involved in securing investment. It allows both the startup and investors to thoroughly evaluate the opportunity without the pressure of an imminent cash shortage.Be prepared for a lengthy fundraising processAs you initiate active fundraising, the second point is to prepare for an extended fundraising process from 3 to 6 months at best (sometimes even more). This is particularly crucial in the early stages, considering all due diligence procedures, negotiation processes, and other factors. The size of the funding round can influence the timeline: larger funding rounds often involve more extensive due diligence, negotiations, and legal processes, potentially extending the duration. For example, one of our longer deals took almost five months, while the shortest one was sealed after one month.


Negotiating the terms of the investment, including valuation and other deal terms, can take time. The back-and-forth negotiations between the startup and investors contribute to the overall duration. And don't forget about legal processes: finalizing legal agreements and paperwork can add time to the timeline.Related: 3 Alternatives to Venture Capital Funding for StartupsCreate a database of investorsBuild a database of 100 or more warm contacts with investors. Initiate conversations with them and strive to convert these interactions into closed deals. Have as many contacts as necessary to achieve the crucial milestones for the next round.Having a database of investors is a strategic asset for startups. It streamlines communication, facilitates relationship-building, and allows startups to make informed decisions throughout the fundraising process and beyond.


The database is also crucial when it comes to your pitch. By understanding different investors' preferences and investment histories, startups can tailor their pitches more effectively. This personalized approach increases the likelihood of capturing investor interest and aligning with their investment thesis.Related: Why Strategic Venture Capital is Thriving in a Founder's MarketTransparency is everythingBe transparent, avoid fabrications, and don't lie. We all know ""Fake it till you make it "" cases, which have made investors more cautious about startups. Transparency is a way for startups to demonstrate accountability and lower the risk of investment for VCs. By providing clear and accurate information, startups show they take responsibility for their actions and decisions, reinforcing a sense of trust. Be truthful because, trust me, distorted information will surface during the Due Diligence process and can become a deal breaker. This could lead to losing investors, and more importantly, it will discourage them from engaging with you.Always remember that transparency is not just about sharing information; it's about fostering a culture of openness, trust, and accountability.

31,Secure Your Funding — How Small Business Owners Can Level Up Their Negotiation Tactics With Venture Capitalists,"Dec 21, 2023",Avi Weisfogel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-small-business-owners-can-level-up-their-negotiation/465466,"
When small business owners are looking to secure investment from venture capitalists (VCs), they have to understand the accurate valuation of their business before they enter into negotiations. Otherwise, they end up asking for too much, and investors won't buy in, or they give away too much as a concession for getting financial backing. You don't need to let either of those unfortunate scenarios happen to you.Instead of guessing and hoping, you must be prepared to negotiate based on honest and accurate information. Even if your business is very small or you're new to the business world, you don't need to be intimidated when working with venture capitalists. Understanding your company's strengths and knowing how to address its weaknesses can take you a long way toward success.Choosing the right venture capital opportunitiesOne important negotiating tip is to make sure you're choosing negotiations with the right people. In other words, be selective about your opportunities. You don't want to send a mass email to many VCs, hoping someone will take interest. If you do that and get replies, it could be that they're trying to take advantage and think that you're desperate. Instead, target only a handful of venture capitalists who are a good fit for your needs and have helped companies like yours before.



Study your options for venture capital and the people who typically support businesses like yours. Look for VCs who work within your industry or who are focused on helping small businesses that are similar in size to what you have. When you find the right people, negotiating with them becomes much easier because you understand one another and have more common interests and goals. Then, you can both see the value of working with one another.Related: 8 Key Factors VCs Consider When Evaluating Startup Opportunities


Options for venture capital you should considerIt's essential to consider more than one option or offer if you can. It's not just the VCs you work with that matters, but also what they give you. Getting additional money to grow your business is essential, but there are other aspects of business development. There are many different ways that a venture capitalist could bring further and ongoing value to your company.If there are other areas where your business needs support, don't be afraid to ask. Some VCs may have connections, offer mentorship or provide additional value beyond cash. Consider these options and if they can help your business succeed. If they're better than an influx of money only, they might be suitable for your needs. Ideally, you can get cash and other perks, but that depends on the person you're working with and what they're willing to offer.Focus on post-investment processesBefore making any deal for venture capital, make sure you're clear on the decision-making processes that will occur post-investment and what level of control you'll retain. In other words, you only want to agree to work with a VC that will buy your business out and take it over if that's what you're specifically looking for. Getting your questions answered in this area is extremely important.You should negotiate this area carefully because too many small business owners get caught up in the idea of earning money to help their business, and they agree to conditions that only benefit them in the short run. Some need to read the contract carefully, or they aren't willing to ask for more because they fear losing what's offered. That is your business, so make sure you know what trade-offs you're agreeing to.


Remember that value-add is part of the equationWhile the financial backing venture capitalists can bring is highly important, there is a value-added beyond that capital. Working with the right venture capitalists brings you additional opportunities that could be even more significant than the money they'll invest.

32,4 Fundamental Mistakes in Fundraising That Startup Founders Can't Afford,"Dec 19, 2023",Greg Waisman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-mistakes-in-fundraising-that-startup-founders-cant-afford/465808,"
The vast majority of startups come up against the issue of conducting a fundraising round at least once in their existence. It is a complex process that requires thorough preparation on multiple levels. In addition to ensuring your products and services are up to snuff, the team members and founders must also be prepared to be examined up close by potential investors.The inability to raise funds is often cited as one of the primary reasons why about 90% of startups tend to fail. If the founders do not have a proper communication strategy and social capital to reach their investors, the business risks adding to this figure.As a founder who has led my company through several funding rounds during different market conditions, I decided to highlight a number of mistakes that business leaders often make when preparing for a Series A round. Here are the main points to take note of.



1. Not having your budgeting in orderWhen you plan to conduct a round, it generally means that you already have a pre-prepared list of potential investors you are communicating with. As a founder, it falls to you to explain to them how much money you need from them, for what purposes, and over what period of time.Investors need to clearly understand when they can expect returns from the funds they put into a business. Having a detailed picture of how their money is going to be put to use will go a long way in assuring them of your company's stability in the long term.


On the other hand, it would be bad for you to show uncertainty over how much money your project needs for further development. This lends credit to the idea that you do not have a good grasp of financial planning and don't have your fundraising round adequately thought out. Such a stance will not inspire confidence in investors.If you need $10 million (as an example), then ask for $10 million and give a satisfactory explanation of why it must be so. Provide detailed data and projected growth patterns when possible. If you have previous results to fall on, all the better – by demonstrating evident traction, you can fit within the schedule you set for yourself.Related: 4 Marketing Budget Hacks That Will Boost Your Business in 20242. Being overly eager or leaning too much on just one investorWhen you consider potential investors for a round, you have to make sure to diversify your options. You should never go after just one or two of the most promising candidates while ignoring others. Relying solely on a handful of options can expose your company to unnecessary risks if those parties fail to come through on a deal. On the other hand, approaching a broader spectrum of investors can fortify your financial foundation and improve the chances of securing the funding you need.


Another thing to consider is that you should not be too eager in your negotiations. It risks giving the impression that your business is struggling and the round is something you went for to stay afloat rather than as a plan to ensure further growth.All your negotiations should be planned and measured. The investors that come to you must be put on a waiting list, with your meetings agreed on in advance over a certain span of time prior to the round. The time your investors spend waiting can be used to show them your data room and give them a chance to familiarize themselves with your business and its metrics.Related: 8 Things Your Pitch Deck Needs If You Want Investment in Your Company3. Choosing investors that do not match your productTo get people to invest in your company, you need to be sure that your product is something that they have an interest in and that they can see its potential for growth in the market of your choosing. Past surveys found that a great deal of startups (over 40%) fail because the market doesn't need their product.


This is why it is paramount to have a thorough understanding of your product-market fit and what investors operate in the sector that you chose to involve yourself in. You need to know who your clients are and what value you can offer them.If you pitch your company to investors randomly, chances are you won't find anyone willing to take part in your round. Take the time to study the known investors in your sector and their portfolios. Determine if you fit with the type of companies they typically invest in, and when you seek them out, emphasize how investing in you could be a good fit for their interests.4. Not preparing a selling pitchAs I mentioned before, negotiations ultimately fall to company leadership. As the founder, you are responsible for your company's idea and driving it forward. As such, investors will first be interested in talking to you when assessing whether your business is worth putting their money into.Going into the negotiations half-cocked is liable to result in failure. You must prepare to present your company in a way that emphasizes all of your strong points. Not only that, but you must also take the time to think of any and every uncomfortable question that investors would be likely to ask and plan how to work around them.


It will be a challenge of both hard data and your personal charisma. You need to make investors believe in you and your vision. Only then will they feel confident about entrusting you with their money.Bottom line: forewarned is forearmedPreparing for and conducting a fundraising round is always a time-consuming and nerve-wracking task that requires full participation and control from the founders. You have to find the right investors for you, convince them of the sustainability of your business model, and win them over enough to negotiate favorable terms.Many factors can affect the outcome of negotiations, but avoiding the main outliers we covered in this material would raise your chances of success considerably.

33,8 Things Your Pitch Deck Needs If You Want Investment in Your Company,"Dec 12, 2023",Alexander Galitsky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/8-things-your-pitch-deck-needs/466034,"
When entrepreneurs try to shore up funding and management for their ventures, they often summarize their business strategies in an abbreviated presentation document called a pitch deck. A pitch deck is typically utilized in meetings with clients, partners and co-founders and when presenting to investors.There are two things to remember when creating a pitch deck to attract and interest potential funders. Your pitch deck's visual appeal (including the text length of each slide) is the first element. The second element is the actual content of your pitch deck, which is critical and challenging to create.Related: Successful Fundraising Begins With a Stellar Pitch Deck



1. Vision statement and value propositionWhether they're on the same slide or are presented separately, each of these needs to be one short sentence or statement. These statements will show prospective investors what your firm does and the value it can bring to consumers. It's a general rule that these statements must be both clever and concise.Related: How to Think Like an Investor When Preparing Your Pitch Deck


2. Problem statementIf your company isn't addressing a compelling, pressing problem, something's wrong. Explain the issue your company is managing and who this issue affects (i.e., your target market). When describing the case, it's essential to tell a story that prospective investors can identify with. This will aid in conveying the nature and purpose of your company.3. Target audience and market opportunityYou can use this section to elaborate on your target market and the size of your estimated customer base. Explain to potential investors how big the market is and where you want to position your company.Collect as much data as possible on existing market purchases to give investors an accurate market size. If necessary, split your market into segments.While you might be tempted to define your target market as extremely broad, you should show investors you have a particular and addressable market. Doing so will add credibility to your presentation.


4. Product — Show the solutionAt last, you can describe the product or service you're bringing to the market. Explain to potential customers who use your product or service how it solves the issues you highlighted in the second section above.Describing your business here builds up the problem and allows you to define how acute or painful it is for your target market. Then, you can tell how your product or service can come to the rescue to solve (or help solve) the problem.Whenever possible, use pictures and stories to describe your solution. Showing is almost always better than telling.Related: Pitching Investors With Customer Motivations Won't Work


5. Business model or revenue modelAfter introducing your product or service, you should discuss its potential advantages and benefits. Some ventures rely on advertising revenue rather than consumer purchases to cover their business overhead and profit. Therefore, make sure you provide some explanation of the financial mechanics here.6. Sales and marketing approachHow will you advertise your company and attract new customers? Use this section to show investors how you intend to promote and sell your product or service. Ensure you include all the advertising and sales methods used to introduce and demonstrate your wares to consumers. You should also emphasize your unique selling points (USPs) here if you have any.Related: How to Sell Your Story Through Your Pitch Deck7. The moneyInvestors need to see sales, profits, and cash flow projections for at least three years. Use charts to display sales, estimated customer numbers, expenditure summaries, and profit projections rather than detailed, difficult-to-read spreadsheets.


Get ready to talk about the primary expense drivers and the assumptions you used to arrive at your sales projections. Keep in mind that your financial forecasts should be logical and reasonable.8. TeamPresent the team you intend to use for your venture, along with their background, qualifications and anything special they bring to the table that would make them especially suitable for their roles. A solid team will enhance your chances of success and give your company much-needed credibility.Additional considerationsEven though the elements above are crucial, a ""competition"" section is also recommended for a successful pitch deck in most cases. In this section, justify your place in the market and explain how your business can stand out from the rest of the options that will be there. Focus on the USPs that set your company apart from competitors.A ""Investment and the Use of Funds"" section can also be included. In this section, you should tell prospective backers how much money you need and why. Describe precisely how their investment will be used. Investors want to know where their money is going and how it will further your company's mission.

Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch is the show where contestants get into an elevator and have just 60 seconds to pitch their business to our board of investors. In this ongoing article series, we're celebrating the entrepreneurs who walked out with a win and sharing their tips for pitching success. (Answers have been edited for length.)K. Rocco Shields is the founder of the AI-powered learning platform Genius Academy. She walked into the elevator with a knockout pitch and went home with a $75K investment at a $10 million valuation from Marc Randolph, co-founder of Netflix. Watch her pitch below, then read on to learn how her pitching strategy paid off.How did you prepare for the show?



We used our technology to create our very own pitch simulator. Our development team started by watching every episode of the show and breaking down the components of not only the successful pitches but also the ones that failed. We took all that data and fed it into our system and created a step-by-step, 7-point breakdown of how to create the perfect 60-second pitch. Next, we built our own version of the elevator complete with a big clock counting down to scare me and keep me on my toes. But we didn't stop there. We had also profiled Kim and Marc during our analysis of the show so we had a list of the types of questions they asked on the show, their personality traits, their tips to the audience, as well as likes and dislikes they expressed about pitches. We fed all that data into our system and cross-compared it with our product to figure out what questions they might ask. Then I used my internal team members to grill me. (I think that had a little too much fun doing that!) Finally, I was ready to swallow my fear and embark on the actual taping of the show.Related: How to Create a Winning Elevator Pitch for Your AppWhat did you expect was going to happen? 


There's a difference between thinking, knowing and expecting. My team and I game-planned for all kinds of situations. I dreamed that both Kim and Marc would be interested, and in the end, my dream did come true. It was one of the hardest decisions to make, but Marc's expertise made the most sense. It absolutely broke my heart not to take Kim's offer. I'm hoping and praying we can get her involved in our next round. In terms of filming, I have a long career in Hollywood and so I understood how the show might be filmed. I'm never a fan of being on camera, but you gotta face your fears and do what you have to do. The production crew was so professional and courteous and supportive — they understood the pressure contestants are under and I really, really appreciated that.How did the negotiations go? Would you do anything differently?Fascinating. It blew me away when Kim got Marc to up his investment in us. But in retrospect, I would have asked not just for money, but also for their time. To have mentorship from either one of these esteemed investors would be of immense help to Genius Academy and our very, very tall mission. So I wish I asked Marc for an additional 75K worth of his time to match the financial offer Kim made, which was $150K. That would have been sweet. Other than that, I wish I could have been able to accept both of their offers. I know it's not what the show allows, but that would have been amazing.What do you plan to do with your investment?This investment adds to our esteemed group of other investors in our current round to turbocharge our marketing. Currently, we've been growing only through word-of-mouth marketing, and this will allow us to scale up by bringing on a marketing and sales team. Our goal is to get our curriculum into every mental health program across the US. Once instructors and decision-makers try out our technology, they're hooked. We're on fire but we need this money to keep up with the current demand and add to it.Related: This 19-Year-Old College Student's Invention Relieves Migraines -- and His Pitch Landed a $10,000 InvestmentWhat did it mean to you personally to get in the doors and walk out with a win?


There's a grave responsibility on my shoulders. Although I was the only person to appear on the show to represent Genius Academy, I'm not alone. I've got an amazing team. They're not just employees, they're more like staff partners. And there are investors who believe in the mission of Genius Academy. I was worried that my fear of being in front of the camera might let down the whole team, but fortunately, we prevailed. I say ""we"" because this was very much a team effort. I was recently listening to a podcast featuring one of my idols, Abby Wambach. She said her daughter was watching her old games and asked why she pointed to the team member who had passed her the ball after she scored. She said everyone looks at the person who scored the goal, but not at the person who made it possible. So she points them out to the crowd. So even though I was the one on the show, I couldn't have succeeded without my team who lined up my pitch. When the team wins I win, and that's what makes this so personally rewarding.What is your advice for anyone thinking of applying to be on a future episode?Prepare, prepare, and then prepare some more. And most importantly, use your team. We're all very busy working in a start-up, putting out multiple fires. But, take the time to involve everyone. You have them on your team for a reason.

Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch is the show where contestants get into an elevator and have just 60 seconds to pitch their business to our board of investors. In this ongoing article series, we're celebrating the entrepreneurs who walked out with a win and sharing their tips for pitching success.This week, we spoke with Zach Barney, the founder of Mobly, a mobile sales tool that quickly scans and enriches leads, records contacts, and logs activity directly into your MAP or CRM. Barney landed a $50K investment and mentorship from Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph. Here's how he planned and executed his winning pitch.Watch Zach's Pitch How did you prepare for the show?Funny enough, two days before the show, I was in a different pitch competition (we won!), but that one was a 90-second pitch. So for two days before the recording, I was focused on trimming out a third of my pitch to make it fit. I probably rehearsed it 200 times!How did it go? What was different from your expectations?I tried not to overhype things because you never know what will happen in an environment like this. Maybe our problem/solution isn't interesting to the investors. Maybe I get stage fright and forget everything. So many things can go wrong, so I didn't tell too many people about it ahead of time. That being said, I hoped for the best, hence the 200 times rehearsing my pitch!Why do you think they opened the doors? I'm a sales guy by trade. One of the core rules of sales is that it isn't about you or the product — it's about solving a problem for the user. I made the bulk of the pitch focused on how painful this problem is that we solve, and then I made sure to be crystal clear on the ask and the traction. I watched a dozen or so episodes in the past and always cringed when the investors deliberated on whether they even wanted to hear more because those critical items were missing.



Related: Watch All Seasons of Elevator Pitch — FreeHow did the negotiations go? Would you do anything differently? Negotiations went well. I was really hoping Marc would make us an offer because his background fits in great with the type of person we want to work with. I'd obviously have been thrilled to work with the other investors, Kim Perell or Pinky Cole, but I knew Marc's experience aligned with what we wanted. I was excited to get an offer from Pinky but knew I had to reject it pretty quickly because we already had 10+ angel investors before the show I had to do right by. It wouldn't have been fair to them to give Pinky 4X the equity for the same dollar investment, even if she is a big name that brings a lot to the table. So when Marc offered money at the exact valuation we asked for, I had to take the deal, even if it was half the money Pinky offered.What do you plan to do with your investment? It's going to serve as a bridge for us to continue to meet payroll as we go to market for a priced seed round. We've got some amazing traction and hit every metric I told the investors I'd hit, so we've got a great story to tell. Those things take time, though, and another $50k in the bank extends our runway as we raise the seed round.What did it mean to you personally to get in the doors and walk out with a win? It served as a lot of validation for me that I'm building something other people value.What is your advice for anyone thinking of applying to be on a future episode? Don't fake anything. The investors are rock stars and they're brilliant.Watch a lot of prior episodes and get a feel for what gets a deal vs. what does not.Practice way more than you think you need to. Even though I was incredibly rehearsed, my mind went blank 30 seconds before recording. Thank goodness it came back to me due to sheer muscle memory!

You are selling a feeling.Most people don't realize the underlying reason why they buy the products that they do. Meanwhile, most sellers don't recognize what they are selling.



Clothes make you feel confident.A Lamborghini makes you feel successful.An alarm system makes you feel safe.Makeup makes you feel beautiful.It's not the product that was bought — it was the feeling it provided.One day, I was in Las Vegas in a meeting with Pitbull and his team, telling him why he should invest in my company. During the meeting, he jokingly made a comment to the room.


""Clinton can sell water to a drowning man.""Everyone in the room laughed.Most people would receive this comment as a compliment — recognizing a good salesman's strength and ability to sell anything to anyone. And that's exactly what Pitbull meant by it. However, even though I know he was being playful, I don't see his comment as something someone should take pride in.


Image credit: Clinton SparksTo sell water to a drowning man would mean I'm trying to sell something to someone who has no use for what I have to offer. When trying to sell something, it's easy to get caught up in convincing someone that your product is worthwhile, when instead you need to convince them it will fill an emotional void.The key to selling anything to anyone is to fully understand how your product makes your customers feel. How does your product provide them value? How does it impact their status, problems or situation? It requires helping others see the value in opportunities they may not see for themselves. But, to do that, you have to understand what they need to feel.Clinton Sparks is an Entrepreneur+ contributor.

This is a selfish approach in personal and business relationships that won't yield you the results you're looking for.How do you know if what you have to offer is valuable to others?In my career, I've had to raise capital for a company, persuade famous artists to participate on my records, and get others to join in my new ideas. I've consistently achieved my desired outcome by applying the same process:1. Understand what they've done or missed out on in the past. I made a record called Gold Rush that features artists Macklemore and 2 Chainz. Being aware of what these artists have done in the past allowed me to bring 2 Chainz into a sound that wasn't traditional for him and that he wanted to participate in. It also allowed me to bring a collaboration to Macklemore that, at the time, he hadn't had because most major hip-hop artists were not up on his music. The result was a successful record that included Tommy Lee and Tyrese in the music video.


2. Recognize what matters to them right now. One time, I texted Diddy about a company I was working on. I went into sales mode and sent him a pressure text warning him about missing out on a massive opportunity if we didn't meet about my company.Thirty minutes later, I realized it was the day his new album was released.He doesn't care about my company that day. He's focused on what matters to him. Not only was it bad timing, but it was inconsiderate, and it appeared that I didn't care about his album, priorities or objectives.It seemed that I only cared about mine. Imagine how that would make someone feel. You must take the time to understand the other party's current needs and situation.


3. Look at what your customers or clients are trying to achieve next. When I was VP of business development at Faze Clan, an esports and entertainment organization, I brought in hip-hop artist Offset as an investor.I knew he was a gamer who wanted to be more involved in the space, become a leader in this growing industry, and position himself as an accomplished executive and investor. Understanding this allowed me to architect a path to accomplish all these things when getting him to invest and join our company.Related: Is FaZe Rug the Willy Wonka of Gen Z?


The company got a new investor and celebrity member. Offset joining Faze Clan became 40% of all media coverage for the company that year, garnering immense credibility in the industry as one of the first to make a serious investment in the space.I earned Offset's trust, which led to a friendship and more business opportunities. That's a win-win-win.To create a sustainable and equally beneficial business relationship, you must care about others' needs, objectives, concerns, vulnerabilities, pain points and past experiences — all of these are feelings.Think about when someone tries to sell you. What bothered you? What annoyed you, or what got you to give in? Perhaps you said yes to a kid selling cookies out of guilt. When you buy the cookies from them, it relinquishes that feeling of guilt. You bought a better feeling.


My entire career is based on a few principles, which are:Be kindOver deliverOnly ask for something if I see both parties mutually benefitingAll of these provide a feeling.These are some of the principles I live by that have allowed me to enjoy continued success and long-lasting relationships.So, if you find yourself selling water to a drowning man to gain personal benefit and feel awesome because you convinced someone to buy something that doesn't have value for them, that's not being a great salesman. That's being a con artist.


Because just like in a relationship, they'll realize you only care about yourself, or the sale — and your success won't last.When selling, you must always remember that you never sell a product or a service. You are — and will always be — selling a feeling. You can sell almost anything to anyone when you understand what others need to feel.Want to see more from Clinton Sparks?

41,Serial Entrepreneur Turned VC Reveals 4 Numbers You Need to Know to Scale Your Company,"Dec 1, 2023",Donna Harris,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/serial-entrepreneur-turned-vc-reveals-4-numbers-you-need-to/463470,"
As a serial successful entrepreneur turned angel investor and venture capitalist and one of the top female seed-stage investors in the world, I see dozens of pitches from entrepreneurs every single day – some through the form on our company site, others in email and loads of them via LinkedIn. Often, though, entrepreneurs reach out to me for advice rather than funding. As a former entrepreneur who once struggled to raise capital myself, I'm sympathetic to their pleas for help.One of those requests came from Emma. Her passion for her stationery business was undeniable. She'd spent years perfecting her craft and had a small but fiercely loyal following of customers who adored her exquisite, custom-made stationery. Now, she was ready to take her business to the next level and sought funding from venture capitalists to scale it up.Unfortunately, her fundraising efforts were a complete disaster, with investor after investor turning her down. Discouraged, she reached out to me for assistance.



I had Emma send me her pitch deck, and the problem was immediately clear. She had a good vision but lacked an understanding of what investors look for. Her deck and pitch didn't align with what investors needed to see, overlooking four key numbers – I call them BFHL – that are most fundamental to scale.B. Big market numbers The foundation of any scalable business is the market it serves. For investors, the bigger the better. To understand why, it's essential to understand VC math.


Assume my fund invests in 15 companies. Ten of them will fail, and I'll lose my money. Three or four will do okay – I'll get my money back or make a bit (1 to 5 times my money). That means the remaining one or two companies need to generate enough returns to make up for everything else (i.e., 100 times my money). Otherwise, my fund won't do better than other far less risky things my investors could have put their money into.VCs look at every company through this homerun lens. What is the maximum revenue your business could generate if it captured 100% of the available market (Total Addressable Market, or TAM)? While no business can realistically achieve that, TAM provides a sense of the market's overall size.For some industries, a market size in the billions of dollars might be considered large. In others, it could be in the trillions. Either way, a substantial market size offers massive potential for growth and a high ceiling for revenue and profitability.Related article: What Nobody Tells You About Taking VC Money


F. Fast growth rateThe market's growth rate is also vital. VCs favor rapidly expanding markets because they enable a company to scale more quickly.Again, let's turn to VC math to understand why rapid growth is crucial. Remember, VCs back the most risky companies (startups are unproven; most of them fail), so they and their investors expect extremely high returns. VC funds are also time-bound. They have eight to ten years to scout for startups, make their bets, help portfolio companies grow and achieve ""exits"" to get their returns. As a result, they want to know:How quickly can your business grow? How long until you can sell your company or take it public so they can sell their shares and get a return?How big can your company get? How much could it be worth (""valuation"") at the point they sell our shares?To deliver homerun-level returns, you need to grow from a startup to $100 to 500 million in revenue in the five to eight years your investor has left in its fund life. Why? We determine what a company is worth based on ""multiples of revenue."" On the high end, SaaS companies can be valued at ten times or more of revenues. E-commerce firms come in around 2 to 3 times. Others can be as low as 1 to 2 times. So, to build a company that is a ""unicorn"" ($1 billion valuation), you need to quickly grow enough to generate $100 million to $500 million in revenue. Growing that big is hard to do, and do quickly, in a stagnant, crowded market.Related article: 4 Crucial Indicators To Know Before Seeking Venture Capital Funding


H. High revenue numbers from each customerVCs want businesses that can generate high levels of revenue from each customer — from the initial sale and subsequent purchases, upsells, cross-sales, and retention (aka, keeping them for the long term). This is called the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a customer, and it's a critical indicator of scalability.Investors prefer businesses with recurring revenue over those relying on one-time purchases because they provide predictable and continuous streams of income. Sell once; earn revenue indefinitely. Even better if that recurring revenue grows through upsells and new offerings. Better still if customers become advocates and bring in more new customers. It's all about demonstrating to investors that your business is a revenue growth machine.Relevant article: 8 Things You Need to Know About Raising Venture CapitalL. Low cost to get customers signed upVCs also prefer businesses that can find, sell to and secure customers efficiently. This includes your marketing and sales tactics (and budget) and the rate at which you convert prospects into paying customers. A low cost of acquiring a customer (CAC) means your business is efficient, which is vital for scalability.


CAC is also a critical metric because it directly affects a company's profitability. VCs favor businesses that can scale their customer acquisition efforts without proportionally increasing their costs. And a scalable customer acquisition strategy is crucial for achieving rapid growth.So, where did that leave Emma? After our talk, she could see how essential it was to have a business (and a deck) that aligns with investor preferences:A massive market with high growth rates and an open landscape to disrupt and capture market share.Subscription models and recurring revenue streams that increase over time, with customers that drive virality.And a combination of high customer lifetime value and low customer acquisition cost ensures that the business can grow quickly and efficiently without eroding profits.The BFHL framework gave her what she needed to rethink her pitch and her approach to growing her business. Whether you're an entrepreneur like Emma trying to attract investment or you're simply seeking to scale your business, these four key numbers — market size and growth rate, lifetime value and cost of acquisition — should be your guiding lights. By focusing on these crucial metrics, you can set your business on a path to scalable success. Understanding these numbers and optimizing them is the key to unlocking the full potential of your venture.

42,Would You Give This Former Hacker Your Money?,"Nov 29, 2023",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/would-you-give-this-former-hacker-your-money/464991,"

43,An Entrepreneur's Blueprint for Crafting a Pitch Deck That Wows Investors,"Nov 28, 2023",Pritom Das,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/craft-a-winning-pitch-deck-that-wows-investors/463629,"
It takes both art and science to create a pitch deck that will result in funding. You must be able to express the idea for your company clearly and concisely while simultaneously appealing to the sensibilities of potential investors. The average time spent by investors studying decks is approximately three minutes and forty-four seconds. Therefore, it is pretty essential to create a fantastic first impression in a short amount of time.What investors want in a pitch deckSavvy investors look for certain types of information when evaluating pitch decks. Skipping over or only briefly glossing over these key details can make or break your ability to secure funding. A pitch deck gives potential investors a thorough grasp of your company. Seeking an emotional bond that goes beyond financial gain, they inquire about the goals and objectives of your organization. They require a concise synopsis of the product or service that highlights its special qualities and advantages. A thorough target customer profile that goes beyond demographics to understand their challenges and perspectives is also necessary for investors. They are looking for reliable total addressable market statistics as well as an accurate analysis of the competition environment. It is essential to have a well-considered go-to-market plan backed by specific traction measures. Investors want to see your business plan, financial forecasts, goals for fundraising and a profile of your competent staff. Effectively addressing these issues is essential to winning their support for long-term success.Related: 3 Key Things You Need to Know About Financing Your Business



Tips for improving your pitch deckCarefully crafting your pitch deck slides and overall presentation can truly make or break your ability to secure startup funding. Keep these tips in mind:Know your audience


Gaining a deep understanding of your target investors should be a top priority when creating your pitch deck. Avoid the rookie mistake of only including information you personally find interesting or want to share about your company. Be ruthlessly audience-centric in your approach.Do extensive research into your investors' interests, motivations, goals and pain points. Conduct stakeholder interviews and analyze past investments to identify their preferences. Adapt your messaging, design choices and content to closely align with your investors' worldview, not just your own.Speak directly to your investors' needs and concerns. Put yourself in their shoes. Ask yourself, what excites them? What keeps them up at night? What past investments have they made and why? What types of language and messaging appeal to them?Emphasize design


Design choices are critical for an impressive pitch deck. Avoid information overload and leave whitespace for a clean design by prioritizing simplicity and clarity. Begin with a visually appealing presentation template that provides polished and unified graphics that adhere to presentation best practices. Customize these templates to reflect your company's identity. Use high-resolution, relevant visuals and photos, keep the text concise, and keep fonts, colors and styles consistent throughout. For a clean, professional appearance, use readable word sizes, high-contrast color schemes, and strategic alignments. Consider modest movements and transitions for increased impact, but avoid anything distracting or unprofessional.Make the ask clearBeing direct and unambiguous in requesting funding is critical. Don't make investors work to figure out what you actually want from them. Clearly state your need for cash and the amount of money you want to raise right away. Explain how you plan to use the money and how it will help the business grow by doing things like hiring engineers or adding more office space. Link the use of the fund to concrete goals. This will give investors a sense of time. Don't make unrealistic predictions; instead, be honest about your plans and stress the return on investment (ROI) for investors. Avoid using hard-to-understand jargon, and keep your language simple. Also, use graphs and charts to make your ideas easier to understand. Lastly, add ""contingency buffers"" to your conservative projections to show that you can be flexible and build trust.Tell a compelling story


Structure your content strategically to craft an emotive, memorable narrative. Hook investors' attention immediately. Make them care about the problem you're solving. Build intrigue around your company as the hero. Walk investors through your origin story, product innovation, traction and team. Sequence key information and visuals to build momentum, culminating in a call to action to invest.Take your audience on an informative yet entertaining journey, mixing logic and emotion. Outline a vision that inspires investors to join your mission.Related: 7 Questions Every Founder Should Ask Potential InvestorsExude passion


It's crucial to convey genuine excitement and passion for your company's purpose, product and growth potential. Investors invest in people and teams as much as they do in raw ideas. Let your authentic enthusiasm shine through. Share what drives your own personal commitment and investment.Be professional but also personable and relatable. Storytelling mixed with vulnerability builds an emotional connection that drives investors to take a chance on you. If you don't show passion and confidence, why would they?Using a strategic, audience-centric approach, you can create a pitch deck that genuinely resonates with investors and secures the funding you need to take your startup to the next level. The work required will be well worth it.

45,How to Navigate Business Challenges — 5 Reflections as I Enter Year 4 of My Startup,"Nov 10, 2023",Kate Isler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-reflections-as-i-enter-year-4-of-my-startup/464449,"
Reaching year four as a startup is an achievement worth celebrating. For a few seconds, while it feels wonderful to have reached the milestone and still be in business and at least partially standing, the journey is far from over, and the challenges continue to evolve.I've learned valuable lessons, faced numerous hurdles, and made significant progress by some measures. But my thoughts have turned to what I should focus on in year four. Should I aim to raise more money for fast growth, or is my limited time better spent rethinking strategy and team dynamics? Here is how I am approaching year 4.Related: Practical Solutions to the Top 5 Challenges for Founders in 2023



1. ReflectBefore diving into the future, I feel that reflecting on the journey is essential. Like most startup leaders, I rarely take the time to dig into specific accomplishments and setbacks for deeper meaning. There is true value in pausing to examine and, ideally, documenting things we have learned. What have been your most successful strategies? Why did those things work? For the strategies and initiatives that failed, how flawed were they? Did I follow them long enough or too long? What was the impact of both success and failure on the business and team?We all know that a clear understanding of the past will help you make informed decisions for the future. It is critical to make the time and space to do this soul-searching. I suggest going along with the team to gather prospective insights and collectively set the direction for the next phase.


Related: The Art of Navigating 'No' — When to Persist, Pivot or Give Up and Pack it In2. Raising capitalOne of the primary questions that every entrepreneur faces is whether or not to raise funds. It's a complicated question, especially for women. Injecting more capital can fuel rapid growth, but it's not always the best choice. Here are the factors I am thinking about while making this decision:What are our strategic goals? Are we looking to expand rapidly, enter new markets, or develop new products? Do we have a solid plan to spend the funds once we raise them? Proof that the invested dollars can be used to deliver on our projections. This is not simply a question to answer for investors or would-be investors; it is critical to ask yourself and your team. The implications of outside capital go far beyond having money.What is our current growth rate? Does our current growth rate justify the need for more capital? If the current trajectory is steady and sustainable, when do I really need funding?Burn rate:  I have spent time calculating our current monthly and quarterly spending to develop a burn rate. It has fluctuated over the past few years, and we are not yet at the point where we are generating enough revenue to cover the cost of sustaining the business. I have looked deeply into how we work and adjusted to manage our burn rate and extend our runway until we raise capital.Investor relationships: This has been tricky. Entering a relationship with an investor is a long-term commitment, and I have learned to think long and hard about who I want to be involved in my business for the long haul. When taking funds from a group or an individual investor, I should have talked to other entrepreneurs to understand their experience. I wanted funding and people that would add value to our business, and I have realized that not all money is equal. Some of our initial investors were inexperienced and had a different view of the business direction. This has been costly in time, energy and focus. These are all things that I don't have time to spare when focusing on growing my business. Lesson learned.3. Assess your teamAs we grow, pivot and refine our product offering, the team's skills and experience need to evolve. This makes perfect logical sense. However, the founding team of a startup holds a special place for every founder. Four years in the startup world is a lifetime and has been full of adjustments in our product offering and refinement to our marketing strategy and business model. In some cases, team members have adapted; in others, they have not. Here are some of the things I considered when looking deeply into my team members and our readiness to move forward in year four and beyond:Team Skill Sets: I have identified the core competencies required to deliver on the strategic goals included in our growth plan. I have looked closely into the skills we need to achieve our targets and overlayed those with the skills of the current team members to create a gap analysis.Hiring Strategy: Once I determined that I needed to bring in additional skills, I developed a plan to see what talent was out there. I started by developing precise and detailed job descriptions. Then, I posted them on social media job sites and spread the word among my professional and personal community. I talked with prospective candidates about what they were looking for and our direction and goals. There is fantastic talent around, and now, with traction and experience, I feel confident in attracting the talent and skills for the next phase of our growth.Culture: I have asked, are we practicing the company culture we set out to develop? Maintaining a positive and cohesive culture is increasingly important to pay attention to as we grow and pivot.Related: Make Better Hires by Getting the Right Assessment Tests for Your Company


4. Customer feedback and product iterationWe now have a solid customer base and continuously receive valuable product feedback. Leveraging this feedback to refine our product offerings is the most important thing we can do to grow. Asking for feedback can be hard, and it is difficult to hear the answers at times, but continuously iterating based on customer needs and market trends is the only way toCustomer-Centric Approach: Staying committed to a customer-centric approach is a must. Regularly engaging with our customers to gather insights, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for improvement is a practice we have implemented and will continue.Product Roadmap: Developing a clear product roadmap for the technical aspects of our product and our customer offering that aligns with our long-term vision is more important now than in the early stages of the business. We have input and lessons learned to build on to prioritize features and enhancements that provide the most value to our customers.5. Scalability and operational efficiencyAchieving scalability and operational efficiency is vital for sustained growth. I am continually looking for ways to streamline processes, reduce costs and increase productivity:Technology Stack: Ensuring that our technology infrastructure can support increased demand. Budgeting for investments in scalable solutions that can grow with our business.Automation: Identifying areas where automation can improve efficiency across the business. Outsourcing routine tasks, leveraging AI and analytics to improve support, marketing, or backend operations.Talent Development: Understanding the skills gap noted above and investing in training and development programs to upskill some existing team members and empower them to take on more significant roles.Year four of a startup is a critical juncture. We are celebrating making it this far while carefully balancing growth ambitions with the realities of our business. Seeking additional funding and expanding the team's skill sets can accelerate growth. Doing so strategically is essential, maintaining a strong focus on our customers and product quality.Success in the startup world combines innovation, adaptability, and perseverance. Reflecting on our journey, evaluating our funding needs, and nurturing your team and customer relationships set us up for sustained success beyond its fourth year.

48,"If You've Applied to College, You Can Pitch Investors. Here's Why.","Nov 3, 2023",Mimi Doe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/why-pitching-to-investors-is-like-applying-to-college/463210,"
In the dynamic landscapes of entrepreneurship, investment and higher education, effective communication is vital. My company, Top Tier Admissions, brings more than 20 years of experience helping students secure places at Ivy League-level schools. As an educator, founder and CEO, I have seen how the art of persuasion and negotiation is most successfully applied in these seemingly disparate realms.Investors are primarily interested in the return on their investment, so it's crucial to understand their preferences, risk tolerance and what excites them about your industry. Colleges, meanwhile, seek students who will contribute to their community and excel academically. Extensive research on the institution's values, programs and culture is therefore vital to tailor an application accordingly.Related: 10 Social Media Tips for Students to Improve Their College Admission ChancesA few additional areas of both similarity and contrast to consider:The personal statement vs. elevator pitchCollege applications require personal essays or statements that showcase a student's intellectual vitality, experiences and academic goals. Much like the elevator pitch, however, this is an opportunity to stand out and make a real impression.



In the entrepreneurial world, the elevator pitch is your first impression — a concise, 30-second overview of your business idea, emphasizing its uniqueness and potential.Distinct life experience vs. unique value propositionCollege applications require a student to convey their distinguishing experiences and perspectives, highlighting what they bring to the campus that sets them apart from other applicants.Similarly, a winning business pitch should articulate a particular solution to a problem, demonstrating why customers choose your product or service over competitors.Self-reflection vs. market researchAcademic institutions demand introspection and self-awareness, so students would be wise to reflect on their personal growth, values and aspirations to provide a compelling narrative.


Entrepreneurs must conduct thorough market research to identify opportunities and assess demand. Investors expect data-driven insights.Extracurricular involvement vs team dynamicsStudent applications include vital sections devoted to extracurricular activities. The right student will showcase leadership, teamwork and authentic civic engagement — reliable indicators of character.Investors, meanwhile, will evaluate the strength of a team and its ability to execute a business plan, focusing particularly on complementary skills and shared vision.Related: Did a Giant Dancing Pineapple Just Jump Into This Meeting? Watch the Season Premiere of 'Elevator Pitch'!


Academic achievements vs. financial projectionsColleges, of course, assess a student's academic record (including standardized test scores) and letters of recommendation to demonstrate an ability to excel in a rigorous learning environment.Investors want to see a clear path to profitability, which includes well-researched financial projections and a sustainable business model.Interview performance vs. pitch deliveryAcademic interviews are an opportunity for a student to showcase potential contributions to and enthusiasm for an institution. Part of that is being prepared to offer thoughtful responses and ask well-researched and insightful questions.Business pitches should be engaging, concise and persuasive, which makes honing them to a fine edge instrumental in capturing an investor's attention.


College selection vs. competitive analysisColleges align with a student's academic and personal goals, and applications should be tailored to each institution to demonstrate genuine interest.Meanwhile, identifying and analyzing competitors is paramount in understanding market positioning. Investors want to know how you'll outperform other players in a sector.Related: Competitive Analysis BasicsWell-roundedness vs. adaptabilityHigher learning institutions tend to value individuals who have depth (not breadth) in a specific academic niche and are versatile and creative as they adapt their interests and talents to particular circumstances.


In the dynamic world of entrepreneurship, adaptability is crucial. Investors want to see that you can pivot and innovate.Campus visits vs. networkingVisiting colleges provides a networking-like feel for campus and culture. Colleges track demonstrated interest, so it's vital — even if students can't visit in person — to show interest in other ways (perhaps virtually).Similarly, building relationships with potential investors is vital, which includes attending networking events, pitch competitions and industry conferences.Related: 2023's Top Colleges for Aspiring Entrepreneurs


Remember that a well-crafted pitch can be a ticket to success, even in sectors as seemingly unrelated as these. While specific requirements and expectations may differ, the underlying principles of knowing an audience, showcasing uniqueness and delivering a compelling narrative remain constant.

51,My Company Hears Hundreds of Pitches Every Year — Here's What Investors Are Actually Looking For.,"Oct 30, 2023",Emil Savov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-things-investors-are-actually-looking-for-in-financial/463239,"
If you're an entrepreneur who's looking for investment, you already know that you need more than a good business idea — you need a strong pitch that includes solid financial forecasts.This is vitally important when seeking out the right investor as it shows them that you understand the fundamentals of your business. It also helps investors understand other key points, such as the attractiveness of your business model; the amount of capital required to meet milestones; and the valuation of the company to be applied to the current financing round.But figuring out what to include in these forecasts can be tricky. At MaRS IAF, we see hundreds of pitches every year. This is what we want founders to know.Related: 6 Important Factors Venture Capitalists Consider Before InvestingInclude the right numbersThe most important thing in a financial forecast is an income statement that spells out your revenue, cost of goods sold and expenses. Cash flow projections are also key: Most startups are not profitable at first, so it's important for investors to understand what kind of runway the companies are forecasting and whether they have the funding to continue operating until they achieve their goals. Include quarterly, and if necessary, monthly projections for various scenarios, as well as your plan if things go awry.



Many founders present what's called the base case, which tends to look at the most plausible scenario when it comes to their cash flow. But we'll often ask, what is your worst case in terms of what could go wrong? For example, what would happen if your revenue gets delayed by six months or a year? When would you run out of cash? That's not just important information to have, it's also a good reference point for us to see how founders evaluate and plan for risk. Often the difference between success and failure is in the execution, so we want to know how they'll handle it when things don't go to plan.Learn the economics of your industry sector — and don't give overblown projectionsDifferent types of industries have different margins and cost profiles, which founders must be aware of if they're going to generate accurate and reasonable financial projections. For example, software and SAAS companies could have gross margins of up to 90% because their cost of goods sold is very low. On the hardware side, it's closer to 50% because of manufacturing costs. The traditional automotive industry has typical net income profit margins between 3% and 5%.To fund all their R&D and other expenses, they need huge revenue volumes and the associated economies of scale. If a founder is projecting profit that doesn't mirror the reality of their industry, it will ruin their credibility because it'll indicate they haven't done their homework or don't understand their business, which can make an investor wonder whether they can trust any of the company's projections.Related: Here's What's Brewing in the Minds of Startup Investors


Have a plan — but be adaptable, tooFounders come up with scenarios based on any number of assumptions that differ from their base case — including the timing of revenue, margins and expenses — so we don't expect them to have a scenario for every single parameter. But be prepared, because potential investors may ask for more financial analysis.It's also a good idea to include your contingency plans in your financial projections. So, if things go in a negative direction, what changes will you make to ensure your survival? That could look like hiring people on a contract basis rather than bringing them on full-time or planning to cut core staff. But many entrepreneurs will save this as a last resort because cutting too deep can lead to a vicious circle where you cannot deliver on promises that you've made to customers. Oftentimes, part-time employees have other sources of income and it's less painful to disengage with those than with full-time employees. It may also make sense to hire a part-time or fractional CFO instead of bringing on a high-priced full-timer right away.Use a model that makes sense for the stage of your businessIn the first and second years of operations, companies have a reasonably good idea of what they need to do to meet their milestones and what resources they need to get there. For example, if they need to develop a new feature, they can likely estimate how many engineers and how much time to dedicate to the project.Similarly, it should be fairly easy to calculate how much that would cost and how much revenue they need to generate in order to fund that. That's how you build an income statement using ""bottom-up"" projections. But any further out, it becomes difficult to estimate exactly how many engineers the company will have and how much revenue it'll generate. At that point, it's time to switch to ""top-down"" models, which use typical industry margins, cost structure and revenue per employee to generate a projected income statement.


Related: Everything You Need to Know to Pitch an InvestorHow to choose the right investorNot every startup gets to choose their investors — sometimes, it's whoever will give you money. But, ideally, founders should look for investors who have some important characteristics, and domain expertise is a big one. That's their track record of investing in that industry, which means they will more easily understand the business case and the value proposition.It's also wise to seek out a firm that can add value after the investment. Look for firms that can provide the resources, skills and networks to validate their ideas and bring products and services to market. I like to call this the ""virtuous circle"" of venture capital. If a venture capital firm has a good reputation, chances are the companies it invests in will attract better opportunities and therefore see better outcomes. Contacts in the industry are also important because that means your investor can support you in the long run by helping open doors with potential customers and partners, which will help the startup become more successful.Founders should also do their research to find out what companies the VC may have already invested in. If they've already begun a relationship with a direct competitor, that can present another challenge.


The bottom lineThere are a lot of details to line up and work through, so make sure you are fully prepared to talk confidently — and honestly — about your business plan. If you want to attract an investor who is committed to your company's growth, you need to first invest the time to ensure your numbers add up.

52,How to Fund Your Business Using Banks and Credit Unions,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-fund-your-business-using-banks-and-credit-unions/459438,"
Many of the most successful businesses are financed by banks, which can provide small to moderate amounts of capital at market costs. They don't want control—at least beyond the control exerted in the covenants of a loan document. And they don't want ownership. Bankers make loans, not investments, and as a general rule they don't want to wind up owning your company.Bankers primarily provide debt financing. You take out a loan and pay it back, perhaps in installments consisting of principal and interest, perhaps in payments of interest only, followed by a balloon payment of the principal. One of the nice things about debt financing is that the entrepreneur doesn't have to give up ownership of his company to get it. The cost is clearly stated.Related: Finance Your Money RightBankers can usually be counted on to want minimal, if any, input into how the business is run. Most often, as long as you remain current on payments, you can do as you like. Get behind on the payment schedule, and you're likely to find a host of covenants buried in your loan documentation.



Loan covenants, however, may require you to do all sorts of things, from setting a minimum amount of working capital you must maintain to prohibiting you from making certain purchases or signing leases without approval from the bank. In fact, most bank loans contain so many covenants that it's difficult for a borrower to avoid being technically in default on one or more of them at a given time. For this reason, you want your accountant, financial advisor, or attorney to review your loan documents and spell out everything for you very carefully.Related: 3 Strategies For Getting Into Lending ShapeYour loan officer is likely to ignore many covenant violations unless you stop, or seem likely to stop, making timely payments. Even then you'll probably get a chance to work out the problem. But if you remain in violation, you may find yourself declared in default in short order, and the bank may demand all of its money immediately, perhaps seizing your collateral and even forcing you to protect yourself by declaring bankruptcy.What Bankers WantA banker's first concern is getting the bank's money back plus a reasonable return. To increase the odds of this, bankers look for certain things in the businesses they lend to. Those include everything from a solid explanation of why you need the money and what you're going to use it for to details about any other borrowing or leasing deals you've entered into.


Bank loan applications can be voluminous, almost as long and complete as a full-fledged business plan. Plans and loan applications aren't interchangeable, however. A banker may not be interested in your rosy projections of future growth. In fact, when confronted with the kind of growth projection required to interest a venture capitalist, a banker may be turned off. On the other hand, a banker is likely to be quite interested in seeing a contingency plan that will let you pay back the loan even in the event of a worst-case scenario. The things a banker will look for you to address are:Cash flow. One of the most convincing things you can show a banker is the existence of a strong, well-documented flow of cash that will be more than adequate to repay a loan's scheduled principal and interest. Basically, you're going to have to show where you're going to get the money to pay back what you're borrowing.Related: Choosing A Lender? Watch Out FOr These Costly Traps.You'll need more than a projection of future cash flow, by the way. Most bankers will want to see cash flow statements as well as balance sheets and income statements for the past three or so years. And don't forget your tax returns for the same period.Collateral. If you're just starting out in business or if you're dealing with a banker who you don't know well, you're unlikely to be able to borrow from a bank without collateral. (That's doubly true if, as is the case with many entrepreneurs, both descriptions apply to you.) Collateral is just something the banker can seize and sell to get back some or all of the money you've borrowed in the event that everything goes wrong and you can't pay it back with profits from operations. It may consist of machinery, equipment, inventory, or all too often, the equity you own in your home. It's advisable NOT to put your home up for collateral—it's simply too big a risk.But it's a good idea to take the initiative here and propose something that will be used if you suspect a banker will require it. Often the collateral will consist of whatever you're borrowing money to buy—production equipment, computers, a building, and so on.Related: 4 Ways To Finance Your Business.


Why do bankers seek collateral? They have no desire to own secondhand equipment or your house. Experience has taught them that entrepreneurs who have their own assets at risk are more likely to stick to a business than those who have none of their own assets at risk.Quick tip: It seems sensible to plan to put up as collateral the exact item you're borrowing money to buy. But bankers often demand more because it may be impossible to sell the item that you're buying for what you'll owe on it. So, plan to use purchased equipment for part of your collateral but be ready to offer more.Cosigners. They provide an added layer of protection for lenders. If your own capacity for taking on additional debt is shaky, a cosigner (who is essentially lending you his or her creditworthiness) may make the difference.Related: Choosing A Business Loan TypeMarketing plans. More than ever before, bankers are taking a closer look at the marketing plans embedded in business plans. Strong competitors, price wars, me-too products, the fickle habits of the buying public, and other market-related risks must be addressed. There are also very web-savvy marketers out there, and it helps if you are tapped into online marketing, such as social media.Your banker (and most other investors) has to know that you recognize these risks and have well-thought-out ways to deal with them. Besides, it's the cash flow from operations that pays off bank loans.Management. Bankers like to stress the personal aspect of their services. Many state that they are interested in making loans based on a borrower's character as well as her financial strength. In fact, the borrower's track record and management ability are concerns for bankers evaluating a loan application. If you can show you've run one or more other companies successfully, it will increase your chances of landing a loan to get a startup going.


Related: Despite Access to Credit, Many Business Owners Are Reluctant to Take on DebtGetting Your House in OrderAs an entrepreneur seeking a bank loan, or any funding for that matter, you'll want to make sure you have everything in place, including all of your financial documentation as well as your credit history. And if you need to improve your credit history and rating, you should do so in advance. Even if you have previous business experience, you'll need to get your personal credit information in order. Start by contacting one of the three major credit bureaus:Equifax: 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.comExperian: 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.comTransUnion: 1-800-916-8800, www.transunion.comDo this once because loan officers will also inquire, and the more your credit ratings are checked, the more suspicious it may appear to lenders. Also, read your credit reports carefully, especially if your rating is not as good as you expected. Credit bureaus make more mistakes than you would ever imagine. Make sure there are no errors on your credit reports. If there are errors, call the credit bureau to have them corrected.Related: 6 Tips For Navigating Online Lending Options


Lenders Look at the Four Cs of CreditCharacter. What's your reputation and record?Capacity or cash flow. Do you have sufficient cash flow to repay principal and interest?Capital. Does your business have enough capital to keep going if you can't pay the debt from earnings?Collateral. Do you own something valuable the banker can take if you can't pay the loan back?Don't Take No for an AnswerOne, two, three strikes, you're out. Most small business owners give up after trying three banks. You should be more persistent. Those entrepreneurs that have persisted have found that the fifth, tenth, or even twentieth banker has been impressed enough to give them a loan. Of course, tweaking the business plan based on the criticism you receive can, and often does, help improve your odds as you continue going from bank to bank. Listen and learn from feedback and criticism, make changes if you feel the comments are relevant, and keep on going. Be persistent.Related: Fund Your Business With Bonds And Indirect Funding SourcesWhen Bank Financing Is AppropriateBank financing is most appropriate for up-and-running enterprises that can show adequate cash flow and collateral to service and secure the loan. Bankers are less likely to provide startup money to turn a concept into a business and even less likely to put up seed money to prove a concept unless you have a track record of launching previous businesses with successful results. Even then, each concept will stand on its own merits.Bankers are sensitive to the term or length of a loan. Most bank loans are short to intermediate term, meaning they are due in anywhere from less than a year to five years. A short-term loan may be for ninety days and used to finance receivables so you can get a big order out the door. A longer-term loan, up to twenty years, may be used to purchase a piece of long-lasting capital equipment.Borrowing When You Really Need ItThe old saying about bankers lending only to people who don't need to borrow is almost true. Bankers prefer to lend to companies that are almost, but not quite, financially robust enough to pursue their objective without the loan. Bankers are lenders, not investors. Unlike a venture capitalist who takes an equity position, bankers don't get a higher return on their loan if you happen to be more successful than expected. Their natural tendency is to be conservative.Related: The Current State Of Business LendingThis is important to understand because it affects how and when you will borrow. You should try to foresee times you'll need to borrow money and arrange a line of credit or other loan before you need it. That will make it easier and, in many cases, cheaper in terms of interest rates than if you wait until you're a needier and, in bankers' eyes, less attractive borrower.


Credit UnionsAnother option when seeking funding is to join a credit union. According to the National Credit Union Administration, there are more than 4,900 credit unions in the country with 131 million members as of March 31, 2022. Because credit unions are not-for-profit financial institutions, their focus is serving the financial needs of their members and not on making a profit. As a result, once you have applied and joined a credit union, it may be easier to get a lower interest rate with fewer fees than can be found at a bank when procuring a loan. However, like a bank, you will still need to prove your creditworthiness and that you can repay the loan or have someone cosign for it.Because banks have gotten a lot of bad press in recent years for attaching fees to all sorts of activities, many people have switched over to credit unions. One reason is that credit unions typically offer more personalized service, which can include helping you get your house in order before applying for a loan. Credit unions may also offer a sense of camaraderie because they are typically sponsored by a business, a community, or some group of people of which you are one. This can be advantageous because you may find other people interested in your business ideas.Related: Choosing A Bank For Your Start-Up? Here Are Some Things To Know.While credit unions are not protected like banks by the FDIC, they are covered by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). This fund provides federal and most state-chartered credit union members with up to $250,000 of insurance per individual depositor, per federally insured credit union.Term to Know: Balloon PaymentA balloon payment is a single, usually final, payment on a loan much greater than the preceding payments. Some business loans, for example, require interest-only payments the first year or two, followed by a single large payment that repays all the principal.

53,How to Perfectly Pitch Your Business Plan in 10 Minutes,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-pitch-your-business-plan-in-6-minutes/463003,"
Delivering a good pitch for your business is as much about conveying emotion as conveying information. The saying ""They don't care what you know until they know that you care"" is good advice to follow.A pitch doesn't need to be long; your audience will appreciate it if you keep it as brief as possible. With that in mind, you can assemble a pitch in ten minutes broken down into one topic every minute.Related: The Only Business Plan Book You NeedMinute 1: Make a personal introduction. Let the audience know that you personally care about the people and the problem you are trying to solve.Minute 2: State the problem. People with this problem have emotions invested. They may be struggling, irritated, angry, and/ or disenfranchised. Keep human emotions real. Break down the problem into its component parts accompanied by a diagram.Minute 3: Present the solution. Show excitement and passion for your business's solution. Walk the audience not only through how the solution works but also through the great benefits of the solution.Minute 4: Show your business model. Now is the time to tell the audience how you will make money. Explain how you are going to charge people for the solution you are offering.Minute 5: Talk about your competition. Do not talk about how you're better than the competition. Instead, focus on how you're different. Your attitude toward the competition gives the audience a peek into your business soul. Are you dutifully respectful of their presence and power or are you arrogant enough to think your little startup will have no problem beating them? Err on the side of humility.Minute 6: Talk about your market and how you'll sell to them. Get excited as you talk about how many potential customers are out there and how you're going to get them. Take the audience through the market data, your chosen point of entry, and your sales and marketing strategy.Minute 7: Tell the audience about how much money you'll make. Talk about how selling to your market shows the unit economics of a single customer (price), and the size of the market shows how many potential deals are out there (quantity). Armed with this information, you can describe how revenue builds over time.Minute 8: Introduce your team. It's important to introduce your team in the context of the business so the audience understands why it is what it is. If you introduce the team up front, you will have to circle back to describe their roles later, which wastes time.Minute 9: Prove your business has traction. You need to show results to get investors and customers to buy in. So, answer important questions such as: What has the team accomplished? Does the company have revenue? Are the customers happy?Minute 10: Ask for the buy-in. You need to spend the last minute asking for people to buy into your business and your vision, no matter if that's asking investors for money or asking someone to work for you. In this last minute, paint a clear picture of what you need from the audience and what investing with you will look like.Related: Pitching For Profits Delivering A Presentation to Investors

Never forget that information grows money.Thanks to the internet, market research for business planning purposes has become much easier and less time-consuming. For example, by logging on to the U.S. Census Bureau website (www.census.gov), you can learn everything you need about population trends in your market, which helps you determine market share—a key piece of information in any business plan. Using your site or email, you can set up an online focus group to get a handle on what prospective customers want from a product or service like yours, how they'd use it, where they'd like to buy it, and how often they'd purchase it.This kind of information will help you establish pricing, distribution, and promotional strategies.Related: The Best Research Tools for Entrepreneurs



You can garner a wealth of valuable information via the web on your competitors—and on businesses similar to yours operating in other markets. Visit these companies' websites to see what their product/service lines are, what their unique selling propositions are, who their target markets are and what media are used to reach them, what their prices are, and where and how their product is distributed. If their websites have a section called ""News"" or ""Upcoming Events,"" you can learn about their plans for future marketing efforts and determine how they'll affect your business.Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big BrandsTrade Associations: Key Source of Targeted InformationTrade associations are an excellent source of specific trade and industry information. Suppose you are an artisan specializing in concrete countertops and related items. Is there a trade association? Sure, see The Concrete Network's newsletter for specialized information.Because there are more than 22,000 trade associations in the United States, you will be hard-pressed not to find one that will include your business. Most have periodicals—magazines or newsletters—whose editors are eager to justify their positions by providing the membership with up-to-date information of all kinds. You can call the editor directly (they like to hear from members) or send him an email with your particular questions.


Related: How to Develop a Great Business WebsiteTrade associations often sponsor trade shows, which can help you get information on suppliers, industry trends, consultants, and even seminars directly related to your business. The people you meet and the informal exchange of knowledge that results provide the greatest value: production tips, problem solutions, contacts, and ideas.Customer DataIf your business is already established, use your website and social media presence to solicit valuable feedback from your customers. Stay in touch with them to foster customer loyalty. After a sale is made, ask them whether they're satisfied or if more service is needed. Let them know about upcoming events and specials. Ask them what changes, if any, they'd like to see made in your product or service and how it's delivered.Related: How to Develop a Great Business WebsiteKeep in mind the 80-20 principle in business, which says that 80 percent of your business comes from repeat customers and 20 percent from new customers. Too many businesses spend an inordinate amount of money trying to lure new customers when their repeat customers and the friends, neighbors, colleagues, and family members of those regular customers are the backbone of most successful businesses.Use the web and email to get the information you need about vendors and suppliers. Get a list of customers you can email, text, or phone so you can assess their business relationships before you make any commitments.Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Position Their Businesses for Growth This Summer


If you don't yet have your business up and running, you may want to tap into social media on your own to discuss your upcoming business— don't give too many secrets away, but go to online groups, discussions, or Facebook pages where you may find your demographic audience and start a conversation. See what they think in general about your ideas—get feedback.Financing OptionsIf your business plan will double as a financing proposal, visit the U.S. government's Small Business Administration site to learn more about the many different types of financing programs available. In addition to financial assistance through guaranteed loans, the SBA also offers counseling services, help in getting government contracts, management assistance through programs like SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives), and lots of publications.Related: A Guide to Elevating Your Franchise with Competitive Research and Data-Driven InsightsOther government organizations also offer financing to small businesses, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Commerce's Export Assistance Centers. To find nongovernment organizations that provide financing to small businesses in your area, visit the Association for Enterprise Opportunity and ask which programs serve businesses in your area. Your banker and state economic development office can also help.Books and How-To ManualsScores of books have been written on how to write a business plan. Most provide skimpy treatment of the issues while devoting many pages to sample plans. Sample plans are useful, but unless planners understand the principles of the planning process, they can't really create sophisticated, one-of-a-kind plans. The following books will help you with the details of various sections in your plan:Dictionary of Business and Economics Terms (Barron's).

This may seem obvious, but it is a step that many people skip as they get caught up in the excitement of a new idea: make sure that your company has the potential to succeed before digging for those hard-to-get dollars. For most of us, our desires about where we would like to go are not as important as our businesses' ability to take us there. Put another way, if you choose the wrong business, you're going nowhere.Luckily, one of the most valuable uses of a business plan is to help you decide whether the venture you have your heart set on is really likely to fulfill your dreams. Many, many businesses never make it past the planning stage because their would-be founders, as part of a logical and coherent planning process, test their assumptions and find them wanting.Test your idea against at least two variables. First, financial, to make sure this business makes economic sense. Second, lifestyle, because who wants a successful business that they hate?Related: How To Craft A Business Plan That Will Turn Investor's Heads



Find Your Realistic PotentialAnswer the following questions to help you outline your company's potential. There are no wrong answers. The objective is simply to help you decide how well your proposed venture is likely to match your goals and objectives.Financial questionsWhat initial investment will the business require?How much control are you willing to relinquish to investors?When will the business turn a profit?When can investors, including you, expect a return on their money?What are the projected profits of the business over time?Will you be able to devote yourself full-time to the business financially?What kind of salary or profit distribution can you expect to take home?What are the chances the business will fail?What will happen if it does? Do you have a backup or alternative plan?Related: The Main Objectives Of A Business PlanDo you have the necessary passion?""Investors want more than just an idea,"" writes Noah Parsons in his article How to Write a Convincing Business Plan for Investors. ""They want evidence that you are solving a problem for customers. Your customers have to want what you are selling for you to build a successful business and your business plan needs to describe the evidence that you've found that proves that you'll be able to sell your products and services to customers. If you have traction in the form of early sales and customers, that's even better.""

It's the knowledge that you've generated by going through the process that's important. Having a business plan shows that you've done the homework of thinking through how your business will work and what goals you're trying to achieve.When you put together a business plan, you have to spend time thinking about things like your target market, your sales, and marketing strategy, the problem you solve for your customers, and who your key competitors are. A business plan provides the structure for thinking through these things and documents your answers so you're prepared for the inevitable questions investors will ask about your business.Even if investors never ask to see your business plan, the work you've done to prepare it will ensure that you can intelligently answer the questions you'll get. And, if an investor does ask for your business plan, then you're prepared and ready to hand it over. After all, nothing could be worse than arriving at an investor meeting and then getting a request for a business plan and not having one ready.""Related: 3 Tips For Pitching Investors Your Big Idea

To convert buyers and investors, sharing product knowledge is important, but you need more. Sure, you have to know the products and services you sell in detail. But product knowledge alone is useless, and that is where many marketing plans run afoul of the first law of marketing: Put the Customer First. Customers don't buy products or services. They buy solutions to problems, relief from an itch, satisfaction of a felt need. In short, they buy benefits.Benefits Are Not FeaturesFeatures are characteristics of products or services that are independent of the buyer's perceptions. A tractor lawn mower may have a 3 hp gas motor, be green with a natty yellow design, have a warranty good for two years, and cost $1,695, payable in twelve easy monthly installments. Those are all features.The benefits to the buyer include confidence (3 hp is plenty powerful for a suburban lawn and will carry its owner in comfort up and down gentle slopes), prestige (John Deere knows how to make its buyers feel good), and convenience and economy (price and terms). Benefits perceived will differ from one customer to the next—another buyer might buy the same lawn mower because his son-in-law is the dealer, or because his neighbor says it's a great machine, or just because it caught his eye.Related: Use This Worksheet to Write a Product Description That SellsThe key point is that benefits are dependent on the perceptions of the market, whereas features are dependent on the product or service.The perceptions of the market are determined only by research. Armchair research does not count. If you know your market and study your demographics, you will know what your customers perceive to be of value. Then and only then can you safely match your products or services to their demands. You get to know what your markets want by asking them, by knowing them, by researching their buying behaviors. Some of this is almost subliminal—but what sets the big winners apart is that they take the extra time to do this research.Cover Your BehindTo a typical consumer who's purchased her share of shoddy products from uncooperative manufacturers, it's encouraging to hear about a multimillion-dollar settlement of a consumer's claim against some manufacturer. It provides proof that the high and mighty can be humbled and that some poor schmuck can be struck by lightning and receive a big fat check.Related: How to Define Your Product and Set Your Prices



To manufacturers and distributors of products, however, the picture looks entirely different. Liability lawsuits have changed the landscape of a number of industries, from toy manufacturers to children's furniture retailers. If you visit public swimming pools these days, for instance, you don't see the diving boards that used to grace the deep ends of almost all such recreational facilities. The reason is that fear of lawsuits from injured divers, along with the allied increase in liability insurance premiums, have made these boards no longer financially feasible.If you're going to come out with a diving board or offer diving board maintenance services, you need to be prepared for this legal issue. Dealing with it may be as simple as merely including a statement to the effect that you foresee no significant liability issues arising from your sale of this product or service. If there is a liability issue, real or apparent, acknowledge it and describe how you will deal with it in your plan. For instance, you may want to take note of the fact that, like all marketers of children's bedroom furniture, you attach warning labels and disclaimers to all your products and also carry a liability insurance policy. In fact, warning labels may seem ridiculous, but in a litigation-crazed society, you will actually see labels such as the one on a portable stroller that read, ""Please remove child before folding."" Really? Funny as it may sound, let it be known that you will take all necessary steps to protect your business, your products, and yourself from litigation.Related: 9 Sales and Marketing Tips for StartupsYou must have an attorney's advice on almost anything you plan to market. A layman's opinion on whether a product is more or less likely to generate lawsuits is not worth including in a plan.On the subject of liability, here is a good place to deal with the question of whether you are already being sued for a product's perceived failings and, if so, how you plan to deal with it. If you can't find an answer, you may wind up like private aircraft manufacturers, many of which were forced out of the business by increases in lawsuits following crashes.It's often difficult to get an attorney to commit himself on paper about the prospects for winning or losing a lawsuit. Many times, plans handle this with a sentence saying something along the lines of, ""Our legal counsel advises us the plaintiff's claims are without merit.""Related: I Watch Great Teams Make These Business-Destroying Mistakes All The Time.

57,6 Steps to Getting Your Business Plan In Front of Investors,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/6-steps-to-getting-your-business-plan-seen/463001,"
Once you've prepared your business plan for presentation and you're ready to pitch it, there are six steps that can help get it seen by the right people.Obtain leads and referrals. Find the names, addresses, emails, social media profiles and phone numbers of investors you wish to target. Ask people you know for referrals. Network as much as possible.Research your target. Learn as much as possible about how much money people have to invest, the industries they're interested in, and other requirements. Search venture capital directories, news articles, websites, and similar sources.Make your pitch. First, send an introductory email to your target, letting them know you have a plan you would like to send. If you do not hear from him within a short time, send a follow-up email in a week and try once more about two weeks later. If this doesn't get a response, look elsewhere.Try to meet people in person. Even though we are living in a text, email, and video call age, you should still try to meet your recipient face-to-face, especially if you are seeking any type of funding. It's tough to get such a commitment through a few texts or by email. Zoom or Skype may work, but meeting in person for a major financial commitment is best. Nonetheless, if they want to keep all communication electronic, follow their lead.Plan for objections. Although you may think you've answered everything in your plan, you haven't. Prepare a list of possible objections—potential competitors, hard-to-buttress assumptions, and the like—that your investor may raise. Then, prepare cogent answers. Have friends, coworkers, and your team play devil's advocate and hit you with tough questions — then formulate your answers.Get a commitment. You won't get an investment unless you ask for it. When all objections have been answered, be ready to offer one last concession—""If I give your representative a board seat, can we do this today?""—and go for the close.Related: 12 Surefire Tips for the Perfect Investor Pitch

58,How to Fund Your Business With an SBA Loan,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/funding-your-business-with-an-sba-loan/459439,"
Sometimes the government really does want to help. The Small Business Administration (SBA) is devoted to helping small business people get started and run successful businesses. One of its most valuable offerings is a set of financial assistance programs that aim to help you raise the money you need to get started and keep going.General Small Business LoansThe most popular of several SBA loan programs is the 7(a) General Small Business Loans. The maximum loan amount is $5 million, but as of 2020, the average loan was $567,599. Loans guaranteed by the SBA are assessed a guaranty fee. This fee is based on the loan's maturity and the dollar amount guaranteed, not the total loan amount. The lender initially pays the guaranty fee, and it has the option to pass that expense on to the borrower at closing. The funds to reimburse the lender can be included in the overall loan proceeds.The SBA website provides a very comprehensive overview of all its loan programs and provides answers to many typical questions. Along with standard business loans, you'll find disaster loans, microloan programs, and real estate and equipment loans.Related: Will New SBA Programs Get Big Banks Lending?



Loan GuaranteesThe SBA can also provide some guarantees. The 7(a) loans, for example, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which guarantees a lender will get back most—but not all—of the money lent out, even if the borrower can't pay. A typical loan guarantee covers 80 percent of the loan. You will find it easier to borrow money and usually get a lower finance rate if you can get an SBA guarantee.Related:While the SBA sometimes lends money directly to small businesses, most of its financing help is in the form of loan guarantees. To avail yourself of these programs, you need to meet the SBA's definition of a small business and put up pretty much all the business's assets as collateral. Most banks handle SBA-backed loans and can tell you more about the programs. It's easier to learn by going to the SBA.gov website and reviewing its loans. You can also visit one of the SBA district offices.Related: Choosing A Business Loan Type


Small Business Investment Company ProgramThe SBA has a program that bridges the capital gap between loans (direct or guaranteed) and equity investments, which are the most difficult to find. Most banks are unwilling to offer very long-term loans (sometimes called ""quasi-capital""), and most venture capital firms are unwilling to invest under $3 million in businesses that are unlikely to go public or be acquired for a fancy multiple within three to five years. Enter the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC).Related: The Stimulus Cash Is Gone... Now What?Congress created the SBIC program in 1958 to fill the gap between the availability of venture capital and the needs of small businesses in startup and growth situations. SBICs, licensed and regulated by the SBA, are privately owned and managed investment firms that use their own capital plus funds borrowed at favorable rates with an SBA guarantee to make venture capital investments in small businesses.Virtually all SBICs are profit-motivated businesses. They provide equity capital, long-term loans, debt equity investments, and management assistance to qualifying small businesses. Their incentive is the chance to share in the success of the small business as it grows and prospers.Related: The Current State Of Business Lending And 5 Trends To WatchTwo Types of SBICsThere are two types of SBICs: regular SBICs and specialized SBICs, also known as 301(d) SBICs. Specialized SBICs invest in small businesses owned by entrepreneurs who are socially or economically disadvantaged, mainly members of minority groups.The program makes funding available to all types of manufacturing and service industries. Many investment companies seek out small businesses with new products or services because of the strong growth potential of such firms. Some SBICs specialize in the field in which their management has special knowledge or competency. Most, however, consider a wide variety of investment opportunities.

59,What Is Your Unique Selling Proposition? Use This Worksheet to Find Your Greatest Strength.,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/use-this-worksheet-to-find-your-unique-selling-proposition/459642,"
Unique selling proposition is a term for whatever it is that makes you different from and better than the competition in the eyes of your customers. It's why they buy from you instead of from someone else.What Makes It Worthwhile?A product description is more than a mere listing of product features. You have to highlight your product's most compelling characteristics, such as low cost or uniquely high quality, that will make it stand out in the marketplace and attract buyers willing to pay your price. Even the simplest product has a number of unique potential selling strengths.Many of the common unique selling strengths are seemingly contradictory. How can both mass popularity and exclusive distribution be strengths? The explanation is that it depends on your market and what its buyers want.Related: Testing Your Values, Living Your Brand



Features. If your product is faster, bigger, or smaller, or comes in more colors, sizes, and configurations than others on the market, you have a powerful selling strength. In fact, if you can't offer some combination of features that sets you apart, you'll have difficulty writing a convincing plan.Price. Everybody wants to pay less for a product. If you can position yourself as the low-cost provider (and make money at these rock-bottom prices), you have a powerful selling advantage. Conversely, high-priced products may appeal to many markets for their better quality and high-end value. People with discerning tastes want quality and do not buy based solely on price points, so saving money is not always the issue. Price is also dependent on other issues such as service. People will pay more for good customer service.Time Savings. People buy products to help them expedite a process. If yours is faster and can help your customers get out of the office and on their way home more quickly, they want it. Today, everyone is looking to save time, so products and services that help people do that are valuable.Ease of Transport. The mobile world has taken over. People are using their mobile phones to go online as much if not more than their laptops. How mobile is your product? Today's consumers like to take things with them—they want apps and gadgets that are portable.


Related: How to Define Your Product and Set Your PricesAvailability. Typically, the more easily accessible your products are the better it is for business. In most cases, you want to have products and services that people can get quickly. Today, thanks to the internet, you no longer need brick-and-mortar locations in many communities. Scarcity, however, can also generate a higher demand, so you may have a marketing plan to release products at intervals and let the demand—and the desire—build. Scarcity doesn't mean that you will be running out anytime soon. For service providers, availability means a good location or locations that are easy to get to.Cutting Edge/New. If you have something to offer that is not on the market, this is a major selling point or competitive edge. Get out there and patent it, market it, and sell it before someone comes along and steals your thunder. You can also utilize technology to build upon products or services you already provide, such as an app.Training and Support. These are components of service that have become increasingly important, particularly for high-technology products. For many sophisticated software products and electronic devices, a seller who can't provide tech support to buyers will have no chance of success.Related: Use This Worksheet to Write a Product Description That SellsFinancing. Whether you ""tote the note"" and guarantee credit to anyone, offer innovative leasing, do buybacks, or have other financing alternatives, you'll find that giving people different, more convenient ways to pay can lend your product a convincing strength.Customer Service. Excellent service is perhaps the most important thing you can add to any product or service today. In a world where word travels fast through social media, you want to provide top-notch customer service. The shoe giant Zappos has built its reputation by providing excellent customer service. Make this a top priority.


Reputation. Why do people pay $10,000 for a Rolex? The Rolex reputation is the reason. At its most extreme, reputation can literally keep you in business, as is the case with many companies, such as IBM and Walmart, whose well-developed reputations have tided them over in hard times.Knowledge. Your knowledge and the means you have of imparting that to customers is an important part of your total offering. Retailers of auto parts, home improvement supplies, and all sorts of other goods have found that simply having knowledgeable salespeople who know how to replace the water pump in a '95 Chevy will lure customers in and encourage them to buy.Experience. ""We've been there. We've done thousands of installations like yours, and there's no doubt we can make this one work as well."" Nothing could be more soothing to a skeptical sales prospect than to learn that the seller has vast experience at what he's doing. If you have ample experience, make it part of your selling proposition.Fast Delivery. Nobody wants to wait for anything anymore. If you can offer overnight shipping, on-site service, or 24/7 availability, it can turn an otherwise unremarkable product or service into a very attractive one.Related: How to Effectively Promote Your Business to Customers and InvestorsEndorsements. There's a reason Peyton Manning makes millions of dollars a year from endorsements. People want to relate to Peyton and share his aura, if only obliquely.Other Factors. There are many wild cards unique to particular products, or perhaps simply little used in particular industries, with which you can make your product stand out. For instance, consider a service agreement guarantee. When consumers know they can get a product repaired under a service guarantee or return a faulty product for a refund, they're often more likely to buy it over otherwise superior competitors offering less powerful warranties.


Unique Selling Proposition WorksheetWhen you've explained the selling propositions associated with your product in each of these categories, give each one a score from one to ten based on your evaluation of how convincing a case you can make for that being a unique selling proposition. The one or two strengths with the highest scores will be your candidates for inclusion in your business plan product description.Common Plan PitfallDon't count on getting your product into a major retailer on its own merits. The glut of tens of thousands of new products introduced annually, combined with the existing plethora of more than 30,000 products stocked by a typical supermarket, puts retailers in the driver's seat. They demand—and get from almost all new product makers—slotting fees, which are simply payments for the right to be on store shelves. The same goes for big online retailers like Amazon.Related: Who Is Your Customer? 4 Questions to Ask.

60,How to Fund Your Business Through Friends and Family Loans and Crowdsourcing,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/fund-your-business-friends-and-family-and-crowdsourcing/459367,"
Before we dive into the different types of funding, keep these quick tips in mind to help you win the funding you are searching for:Spend extra time working on the executive summary. Because bankers and professional investors receive so many business plans, they sometimes go right to the executive summary for an overall view of what your plan is all about. If you can't seize their interest in your executive summary, go back to the drawing board and try again.Make sure your business plan is complete. You would be surprised at how many business plans are submitted with important data missing. You need to double- and triple-check to make sure all of the important components are included. Even when using business plan software, people skip sections or decide an area is not important. Leave nothing to chance. A well-written and complete business plan gives you a higher chance of success and better odds of getting the financing you are seeking.Related: First Time Crowd Funding? Here's What You Need To Know.



Be able to back up anything you have on paper if asked for more details. While the business plan should have all the answers, investors, bankers, and venture capitalists are shrewd and ask questions that may not be answered in the plan. Be ready to answer anything they can possibly throw at you. Expect the unexpected and prepare for it.Direct Funding SourcesWhen you're looking for money, it may seem that investors are scarce. But the real problem may be that you're not looking in enough places for potential financiers. You may find investors as close as your immediate family and as far away as professional venture capitalists on the other side of the world.Investors come in many shapes and sizes, as well as with various needs and intentions. Odds are you can find someone to help you with your financing needs if you cast your net wide enough.Related: Family Business: The Pros and Cons of Getting Funding From Family.


Direct funding sources invest directly in your business. These include funds from individuals, banks, government agencies, and various levels of professional investors. Indirect funding sources provide trade credit and financing mechanisms such as extended terms on purchases. These are important sources of working capital, but they do not put funds directly into your business.Your Own ResourcesYour own resources, savings, investments, and other valuable assets are the beginning of your financing efforts. One reason to write a business plan is to provide reassurance that you are making a sensible investment. Note that you will be investing serious nonfinancial assets in your business: your time, effort, hopes, and reputation.As for your own financial assets, make sure the money is not earmarked for tuition or part of your necessary family spending, such as your mortgage, rent, and the like. If you're in debt, it is also advisable to get out from under before starting a business. But you can start writing your business plan while getting your financial affairs in order.Related: An Entrepreneur Guide To Finding Various Funding OptionsEven though hopefully you will be investing assets from investors, you should be prepared to invest some of your own money in your business venture. Rule of thumb says if you want other people to invest in you, then you also have to invest in yourself.Why should other people take a gamble on your business if you won't?Friends and FamilyThe most likely source of financing is the group of people closest to you. Spouses, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and in-laws, as well as friends and colleagues, have reasons to help you that arm's-length financiers lack. For that reason, they may back you when no one else will.


One seldom-noticed aspect of asking family and friends to invest in your venture is that other investors (especially bankers and venture capitalists) often ask if you have approached friends and family to raise initial capital. If you say you haven't, they'll then ask why not. If your deal is so appealing, why wouldn't you let your friends in on the ground floor? If you say yes, but they couldn't come through for you, at least the banker or VC will know you tried.Related: 4 Ways To Finance Your BusinessWillingness to take a risk doesn't make friends and family foolish investors. Money from family and friends has backed many very successful business ventures. Here are a few:Albertson's Inc. Cofounder Joe Albertson borrowed $7,500 from his aunt to make his $12,500 contribution to the partnership that began the grocery store that grew to have sales of more than $2 billion a year.Pizza Hut Inc. Cofounders Frank and Dan Carney borrowed $600 from an insurance fund left by their late father to start the pizza chain.Eckerd Corporation. Jack Eckerd raised $150,000 from family members to purchase three failing Florida drugstores, the cornerstone of a company whose sales would one day top $9 billion a year.Friends and family may not be able to raise millions of dollars, but they can provide long-term financing for highly speculative endeavors that more mainstream financiers wouldn't touch.


Related: 8 Ways To Fund Your Start-UpEven Families Need a PlanIf you're financing your venture with family money, you may think all you need is a smile and a polite request to raise what you need. In the short term, that may work and produce the funds you need to start out. But over the long term, even family-financed enterprises will benefit from having a business plan.Such a plan shows family members who are putting up the money what they can expect for their contribution. And it helps keep the entrepreneur— you—mindful of responsibilities to the family members who backed you and on track to fulfill your obligations.Related: The Money Raising Marathon: Preparing To Pitch InvestorsPros and Cons of Family FundingOn the positive side, family and friends will let you know if your idea appeals to them. Typically, they will also give you the time and a less stressful environment in which to present your plan. Family members may be more readily available to lend a helping hand when you need one and may be there to take over the business down the road.The flip side is that you are closer to your family and friends. Losing the money of someone close to you can create a lot of tension between you and your family or friends. Family members and friends may also want to get more involved and try to oversee aspects of the business or push you to make changes that other investors would not. They may even expect to be on your management team, which would not be the case with a bank.Related: Crowd Funding, Personal Credit, and The Bank Of Mom And Dad


In order to make investor agreements work with friends and family, you need to spell out everything clearly and make sure you can separate your business from your personal relationships. This is not necessarily as easy as it sounds. You need to go into any such deals playing some defense and making it clear that people may lose their investments. Provide plenty of warning, and, if they insist on being part of your business, make sure there are boundaries set out in advance that everyone can agree upon.Potential Pitfalls of Friends and Family FundingFamily members offer tempting capital sources. But emotions can interfere with judgment when dealing with relatives and can lead to hurt feelings as well as possible lawsuits and other entanglements. Minimize the risk of such misunderstandings by fully documenting terms, possible interest rates, and other details for loans and equity investments from family.If you do not document the terms of such loans in writing, the IRS can either treat the loan as permanent capital or impose a stiff interest rate on the loan. Neither of these options is desirable.Related: The Best Source Of Funding You'll Ever FindCrowdfundingA rather recent entry into the world of procuring funds for projects is crowdfunding. This is a means of gathering funds from a diverse group of investors using Internet technology.The idea is broad based with some investors on crowdfunding sites getting rewards for investing money while others become investors with a stake in the business. As a result, some of these sites are, like PBS, seeking support from generous people with a passion for a type of business or short-term project or for a cause behind that business or project. Other sites are looking for investors in more full-blown long-term business ventures.Related: You Can't Get VC Funding For Your Start-Up - Now What?


Statista, a leading provider of market and consumer data, reported that the overall industry raised more than $13.6 billion in 2021, and is forecast to more than double to nearly $29 billion in 2028.Adam Chapnick, former head of Indiegogo, notes that an abbreviated business plan works best for most crowdfunding sites. ""Make a big fat business plan—then throw it away,"" says Chapnick, adding that it is important to go through the process of creating a business plan and then necessary to simplify it and make it quick to convey for crowdfunding.MicroVentures starts off with a snapshot questionnaire to which you can attach a business plan if you so choose, but it's not required. Like Indiegogo, it would also look for the abridged version of your longer plan.There are more crowdfunding services coming of age, with new parameters and guidelines, many of which meet specific niche groups. Rules are changing, in part because of federal and SEC regulations and in part because the crowdfunding services are seeing new ways of doing business. For example, Kickstarter, the early trendsetter in this industry, which has raised over $300 million for over 1,800 projects, will give the new business venture the money that has been raised only if the total amount requested has been reached. Therefore, if you request $10,000 to start a business, and you raise only $7,500 from interested parties, you get nothing. Other services, though, would give you the $7,500. Kickstarter is also more selective about what projects end up on its website, looking for more ""trendy"" ideas to keep the company in the limelight.Related: Angels, VC's, Or The Crowd - Who Should Fund?By reviewing the various crowdfunding websites, you can determine which one might be best for your efforts. Look at what the investors will get in return. This can be anything from a gift, not unlike pledging money to PBS; a return on the investment with interest; or, on equity investment crowdfunding websites, a share in the business.Also, keep in mind that many people invest in crowdfunding ventures with their hearts and/or emotions. It is a daring means of investing, but one that drives many crowdfunding investors to put money into something in which they personally believe, such as an environmentally sound business. Of course, there are downsides to crowdfunding, such as putting an idea out there that can be easily stolen or having backers that offer money only while not giving you either the network you need, good business advice, or second rounds of funding. There is also a lot of time spent on marketing to raise your funds. In addition, the SEC is closely watching this new investment opportunity, so you need to be abreast of the latest rules governing crowdfunding.


While Kickstarter and Indiegogo are more frequently used for creative projects, business owners have found success with AngelList.com, MicroVentures.com, or CircleUp.com. But there are so many more that you can find by searching online for ""crowdfunding for business.""

63,The Opportunities We Unlock As Solopreneurs,"Oct 12, 2023",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-opportunities-we-unlock-as-solopreneurs/463583,"
When Angela Shen sold her food tour business, Savor Seattle, it wasn't an easy decision—and it involved many tears. After pivoting her business to curated food boxes during the pandemic, Angela wasn't feeling challenged professionally or personally, so she decided it was time to move on.But the entrepreneurial drive that made her succeed with Savor Seattle never faded. After trying a corporate job and taking time off to travel, she decided to start something new: Savor the Wild Tours. Her new business offers novel food experiences in Washington's local wilderness, such as mushroom foraging and oyster shucking.""You should be a lifetime learner. If you've stopped or you feel like, 'I know enough, I'm a pro at this already,' that's no fun,"" Angela said. ""I'm having way more fun today than I have had in years.""



At Savor Seattle, Angela had a team of 30 to 35 team members creating and running food tours with her. With her new business, she's a solo entrepreneur and does all the work herself: finding locations, creating itineraries, and leading tours.When creating a new business, Angela also adopted a new mindset—less focus on success in terms of profits and more on providing quality experiences.


""It won't be 30,000 [customers] a year like we did before, maybe a couple hundred, maybe even a thousand,"" Angela said. ""That personal touch and that impact that we have is so much deeper, and it makes me happy. That is a marker of success that never was part of the equation before.""After owning and working on Savor Seattle for 17 years, Angela felt her identity was intertwined with the identity of the business. With Savor the Wild, she tries to compartmentalize work from her personal life to avoid stress and burnout. As a one-person operation, she's able to run the tours on her own schedule, allowing her to spend more quality time with her family and work on other business ventures, such as business consulting.""I was lucky as an entrepreneur to have started a successful business early in my career, so I have this privilege now of not having all of that pressure on me to say my success in life is defined by this one business,"" Angela said. ""I feel really proud of that, and my kids got to see that, and I think now it's about showing them and myself that I'm capable of more.""In addition to Savor the Wild having a similar namesake, Angela maintains Savor Seattle's values of diversity and inclusion in her new ventures. She makes sure every customer feels welcome at each experience, no matter what they look like or where they come from.


""I don't really look like your average mushroom forager. Most people I encounter in the woods look very different,"" Angela said. ""As someone who is of minority background and had to deal with adversity to get to where I'm today, and will continue to deal with it, I want to make it easier for others to come into this space and to do so in a way that feels safe and welcoming.""When debating big business decisions, other business owners can learn from Angela's journey, including the following tips:Stay true to your values. While Savor the Wild offers different experiences from Savor Seattle, both businesses foster a spirit of adventure and inclusion, representing the business owner's values.Form valuable partnerships. Throughout her journey, Angela found trustworthy business partners that helped her think through tough business decisions and even connected her with the company that bought Savor Seattle.Listen to your gut. When debating the sale of Savor Seattle, Angela listened to her hunch, leading her to a fulfilling decision that opened doors to new opportunities.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Angela, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.

64,When Is The Right Time to Raise Institutional Capital For Your Business? Here's What You Need to Know.,"Oct 9, 2023",Daniel Rosenrauch,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/when-is-the-right-time-to-raise-institutional-capital-for/452157,"
As the founder of Viirtue, my entrepreneurial journey was a rollercoaster of decisions, risks and strategic turns. But one of the most critical turning points was knowing when to seek institutional capital for my business. This is a decision that can make or break a startup, and understanding the correct timing was paramount for us.My company was bootstrapped for many years, and we maintained profitability throughout. This was a significant advantage, especially when the economy took a downturn in 2022. It was a moment when investors started valuing profitability more than unicorn potential, which put us in a favorable position.But even then, the decision to raise institutional capital wasn't taken lightly. It came after we saw rising traction and rapid growth. Larger groups had access to more capital and strategic advisory than we did, which fueled our motivation to seek institutional funding.



We ran a long process, vetting investors just as much as they vetted us. In our eyes, this was not just about finding a partner for financial growth, but also about securing strategic guidance. We were not looking for a mere check; we were in search of a partner who could offer advice and mentorship based on experience and industry insight.The process wasn't without its pitfalls. One of the primary lessons we learned was about the importance of hiring investment bankers that specialize in your industry. Initially, we made the mistake of hiring inexperienced bankers. This decision cost us time, money and a long tail period when we decided to move on from them. If there's one thing I wish we did right from the start, it would be interviewing many bankers who specialized in our vertical and meticulously checking references.


Related: Kevin O'Leary Explains Why Institutional Capital Must Have a Role in SustainabilityInvestment bankers are not just intermediaries who connect you with potential investors. They represent you at the negotiation table. Many founders can receive Letters of Intent (LOIs), but the real challenge lies in navigating deals that don't retrade and negotiating with future stakeholders, especially when emotions run high. These are the moments when a seasoned investment banker can make all the difference.Ultimately, we decided to raise capital for a multitude of reasons. The business was growing exponentially, and we needed the development and sales funding to help us scale from a $20 to $30 million company to a company worth over $100 million. We had long-time minority investors who were looking to exit and needed liquidity. And most importantly, we were in search of strategic partners who could fuel our growth thoughtfully as well as financially. Raising capital was the silver bullet that enabled us to accomplish all of these goals in one fell swoop.Are you ready to take on institutional capital?Firstly, are you ready to commit to the robust reporting requirements of investors? Institutional investors will need regular and detailed reports on business performance, financials and strategic updates. This requires a significant time commitment and a level of transparency that some business owners may find uncomfortable. We had always operated Viirtue with candor and transparency. This made the transition so much more frictionless.


Secondly, do you truly need the capital to reach a milestone, or are you just taking money? Money for the sake of money can lead to wasteful spending and a lack of focus. It's crucial to have a clear understanding of what you need the capital for, such as reaching a particular business milestone or achieving a specific growth target.Thirdly, do you have a thoughtful growth plan of how you will deploy the capital? It's not enough just to have money; you need a strategic plan for how that money will be used to grow your business. This includes identifying key areas for investment, understanding how these investments will drive growth and having a clear timeline for when you expect to see returns. Detailed financial modeling is an incredible asset for any founder. We never had a full-time finance leader, yet still were able to create detailed models with our CPAs and bankers. Additionally, when it comes time to pitch to investors, they will want to see these models coupled with market research and other evidence to support your assumptions.Finally, have you set the stage to significantly scale your team? Fundraising is a pivotal step, but it's just a piece of the puzzle. The real task is putting the capital to good use, which often implies expanding your team. This demands not only a well-crafted recruitment strategy but also the capacity to house a growing workforce.At Viirtue, we have always held our people in the highest regard. Our human capital, which comprises industry experts and genuinely wonderful individuals, has been our greatest asset, our superpower. The team's dedication and expertise have been instrumental in shaping my company's identity and will continue to give us a competitive edge as we move forward.


The unique culture we have cultivated at my company has been a magnet for new talent, making our scaling efforts more seamless than we could have ever anticipated. But, let me assure you, a strong culture doesn't materialize overnight. It's a product of time, open dialogues with your team, investing in their growth and success, and co-creating a vision that resonates with their sense of purpose.I have often emphasized the transformative power of finding purpose in work. When you can align a group of uniquely talented individuals towards a shared mission and imbue their roles with purpose, the result is nothing short of magical. A purpose-driven team is not just a group of employees; it's a community of dedicated contributors who are invested in the company's journey and its ultimate success.Related: 4 Passive Income Investment Strategies That'll Free Your Time and Peace of MindThe quest for institutional capital is more than just a funding round. It's a strategic move that can catapult a business to new heights if done correctly. But it's crucial to remember that timing is everything. Raising capital should be considered when the business shows promising growth and needs an additional boost to reach its full potential. It should also be considered when partners are looking for an exit, and the company requires strategic guidance to navigate future growth.


One more point to consider is the importance of maintaining profitability. It's not just about creating an appealing proposition for investors. It's about ensuring that your business can weather economic downturns and still come out on top.I hope you find success and the answers you are searching for in your entrepreneurial journey. Whether or not it is the right time to raise capital is ultimately up to you as a founder.

65,How to Build a Marketing Function During the Early Stage of Your Startup,"Oct 5, 2023",Bryan Karas,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-build-a-marketing-function-during-the-early-stage/458779,"
Companies gaining traction in the early-to-mid growth stages have a few common marketing attributes: they're seeing good returns in paid media, they have some resources to deploy, and they're facing a dilemma of building an in-house team or hiring an agency to help them scale.I'm CEO and founder of a marketing agency — I'll put that out there right up front. Yes, that means I have a bias toward brands at this stage hiring agencies, but it also means I've seen plenty of brands over-invest where they shouldn't and under-invest in the places that will actually move the needle.This article will cover a few considerations for how to build a marketing function at this stage: core competencies you must have covered, how to address common mistakes and how to gauge the pros and cons of agencies and in-housing.



Related: 6 Key Roles to Build an Efficient Marketing TeamMust-have competencies of early-stage growth marketingCompanies of every maturity stage are generally focusing their advertising spend on Google and Meta (and perhaps LinkedIn, if you're B2B). There's a good reason for this: between those channels, which still account for nearly 50% of all digital advertising spend, you have huge audiences and engagement capabilities at every point in the funnel. All told, that's a perfect focal point for companies in the early stages of growth.


So what competencies do you need to have on hand to make the most of these channels? It's a surprisingly long list:Fluency in bidding and audience levers on each channelCreative production and testing at scaleExperience with tracking and taggingMartech fluency (GA4, CRM and email platforms at minimum)Channel contacts who can help with insights and access to early betasThe ability to look at budget holistically (attribution modeling, media mix modeling, lift testing)Even if your in-house resources can account for the first few points (which would put you far ahead of the curve), I almost guarantee you're spending inefficiently within your current channels. The ability to do native-to-platform lift studies and advanced analyses that look at incrementality and marginal return is a difference-maker at any stage – but particularly at this stage, when every dollar of spend and your burn rate should be under scrutiny. This is especially true in 2023, as the gap between Series B and C funding rounds has widened, and Series C funds are much harder to come by.Related: 3 Marketing Fails That Demonstrate The Importance of FundamentalsHow to reduce mistakes in early-stage growth marketingAt this growth stage, striking a balance between being too cautious and moving too quickly is key, and it's hard to do. It's a state of being for early-stage marketers, particularly those with VCs or private equity investors scrutinizing the use of their investment dollars, to feel the crunch of time and budget in bringing a product or service to the mainstream.


The common mistakes I see at this stage involve spending where a channel/product or channel/audience fit hasn't been firmly established; spending to acquire customers who would have purchased anyway; ignoring current customers in the rush to acquire new ones; and tying up resources in unnecessarily long commitments.Related: Should Your Small Business Hire a Marketing Agency or Build a Marketing Team?Early-stage growth marketing: the agency/in-house debateIf none of the above mistakes apply to you, and if your marketing team can account for all the core competencies I listed, your biggest takeaway should be giving those team members whatever they ask to stay with your company. You don't need to pay for an agency, and you should feel secure in knowing that your marketing team has a more thorough understanding of and investment in your company's goals, objectives and philosophies than any agency will.If, on the other hand, you know your team is too small or stretched too thin to cover the above, or you would value the perspective of an objective third party on your approach to meeting your business goals, it's time to start researching potential agency partners. If you're at that step, look for agencies with a strong perspective on customer retention and demonstrated experience in driving scale and efficiency within your vertical, and ask them to analyze your current media mix setup.


If you've chosen your shortlist well, each agency will be able to demonstrate the potential value of working with them. The right agency partner will work with you on contract terms that will keep you from tying up too many funds over the long term (and for what it's worth, something that every agency owner has learned during economic dips is that it's much easier logistically, financially and emotionally to fire an agency than to fire a colleague). But don't settle for an agency doing grunt work and simply taking orders; make sure they can proactively define a strategy to get you several steps further on the growth path and demonstrate a holistic understanding of the challenges in your space.What's nextGrowth at this stage is a high-speed blend of action, analysis and planning to enable future growth. It's a tough blend for fully resourced teams and an even tougher ask of teams trying to assess hiring needs on the fly. Whether it's an outside party or expertise already baked into your team, a resource with the time and perspective to help you plan for the year ahead, not just the week to come, is essential to longer-term growth.Speaking of longer-term growth, I'll close the series with a look at an ideal marketing function for established brands – remember, it's harder to stay on the mountaintop than to get there.

66,How to Think Like an Investor When Preparing Your Pitch Deck,"Sep 21, 2023",Vikas Agrawal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-think-like-an-investor-when-preparing-your-pitch-deck/457339,"
Startups are no longer confined to their local markets for fundraising. In the last decade, global venture capital (VC) investment in the startup ecosystem surged from $347 billion in 2010 across 31,623 deals to $671 billion in 2021 across 38,644 deals.Startups are looking for more than just cold monetary transactions to fuel their growth and global exposure.Today, successful startup fundraising boils down to one single most important thing: the pitch deck. It's still the golden ticket for startups to secure both local and global VC funding. However, there are strategic differences between these two.



Related: Stop Giving Boring Presentations — Follow These 6 Presentations Hacks to Captivate Your AudienceThe differences between the investment strategies of local and global VC firmsLocal VC firms usually invest close to home, often within their own country. This is usually because they know their local market well, including its trends and regulatory nuances. Moreover, they often invest based on personal connections and grasp local culture and business habits well. This helps them pick and support startups that fit well in their region.


Local VC firms typically invest in newer startups but in well-known markets. They're also a bit more careful with their investments, building trust and checking everything before investing.As their name suggests, global VC firms invest all over the world. They're open to investing in startups from different countries, giving them a wider view and spreading their risks. Usually, they have a mix of investments in different areas and industries. And they're especially interested in new tech and business ideas that can change industries.They mostly invest in startups that have already shown some success and focus on newer markets. They're willing to take more risks and generally quicker in making decisions. While they, too, check everything before investing, they are more likely to invest if they feel there is an excellent opportunity.So, it's fair to say there are some basic differences in their investment perspectives. That's why your pitch deck must be more than just a presentation for securing global VC funding and exposure.


Let's dig deeper into the stats.Techcrunch analyzed that VC investors are spending 24% less time evaluating pitch decks in 2022 than in 2021.According to Infobrandz's recent research paper, global startup funding astonishingly crashed down from $42 billion in 2021 to $25 billion in 2022, 40.5% less than in 2021, as investors were looking for more risk-averse investment opportunities.A recent industry research report published by AstelVentures highlights that you have to capture investors' attention in the first 30 seconds or first 2 to 3 slides of your pitch deck presentation else you risk losing them for the rest of the presentation.Factually, it's getting tougher to win global investment, and your pitch deck can turn it around.Related: Here's What's Brewing in the Minds of Startup InvestorsProven pitch deck trendsLet's now study the trends and understand the investors' perspective here. After all, investors see hundreds, if not thousands, of pitch decks each year. So, finding what sets the successful ones apart is crucial so you can learn what investors look for and optimize your pitch deck accordingly.


First, visual content plays an increasingly crucial role in a pitch deck. This is because it helps to simplify complex information, making it easier for investors to understand your business model, market opportunity, and growth strategy. A well-designed pitch deck can make a lasting impression, helping you stand out in a sea of startups. Investors also want to see that you've identified a significant problem and have a unique solution that is different and better than what's currently available, as this directly affects your sales. Moreover, investors are looking for businesses that can scale over time. They want to see a large and growing market for your product or service to ensure long-term returns.Most importantly, they want to know how you will make money. This is a key question investors want answered to see a clear and viable business model that shows potential for high returns. But one key factor is as important as the numbers and aesthetics — a factor often missed in pitches. Yes, I'm talking about the human factor!Investors invest in people as much as they invest in their business ideas. They want to see a passionate, capable team with the skills and experience to execute the business plan. After all, it's often the grit and determination of the team that makes all the difference when a business faces challenges in a volatile market.How to craft a pitch deck in 2023Now that we understand what investors are looking for, how do we craft a pitch deck that ticks all the boxes?Here are the essential elements of a Pitch Deck:Storytelling and design — A successful pitch deck tells a compelling story about your business idea and team. It uses visual content to engage the audience, create an emotional connection, and make the business idea come alive. The pitch deck's design should be professional, clean, and on-brand.Data and validation — Investors want proof. Include data that validates your market opportunity, business model, and growth projections. This could be in the form of market research, customer testimonials, or key performance indicators that are presented aesthetically.Call to action — End your pitch deck with a catchy and convincing call to action. What do you want investors to do next? Whether scheduling a follow-up meeting or investing in your startup, make sure it's clear and compelling.Understanding the investor's perspective is key to crafting a successful pitch deck, as the future of global fundraising is likely to be even more interconnected and competitive. Further, startups that can adapt to the evolving funding landscape, leverage technology, and align to the multi-cultural nature of the business will be well-positioned to stand out in the international arena.

67,6 Strategies for Optimizing Cash Management When Starting a Business,"Sep 20, 2023",Stephen Bittel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-optimizing-cash-management-is-a-critical-early-lesson/458867,"
I was asked in an interview once what the three biggest mistakes I made were when starting my business. In coming up with a response, I quickly realized they all revolved around cash management. (For those wondering, I started undercapitalized and with a negative net worth, not understanding the importance of managing a balance sheet and cash flow, and entering a number of down business cycles without enough liquidity to seize opportunities properly.)Effective cash management is an indispensable skill for entrepreneurs. It plays a pivotal role in the success and sustainability of a venture, and if the metaphor for a business is an engine, cash would certainly be the fuel. Without proper management of cash resources, i.e., enough fuel to keep the engine running, no business can survive, no matter how good the idea is.Related: 3 Cash-Management Strategies for Improving Cash Flow Issues and Optimizing Efficiency



The challenges of cash flowEntrepreneurs must understand cash flow dynamics as early on in the process of starting their business as possible. It allows you to anticipate and manage your company's financial health, weighing sources such as customer payments, loans or investments against rent, payroll and supplier payments, to name just a few inflows and outflows. The timing of these inflows and outflows can seriously impact a company's ability to cover its financial obligations, invest in growth and weather financial uncertainties.Businesses in their earlier stages are also more likely to face challenges with cash flow due to their newness and instability. Irregular revenue streams, high upfront costs for product development or marketing, and the time it takes to establish a customer base are all stepping stones that are unique to new businesses that hold the potential to make or break a company. Entrepreneurs also may underestimate the time it takes to convert sales into cash, leading to temporary cash shortages. Seasonal fluctuations, unexpected expenses, or delays in accounts receivable collection can exacerbate cash flow problems.


When cash isn't managed effectively, it becomes a struggle to meet its financial obligations, leading to missed payments, damaged supplier relationships and even — God forbid — legal troubles. As I experienced myself in the early days of my company, insufficient cash reserves can also hinder growth opportunities and prevent a business from capitalizing on strategic opportunities or adapting to market changes. Consistent poor cash management will eventually erode confidence in your company, making it difficult to secure funding in the future or build new partnerships. Ultimately, poor cash management causes much more than financial woes; it's a fundamental threat to a business's overall sustainability.Related: 10 Expert Tips on Managing Cash Flow as a New BusinessStrategies for optimizing cash managementWhile my company is now over four decades old, I can still remember the pain points I felt in my early days of learning cash management. Below, I have highlighted what I believe to be essential strategies for getting a handle on cash flow early on and setting your business up for success and longevity.Create and maintain a cash flow projection: First and foremost, entrepreneurs should always have a detailed cash flow projection that outlines expected cash inflows and outflows over a period of time. Companies should aspire to be proactive rather than reactive whenever possible. With a well-constructed cash flow projection, entrepreneurs can make informed decisions about resource allocation while also mitigating financial uncertainties.Set realistic financial goals: This may seem like a no-brainer, but you would be surprised how many people don't understand what ""realistic financial goals"" entail. Whether you are a party of one or your business has grown into a team, short-term and long-term financial goals in tandem create a roadmap that guides decision-making. Without clear and achievable financial goals, overspending and underspending are more likely.Keep an eye on costs: Make a point to regularly review your expenses and identify areas where costs can be reduced or eliminated without compromising the quality of your products or services. Consistency is the key factor that is most often neglected, but what was once deemed essential can become superfluous in just a few months. We all have that subscription service that is being charged to our personal bank account each month even though we no longer use it—small expenses over time can quickly add up to be large detriments and opportunities lost as a result.Negotiate supplier terms: Another common trait I have noticed in entrepreneurs first starting out, is a hesitancy to negotiate. Our society's relationship with money is strange — many of us have grown up being taught that talking about money at all is impolite, but to successfully optimize cash management, one must get comfortable with speaking openly about it. Negotiating favorable payment terms with suppliers, such as extended payment deadlines or early payment discounts, can help you manage your cash flow more effectively.Consider cash reserves: Maintain an emergency cash reserve to cover unexpected expenses or revenue fluctuations. Having cash on hand ensures you can continue operations without relying on credit in times of need. Much of the narrative today likes to talk about how we live in ""uncertain times."" Still, as someone who has navigated a business through several financial downturns over the past forty years, I can tell you that there will always be periods when you need to be able to rely on cash reserves. Don't underestimate their importance.Regularly review and adjust: Cash management is an ongoing process that requires continuous attention and adjustment. Regularly monitoring cash flow and reviewing your budget makes your business agile and resilient in the face of changing market conditions, allowing you to seize opportunities and mitigate financial risks effectively. As the saying goes, there is no ""holding steady"" in business.It's a dynamic world, and optimizing cash management means consistently reassessing what is working and what isn't for your business. The earlier you learn this, the better.

68,Bootstrapping vs. Seeking Venture Capital — How to Decide the Best Avenue for Your Business,"Sep 15, 2023",Cyrus Claffey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/bootstrapping-vs-venture-capital-whats-best-for-your/458872,"
Every person who's founded a business knows that financing your idea is one of the hardest but most important early steps. In fact, creating a stable financial nest for your new company might be the difference between a company that thrives and one that fizzles out.There are two primary methods of financing: looking for venture capital and bootstrapping. Choosing which financing method you go with is a crucial decision that may have long-term impacts on your business.So, how should you decide which method to pursue?Related: 9 Advantages Of Bootstrapping Your CompanyBootstrappingBootstrapping is the process of starting a business with no outside funding. This is an achievable way to start your company because you can focus on building your team and product exactly how you want. Further, bootstrapping typically means you'll reach an initially smaller audience, so you'll have time to get feedback from early users before launching to a wide audience.



The advantages of bootstrapping include a bigger focus on customers. Because you don't have a huge nest egg, pleasing your early customers is your lifeline. So, you'll focus more on user retention and building long-term customer relationships.Disadvantages of this creative financing option include slower growth. Because you're funding yourself, you'll have less access to expensive technology that affords fast production processes. Further, you'll have to rely more on personal savings or debt in order to jumpstart your business.Seeking venture capitalOn the other hand, you may opt to seek venture capital. Venture capital is a type of financing through private equity. In other words, investors put money into your business, betting that it will become a successful venture. By going with venture capital, your business will grow faster, resulting in a quick return on investment.The benefits of venture capital include less personal risk. You're not pouring your own money into the business, so you don't risk losing your own money. Additionally, getting a loan from a credible investor will increase your own credibility.


However, drawbacks of venture capital include the expectation to grow quickly and the initial reduction of your stakes as an owner of the business.Related: 6 Important Factors Venture Capitalists Consider Before InvestingChoosing the best financing optionThe decision between bootstrapping and looking for venture capital depends largely on the state of growth that you're in. In fact, many great investors often want to see evidence that you've successfully bootstrapped for the first stage of your business.But why? Because successful bootstrapping serves as evidence that you're smart and hardworking — and that you've got a good idea.


However, say your business is in an industry that requires a large amount of upfront research, such as the biomedical or electric car companies. In this case, you'll need a huge amount of capital, which will likely require raising money from outside investors. But if you can bootstrap the formation of the company and proof of concept, you'll face less dilution in the venture capital process as the founder. Further, it means you can embrace a lean-and-mean, efficient philosophy toward operations.In this case, you prove that you're efficient when it comes to using capital. It also proves you're more resourceful than some business owners and entrepreneurs. Further, it shows that you can be innovative out of necessity.So, if you're creating a good product and your business is successful, you'll begin to gain traction in your industry. Then, there will inevitably come a time when you start to outgrow the resources that are available to you on your balance sheet. As a result, your own bootstrapping funds will cease to be able to fund your business's growth as aggressively as necessary.When this happens, it's likely best to raise outside capital. In fact, this is often the best way to take advantage of the opportunity you've created for yourself. In this case, you should have an easier time finding funding.


Why seeking growth capital is easier than seeking startup fundingHistorically, it's easier to find growth capital than it is to seek startup funding. So, because you've bootstrapped for a period of time, you've given yourself the opportunity to prove the viability of your idea. As a result, seeking venture capital will be easier as you can approach investors with successful results about your company.At the end of the day, how you fund your business is up to you. Your own evaluation of the state of your business, the viability of your product and the potential of your business to generate profit should help you determine which avenue is best for you. Bootstrapping and seeking venture capital both have significant benefits and drawbacks. So, you should evaluate where you are in your business when choosing between the two.Most likely, the best option is a combination of the two. Consider the stage that your business is in when deciding whether to choose bootstrapping or seeking venture capital in order to guarantee the highest level of success.Related: How I Bootstrapped to $100 Million Without Venture Capital Funding

69,4 Strategies for Creating a Compelling Business Plan That Actually Attracts Investors — and Secures Funding,"Sep 15, 2023",Mark Hauser,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-strategies-for-crafting-a-business-plan-that-attracts/458545,"
According to data from Teten Advisors, the median investor in private companies reviews over 80 opportunities in order to make a single investment. As someone who has been working in private equity and investing for over three decades, I can confirm that this number sounds about in line with my experience.While the due diligence process is rigorous and involves exploratory and confirmatory checks into practically every aspect of the business, before that process can even begin, an investor must be hooked by a compelling business plan. More than a mere task, here's how crafting a business plan is an opportunity to articulate your business's true potential.Related: How Startups Can Attract the Right Type of Investors



1. Understanding overall investor expectationsFrom venture capitalists to angel investors, there are a few key elements that are sought after in a business plan across investor classes. At the heart of every investor's scrutiny is the quest for a clear and viable path to profitability. Your business plan must be able to provide a meticulously outlined roadmap that navigates from the present to a future that is both lucrative and financially sustainable. Investors seek hard evidence of your business model's viability, the scalability of your operations and the potential for impressive returns on their investment.However, while numbers are certainly persuasive, investors also seek a compelling narrative that communicates not just the ""what"" but the ""why"" behind your business. Going beyond metrics, it's essential to showcase your understanding of the market, your customers' pain points and how your solution uniquely addresses these challenges. Essentially, investors want to know that you're not just offering a product or service but contributing to a larger story of transformation and value creation.


It's no easy task balancing factual data and captivating storytelling, and in my time investing I have seen thousands of business plans that skew too far in both directions. It takes finesse, but achieving that balance is what sets apart a winning business plan. Providing a comprehensive overview of your financial projections while infusing the narrative with passion, purpose and a vision for growth captures the essence of investor expectations.2. Risk mitigation and investor confidenceAs investors, we appreciate transparency. It may seem like a business plan should project positivity and avoid pointing out potential problems, but acknowledging hurdles and articulating contingency plans demonstrates preparedness and enhances our confidence in your ability to navigate uncertainties.Addressing risks isn't just about managing potential crises; it's a testament to your ability to adapt and pivot when circumstances change. Investors seek reassurance that you have a contingency plan in place, a roadmap for resilience that ensures your business can weather unforeseen challenges. A well-considered risk mitigation strategy avoids reactive measures by building proactive tools for strategic decision-making.Presenting a robust risk mitigation framework within your business plan is not just a formality — it's an invitation for investors to embark on a journey of calculated growth with you. Risks are inevitable, and nobody is more acutely aware of this than investors. What distinguishes an exceptional business plan is not the absence of risks, but rather the transparency and foresight with which these risks are managed.

Showcasing team dynamics and execution strategyProfiling a team's expertise, track record and ability to execute your vision is an often underestimated but integral aspect of a business plan. Data and financial projections provide a solid foundation, but the people behind the numbers are the ones who actualize a venture's success. In my time in private equity, I've witnessed firsthand the transformational power of a skilled and motivated team.Introducing key team members not only imparts a human dimension to your business plan but also offers insight into the talent that fuels your organization's potential. A team with a proven track record, complementary skills and a shared commitment to the venture's success is a compelling indicator of your ability to execute your vision. Sharing anecdotes that highlight instances of successful teamwork or innovative solutions can illustrate these dynamics, offering a glimpse into the operational alignment that underpins your execution strategy.4. Customizing your approachInvestors may all share a common goal — to identify lucrative opportunities — but their paths to investment can differ significantly. By customizing your approach, you not only maximize the appeal of your business plan but also demonstrate your commitment to understanding and catering to the specific expectations of your target investor. Below I will provide a brief general overview of the three investor classes that are most often discussed in the private sector: venture capitalists, angel investors and private equity investors.


For venture capitalists seeking exponential growth and early-stage innovation, a focus on disruptive technologies, scalability and market expansion can be particularly compelling. Addressing their appetite for high-risk, high-reward opportunities and showcasing a well-calibrated strategy for capturing market share can resonate powerfully.Angel investors, often drawn to supporting the underdog and betting on visionary founders, appreciate personal narratives and the passion that drives entrepreneurial journeys. A compelling backstory, a clear articulation of your dedication to the venture and a keen awareness of the human element can resonate deeply with this investor class.Related: Are You Approaching Investors With No Business Plan and Fuzzy Profit Projections? Get Real.Private equity players, on the other hand, often prioritize proven business models, established revenue streams and tangible pathways to profitability. Demonstrating a steady and calculated approach to growth, backed by data-driven insights, can align with their preference for more mature and stable opportunities. Customization doesn't merely involve tweaking language or figures; it requires a fundamental understanding of what drives each type of investor. It's about presenting your venture in a way that resonates with their motivations.


A meticulously crafted business plan is your most potent tool in the competitive landscape of securing an investment. By understanding and addressing investor concerns, effectively portraying risk management strategies and harmonizing your team's prowess with an engaging narrative, you'll create a blueprint that resonates with a diverse array of investors and paves the way for your entrepreneurial success.

70,Pitching to Journalists and Investors Is Like Playing a Game of Cards. Here's How to Know Which Ones Will Help You Win.,"Sep 14, 2023",Evgeniya Zaslavskaya,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/pitching-to-journalists-and-investors-is-like-playing-a/458572,"
Pitching your story to journalists and investors is similar to playing a game of cards. Although the outcome does depend on your strategy and experience, it is still largely determined by what's in your hand. The thing is, to get the most out of the cards received, it is necessary to realize their value.So, let's discuss what can become your trump cards and help you achieve your goals — and how to use them properly.Joker: $10+ funding roundWhen pitching news to journalists, a large investment amount can become your joker. If a company has raised over $10 million, top media outlets will unlikely remain indifferent. Crunchbase data shows that US Series A funding has declined for five consecutive quarters. The situation with Series B funding is no better — it's even harder to raise. The chances of startups reaching these stages have never been exceptionally high, but the decline in venture capital makes the task even more difficult.



It also means that journalists are likely to pay attention to your project if you get past this milestone. News about companies raising millions of dollars and guest posts about how they managed to do it in such a volatile economy regularly appear in Techcrunch, Forbes, Venture Beat, Entrepreneur and other media outlets. So, it's much easier for a startup that has attracted such funding to pitch its success story to editorial boards.Although the odds of winning the game with a joker increase dramatically, you'll also need trumps for sustained success. Let's talk about them now.Related: 5 Ways to Make Journalists Actually Want to Publish Your Brand's StoriesIndustry reports with exclusive figuresUnique market data may be the trump ace that will help you get into top-tier media outlets. A cybersecurity company specializing in preventing DDoS attacks can collect information on the number and types of such attacks in different regions, as well as the most attack-prone industries, and share the results with journalists. At the very least, this story may be published on specialized cybersecurity news websites. And at most, international publishers with a broader profile and audience, such as Bloomberg and CNBC, will express their interest.An important tip from my experience is to consider the specifics of a particular media outlet. If you want to pitch your report to a news agency that writes about the UAE, don't try to focus on global trends in your story, as editors will be primarily interested in the local situation. And vice versa, if you aim to get into the global technology and business media, emphasize the international trends and how the industry is changing.A well-known investorWith an investment of at least $1 million, this card can be your trump jack, queen or even king. A high-profile investor can attract media attention for two reasons. First, the name of a recognized venture fund or business angel can hook the reader and compel them to read the entire article. Second, it is a quality marker for journalists. If an experienced investor noticed a project, there is a higher chance that the startup makes a worthwhile product. Of course, this is not always the case — the story of Theranos shows otherwise. Still, the project gained worldwide fame even before the scandal.


This trump card works exceptionally well if the investment made is the first of its kind for the fund — or, on the contrary, continues a series of funding rounds in a particular area. For example, in 2022, Techcrunch wrote about a16z investing in BreederDAO, a blockchain-based producer of digital assets for games and virtual worlds. Before this, a16z had supported several other decentralized solutions, which caught journalists' attention. And in 2023, Reuters mentioned that Sequoia made its first investment into defense technology company Mach Industries.Having a reputable investor on board also becomes a trump when raising the next round. At the very least, they can help founders with valuable contacts in the industry. One study shows that 20% of venture deals come from referrals by other investors. Plus, the fact that someone experienced has invested in the company means that they have already conducted due diligence, evaluated the market, competitors, product and team —and concluded that the deal is worth the risk, which enhances the reputation of the project in the eyes of venture capitalists.Innovative technologyIf you have developed a unique solution and can prove it — congratulations, that's another trump card. I'm pretty sure that you've seen articles with headlines like ""This startup is looking to..."" more than once in major media outlets. For instance, ""This startup is zapping seawater to tackle climate change"" in The Verge or ""This startup wants to give farmers a closer look at crops-from space"" in Wired. Often, subjects of these stories try to tackle pressing issues, such as staff shortages in the healthcare industry, food crisis or global warming, through technology. So, if you offer a truly innovative solution, especially if you are solving a critical social problem, the chance of seeing a feature about your startup in a top media outlet increases dramatically.However, often, more than this is needed. In our practice, there was a case where a top-tier journal was interested in a healthcare robotics project but agreed to publish a longread about it only when the team got first clients on board. In the case of The Verge story mentioned above, partnership with Boeing became one of the startup's chips, which helped it to win the pitching game. If you don't have that, the task can get more complicated.


Plus, in some cases, pitching to investors may take more time and effort. Suppose we are talking about a complex, innovative high-tech product, for example, in biotechnology or alternative energy industries. In that case, many investors may be scared off by the long payback period and the hardships associated with hardware development.Still, if you are disrupting a niche and can provide supporting documents such as patents, a detailed description of the technology, test results, competitors and market analysis — you've added a trump card to your hand.Related: The 10 Things You Should Cover in Every Investment Pitch (Infographic)Successful entrepreneurial experienceIf your past projects have succeeded, it will be easier for you to attract your target audience's attention. And if you have already created a market leader, count that as your trump king or ace, both for the media outlets and investors.


The most straightforward example confirming both theses is Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork, who raised $350 million from a16z for his new real estate startup, Flow. Major media outlets wrote about it because of the huge investment amount, the well-known investor and the fact that it was Neumann, the founder of a coworking giant. His controversial past didn't scare off a16z. General partner Chris Dixon said of Adam, ""He's one of the few founders — I mean, he's one of the only people in the world who has built a real estate brand name.""If the previous project was successful but did not reach such heights as WeWork, such a trump card will unlikely change the situation without others and may not help you get into the top-tier media. But it is indispensable when pitching to investors because, at the early stage, they look at the team first. With an experienced founder in front of them, they will be more interested in considering the project. According to PitchBook, the fundraising process is easier for serial entrepreneurs. Moreover, they get a deal size and preliminary valuation 2-4 times higher than their less experienced colleagues.News tied to current eventsJournalists want their stories to be relevant. Tying your pitch to current events greatly increases your chances of being mentioned. Since no one can constantly generate breakthrough news, it's a great way to stay in the spotlight. During the pandemic, media outlets featured compilations of projects fighting Covid-19, stories about companies that had to change strategies to stay afloat, and guest posts about how different technologies can help to stop coronavirus from spreading. Of course, you can't predict how things will turn out and when your expertise and product will be most relevant to journalists. Still, keeping a finger on the pulse and seizing the right moment can become your trump card.As your company grows, you will acquire more and more trumps. The best part is that they will stay with you for future battles, unlike in a real game of cards. For example, the ""Attracted substantial funding from a recognized investor"" card will definitely help you in the next round of pitching. The more trumps you have, the stronger the player you are — the easier it is to win even the most challenging games: getting top-tier media coverage and finding new investors through publications.

71,3 Essential Funding Factors to Consider If You Want Your Startup to Bloom,"Sep 8, 2023",Greg Waisman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-essential-factors-your-startup-should-consider-if-you/458052,"
Venture capital funding has always been a complex and highly competitive landscape where startups and established businesses alike vie fiercely for investor attention and financial backing. And in recent times, this state of things has only grown progressively worse.Over the past two years, global markets have observed a continuous fall in venture capital funding. In Q1 2023, the figure reached $76 billion, less than half the amount recorded in 2022 ($162 billion). Funding into the fintech sector amounted to just $23 billion in the first half of 2023. At the same time, the number of funding rounds dropped by 64% compared to the same period in 2022.The investor sentiment is waning, and to survive in this grim climate, startups must be capable of rapidly adapting to changes and possess a sensible MVP capable of attracting investors and customers alike. These are the foundation upon which a business is built and from which it can improve based on evolving customer needs and emerging market trends.



Let's look at how companies can adapt their operations in a challenging environment where investors are becoming more cautious and their funding scarcer.Adapt your startup to the realities of the BANI worldBefore we get into the detailed recommendations on what parts of your business you should focus on when seeking investment opportunities, I believe it important to point your attention to a more overarching matter. Namely, the modern-day business landscape in which companies find themselves operating.


In today's rapidly changing global environment, any startup founder must know the BANI world and understand its nuances and rules. BANI stands for ""Brittle, Anxious, Non-Linear, and Incomprehensible,"" representing the key characteristics of the current business environment.Today's world is prone to sudden disruptions and shocks that can significantly impact businesses and their activities. As such, leaders must learn to anticipate potential risks and build resilience within their organizations. To maintain an efficient business in times of uncertainty and volatility, leaders need to monitor market dynamics constantly, understand the ongoing trends and adapt their strategies accordingly.In short, understanding the modern realities is essential for heads of startups to successfully steer their companies towards growth and secure investments from stakeholders who value adaptability and foresight. It is particularly important for startup founders, as such businesses already tend to start their journeys in a financially vulnerable position. Failing to acknowledge the aspects of the BANI world may leave them ill-prepared to face disruptions, competition, market shifts and other threats.By taking care to keep an eye on these complexities, on the other hand, founders can make more informed decisions and adjust their business strategies accordingly. This can build their organizations more resiliently and attract investments by showcasing their ability to thrive in a rapidly changing and challenging environment.


Now that we have cleared up the BANI world issue, let's take a closer look at the actions that startup founders can take when fundraising. Based on personal experience, I recommend focusing on three main aspects of your business when you're planning to engage with promising investors.Related: How to Adapt in a Rapidly Changing Economy1. Grow your revenue rather than your turnoverWhen the market is going through a boom, investors tend to look at how rapidly a company can grow and capture its share in the market. But in today's business landscape, it is more important for them to understand that a company can endure and survive in harsh circumstances. And survive for a long time, at that. If you have the capacity to be profitable on top of that, then all the better for you.Make sure to demonstrate this fact openly and proudly, as it would make a lot of sense for investors to invest in you to drive this success further and get their share of the profit from it.

Pay attention to your company's data and analyticsShowcase figures that would indicate to investors that your business is viable and that they can invest in it safely. In my own company, for example, we demonstrated how much we managed to reduce costs while boosting revenue simultaneously. Things like that give investors the information that you can operate effectively, which worked to great effect for us.3. Show that you can make responsible financial decisionsIf investors are to put their money into your startup, it would put their minds at ease to know that you can invest said money competently and precisely. More specifically, under the current market conditions, pouring funds into things that yield a quick result is necessary. You are required to be able to adapt to market trends and make quick decisions that provide quantifiable outcomes.Fundamentally, the most important thing is to demonstrate a set of skills and tools that would indicate to investors that your business can maintain itself regardless of the outside conditions in a market filled with uncertainty.


Related: How to Think Outside the Box and Craft a Values-Aligned Investment OfferingData-driven decisions give businesses the power to growBy staying updated on industry developments, customer preferences and the competitive landscape, businesses can identify opportunities and adapt their strategies to stay ahead of the curve. This requires strategic thinking, flexible problem-solving skills and a willingness to take calculated risks. It falls to the company leadership to monitor performance and make informed decisions that would enable their business to maintain a level of success attractive to investors.

72,I'm a Human Lie Detector — You Can Be Too If You Learn to Read These 5 Facial Expressions,"Sep 6, 2023",Annie Särnblad,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-read-expressions-to-tell-when-someones-lying/457638,"
My clients often refer to me as a human lie detector because I can read microexpressions and see what people are feeling at the exact moment they feel it.Microexpressions are the fleeting, involuntary facial expressions that precede the thought process. They are universal and hardwired into humans and present on our faces regardless of age, gender, culture or geographic location. Even someone well-trained can't mask their facial tells — unless they change their thoughts.Related: This Body-Language Expert's 'Triangle' Method Will Help You Catch a Liar in the Act



I have spent two decades working as a strategic advisor, and my ability to see what all parties in a meeting are feeling has made me an excellent resource for my clients, both in negotiations and in communicating effectively with various stakeholders.Now I train other professionals how to read microexpressions using a simple and systematic methodology that I developed while living abroad for 25 years in nine countries and studying eight languages through immersion. This easy-to-absorb approach works especially well for people in power who have limited time and want immediate takeaways.


Here are five microexpressions to look for in negotiations to make you a human lie detector yourself.1. The NO FaceImage Credit: Courtesy of Annie SärnbladIn any negotiation, pay attention to when the other party shows that they don't like something. Recognizing this allows us to pivot and adjust. The NO face has three parts:1. Squishy wrinkles on the sides of the nose2. Pulling up the upper lip3. Deep shadows on the sides of the nostrilsIn the microexpression of NO, we usually just see the nose wrinkles and the nostril shadows twitch on one side, like a bunny rabbit wiggling its nose. Because this motion can last only a fraction of a second, plant your gaze on the lower part of the face when you come to a pivotal part of the negotiation or pitch. Note: Don't keep your gaze fixed on the mouth area for more than three seconds, because this could send a signal to the other person that you want to kiss them, and that's an entirely different discussion!2. Holding Back


Image Credit: Courtesy of Annie SärnbladThis facial expression is the equivalent of biting our tongues. Think of it as the ""I have something to say but don't think it's the right time or place to say it"" expression. If you see this expression in a meeting, the person showing it will likely tell you what they are holding back when you get them away from the group… because they are already itching to say it.This gives you a chance to build a connection by presenting the person with an opportunity to talk about something important to them. Holding back shows in a bubble underneath the lower lip. This expression looks like someone's taken a pinch of chewing tobacco and placed it between their lower lip and their bottom teeth. It's not technically a microexpression because it takes a lot of muscles to twist your face into this position, and as such is usually held for a longer duration.Related: 10 Telltale Phrases That Indicate Somebody Isn't Telling the Truth3. Joy (the YES Face)


Image Credit: Courtesy of Annie SärnbladThe most important part of the expression of Joy is the rise of the cheeks, and the easiest place to see if the cheeks have risen is in the area under our eyes. Normally the skin in this area is flat; however, when the cheeks rise, it bulges because it has nowhere else to go. I call these bulges ""smile bags."" If you see a person with smile bags in a negotiation, they like what was just said. Seeing that someone is enthusiastic about where you're going in a conversation gives you an opportunity to close your deal or possibly expand your ask.4. Oh Crap!Image Credit: Courtesy of Annie Särnblad""Oh crap!"" is what I call the microexpression of fear. In this expression, a person pulls one corner of the mouth diagonally down toward the respective shoulder, often while making a reverse hissing sound. We make this face when we're worried about something that could potentially happen — it's a piece of anticipatory anxiety.I've seen this expression many times in M&A deals. For example, if one party says, ""I want to make sure the technology will be ready for market in the next six months,"" and the other party says, ""Absolutely!"" while making this microexpression, there's a problem. The person making the expression doesn't believe what they are saying, and more investigation is needed.


Related: Use This Secret Military Trick to Tell if Someone Is Lying5. MaybeImage Credit: Courtesy of Annie SärnbladThe ""maybe"" face pulls both lip corners down at the same time with closed lips. It looks like a child has drawn a big frown on the face, and it often comes with a shoulder shrug. Some people believe this expression indicates disbelief, but I disagree. It means, ""Maybe… I'm not yet convinced, but I could be."" If you're in a sales pitch and someone makes this expression, you're not finished convincing them that your solution will meet their needs — more work is needed.If you want to learn more than 30 facial expressions and test yourself with photographs, see my book, The Facial Expressions Glossary.

73,6 AI Tools to Make Building Business Relationships 10 Times Easier,"Aug 30, 2023",Lirone Glikman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/6-ai-tools-to-make-building-business-relationships-10-times/457361,"
Building strong business connections has always been a cornerstone of success. Creating meaningful relationships and nurturing professional bonds with a wide variety of people can unlock exciting opportunities and collaborations, driving growth, influence and impact. But as I keep telling my students, while human communication hasn't changed much in thousands of years, artificial intelligence (AI) opens up new means to do so, claiming to overtake many aspects of communication and make it more efficient.As I've been researching the practices and evolution of business relationships for over a decade, there are several core issues people face around business networking:One key challenge is the false perception individuals hold of themselves in relation to networking — they either ""have it"" or not.The second key challenge is the fact that building relationships takes time and energy, and people often lack the motivation to ""work"" on their networking to achieve those valuable connections and ultimately, desired results.So, can AI replace the human touch in connecting with others?



This is a common question I pose during my worldwide lectures. My answer is: I don't believe so for the current version of AI, but it can be used to support the ""groundwork"" aspects of networking.Networking work consists of many small, repetitive actions such as: researching others, identifying common ground, effective communication, composing emails, creating social media posts and skillful follow-ups (where many of us tend to fail). With that in mind, the integration of artificial intelligence and networking has the potential to create a new era of efficiency, personalization and unparalleled insights than ever before.


This is why I would like to share common networking use cases and highlight some transformative AI tools that, if harnessed effectively, can literally reshape and support how we connect with others, cultivate our personal brand, expand our networks, establish meaningful connections and navigate the realm of business relationships towards business results.Related: AI Can Replace (Some) Jobs — But It Can't Replace Human Connection.

76,3 Crucial Strategies for Sustaining Growth in a Competitive Market,"Aug 23, 2023",Shawn Cole,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-crucial-strategies-for-sustaining-growth-in-a-competitive/457132,"
In the early days of a business, there is typically one goal: making sales. Most startups don't have unlimited cash for their operations, so they'll quickly fall apart if they can't attract customers. But those who successfully build a client base face new challenges, including scaling their business for further growth.Scaling a business for growth isn't a simple task. For one thing, startups have limited resources. They can handle only so many sales before hiring more employees or increasing their infrastructure.Managers must recognize a specific tipping point as the signal it's time to boost human or material capital. If they fail to see the signs, the results can be just as disastrous for the company as failing to attract sales in the startup stage.



If you believe your startup organization is nearing the time when scaling is necessary, take the following steps.Related: Want to Scale Your Business? Companies are Using These 5 Strategies Right Now to Unlock Sustainable Growth, And You Should Too.


1. Assess your staffing needsOne of the biggest mistakes companies make when it comes time to scale is hiring the wrong employees to do the job. They often end up with bad hires simply because they need people immediately and can't wait for cream-of-the-crop talent.The cost of a bad hire is difficult to estimate, but SHRM places it around $240,000. You'll incur the expenses of hiring, sourcing and training the employees. If they turn out to be the wrong fit, you'll need to start the process again, requiring more time, effort and money.Additionally, a bad hire can impact your organization, like decreased team morale and lost customers.When organizations solidify their plans for eventual expansion, they're less likely to encounter bad hires. They identify the roles they need to hire for well before it becomes time to fill them. They can start their hiring processes early rather than waiting until the last minute.


Planning ahead gives hiring professionals time to write a thorough job description, conduct lots of interviews and pick the person with the skills to handle the role that best aligns with the company's values.Hiring the right people for your organization is critical in the early stages of a company. They will often form the backbone of the business and set the tone for future employees. A supportive team on board ensures that you start scaling on all four cylinders.Related: How to Scale a Marketing Strategy That Works2. Make financial arrangements to support your growthScaling a business requires an increase in expenses. There are no two ways around it. You'll need more equipment, a bigger advertising budget and a larger team.


If your company doesn't have the bank account to support all these changes, you'll need to find the money elsewhere — by taking on debt or finding an investor who believes in your company's potential for success.It's critical to seek out financial support early. When you know it's almost time to scale, get your accounting books in order if they aren't already. If you don't have a full-fledged accounting team, seek help from a CPA firm that can prepare your financial statements and set up proper internal controls.You'll also want to undergo an audit, as most lenders and investors will want to review approved financials before they provide you with any financing.Once you feel confident about your books, you can research funding opportunities. You'll need to obtain a loan if you don't feel comfortable bringing an outside investor on board. The SBA provides financing opportunities to small businesses, but you'll need to prepare the proper paperwork and collaborate with an SBA lender to qualify.


Carefully consider your funding opportunities and evaluate each to determine which suits your company most. Look for low-interest rates and fair repayment terms if it's a loan. Business owners who prefer to work with investors should realize that they may need to give up some control in their organization, depending on the terms of the agreement.Related: Should You Scale or Should You Grow? (The 2 Strategies Are Not the Same.)3. Define your objectives for the futureWhere do you picture your company in six months, one year or five years? Understanding your vision can help you establish the milestones necessary to achieve your objectives.You'll probably need to set several goals, not just one. For instance, you might envision reaching a certain level of revenue, introducing a new product or opening a location in a new region. Some startups aim to grow their company to a specific level before they sell it to interested investors.


Once you know your goals, it becomes easier to identify what you need to do to meet them. Expanding your revenue will likely require increased marketing expenses, and you may need to bring a few new employees on board. If your goal is opening a new storefront, you must find a property to lease or buy, hire staff and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.The SMART method can help you define reasonable goals to work toward. Under the SMART process, you set specific objectives and a time for meeting them. As you accomplish each milestone, you work toward the next one. It provides a solid infrastructure for your goals that you can easily explain to stakeholders, including employees, clients and financiers.Scaling requires planningMoving an organization from startup to scaling for growth is possible through adequate planning. Some business owners start the process very early before opening their doors to their first customers. Doing so is a good idea and can help you get on the right footing in the initial days of your business.Remember that you'll likely need to adjust your plan as you learn more about your customers and operations. Remember the two critical considerations in scaling a business: staffing and finances. Start your hiring processes early, and determine the roles you must fill as you grow the organization. You'll also need to ensure proper monetary backing as you focus on expansion.


Taking the time to plan thoroughly for the growth of your business will put you in a good position when the time to scale arrives. Your company can avoid many pitfalls when you are prepared.

78,How to Build a Culture of Learning in Startups,"Jul 27, 2023",Roland Polzin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-you-want-to-instill-a-culture-of-learning-in-startups/455815,"
People often ask why I chose to pursue a career in business after serving in the military. One of the reasons for my shift is that I wanted to forge direct, meaningful change in a small and agile organization. The startup environment, which is fast-paced and dynamic, became the perfect place to do that.After starting Wing Assistant, it became apparent that training is vital not only to our own organization but also to all assistants serving our clients (of which many are young startups, too). Based on this vast experience, I want to share my insights through this article for other entrepreneurs to leverage. Training in a startup: How is it special?In early-stage startups, employees often learn on the job. They solve problems on their own and come up with initiatives to meet business goals. This differs from the training that corporate workers often get when they first join an organization, which is typically more structured.



Startups are also more likely to leverage remote work. Having teammates in different time zones or regions could impact collaboration and communication. These realities present unique challenges to entrepreneurs tasked with continuous learning processes.Related: 4 Great Things That Happened When We Went Remote


Shifting paradigms: From training to learningModern organizations must embrace a paradigm shift. They must cultivate a culture of learning. Traditional onboarding focuses on skill acquisition through standardized sessions. These sessions may help a new employee grasp the basics but have a limited impact.Our rapidly evolving world necessitates an openness to change. Focusing on what one can learn encourages constant personal and professional development. It keeps employees balanced—successes are signposts of doing the right thing, while failures are learning opportunities.Learning by doing helps employees focus on addressing the company's immediate needs. They must quickly acquire knowledge and skills that help them manage emerging issues, new technologies and changing customer needs.Related: Managing Your Customers Through Change


How to build a learning cultureBuilding a team that puts a premium on learning doesn't happen overnight. For one, leadership support is crucial. Leaders must set the tone by actively supporting and promoting learning over training. A plan is essential — not a module for strict, by-the-book implementation, but a list of milestones trainees should meet. Create inclusive and supportive learning environments where new employees feel comfortable taking risks, sharing knowledge and experimenting.Like a cross-functional team, establishing a learning community is one way to develop a supportive space. Within a team like this, peer-to-peer learning isn't forced. It's an organic offshoot of working together.Designing engaging learning opportunitiesChanging training methods to suit today's changing work environments involves leveraging technology and tools to engage workers remotely. Even if you have a hybrid or in-office work setup, these tools will enable your new team members to keep learning.For instance, video conferencing and multimedia tools encourage engagement with educational content. Video-on-demand tutorials can also enable employees to pick up skills as needed and return to lessons for individual refresher training. Consider allowing employees to learn remotely to incentivize them to engage in educational activities.


These adaptations allow companies to create learning experiences that adequately support skill development and employee growth.Agile methodologiesIn a startup, rapid prototyping is common. Managers can apply this principle to employee education. Continuously improving training materials by testing and iterating based on employee feedback will refine content and delivery methods.In rapid prototyping, having regular feedback loops in the learning process is vital. Feedback, whether through surveys, focus groups or 1:1's, enables managers to gather insights and make timely adjustments. Implementing feedback keeps learning content adequate and relevant.Lean teams or startups can also leverage Scrum, Kanban or other agile project management frameworks for managing and improving the learning environment. Frameworks like these make the learning process efficient and promote accountability for new employees, thus, ensuring teams stay on track.


Using these frameworks also generates data. For example, managers can match their milestones to time stamps when new employees use Kanban to progress through a learning plan. They will know exactly when their new team members complete certain tasks. Managers can use learning analytics to track everything from engagement to knowledge retention. This means data-driven, purposeful changes can be made to learning plans.Addressing the challenges of remote learningWhile having a remote-focused learning environment has its advantages, it also has drawbacks. For one, connectivity and technology challenges may disrupt remote learning. Overcome these hurdles by ensuring that employees have a stable internet connection. Recommend backup options for remote employees, like mobile hotspots. You may even consider providing access to workspaces such as WeWork. Addressing remote learning challenges and providing support ensures all employees' learning experience is as smooth as possible.Encourage continuous learning among employeesFinally, learning shouldn't stop when the onboarding period does. Organizations can solidify their culture of learning by encouraging employees to seek out new knowledge and skills actively. Empowering self-directed learning allows employees to shape their roles (and, by extension, their careers) to suit their natural talents.Rewarding employees for reaching milestones also bolsters this culture. Celebrating team members' commitment to learning by spotlighting their achievements further motivates continuous development. Simple examples of fostering this are nicely designed learning certificates or LinkedIn certifications.


ConclusionEffective training and development no longer rely on how well a new employee scores on a standardized assessment. Today, companies should embrace agile principles in delivering educational content. Create flexible learning plans, implement feedback loops, use agile project management tools and empower self-directed, on-demand instruction.Doing these things ensures new employees take ownership of their learning and will be ready to take on whatever challenges come their way.

79,How Startups Can Weather the VC Funding Winter,"Jul 25, 2023",Yan Katcharovski,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/what-startups-must-focus-on-to-weather-the-vc-winter/455905,"
The VC winter has shown us the vulnerability of startups that base their foundations on investor funds. The obsession with securing VC backing has sometimes led startups to sideline the cornerstone of any successful business: the customer. This article aims to redefine startup success, highlighting the crucial need for startups to prioritize product-market fit (PMF) over fundraising metrics and showcasing how genuine startups weather the VC winter by addressing real customer needs.While external funding can accelerate growth, it's not a definitive measure of success. Many startup entrepreneurs are under the misconception that securing a hefty investment is the key to a successful startup. However, this approach often leads to a focus on impressing investors rather than serving the target market. The real barometer of startup success should be a robust PMF, an indication that the startup's product or service meets a significant customer need.Navigating the VC winter becomes a lot less daunting when a startup has a PMF. It's the PMF that ensures the relevance and resilience of the startup, even in challenging economic landscapes. A strong PMF suggests that a startup is providing real value to its customers, thereby fostering loyalty and driving organic growth.



Let's look at some real-world examples to understand how focusing on PMF over fundraising can lead to enduring success, even in the face of a VC winter.Related: Startups Need a Plan To Brave the Funding Winter


LinkedIn: From humble beginnings to a networking powerhouseWhen Reid Hoffman and his team launched LinkedIn in 2002, the scars of the dot-com bust were still fresh, and the investment landscape was uncertain. Undeterred by these challenges, the founders instead focused on solving a significant problem: the need for a professional networking platform in an increasingly digital world.Rather than pursuing aggressive fundraising or creating an appealing pitch deck, they channeled their energies into understanding their market and refining their product. This customer-centric approach paid off as LinkedIn began to find traction among professionals who appreciated the value the platform provided.As LinkedIn's user base grew, so did its features and capabilities. The founders listened to their customers, continually tweaking and improving the platform based on their feedback. LinkedIn evolved from a simple networking site to a comprehensive professional platform, providing everything from job postings to professional development resources.Ultimately, LinkedIn's commitment to delivering an effective solution to a real customer problem led to its acquisition by Microsoft in 2016 for an astounding $26.2 billion. LinkedIn's journey underscores the power of focusing on PMF and understanding the market need above all else.


Mailchimp: Prioritizing service over quick monetizationDuring the early 2000s' economic downturn, Mailchimp was born not as a grand venture but as a side project of its founders, Ben Chestnut and Dan Kurzius. They saw a gap in the market — small businesses struggling to afford big-ticket email marketing software.Mailchimp's founders could have sought venture capital funding and scaled quickly, but they decided to focus on their customers and self-fund their venture. This allowed them to fully concentrate on creating a product that was user-friendly and accessible for small businesses.Their dedicated focus on the customer pain point helped Mailchimp gain steady traction. Its user base grew organically as small businesses started to realize the value that Mailchimp brought to their marketing efforts. Despite never raising a penny from external investors, Mailchimp is now a leading email marketing service with millions of users globally.Related: Investors' Advice to Early-Stage Startups During The Funding Winter


Slack: A pivot driven by market needStewart Butterfield, Eric Costello, Cal Henderson and Serguei Mourachov originally founded Tiny Speck in the late 2000s as a gaming company. When their game, Glitch, didn't pan out as expected, they stumbled upon a market need they themselves experienced — efficient team communication.Instead of giving up or seeking more investment to continue their failing game project, they decided to pivot. They developed a tool that allowed for more streamlined and organized communication among their team. Realizing that other teams might also benefit from such a tool, they expanded and refined the product, which became Slack.This willingness to pivot based on market need and prioritizing PMF over securing more investment for their original project laid the foundation for Slack's success. Slack's journey is an inspiring tale of how relentless focus on solving a real problem can lead to unexpected success, even in the midst of an economic downturn. Today, Slack is used by millions of teams worldwide for effective collaboration and communication.Moving forwardNow that we've explored these compelling case studies, let's outline some practical strategies for startups to identify and hone their PMF.


Firstly, startups must spend time understanding their target market and identifying clear customer pain points that their product or service can address. This can be achieved by in-depth market research, customer interviews and prototyping.Secondly, startups should remain flexible and ready to pivot if the market needs change or if their initial product doesn't achieve the desired PMF. The story of Slack is a testament to this.Lastly, startups should focus on constant innovation, ensuring that their product remains relevant and continues to provide value over time.Related: How to Find the Holy Grail of Product-Market Fit


To sum up, focusing on PMF rather than fundraising not only increases a startup's chances of success but also makes it more resilient during challenging times, such as a VC winter. The entrepreneurial ecosystem needs to shift its success parameters from the size of fundraising rounds to the strength of PMF.Our call to action for entrepreneurs is to share their experiences of finding PMF in their ventures and how it helped them weather tough times. Let's initiate a dialogue that underscores the importance of PMF over mere fundraising in the startup journey, shaping a more sustainable and customer-centric startup culture.

80,5 Things Your Pitch Deck Needs to Include for VCs to Consider Investing in Your Company,"Jul 24, 2023",Alexander Chachava,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/to-secure-vc-funding-your-pitch-deck-must-include-these-5/455825,"
Venture capitalists are always on the lookout for the next big thing, and most of them review hundreds of decks monthly. Seasoned VCs need 30 seconds to decide whether the pitch deck is worthy and whether they should proceed and arrange a meeting with the founder.If you're an entrepreneur looking for VC funding, you need to understand what investors are looking for in a company before they decide to invest. Here are five things that should be in your deck, without which Leta Capital won't invest in your company.Related: Seeking Funding? Here Are Five Tips for Creating an Effective Pitch Deck



1. A clear and compelling problem statement in conjunction with the timingFirst, you sell the problem, not the decision. The market need, not the product. VCs are looking for companies that solve real problems for real people. Your deck should clearly articulate the current state your company is changing, why it matters and then how you do it. The problem statement should be clear, concise and compelling. It should show that you've done your research and understand your target market. For example, Airbnb's problem statement was: ""People need affordable, safe, and unique accommodations when they travel."" This statement makes clear that Airbnb is solving a real problem in the travel industry. Moreover, people travel as much as ever before, so the timing was perfect.2. Realistic projections and a scalable modelThere is nothing worse than unrealistic and unprovable projections. If you claim that today you have $10k MRR and two customers, but next year you will make millions, and in 5 years, you will have an IPO, no one will believe you. You just don't have enough data to convince people! Keep in mind that VCs want to invest in companies that can scale and generate significant returns on their investment. Your deck should show that you have a clear and scalable business model that can generate revenue and profit over time. That is why your traction, your business model and your projections should match.


3. Full focus and commitment from the foundersVCs want to invest in companies that have a strong team with a track record of success. But even more than that, VCs want to see the absolute commitment of the founders if we are talking about seed/series A stages when entrepreneurs need to work really hard and invest all the energy and time to boost their startup. Of course, the deck should show that you have a team with the skills and experience necessary to execute on your business plan. The red flag here is if you say that you need to raise money to hire a technical co-founder or lead engineer. In that case, VCs will think that you can't attract and convince technical talent. You should figure out how to convince people to join you on your own — otherwise, how will you create a game-changing company?Related: Five Best Pitch Decks of All Time4. Competitive advantage and a POD among competitorsNo competition? No market. You should admit that if the problem exists, someone is already solving it somehow. Don't belittle competitors, and don't say they are stupid (especially corporations or startups with a proven track record or huge funding). However, VCs want to invest in companies that have a competitive advantage over their competitors.Your deck should show that you have a unique product or service that sets you apart from your competition. For example, Tesla disrupted the automotive industry by offering electric vehicles that were more environmentally friendly and had better performance than traditional gas-powered cars. Their competitive advantage and POD were their focus on innovation, sustainability and design.


5. A clear path to exitVCs want to invest in companies that have a clear path to exit. Of course, investors don't want to fund founders who haven't built the company already want to sell it, but still, your deck should show that you have a plan for how investors can eventually make a return on their investment. This is an art, but nobody promised this would be easy!If you're looking to secure VC funding, your deck needs to show that you have chosen the perfect timing to solve a real problem, that you have a scalable business model executed by a strong and dedicated team, you have a competitive advantage, and your company will give an investor the desired returns after 5-10 years. By including these five things in your deck, you can increase your chances of securing the funding you need to take your company to the next level.Related: How a VC Wants to Be Pitched

I often get the same response when I ask people why they don't post on LinkedIn more often: they can't think of anything to write. If you've ever had this problem, it's very common but easily fixable through a technique I use.And this technique won't just give you a cheat code to an unlimited number of content ideas, it will also help you land clients that want to work with you based on who you are as a person, not just what you offer as a business. Essentially, it will boast your personal brand.Related: 3 Reasons to Keep Posting on LinkedIn, Even if Nobody is Engaging With You

82,Smart Investors Evaluate the Founder More Than Their Pitch. Here's How You Can Persuade Them You're Investable.,"Jul 19, 2023",David Newns,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/smart-investors-evaluate-the-founder-more-than-their-pitch/454710,"
I've invested in more than 25 world-changing, disruptive businesses in the last decade. These innovative companies have made women safer on the streets, children more protected online, people healthier and given us all more fun via some of the world's most entertaining creators. Here's the thing: While all the businesses had a completely new concept at their heart, I invested in the founder more than the idea.What I've learned as a serial entrepreneur and investor is that a business doesn't need to have the best idea in order to be a worthwhile investment — they need an investable founder. Just think about the world's most recognizable entrepreneurs today. Do you know Elon Musk for city guides, Jack Dorsey for a podcasting app or Richard Branson for a student magazine? Of course not. Behind every famous entrepreneurial idea is a pivot or evolution from a determined, skillful founder.Every investor has a healthy appreciation for the unreliability of ideas — so often at the mercy of external influences out of your control — versus the reliability of people. If you have successfully returned 10 times once or twice, you will have already proved yourself a worthy, reliable investee — but what if you haven't? Highly experienced investors have developed an instinct and shorthand to find founders worth investing in.



Many new entrepreneurs misunderstand this, so focus on the wrong things in crucial meetings to raise capital. In the ""shark tank,"" the founder might think it's most important to draw attention towards bullet point three on slide five of their deck, but investors only looked at the headline (as they do with every slide) in order that they can instead peer into your soul. They're more interested in getting a measure of you, not your idea. So what traits are they looking for in you?Related: Here's What's Brewing in the Minds of Startup Investors


1. A superhuman determination to succeedPeople have different reasons for wanting or even needing to succeed. Many that I know like to have control over their lives, from making their own lot better to improving the future for millions (or billions) of people. Whatever is feeding your determination to succeed, make sure it's a deep well.To win, entrepreneurs typically endure relentless decision-making, constant risk-taking and strings of failures. The successful ones are more right than wrong, have great ideas to manage risks and turn failures into opportunities.Determination must be a lifelong habit, too, as founders should have a strong sense of urgency (procrastination won't fly) yet also have an unusual amount of patience (as their idea can take years to come to market or generate profit) combined with persistence. No wonder so many entrepreneurs run marathons and ultramarathons, as being a founder is the ultimate endurance test where resilience is the name of the game.  2. Endless curiosityBeing able to remain insatiably curious allows entrepreneurs to continuously seek new opportunities. So rather than just settling for what you think you know, show investors that you always ask challenging questions and explore different avenues.


Incidentally, this curiosity can usefully extend to skepticism, especially about technology. On the one hand, you should be able to pull things apart from a quality point of view, and on the other hand, you should be able to really focus on what problem you are solving. In the words of my business partner, Chris, ""Question everything.""For a killer combination, put curiosity together with a willingness to break the rules that you're questioning. Asking, ""Why has no one done this?"" could identify a great opportunity to disruptively innovate.Related: Do You Have These 6 Personality Traits? You're More Likely to Score Investors3. Commit to building a great team around youIt's true that, as an entrepreneur, at first you are the proverbial ""chief cook and bottle washer,"" you are doing every role in the business. To grow, you need a team, and to exit (which you will, one way or another) you need a team to run the business after you have moved on. So smart entrepreneurs show interest in building a great team around them.


That's not only co-founders but indeed the total management team that's in (or going to be in) the company. Back to the curiosity point, founders who know what they don't know are really valuable. More than that, ones who can put their ego to the side and see there are specialists — who are better designers or marketers or whatever — are gold.4. Focus on execution more than the ideaThere are new ideas to be discovered, and that's one reason I'm optimistic about the future. We live in a dynamic world, so new ideas are always needed. That said, a great team can execute a mediocre idea, make it great and make a great company. So investors look for your ability to execute. They want to see an exceptionally talented product and technical leadership with domain expertise.So, if you're building a product for a specific market or an ecosystem, ideally you have brilliant experience in that world. When billionaire investor Peter Thiel's fund was investing in cleantech entrepreneurs, they quickly realized that the people wearing suits to pitch for capital were salesmen with no real technical expertise, so they instituted a rule to never invest in cleantech founders wearing suits.5. Old-school hard workWe've all heard stories about entrepreneurs sleeping in the office at night. I'm not saying that's optimal; however, you will work harder than you ever have in your life. Ever tried running a startup and running an investment raise at the same time? They're both full-time jobs, but no one else can do it — it's all on you. Beyond that, it's true that the person who works more hours is almost always going to succeed or do better than the person who works fewer hours, and investors will be looking for a solid work ethic.


Related: Beyond the Basics: 5 Surprising Qualities Investors Seek in a Winning Team6. Be a good storytellerBeing able to articulate a bold vision and your mission, as well as your personal story that brings you to the investment pitch is incredibly helpful. It's about amazing storytelling. When he took over Tesla, Elon Musk said fossil fuel will run out, so we need electric cars, but because they're expensive, Tesla will make the most luxurious ones and rich car owners will fund the development of mass-market ones.That's great storytelling that let investors see the opportunity, made rich car owners feel good and mass market owners feel excited about the advent of cheaper electric cars. When you're captivating, and of course have great control of your commercial numbers, you're going to be able to raise money.

In this article, I would like to focus on one significant trait that some investors possess — an entrepreneurial background that enables them to establish strong connections with startups and better understand the 'pains' and challenges new founders face.Based on my personal experience as an entrepreneur I would like to highlight key aspects of communication with startups and why your entrepreneurial past makes you a little bit different from others.Related: 6 Steps to Finding the Right Investors for Your Business



Speaking the same entrepreneurial languageWhen communicating with founders, having an entrepreneurial background is extremely helpful. Founders can sense it, even from how questions are formulated, and they often highlight they have never been asked such questions before — questions are tailored with a deep understanding of the subject.And it's not just about technology-related topics, but specifically business management, such as sales funnels, marketing strategies, product market fit and customer development. Besides managing businesses, having personal experience in creating acceleration programs and all the leading methodologies of Silicon Valley, which we have integrated into accelerators for many years to make them more effective, can enhance communication between investors and founders.


With my experience of establishing 42 accelerators and collaborating with 1500 alumni startups, I have encountered familiar patterns, challenges and intricate situations when working with founders. We have found solutions together with startups in the past, and now I bring that experience to my current communication with founders.Entrepreneurs then — investors nowInvestors with entrepreneurial backgrounds bring valuable insights and expertise to the table. They have firsthand experience navigating the challenges and uncertainties of building a business, which allows them better to understand the struggles and aspirations of startup founders. Here are some great examples from the venture world.Mark Suster is a well-known voice in the investing world, having written extensively about investing in startups and building them on his website, Both Sides of the Table. He possesses the unique ability to discuss both sides of the table due to his experience as a two-time entrepreneur, having sold a company to a French firm and another to Salesforce. Currently, he serves as a partner at Upfront Ventures in Southern California (SoCal).Marc Andreesen, viewed as a pioneer in the tech space, founded Netscape, Opsware, Ning, and now his investment firm, Andreessen Horowitz. He's an expert in tech trends and a frequent speaker in the angel investing space.


Reid Hoffman is one of the most sought-after opinion makers in Silicon Valley. He is widely recognized for founding the largest business social network in the world, LinkedIn. Moreover, he has successfully translated his entrepreneurial acumen into profitable investments, with key stakes in companies like Facebook, Airbnb, and PayPal.Related: 5 Questions to Prepare for Ahead of Your Meeting With InvestorsBenefiting from an entrepreneurial past: from coaching to strategic planningAn investor with entrepreneurial skills can provide valuable support and guidance to a startup in several ways. Here are some ways in which such an investor can help:Fundraising strategy. The primary role of an investor is to provide funding to the startup and help them with fundraising strategy going forward. This financial support is crucial for the startup to develop its products or services, hire talented employees and scale its operations. With their entrepreneurial experience, the investor can assess the startup's financial needs and give some strategic advice on funding allocation. Additionally, can guide the founder towards better fundraising strategy and preparation for investor meetings.Strategic planning. An investor with entrepreneurial skills can help the startup create a solid business plan and set strategic goals. They can provide insights and expertise gained from their own entrepreneurial background, helping the startup identify potential challenges and opportunities. Together with the startup's founders, they can develop a roadmap for growth and devise strategies to overcome possible challenges.Shared perspective. I think this is one of the most important ways of communication, and here is why. An investor with an entrepreneurial background can better understand startups' challenges and opportunities. They have likely experienced similar struggles, such as fundraising, market-entry, scaling and operational issues. This shared perspective helps establish rapport and empathy with startup founders, fostering better communication and mutual understanding.Mentoring and coaching. Startups often appreciate investors who can go beyond providing capital and act as mentors or coaches. An investor with an entrepreneurial background is well-suited to fulfill this role. They can offer guidance on overcoming challenges, making critical business decisions and navigating the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. Their ability to draw upon personal experiences can be particularly impactful in helping startups succeed.I love seeing founders passionate about their startups, and our fund sometimes goes the extra mile to advise startups, even if they didn't receive investments from us. It's important to remember that when rejecting a startup, there is always the possibility that it may return in the future after making significant improvements in key metrics. Therefore, it is in our best interest to provide additional advice on what steps they need to take to attract funding.


I receive requests from founders for personal consultations quite often. We were thinking about how to turn this demand into something beneficial for startups and society and came up with a very good solution. We decided to combine venture and charity by launching a project with the Podari.Life charity fund called ""30 min/lunch with VC to save lives.""Relationship buildingInvestors with an entrepreneurial past can leverage their extensive network and connections to open doors, make introductions and facilitate strategic partnerships for the startups they work with. This network can be instrumental in helping startups access resources, industry expertise and potential customers.For example, the CEO of one of our portfolio companies, PicUp, recently embarked on his first visit to the USA. He took the initiative to go on an extensive tour, visiting key states and connecting with potential partners and investors. I understand firsthand how challenging it can be to establish new connections in a foreign country, especially in the USA and particularly in Silicon Valley, which has no analogs in the world. With this in mind, we decided to assist by connecting the company with investors and key players in the Silicon Valley innovation ecosystem in advance.Related: The Things Successful Leaders Do and Don't Do to Build Relationships


What matters the mostIn summary, it is not solely the investors' entrepreneurial experience that founders find appealing. Rather, their experience in different roles inside a business allows investors to have a wider view and help early founders avoid common mistakes while building the next big thing. After all, venture investment is a long-term relationship, and you want to build partner-like relationships with people you will most likely work with for the next 8-10 years until your exit.

84,5 Growth-Hacking Strategies to Help Your Startup Succeed,"Jul 13, 2023",Hasan Saleem,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-5-strategies-of-startup-growth/454810,"
Growing your startup is a challenge. According to 2022 statistics, only 10% of fledgling companies succeed.Given the fierce competition, that's hardly surprising. As a startup founder, you know that there are a million things to tick off on your to-do list, and a deluge of advice you're supposed to follow.So what should your priorities be? How can you stay ahead of the curve?Here are five straightforward tools and no-nonsense strategies to actually help your startup thrive.1. Hire the right teamFirst off, it's crucial to assemble the right team. Having a dynamic, dedicated and inspiring group behind your vision is essential for any startup.So, how do you recruit the best candidates?First, you must adjust your hiring to the field's unique challenges. Since many startups thrive in emerging industries and up-and-coming sectors, there's often a lack of people who come with prior experience. Instead, look out for transferable skills that match your startup's needs.Another element to keep in mind is DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion. This can be challenging, especially if your candidate roster is already small. However, having a diverse team contribute different perspectives can provide invaluable inspiration and further your vision.And talking about vision and inspiration — make this part of your employer brand. Make your mission central to who you are as a startup to draw in highly motivated talent.

Select the right productivity toolsAs a next step, identify the business tools that best suit your startup's needs and will help you supercharge your productivity.Is your team remote? Hybrid? Or on-site? How many people are you coordinating? How many projects do you work on simultaneously? What's your current and projected client base?These are all questions that let you winnow down the numerous productivity tools on the market to those that fit your priorities.


In general, you will need a business communication suite for internal and external communication, a project management tool and a customer relationship management (CRM) system.Business communication suites help you centralize all your internal and external communications. Many modern providers offer UCaaS - Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) that combines voice and video calls, messaging, live chat, email and even fax. These platforms also come with handy tools, and AI features like automatic call transcripts and meeting summaries.A solid project management tool allows you to keep track of your team, their tasks and deadlines — and of the progress of the overall work. These tools let you define goals, clarify timelines and dependencies, and measure efficiency and success.CRMs, finally, let you store all possible snippets of information about a customer in their profile - from their interactions with your brand on social media to any support they needed with your products.


Heads up: When comparing tools, make sure to project ahead. Make easy scalability a key criterion during the selection process.3. Focus on the customerDuring the early stages of growing your startup, customer acquisition and retention ought to be at the center of your strategy.Once you've assembled your core team and settled on the right tools to effectively harness for your workflows, focus on the customer. What are their priorities and pain points? How can you meet their needs and ensure maximum satisfaction? What are the most efficient ways to communicate with them?At an early stage, implement metrics for customer satisfaction and avenues for them to provide feedback. At this point, every customer interaction is a crucial learning experience. If someone is happy, find out why. If they're not, pinpoint the issues that cause dissatisfaction and address them. Then, integrate the lessons learned into your workflows to optimize your processes. Get testimonials wherever you can.


For instance, you can harness the survey capabilities of your CRM to create a feedback form to gather information from new customers or those who have stopped using your products or services.Related: The Future of Startup Marketing: 2 Popular Lead Magnets Your Startup Needs4. Leverage Guerilla MarketingIn the early days of your startup, your marketing budget will likely be limited. Instead of wasting resources on broad marketing campaigns that deliver limited success, focus on highly targeted guerilla marketing.Leverage bespoke, guerilla marketing tactics to reach your target audience directly. Channeling your outreach resources into this strategy will achieve more significant short-term results and will help you build a solid core audience for your brand.


Depending on your products and services, you can opt for offline campaigns (think murals, stickers, or old-school billboards with a twist), or online panache (let us remember Deadpool's Tinder profile).5. Nurture partnerships and investorsFinally, the key to growing a successful startup is nurturing relationships with partners and investors. Funding and collaborations will provide your startup with the support, resources and industry connections it needs to thrive.Prepare the necessary pitch materials, and then make a concerted effort to pinpoint opportunities to network and meet the right people.Depending on your niche, this could be virtual events, in-person industry conferences, or niche-specific online spaces. For example, if your startup is in the climate tech sector, you can check out events such as VivaTech in Paris, the London Climate Technology Show, or Verge 23 in San Jose.


Growing a successful startup remains challenging, there's no doubt about that. By pursuing the strategies above — from putting an emphasis on hiring the right team to leveraging guerilla marketing — you'll be able to build a strong basis for your business to help it thrive in the long run.

85,9 Reasons Nurturing Relationships With Other Entrepreneurs Is Vital,"Jul 12, 2023",Athalia Monae,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-nurturing-relationships-with-other-entrepreneurs-is/455234,"
As an entrepreneur, nurturing relationships outside of that realm is important, but the same goes for nurturing business relationships. We have to find that balance. Being able to do so has been very rewarding for me. In the beginning, I didn't have other entrepreneurs to share my excitement, ideas, wins, challenges or losses with.I get very excited about sharing my journey, ideas, plans, etc., and in the past, when I would share certain parts of my journey with people who weren't entrepreneurs, my excitement was perceived as me bragging or thinking I know more than that person. My reaction was, ""No, I'm just passionate and excited to have made it to this point or be able to take that negative and turn it into a positive. That's it, that's all"". I'm passionate about any projects I work on, and I love hearing about other people's passions.""The true currency of business is trust. Nurture your relationships, show integrity, and deliver on your promises. That's how you build a solid foundation for long-term success."" — Denise Morrison, Former CEO of Campbell Soup Company

86,How To Know if Your Startup Has a Proper Founder-Market Fit,"Jul 11, 2023",Vital Laptenok,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-founders-can-demonstrate-their-founder-market-fit-to/454706,"
In the early stages, startups often lack impressive numbers to showcase their potential. That's why investors primarily examine the co-founding team to assess how likely they are to build a thriving company.In simpler terms, investors are looking for something called founder-market fit when the founders' skills, experience, and personal qualities align with what the market needs.But how can a founder determine if they have this so-called founder-market fit?



A background checkDeep industry expertise can indicate a strong match between the founders and their target market. The ability to execute ideas is vital for early-stage founders, and the more bulletproof they are in their domain, the higher the chance they'll be able to do it.It's also about knowing what to disrupt and how, because, at its core, a founder-market fit means that the person starting the company has personally experienced the problem they're now trying to solve.


In some cases, outsiders have disrupted industries they knew little about, but generally, founders have a much better chance of succeeding if they have a sense of how a specific market works. About 35% of startups fail because the founding team doesn't know enough about the market and what customers actually need.The best way to know an entrepreneur has a founder-market fit is to look at their education, previous employment, and projects. How long have the founders been active in this industry? How well do they know its problems? How badly do they want to change the status quo?There are many examples of this: Airbnb's founders hosted people in their apartments before building a marketplace for homestays; Slack began as an internal communication tool for a company owned by one of the founders — he knew what app his team needed.Health tech startup Theranos is a well-known case of the opposite when a lack of industry knowledge — among other things — led to a startup's failure. Investors were swayed by the founder's grand vision: they collectively invested $1.3 billion. Unfortunately, they overlooked the significance of the founder's background.


The founder, Elizabeth Holmes, promised to revolutionize health care while having only two semesters of chemical engineering classes at Stanford.Related: 6 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From the Fall of TheranosSynergy among co-foundersWhen a founder presents me with a startup that heavily relies on sales but struggles to articulate their thoughts, it raises a red flag. In such situations, investors should carefully assess the other co-founders in the team, seeking a partner who brings the required expertise — in this example, in sales.Founder of Awesomic, a platform that matches web design talents with businesses, Roman Sevast has a background in software development. He takes full responsibility for Awesomic's technical aspects and product development, while another founder, Stacy Pavlyshyna, is a former digital marketer who handles operations, communications and marketing.


This serves as a good illustration of where both co-founders bring their domain expertise to the table, and their collaboration enables them to achieve a solid founder-market fit.A prominent global example of a synergistic partnership is the relationship between Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs.Related: 5 Expert Tips on How to Choose a Co-Founder for Your New BusinessHow to tell investors about founder-market fitTo increase the likelihood of securing funding, early-stage founders should make sure they communicate their founder-market fit to investors. My several tips:


Share specific examples of the co-founders' industry challenges and how they resolved them.Emphasize accomplishments relevant to the target market, such as previous startup ventures, industry accolades, significant milestones, or partnerships.Present a compelling narrative about a co-founder that showcases their in-depth industry knowledge. Instead of stating ""5 years of IT experience,"" highlight achievements by saying, ""developed a product used by 300,000 clients"".Demonstrate a scalable business model that aligns with market needs and show how exactly it aligns.Problem-solving experienceThis does not suggest that successful startups can only emerge from founders with prior experience. Quite the opposite, according to Sebastian Mallaby's book ""The Power Law,"" groundbreaking ideas often originate from individuals who are outsiders to the industry.These outsiders, however, must possess certain character traits that enable them to achieve a founder-market fit. I'd like to highlight perseverance and curiosity.Outsiders should thoroughly study the market to understand their potential customers, launch effective marketing campaigns, and ultimately develop a product that people will find valuable. Curiosity serves as the driving force behind acquiring the necessary knowledge.Perseverance is crucial because the market landscape constantly changes, and founders continuously overcome new challenges. We seek to invest in founders who are prepared to adapt to evolving market conditions, meet customer demands and embrace emerging trends.


Founders never know which particular problems they will face when starting a business. But if they previously solved problems in a chosen market or if they show they have grit, VCs take it as a good sign.Related: Beyond the Basics: 5 Surprising Qualities Investors Seek in a Winning Team

Venture capital can be critical for a company's growth across many different stages — but the funds aren't flowing as freely as they once did.U.S. investors backed 3,011 startup funding deals last quarter, about a third fewer than they did during the same quarter last year, and gave $39.8 billion in cash — almost half as much compared to the same period last year, according to Pitchbook data reported by Bloomberg.Related: 3 Alternatives to Venture Capital Funding for Startups | Entrepreneur



Angel and seed deals, funding for startups in their very early days, were hit especially hard, seeing half as many funding deals as there were the year before. But Pitchbook analyst Kyle Stanford attributes that in part to excess financing amid the pandemic, where ""probably too many"" startups raised money.Worldwide, startup funding dipped nearly 60% — down from $152.9 billion to $87.4 billion year over year, per the data. Some of that dip can be attributed to higher interest rates, Reuters reported.


Even as public tech companies have started to recover, those in the private sector continue to struggle amid few significant initial public offerings and large acquisitions, per Bloomberg.

88,Why It's Unwise to 'Fake It 'Til You Make It' in the Startup World — and What to Do Instead,"Jun 29, 2023",Collin Williams,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-startups-must-drop-the-fake-it-til-you-make-it/453746,"
The recent imprisonment of Elizabeth Holmes got me thinking more deeply about the old Silicon Valley adage, ""Fake it 'til you make it."" This saying has long been the mantra of startups not only in Silicon Valley but throughout the country. I've been involved in the startup community for the better part of 8 years now. I worked at a startup that believed faking it was a legitimate business strategy. Its founders are now staring at substantial prison time tied to a multitude of fraud convictions. I've also worked at two startups (my current one included) where the focus was grit, effort and hard work always backstopped by integrity. You don't tell people you can do something you can't do simply to benefit your own self-interest.The fact is ratifying ""fake it 'til you make it"" is nothing more than creating an excuse about your own personal or professional failures. Does that mean you can't push limits? Or test the abilities of your team? Does it mean you can't seek to achieve goals that seem unattainable? Or to publicly aspire to accomplish those goals? Absolutely not. Startups are typically only successful when they are backed by seemingly impossible dreams. But there are ethical ways to get there. Let me explain.Let's say your startup idea is to create a two-sided marketplace for art. On one side, you have buyers who are interested in art from particular artists, and on the other side, you have sellers who have access to legitimate pieces of art from those artists. Your goal is to programmatically match buyers and sellers and to use technology to validate and authenticate the art. In your mind, this will all eventually be done without human intervention, but it will take months (or maybe years) to make that happen technologically. So, now let's break this down into two models: (a) a model based on ""fake it 'til you make it""; and (b) a model based on grit, hard work and creative but ethical solutions.



Related: Here's Why You Should Not ""Fake It Till You Make It""""Fake it 'til you make it"" modelLet's start with the ""fake it 'til you make it model."" You put out a pitch deck and marketing materials that tout proprietary matching algorithms that will connect the right buyers to the right sellers and an AI-based software that will detect fraudulent or forged works of art. Without question, these are how you envision the future state of your business. Moreover, your website states that you've completed thousands of successfully matched art transactions. What does it matter if it's not true? It's not hurting anyone.


Now the truth is it's still your dream to create proprietary matching algorithms and AI-based fraud detection, but what you currently have is a simple database of sellers and buyers of art with a basic taxonomy that allows you to classify the works. You also employ a few art experts who can review the listings for any clear or apparent fraud. Since you started the site, you've matched around 100 buyers and sellers who all seem generally pleased with the experience and what they've received. Seems simple. Unfortunately, the fact is, you have completely misrepresented your product, your transaction history, and fundamentally, what your company does to provide value.It may seem harmless because your users are satisfied, but what if an angel or VC firm is so interested in your pitch that they want to invest seven figures into your business? You're a startup. You need money. Depending on the angel or VC, it may also provide significant clout or publicity to your business. So, now you're stuck between Scylla and Charybdis. Do you perpetuate false information and financially insulate and benefit your business? Or do you turn down the money and attempt to rectify the untruths which may severely impact your business's ability to survive? Neither is a good option. The fact is, because you touted the potential future state of your business instead of its current reality, you've engaged in ""fake it 'til you make it"" and, depending on the outcome, committed fraud.Related: The Truth About 'Fake It 'Til You Make It'Reality-based modelNow, how could this have been done ethically, while still generating interest and buzz in your business? It's simple. In your marketing materials, you could state your value proposition as a technology company/marketplace that helps buyers find sellers, sellers find buyers and ensures that each party is comfortable with the legitimacy of the pieces of art. Your goal can still be the creation of algorithms that help match buyers and sellers as well as an AI-based fraud detection software, but that isn't what you are currently selling.


In order to make sure users have a good experience, you can have team members in the background manually poring over the listings to find the best matches and those same art experts perusing the lists for forgery and fraud. The truth is, the users will be happy as long as they have a good buying or selling experience, get what they want and feel as though the platform provides transactional transparency and certainty.Publicly, your marketing materials can tout that you've successfully matched ""numerous"" buyers and sellers and even use quotes and endorsements from those satisfied customers. Angels and VCs will see traction and may very well decide to invest in your vision without believing it to be the current reality. Most importantly, you haven't committed fraud or compromised yourself ethically simply to boost your ego. You've simply used grit and ingenuity to provide a good experience without relinquishing a much grander vision for the future.We've now seen the result of the ""fake it 'til you make it"" culture — Sam Bankman-Fried, Elizabeth Holmes, Charlie Javice, etc. Right now, we're operating in a legal climate where the traditional startup mantra is having real and serious repercussions. But that doesn't mean it won't change in the future. More importantly, it doesn't mean the temptation won't be there for the next generation of entrepreneurs and startups. It's hard to be patient. It's hard to grind. But it's also the only real path to success. Speed kills is another old adage that has existed for generations. Perhaps that should be the new mantra for startups.Related: The 5 Worst Tips I Received When Starting My Business

89,Why Venture-Backed Startups Are Losing Speed — and Creative Ways to Earn Funding in Challenging Economic Times,"Jun 27, 2023",Michael Stagno,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/creative-ways-startups-can-earn-funding-in-tough-economic/453600,"
In a declining economy, startups face an uphill battle when it comes to securing funding. Despite financial hardships, with resourcefulness, innovation and strategic planning, entrepreneurs can explore various avenues to obtain the necessary capital for their ventures.Venture-backed startups have long been the bedrock of innovation, driving economic growth and shaping industries. In recent years, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of venture-backed small businesses. Let's delve into the reasons behind this decline, exploring the changing landscape of entrepreneurship and the factors that have contributed to this trend:Related: How to Access Capital in an Economic Downturn



Why startups are losing speedSaturation of the market: One key factor contributing to the decline of venture-backed startups is the saturation of the market. The startup ecosystem has experienced an unprecedented boom over the past decade, leading to an influx of companies competing for funding and market share. With numerous startups vying for attention, venture capitalists have become more cautious in their investments, opting to support only the most promising and disruptive ventures. Consequently, startups are finding it increasingly difficult to secure funding, especially those operating in crowded markets.Risk aversion and investor preference: In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in investor preference towards late-stage and growth-stage startups. Venture capitalists are more inclined to invest in established companies that have demonstrated a solid track record of growth and revenue generation. This risk-averse behavior has resulted in reduced funding opportunities for early-stage startups, which typically require substantial capital injections to grow and scale. The scarcity of funding options has undoubtedly hindered the formation and growth of new ventures.Changing regulatory landscape: Regulatory factors have also played a role in the decline of venture-backed startups. Governments around the world have implemented tighter regulations and compliance requirements in the wake of financial crises and scandals. While these measures aim to protect investors and consumers, they have inadvertently increased the barriers to entry for startups. Compliance costs and legal complexities have become significant hurdles for entrepreneurs, particularly those operating in heavily regulated industries such as fintech, healthcare and transportation. The burden of navigating complex regulatory frameworks has deterred many potential founders from pursuing venture-backed startups.Alternative funding sources: The decline in venture-backed startups can also be attributed to the availability of alternative funding sources. Traditional venture capital is no longer the sole option for entrepreneurs seeking funding. Crowdfunding platforms, angel investors and corporate venture capital funds have emerged as viable alternatives, providing capital and support to startups. Additionally, the rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and blockchain technology has enabled entrepreneurs to raise funds through token sales. These alternative funding options have diversified the startup funding landscape, reducing the reliance on traditional venture capital and contributing to the decline of venture-backed startups.Changing entrepreneurial landscape: The nature of entrepreneurship itself has evolved over time. With the democratization of technology, the cost of starting a business has decreased, making it easier for individuals to embark on entrepreneurial endeavors. This has led to a rise in bootstrapped startups and self-funded ventures, which may not seek venture capital funding at all. Furthermore, the gig economy and freelance work have attracted individuals who prefer independent work arrangements over building traditional venture-backed startups. The changing entrepreneurial landscape has shifted the focus away from venture-backed startups, contributing to their decline.Although we have seen a decline in the number of venture-backed, it's important to know that there are numerous other ways for startups to garner funding.Related: Raising Funding in a Downturn Isn't Impossible — I Did It (and You Can, Too).Creative ways to earn fundingBelow are several creative ways that startups can earn funding even in challenging economic times:Bootstrapping and self-funding: One of the most accessible and immediate ways for startups to earn funding in a declining economy is through bootstrapping and self-funding. By leveraging personal savings, credit lines or personal assets, entrepreneurs can finance their ventures without relying on external investors. While bootstrapping may require sacrifices and careful financial management, it grants startups full control over their operations and minimizes the need to dilute equity at an early stage. Additionally, self-funding demonstrates commitment and resilience, which can attract potential investors in the future.Strategic partnerships and alliances: Startups can explore strategic partnerships and alliances as a means to secure funding in a declining economy. By identifying synergistic organizations or established companies in their industry, startups can propose mutually beneficial collaborations. Such partnerships may involve strategic investments, joint ventures or co-development agreements, which provide startups with access to funding, resources, expertise and a broader customer base. These alliances can not only alleviate financial constraints but also enhance market credibility and pave the way for future growth.Government grants and programs: Governments often offer grants, incentives and programs to stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship, even during economic downturns. Startups can tap into these resources by researching and applying for grants specifically tailored to their industry or innovative projects. These grants can provide much-needed funding, mentorship and networking opportunities. Additionally, government-backed programs, such as incubators and accelerators, offer access to valuable resources, expertise and potential investors, further aiding startups in their quest for funding.Crowdfunding: Crowdfunding has emerged as a popular and effective funding avenue for startups in recent years. It involves raising capital from a large pool of individuals through online platforms. In a declining economy, crowdfunding allows startups to bypass traditional funding sources by directly appealing to potential customers, supporters and like-minded individuals who believe in their vision. By offering early access to products, exclusive perks or equity shares, startups can incentivize individuals to contribute to their fundraising campaign. Crowdfunding not only provides funding but also helps validate the market demand for a startup's product or service.Impact investment and social funding: In the face of economic decline, there has been a growing focus on impact investment and socially responsible funding. Investors and funds dedicated to making a positive social or environmental impact are actively seeking startups with a strong mission and purpose. By aligning their business models with social or environmental goals, startups can attract impact investors who are willing to provide funding in exchange for measurable social or environmental outcomes. Social crowdfunding platforms and impact-focused venture capital firms offer additional opportunities for startups to secure funding while making a positive difference in the world.Related: Think You Need Venture Capital Backing to Start Your Business? Think Again.


While venture-backed startups have long been the driving force behind innovation and economic growth, their decline in recent years can be attributed to various factors. Saturation of the market, investor preference for late-stage companies, changing regulatory landscape, availability of alternative funding sources and a changing entrepreneurial landscape have all played a role. Despite this decline, entrepreneurship remains vibrant, with new models and funding mechanisms continuing to shape the startup ecosystem.In a declining economy, startups must adopt creative approaches to secure funding for their ventures. Bootstrapping, strategic partnerships, government grants, crowdfunding and impact investment are just a few avenues that entrepreneurs can explore. By leveraging these funding sources, startups can mitigate the challenges posed by economic downturns and pave the way for sustainable growth and success.As the landscape evolves, it is crucial for entrepreneurs and investors to adapt and embrace new opportunities to foster innovation and support the next generation of disruptors. Furthermore, entrepreneurs should remain adaptable, resourceful and open to exploring new opportunities as the economic landscape evolves.

90,How AI Is Becoming a Game-Changer in Startup Fundraising,"Jun 26, 2023",Yan Katcharovski,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/ai-is-becoming-a-game-changer-in-startup-fundraising/453560,"
Navigating the world of startup fundraising can often feel like walking a tightrope, balancing a compelling pitch with hard data, all while trying to predict what investors want to hear.The good news? Artificial intelligence (AI) is here to lend a helping hand, providing startups with an advanced toolkit to make informed decisions and craft persuasive pitches.Related: Here's How AI Is Changing VC Funding



AI in startup fundraisingAI, in the context of startup fundraising, refers to data-driven technologies that analyze patterns, predict trends and provide actionable insights. AI tools can help evaluate the potential of a startup based on various factors, such as market trends, competitive landscape and financial projections. These tools are increasingly being used by investors to inform their decisions and by startups to refine their strategies and pitches.AI's influence is not just limited to data analysis; it's also creating a new frontier in how startups connect with potential investors. AI-powered platforms are transforming the traditional fundraising process, providing efficient, data-driven matchmaking between startups and investors.


The impact of AI on investor decisionsInvestors have always used data as the backbone of their decisions, but with the surge of AI technologies, this reliance has deepened and evolved. AI is stepping up to reshape the decision-making process, offering advanced capabilities in areas that are key to investor deliberations.Firstly, AI assists in examining a startup's financial data more thoroughly. AI algorithms can quickly sift through vast amounts of financial data, decoding patterns and identifying insights that might be less obvious otherwise. This results in an in-depth understanding of a startup's financial position, which is fundamental for investors.Secondly, AI is invaluable in evaluating potential market growth. By utilizing machine learning and predictive analytics, AI can anticipate market trends and growth with superior accuracy. This helps investors gain an insight into the scalability of a startup and its potential to claim a share of the market.Thirdly, assessing the competitive landscape is another domain where AI's prowess shines. With AI, real-time insights into the strategies and market positions of competitors can be gleaned, helping investors understand where a startup stands in its market, and its capacity to endure competitive pressures.


Finally, AI helps in predicting a startup's success by comparing it with similar businesses. By drawing on data from businesses with comparable models, AI can estimate the potential risks and returns of investing in a startup. This can be crucial for investors in determining the future trajectory of a startup.Related: 5 Things That Have Changed in Startup Pitching This YearHow AI can help startups with fundraisingArtificial intelligence is not just a powerful tool for investors; it's also a transformative force for startups, particularly in the fundraising landscape. Here's how AI can help startups raise the necessary capital:AI can guide startups in developing a data-driven pitch, harnessing the power of predictive analytics to illustrate potential growth and returns. For instance, by analyzing market trends, competitors and customer behavior, AI can furnish startups with the knowledge needed to craft a compelling, evidence-backed argument for their business.


Furthermore, AI can take a startup's financial modeling to the next level. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, AI can predict future revenue streams and cash flow with a degree of accuracy that's traditionally been hard to achieve. By doing so, it generates a realistic, granular picture of the business's potential — something that's crucial for both the startup seeking funds and the investor looking to allocate capital wisely.The insights gleaned from AI not only support the crafting of persuasive pitches but also inform strategic decisions, help identify growth opportunities and potentially foresee challenges. Thus, AI's role in startup fundraising is multifaceted, offering key support in the journey from early-stage venture to successful business.Matchmaking with investorsAI-powered platforms, such as Crunchbase or AngelList, serve as efficient matchmakers between startups and investors. These platforms leverage AI to analyze various factors — the startup's business model, industry sector, and fundraising stage, among others — to identify and connect with the investors best suited to a startup's unique needs. This advanced matching capability helps to streamline the fundraising process, increasing its efficiency and effectiveness.Beyond initial introductions, AI tools can also assist startups in maintaining robust relationships with their investors. They can automate the process of providing regular updates, tracking critical performance indicators and even forecasting potential issues. This constant communication loop not only keeps investors informed but also nurtures trust and transparency between the parties involved.

This isn't just about demonstrating an understanding of AI's technical aspects. It also involves clearly articulating its impact and relevance to their business.Startups must show that they grasp how AI can transform various aspects of their operations. This may include improving efficiencies, optimizing customer experiences, streamlining processes or driving innovation. The ability to comprehend and communicate the potential implications of AI can prove to be a game-changer in gaining an investor's interest and confidence.Moreover, startups should underscore how they are already utilizing AI to bolster their operations and spur growth. Concrete examples of AI applications in their business strategy not only indicate a startup's tech-savviness but also its ability to stay ahead of the curve. This can be particularly appealing to investors who are always on the lookout for businesses that leverage cutting-edge technologies to gain a competitive edge.


In the rapidly evolving startup ecosystem, AI is a potent tool, offering a competitive edge in fundraising. It empowers startups to make data-driven decisions, tailor their pitches and connect with the right investors. But as with any tool, its effectiveness depends on how well it's used.As such, startups need to invest in understanding AI and incorporating it into their fundraising strategy. This involves not just leveraging AI tools but also developing an AI-literate team and an AI-friendly culture. This way, startups can use AI not just as a tool for fundraising, but as a driver of innovation and growth.

91,The Complete 10-Step Guide to Bootstrapping for Entrepreneurs,"Jun 23, 2023",Dario Markovic,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/10-tips-for-bootstrapping-your-startup/452564,"
Entrepreneurship is a journey filled with exciting dreams, daunting challenges and exhilarating victories. One of the initial challenges entrepreneurs face is securing funding to translate their visions into reality. While there are multiple avenues to fund a startup, including venture capital, angel investors and bank loans, one approach stands out for its grit, resilience and independence — bootstrapping.Bootstrapping is a strategy where entrepreneurs start and grow a business using their funds or revenue from the company. It's a self-starter method emphasizing sustainability, independence and creative problem-solving. As an entrepreneur who bootstrapped my business, I've experienced firsthand this journey's trials, tribulations and triumphs. So here's a comprehensive guide to help you navigate the path of bootstrapping.Related: 8 Bulletproof Ways to Bootstrap Your Business



1. Understand the landscapeUnderstanding the landscape of bootstrapping is crucial, especially as it demands resourcefulness, patience and a frugal mindset. It's a journey that may mean slower growth, longer working hours and carefully balancing personal and business finances. However, it can provide greater control over your business decisions, unshackling you from the expectations of external investors.2. Start leanStarting lean is a fundamental principle of bootstrapping. Entrepreneurs should opt for minimal viable products (MVPs) instead of aiming for perfection from the get-go, which can significantly reduce initial costs. Considering contract work or freelancers over full-time employees can also be an intelligent choice in the early stages. Choosing co-working spaces or home offices over plush spaces can drastically reduce overheads. This mindset of frugality and astute resource allocation often translates into a company culture that values efficiency and detests waste.


3. Focus on cash flowFor bootstrapped startups, cash flow is king. Regular revenue inflow ensures you can cover your operating costs and invest in the business. Build a solid business model that generates steady cash flow. Prioritize paying clients and profitable projects.4. Be your best marketerMarketing can sometimes need a hefty budget. Word-of-mouth, social media, networking, collaborations, or even a well-crafted email can be powerful, cost-effective marketing tools. Remember, as the founder, you are your best marketer. Your passion, vision and dedication can be more compelling than any glossy ad.5. Cultivate strong relationshipsBuilding solid relationships with customers, suppliers and peers is critical. Happy customers become repeat customers and can bring referrals. Good relationships with suppliers could lead to flexible payment terms. Peers can provide valuable advice, feedback and support.Related: 4 Tremendous Benefits of Bootstrapping a Company


6. Constantly learn and adaptBootstrapping is a journey of constant learning and adapting. Be open to feedback, learn from mistakes, adapt to changes and continually improve your products, services and processes.7. Celebrate milestonesBootstrapping can be a challenging and often thankless journey. Celebrate your milestones, no matter how small. They serve as morale boosters for you and your team and reaffirm your progress and potential.8. Nurture your teamIn bootstrapping, a committed, motivated team is invaluable. While you may not be able to offer extravagant salaries or perks, you can foster a culture of growth, learning and ownership. Recognize their efforts, provide learning opportunities and involve them in decision-making. A team that believes in your vision and feels valued will go the extra mile with you.9. Leverage technologyToday's digital era offers numerous tools and platforms that can help optimize operations, increase efficiency and reduce costs. From project management and collaboration tools to digital marketing platforms and cloud services, these resources can help you achieve more with less. Choosing the right technology can make a significant difference in managing and growing your bootstrapped startup.


10. Stay resilientBootstrapping is a test of endurance and resilience. There will be setbacks, rejections and cash crunches. But remember, every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow. So stay resilient, believe in your vision and keep moving forward.In my own entrepreneurial journey, bootstrapping has been both challenging and rewarding. It was not just about starting a business with limited resources but about nurturing a mindset of resilience, resourcefulness and relentless pursuit of excellence. In addition, it taught me valuable lessons in frugality, priority management, and strategic decision-making.Bootstrapping may not be the fastest route to entrepreneurial success, but it can be one of the most fulfilling. It allows you to retain control over your venture, overgrow and imbibe a deep sense of financial discipline and creative problem-solving skills. It fosters a culture of doing more with less. Finally, it empowers you to build a business with a solid economic sustainability and integrity foundation.Related: What I Wish I Knew Before Bootstrapping My Startup


The journey of bootstrapping is a test of endurance and resilience. There will be setbacks and rejections. Cash crunches will threaten to slow down growth. But remember, each challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow. Resilience is the fuel that keeps the bootstrapped entrepreneur going. It's about weathering the storm and learning to dance in the rain.

92,How Entrepreneurs Can Position Their Businesses for Growth This Summer,"Jun 16, 2023",Sharon Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-position-your-business-for-growth-this-summer/452638,"
The warmer months often bring our picturesque visions of small businesses into focus — local florists adorn their stores with colorful bouquets, mom-and-pop ice cream shops serve lines out the door, and our favorite restaurants bustle with the day's fresh catch and seasonal specialties under a clear sky.While daydreaming of these early summer scenes, it's important to remain cognizant of the economic headwinds that have impaired small businesses over the past year. Though entrepreneurs are used to rising above a difficult economy, challenges persist.Although inflation rates have cooled significantly over the last year, prices are still causing problems for consumers. Supply chain and labor issues linger, and concerns around a potential recession and commodities prices remain at the top of many people's minds.



Despite these concerns, Bank of America's 2023 Small Business Owner Report found that nearly half of entrepreneurs plan to grow their businesses in the coming year.Related: 3 Ways to Start Raising Capital for Your Business, Big or Small


The importance of capitalOne of the most critical components for business growth is access to capital. Consistent and convenient credit empowers business owners to expand the scale of their operations, diversify their revenue streams, acquire new tools and technology and provide a buffer against economic downturns.For many business owners, a key source of capital infusion is a bank loan. The process of applying for and receiving loans can feel complex, even mystifying, but understanding the keys to the application and approval process can provide clarity and help business owners prep for success.Most lenders consider a few primary factors when evaluating a loan application: Capacity, capital, conditions, character and collateral.Capacity:


Lenders want to ensure the borrower has the ability to repay their business loan. This is often calculated by evaluating a business' debt-to-income ratio. A capacity evaluation is essentially a risk assessment on the part of a lender — they want to ensure you have the cash flow to take on loan payments.Capital:To secure a loan, entrepreneurs will likely have to show they can commit their own funds toward business costs. Prospective lenders are looking for a personal investment in your business endeavors, including equipment and savings to support your business. Think of it like a down payment that shows you're committed to the project.Conditions:


Some external factors are also considered in your loan application, including the economy, industry trends and any pending legislation related to your business.Character:Your personal history also plays a role in a credit application. Some considerations of character might include industry experience, work history and personal credit history. Many lenders believe that past behavior is the best predictor for the future, and it's crucial for business owners to repay any outstanding loans and monitor the behavior of those closely associated with their businesses.Collateral:


Some lenders will want the assurance of additional assets as security for potential loan repayment. Inventory, cash and real estate can all qualify as collateral, as will secured loans and credit cards.Related: 5 Things Entrepreneurs Need to Know When Raising CapitalOther avenues for access to capitalSometimes, business owners will struggle for approval even if they meet the previously mentioned criteria and are otherwise in good financial standing. Luckily, there are options beyond traditional loans to secure capital, such as grants and community development financial institutions (CDFIs).There are thousands of federal grants that business owners can apply for, and many states and local organizations also offer specific grants for entrepreneurs. Additionally, CDFIs are lenders with a mission to provide fair, responsible financing to underserved entrepreneurs.


The small business lending space can feel overwhelming, and staying up to date on the latest programs and resources available to business owners is crucial — and not always easy.Many entrepreneurs are interested in greater educational resources around small business finances. Over the past few years, these resources have continuously improved and evolved.The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers a learning platform for small business owners, including educational and training programs. SCORE also provides educational resources across the business lifecycle, as does Bank of America's Small Business Resources site. In addition, the Bank of America Access to Capital Directory can serve as a crucial resource for business owners looking to identify sources of capital.The capital landscape and approval process can feel overwhelming at times, but by staying prepared, exploring all available options and keeping up with the latest business trends, entrepreneurs can focus less on the ins and outs of finance and more on serving their customers all summer long.

93,8 Reasons to Make Networking Part of Your Everyday Life,"Jun 13, 2023",Jason Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/8-reasons-to-make-networking-part-of-your-everyday-life/452128,"
In an increasingly connected world, networking has become essential to business success. From building new partnerships to tapping into talent pools, networking opens doors for companies to grow and succeed. Building connections has been the cornerstone of my company's success and is an essential skill for any entrepreneur. Here are some key reasons you should make networking part of your everyday life.Related: 4 Reasons Why Networking Is a Must for All Successful Entrepreneurs1. Expanding business opportunitiesBy cultivating strong relationships with industry peers, potential customers and suppliers, companies gain access to new markets, collaborations and referrals.



At my company, we often encourage our clients to attend networking events with organizations such as their local Chamber of Commerce, Rotary Club, Eagles and BNI networks. One of our clients, Lisa, is an excellent example of how these meetings can result in unlikely connections.Lisa engaged in a conversation at a local conference with a man named John. Lisa is a fashion designer specializing in sustainable clothing, and John is an architect with a passion for incorporating eco-friendly designs into buildings. They discovered a shared interest in sustainability and a mutual desire to create innovative solutions.


Inspired by their discussion, the two decided to explore a partnership where they could combine their expertise to design sustainable, eco-friendly fashion boutiques. They realized that by integrating sustainable materials, energy-efficient lighting and green building techniques, they could create unique retail spaces that align with their shared values.They secured funding from investors who were impressed by their unconventional partnership. They were approached by other retailers and designers interested in incorporating sustainable elements into their stores and collections. Lisa and John's unlikely collaboration boosted their businesses and created a ripple effect, inspiring other professionals to explore unique partnerships and embrace sustainability in their industries — and that could happen for you, too.2. Accessing knowledge and experienceBy connecting with industry leaders, entrepreneurs can learn about best practices, new trends and innovative strategies. Let's use Tesla as an example.In Tesla's early days, Elon Musk sought out Martin Eberhard, an experienced engineer and electric vehicle enthusiast. Through their collaboration, Musk was able to leverage Eberhard's extensive knowledge of battery technology, which helped Tesla develop its groundbreaking electrical vehicles. At SAB, we regularly hold online networking sessions where our clients can share what is working well in their business and what they may be struggling with to get suggestions from other clients.

Improving your company's reputationActively participating in networking events, industry associations and online forums can help entrepreneurs build credibility and authority in their respective fields. Speaking at events and offering your expertise to others will position you as a thought leader. Speaking in smaller locations allowed me an opportunity to grow my brand awareness which then opened doors for me to speak on larger stages. As my brand grew, people would come up to me after events and ask how they could work with me.4. Attracting and retaining talentNetworking can also be a great way to secure talent for your business. Through networking with employees and other entrepreneurs, you can learn more about who is looking for work or a change in environment, who would be a good fit for your company culture and who's recommended by previous employers.A fellow business associate carries recruitment cards that he refers to as ""rockstar cards."" When he receives amazing customer service, he gives the rep a card for ""rockstar"" service. On the back, the card reads, ""We are looking for superstars like you to join our team"" with a link to apply for his company. You never know where your next stellar employee might come from.


5. Facilitating collaboration and innovationNetworking can lead to interesting collaborations and new products and services. Apple and IBM are great examples of two large companies that are considered rivals. But they were able to come together regardless of their different work culture and work together. Their strategic partnership, announced in 2014, allowed both companies to leverage each other's strengths and expertise to develop a suite of enterprise applications that revolutionized mobile technology in the business world.6. Promoting diversity and inclusionAs you network, you increase the diversity of those on your team and those you collaborate with. This can help you and your company bring in a greater mix of ideas, perspectives and cultural considerations into your work environment. To build upon the diversity in your organization, try participating in events and organizations that focus on diversity and inclusion. You could even hold your networking event and invite specific people and businesses to attend to ensure different groups would be there. Actively seek out connections with people from diverse backgrounds, industries and skill sets.Related: 3 Ways to Diversify Your Network7. Connecting globally through online networkingIt's no secret we've moved more towards online networking during these past few years. Social media has given us access to interact with other entrepreneurs and our customers. Don't underestimate networking through Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. I've personally benefited from these platforms and created various professional connections.


My company, Strategic Advisor Board, uses the popular team collaboration tool Slack every day. Slack offers numerous industry-specific communities where professionals can exchange ideas, share resources and make new contacts. This platform allows for easy collaboration internally and communication globally in real time.8. Building long-term relationshipsNetworking isn't a one-time activity, but an ongoing process of building and maintaining relationships. Due to relationships I've built over the years, I have a network of referral partners for nearly all service sectors and I'm able to refer others to trusted people; this furthers my status as a trusted business resource.By incorporating diversity and inclusion into networking and using technology to expand connections, we can build a stronger foundation for lasting success. As markets evolve and the business landscape changes, the relationships forged through networking will continue providing invaluable support and resources to help companies succeed in an ever-changing world.

94,Want Startup Advice? Start by Getting Off TikTok,"Jun 8, 2023",Shannon Scott,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/want-to-successfully-start-a-business-start-by-getting-off/452886,"
There's nothing I'm more tired of than 19-year-olds on TikTok selling entrepreneurial advice. Well, there might be one thing: the fact that people listen to it.These content creators sell the perception that business is easy; all you have to do is buy a template and plug and play. They promise to teach you how to become rich on the stock market if you'll only pay them $199/month to do it. But many of the creators giving this advice are not successful CEOs. They're misleading at best and blatantly dishonest at worst. Unfortunately, an alarming amount of people in our society believe that everything they hear on the Internet is true. But we need to remember that Google is not a replacement for mentorship.At the end of the day, you have to find somebody who's been successful and somebody who has failed — and then learn from both of them. You can't get that from a 30-second TikTok video.



What is social media good for?Social media is content. Entrepreneurs can never absorb enough content, so long as it's relevant and reputable. I don't use TikTok for business advice; I use it to follow my favorite chefs and keep a pulse on what my kids are up to.It's OK to be an entrepreneur or a coach and try to use social media to sell your product.


But it becomes a problem when people sell a dream that's not reality. It's deceitful. And unfortunately, social media makes it pretty easy to be dishonest. In the same way, you can apply a filter to a photo, you can filter reality. And this leads to being catfished on the business side of things. A person having 1.4 million followers on social media doesn't make them a good CEO — it makes them a good content creator. You have to vet and verify to establish the first part.Related: Successful Entrepreneurs Don't Follow Mainstream Money Advice, And You Shouldn't EitherIf not TikTok, then who?The best advice I can give to someone looking for startup advice is to jump on LinkedIn, reach out to local business professionals who have been successful, and try to meet with them face-to-face. It's much easier vetting someone's credibility when they have to look you directly in the eye. But not everyone is who they say they are — LinkedIn doesn't fact check resumès. Make sure you research by searching the individual's online footprint and contacting people in their network to verify their reputation. If their online presence is hard to find, that's a pretty big red flag.When seeking a mentor, look for gray hairs. It's not just because we have more experience; it's because we likely have more time on our hands. A 31-year-old executive running the same number of companies I do probably has a lot less time; I'm a bit further down the road, so I've been able to figure this puzzle out. People in my stage of life are also beginning to think about building a legacy and doing something meaningful with all the knowledge they've acquired. It's wise to tap into that.


But just as it's important to seek advice from the right professionals, it's also important to diversify your perspective. Opinions and recommendations from mentors both inside and outside your industry are critical in widening your lens and creating an all-inclusive view. When you go to these mentors for advice, make decisions that make sense — don't take shots in the dark by asking generalized questions to people outside your industry. When you look for an outside opinion, choose someone with experience with a problem you immediately need to solve. Maybe they have the financial experience you don't have or have found innovative solutions to an important tech problem.This practice also indirectly introduces you to people who may be able to support you down the road. The person you connect with may have connections to bankers, business insurance reps, etc. Receiving mentorship is more than learning how to run a business; it's about forming those necessary connections your business will need to survive. Numerous unexpected fires will inevitably pop up that you probably haven't thought about, and this is how you plan for the unplanned.Related: Elon Musk, Richard Branson & Jeff Bezos' Best Advice for Ensuring Your Startup Doesn't FailWhat to expect and how to get thereExperienced entrepreneurs will tell you the truth: being a CEO is not a comfortable 9-5. It's an 8-8, and people will have problems at 3 am. Every successful CEO will probably tell you they have 30 sleepless nights a year. If you're actually invested in your business, that is what it takes. If you don't work hard, work doesn't get done. And if you want your team to work hard, you must show up alongside them and lead by example.


When you approach these potential mentors, there are a few things to keep in mind if you actually want to get their ear. The first is to do your damn research. As an investor, I shouldn't receive a copy/paste email from you. I want to know why you think I'm the person you need to talk to. Why do you know who I am? What do you think I have to offer you? I've received several requests from hopeful entrepreneurs offering to meet me in person and buy me a cocktail, and because they've come across as pleasant human beings who have done their homework, I've taken them up on it.Related: 5 Types of People Who Can Help With Small Business MentoringYou can't replace face-to-face.I'm not against online courses, in-person seminars, or other exercises in business education. But nothing can replace face-to-face. It gives you a chance to ask tough questions, be vulnerable and experience their vulnerability in return. The result is a much more valuable learning experience.I won't say everything business-related you find on social media is garbage; it's not. But the opportunity to look someone in the eye and see their hard-won successes (and failures) is priceless. Take the extra time to find ""real"" human beings to connect with. You won't regret it.

96,How I Raised $2 Million Without Knowing Any Venture Capitalists,"Jun 7, 2023",Jackson Cunningham,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-i-raised-2-million-without-knowing-any-vcs/452840,"
One of the greatest challenges of entrepreneurship is raising money for your startup, especially if you don't have an established network of venture capitalists (VCs) to rely on. However, with the right strategies and approach, it's possible to secure the funding you need even without prior connections.My DTC cat company, tuft + paw, is living proof of this concept. In 2022, the company faced a critical situation: We urgently needed funds to address supply chain and inventory requirements. I hadn't built a network of VCs at that point, but I was determined to secure the capital we needed to keep the business running smoothly. In the end, I successfully raised $2 million in six months by using the strategies I outline here.I understand the challenges that come with raising funds without an established network, so I hope my story and advice can help you navigate the fundraising landscape more effectively. But before you get started, set realistic expectations — this is gonna take plenty of time and effort…



Related: How to Raise VC Funding When the Odds Are Against You1. Fundraising takes time and patienceRaising funds always takes longer than you anticipate. Even if you already know investors, it's wise to allow a minimum of three months for the process. For those starting from scratch like I did, be prepared for it to take around six months. Patience and persistence are key virtues during this journey. Embrace the process and give it the time it deserves.


Dedication and follow-ups:Raising funds requires significant effort and labor. In my case, nearly 50% of my time was spent in meetings and following up with potential investors. Remember, this is not a one-and-done process. You have to be dedicated, attend multiple meetings and provide timely updates to build trust and keep investors engaged.Give yourself some runway:Ideally, raise funds for a runway of at least 18 months. This ensures you have a comfortable buffer and don't find yourself constantly chasing funding every six months. Raising capital is a demanding process, and having an extended financial runway allows you to focus on growing your business without constant financial stress.


2. Craft a compelling pitch deckYour pitch deck is a critical tool for capturing investors' attention. Keep it simple, direct and transparent. Fancy visuals won't fool investors; they can see through any BS. Focus on showcasing your traction and growth, as well as your unique value proposition. Check out tuft + paw's online example for inspiration on how to create an effective pitch deck.3. Leverage your founder networkFounders are often the best way to connect with VCs. Reach out to your founder friends and ask for warm introductions to any VCs they may know. Personal referrals hold significant weight in the startup ecosystem and can help establish initial trust and credibility.4. Build a VC database and connectionsCreate a Google Sheet, and list as many VCs in your industry or category as possible. Our focus was on direct-to-consumer brands, but tailor it to your specific niche. Use LinkedIn to connect with these VCs. Try to secure warm introductions through mutual contacts. If you don't have any shared connections, don't worry. You can reach out to them directly using tools like Rocket Reach to find their email addresses. Craft personalized and compelling messages that demonstrate your knowledge of their investment focus, and express genuine interest in their expertise.The importance of building relationships:


Remember, building relationships with VCs takes time. Don't expect immediate results after just one meeting. In my experience, it typically takes at least five meetings with a particular VC before they make an investment decision. So, be patient, and nurture these relationships. Address their concerns, answer their questions, and demonstrate your industry knowledge and growth strategy. Show them why your business stands out and how it aligns with their investment thesis.Related: 5 Unconventional Ways to Attract VCs5. Effective outreach strategiesWhen reaching out to VCs directly, a concise email is the medium of choice. Craft a brief message that highlights your traction and includes a specific ask. This approach cuts to the chase and increases the chances of getting a response. For example:Hi Dave — we're a direct-to-consumer cat brand that achieved 100% year-over-year growth, with our most recent month generating $1 million in revenue. We're finalizing a $1 million raise, any interest? Deck attached.


6. The power of S.A.F.E.When it comes to paperwork and legal fees, a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) is the preferred format. It simplifies the process, reduces legal costs and allows you to concentrate on your business rather than getting tangled in complex legal negotiations. I definitely recommend using S.A.F.E. to streamline your fundraising journey.7. Explore alternative funding sourcesWhile VCs are often the go-to for startup funding, don't overlook alternative sources such as angel investors, crowdfunding platforms or small business grants. These avenues can provide access to capital and additional support for your business.Related: 3 Alternatives to Venture Capital Funding for StartupsI've said it once already, and I'll say it again: Raising funds will almost always take more time and labor than you expect. I was able to secure funding for my company because I was persistent, patient and proactive, even when things got held up or I was feeling frustrated. Allow ample time for the fundraising process, leverage your founder network, create a compelling pitch deck, and craft personalized outreach messages. Be prepared for multiple meetings, and invest in building relationships with potential investors. Remember, fundraising is a journey, and by following these strategies, you can increase your chances of securing the funding you need to propel your business forward. Best of luck on your fundraising endeavors!

98,A Guide to Visualizing Data in Your Pitch Deck,"Jun 1, 2023",Vikas Agrawal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/a-guide-to-visualizing-data-in-your-pitch-deck/450819,"
As an entrepreneur, a pitch deck is your most powerful tool to impress investors and raise investments from them. However, creating the perfect pitch deck can be a real challenge, and only 1% of pitch decks succeed in acquiring funds! So, how do you make things work here?To make a convincing impact, your pitch decks should tell an engaging story that covers the customers' problems, the solution you provide, market conditions, your financials, your traction and predictions and all other relevant details. At the same time, the presentation should also be concise and persuasive. How do you achieve this balance?One of the best ways to make such a concise yet convincing pitch deck is by using data visualization. After all, visual content constitutes 90% of the information transmitted to the brain, and we process visuals 60,000 times quicker than text! So, this article will focus on the art of visualizing data in your investment deck, helping you make complex information more engaging, accessible and persuasive for investors. Let's begin!



Importance of data visualization in pitch decksData visualization plays a crucial role in pitch decks, as it allows you to present complex information clearly, concisely and visually appealingly. A well-crafted pitch deck should convey your startup's story and showcase your data in a way that quickly and effectively communicates your business's potential.Remember that investors review numerous pitch decks, and the average investor spends only 3 minutes and 44 seconds on a pitch deck, so using data visualization is essential for creating a memorable, concise and convincing pitch deck is essential.


Data visualization will drive the success of your pitch decks at all points, from Seed to Series A! So, you must understand and follow the principles of visualizing data effectively at all stages. Here are some pointers to help you do this easily.Related: 4 Strategies for Pitching Company Stories That Rise Above the NoiseChoosing the tools: Selecting the right charts and graphsChoosing the right charts and graphs for your data is vital for an effective investor deck. Consider your audience, the type of data you are presenting and the message you want to convey to choose the right visualization tool.I identified 11 common types of charts, graphs and tables that are best for visualizing data, both non-financial and financial data visuals. Let's check out these graphs and their applications to help you choose the right one-


Non-Financial Charts and GraphsLine Graph — Shows the trends over defined periods.Pie Chart — Displays distribution of a single data point among categories.Proportional Area or Comparison Chart — Represents market size and the portion a company hopes to capture.Bar Charts — Compares different categories using horizontal or vertical bars.Timeline or Roadmap — Demonstrates the company's plans and milestones.Competitor Matrix/Comparison — Compares a company's features, strengths and weaknesses against competitors.Financial Charts and GraphsStacked Bar Graph — Demonstrates growth and distribution between different segments.Bar Graph — Shows growth or trends in financial data.Financial Table Snapshot — Provides a high-level summary of financial projections.Line Graph — Displays trends in financial data, such as revenue or profit.Stacked Area Line Chart — Shows different segment slices that make up overall financial figures.Remember that you don't have to stick to one type of visualization tool. Use multiple charts and graphs in your investment deck based on the slide's content and the aspects being covered.Related: 5 Tips for Taking Your Pitch Deck From Seed to Series A


Adding the visuals: Incorporating data visuals into your pitch deckTo create a cohesive pitch deck, ensure that data visuals complement your narrative and follow a consistent design across the presentation. Each visual should support the main points of the respective slide and must be strategically placed to maintain the flow of your investor presentation or deck.Moreover, you must avoid overwhelming investors with data by including only the most relevant and impactful visuals. Some of the most compelling Data Points to Visualize in a Pitch Deck are:1, 3, and 5-year revenue1, 3, and 5-year profitabilityCustomer churn rateCustomer signupsCustomer acquisition costsBreak-even pointMRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) GrowthCAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)SalesEnhancing the pitch: Balancing aesthetics and clarityWhile creating visually appealing data visuals is important, clarity should not be compromised. Your pitch deck should balance aesthetics and clarity, using colors, fonts and design elements that enhance the overall message without distracting from the data. Here are key points to consider when designing your pitch deck:Select appropriate visuals — Choose the most relevant visuals that enhance your message while you make a pitch deck. This could include graphs, tables and infographics.Use videos where appropriate — Don't hesitate to include explainer videos to explain complicated concepts, as people typically prefer videos to understand new information. After all, videos make up nearly 82% of internet traffic!Ensure clarity — Opt for simple, easy-to-understand visuals that are relevant to your data and message. Also, make sure that the visuals are correctly sized and labeled to enhance readability.Prioritize readability — Ensure that text is easy to read by using clear fonts and appropriate font sizes. Avoid overcrowding the slides, and don't cross 75 words per slide.Use consistent design elements — Apply a uniform design throughout your pitch deck using consistent colors, fonts and style. This consistency enhances the visual appeal and makes your presentation look polished and professional.Leverage whitespace — Whitespace, or empty space on your slides, can help guide the viewer's attention and prevent clutter. Use whitespace strategically to improve readability and emphasize key points.Color scheme — Use a color scheme that complements your branding and improves readability. Avoid using too many colors or overly bright hues that can be distracting or difficult to read.Test and refine — Gather feedback from others to ensure your pitch deck balances aesthetics, clarity and informative value. Iterate and refine the design and content based on the feedback you receive.By considering these points, you can make a pitch deck that is visually appealing while effectively communicating your message to potential investors.


A successful example of data visualization in an investor deck is the one used by Uber in their early funding rounds. They used simple yet compelling visuals and points to demonstrate their market potential, operating areas, services and growth trajectory. The perfect visual tool selection, clarity and simplicity allowed investors to quickly grasp the startup's innovative idea and potential, leading to successful funding rounds.Related: Successful Fundraising Begins With a Stellar Pitch DeckConclusionIncorporating effective data visualization in your pitch deck can make a significant difference in capturing investor interest. By selecting the right charts and graphs, incorporating visuals strategically and balancing aesthetics with clarity, you can create a compelling and persuasive pitch deck that stands out among the competition. If you find this complicated, you can also go for a pitch deck agency that specializes in making pitches with effective data visualizations. All the best!

99,Why a Good Venture Capitalist Has a Personal and Business Brand,"May 15, 2023",Jon Michail,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-a-good-venture-capitalist-has-a-personal-brand/450965,"
The presence and significance of venture capitalists in businesses cannot be emphasized enough. This piece is an opportunity to delve into the relationship between venture capitalists (VCs) and personal or business branding services.As you may already know, VCs invest in companies with high potential for returns and sustainable growth prospects. They are investors who provide companies with capital and guidance. VCs typically look for companies that offer a high potential for returns and, as such, will invest in firms that can demonstrate a competitive advantage and sustainable growth prospects.However, they may have reservations about investing in personal brand leadership services, as they may not perceive their value. They worry that they won't be able to see a clear return on their investment as it's an 'intangible"" and emotional ""soft"" value versus the logical ""hard"" value of money and finance.



Related: How Great Branding and a Stellar Pitch Deck Can Help You Gain a Venture Capital EdgeBut here's the thing: personal and business brand leadership services can be incredibly beneficial for the companies that VCs invest in. Once they understand the potential of personal branding service as a leadership trust-building exercise (as most human decisions are first emotional before they're backed by logic) and see the positive results for the firms they represent, they can become enthusiastic proponents. But first, the benefits, especially the financial possibilities, need to be presented to them. In fact, with the right approach, VCs can reap boundless benefits by supporting the investment in these services.


This article aims to explore the tangible benefits of personal and business brand leadership services and examine how they fit into the venture capital operations and model. By doing so, we hope to shed light on why it's not unusual for VCs to initially harbor aversion towards these services and later grow to love them for the benefit of the companies they invest in.Related: 6 Important Factors Venture Capitalists Consider Before InvestingHow venture capitalists benefit from personal and leadership business branding servicesVenture capitalists (VCs) are professional investors that are an integral part of the startup ecosystem and play a key role in helping companies get off the ground. VCs typically invest in companies with high growth potential, but are too early-stage or risky for traditional lenders. What this means is that venture capitalists are typically interested in companies that have the potential to become market leaders.Let's explore some ways venture capitalists benefit from personal and business brand leadership services.


1. Create a memorable brand identityVCs can benefit from personal and professional brand leadership services to develop a distinctive brand identity that distinguishes them from the competition. These services can assist VCs in developing a unique storyline that accurately represents their values, purpose, and objectives. They can also assist VCs in developing smart messaging and content that appeals to potential investors.2. Differentiate from the crowdWith so many VCs competing for the same investments, standing out from the crowd is important. It's critical to differentiate yourself from the pack, given the fierce competition for similar investments. Personal and business leadership branding services can assist VCs in developing a special value proposition, establishing connections with investors, and forging a distinctive brand identity.3. Build trustIt's crucial for VCs to establish trust with other potential investors. By developing a strong brand identity that communicates integrity and dependability, personal and corporate brand leadership services can aid VCs in gaining the trust of potential investors. They can assist in producing premium content that informs potential investors of the benefits of investing in such businesses. Strong relationships are developed by interacting with potential investors with timely, pertinent content.4. Increased visibilityVCs can benefit from personal and professional brand leadership services to improve their marketability. They can assist VCs in producing material that is sharable and accessible through a variety of digital media, including mainstream. VCs are able to build a powerful social media presence and use influencers to connect with potential investors.


5. Establish thought leadershipServices for elevating one's brand and becoming a thought leader is ever-growing. They assist in producing premium content that showcases know-how and other benefits beyond past tactics and campaigns.Related: 4 Ways Market Leaders Use Innovation to Foster Business GrowthHow CEO personal brand leadership adds value to the company.The potential value a CEO's company may create is significantly influenced by their personal brand. Enhancing employee and customer trust, enhancing the company's reputation, and luring top talent are all benefits of having a strong CEO personal brand. Additionally, it can boost customer retention, revenue growth and the value of the company's stock. In a nutshell, a CEO's personal brand leadership may become a priceless asset for any company.A CEO shows their dedication to the company's mission and values by using their personal brand to lead. This dedication may contribute to developing a cooperative, respectful and trustworthy workplace environment. Additionally, it demonstrates to current and potential customers that the business is dedicated to providing a high-quality good or service. Talented employees may also be drawn to the company with a strong CEO personal brand.


When a CEO is seen as an authentic leader in their field, their business will be viewed as a dependable and trustworthy supplier of goods and services. Increased client loyalty and increased customer attraction may result from this trust and dependability. Additionally, by giving investors more faith in the company's success, a strong personal brand leadership positioning can help to raise the value and share price of the business. This could spur an increase in income through several strategies, such as speaking engagements, networking occasions and collaborations with other organizations.In conclusion, my lived experience demonstrates that CEOs and venture capitalists have a special chance to gain from services for both personal and business leadership branding. It can improve consumer and employee trust, boost the company's brand, and draw in top-performing employees. Additionally, a strong personal brand sets up superior long and short-term organizational performance due to the boost in the company's revenue and customer loyalty.

101,How Startups Can Manage Their Cash Better — 4 Tips from a Venture Capitalist,"May 9, 2023",Vital Laptenok,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-startups-can-manage-their-cash-better-according-to-a-vc/450739,"
The bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank caused a great deal of stress for many startup founders. Although U.S. financial regulators intervened and took charge of customer deposits, the incident has shown that financial markets remain unstable.Amidst a banking panic, Signature Bank has suffered bankruptcy, while Credit Suisse is being acquired by its competitor UBS; First Republic Bank's customers have recently withdrawn over $100 billion.To avoid being swept up in a bank run like this, startups should concentrate on getting better at cash management and fostering strong relationships with banks. That's something VCs are going to pay more and more attention to when deciding to invest in a startup.



Here are four tips that startups could take to minimize their financial exposure.Tip #1 — Put money in multiple banksWhen the economy is unstable, the likelihood of bank failures rises due to factors such as higher interest rates, increased risk of loan defaults, investment losses, large customer withdrawals and stricter regulations by the government.


But even in steady economic conditions, banks may decide to freeze or close accounts for security or other reasons. That's why relying on a single bank account is never a safe option.Businesses should distribute their funds across two-four non-affiliated banks, preferably in different countries, while closely monitoring the activity of each account. I'd recommend keeping two checking accounts with sufficient cash to cover 2-3 months of expenses in each one and a third account for investing any surplus cash in safe and liquid assets.Those who find managing more than three accounts challenging should have at least two. One account can be designated for regular business operations such as payroll and supplier payments, while the other can be used for holding the remaining funds.For startups with a balance sheet exceeding $3 million, it is advisable to open a savings account with a reputable and stable A-level bank such as JPMorgan Chase & Co or Bank of America in the United States, Deutsche Bank or Crédit Agricole in Europe.


Consider buying Treasury Bills (or T-Bills), U.S. government bonds issued in U.S. dollars with a maturity period from one month to one year, which also have an annual yield of up to 5%. If a bank goes belly-up, T-bills won't be impacted by the bank's financial position because they are kept independently from the bank's finances.A clever idea would be to create an investment plan that prioritizes capital preservation rather than aiming solely to profit. Never hold the money of your VCs in cryptocurrency — it's too risky.Related: What Is A Cash Management Account?Tip #2 — Research countries, not just banksWhen you choose a bank for your startup, don't just look at how secure it is. Think about other factors that could make it stable or unstable in a particular country, especially if there were times when banks went bust there.


To find a bank in the right place, learn about the local rules and laws that control banks there. Evaluate economic and political climate, including inflation rates, the amount of interest banks charge and the stability of the currency and banks in that location.Related: Choosing A Bank For Your Startup: Here's Some Things To ConsiderTip #3 — Learn about deposit insurance provided by regulators, institutionsDifferent countries have their regulators that manage their financial systems. For instance, the United States has the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the United Kingdom has the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.These regulators are intended to safeguard bank deposits to a certain extent by providing insurance in case of bank failure.


The U.S. The FDIC insurance typically covers up to $250,000 per depositor per bank for individuals and businesses. Nonetheless, certain financial companies may provide additional deposit insurance options.In the wake of SVB's collapse, U.S.-based financial platform Brex has upped its FDIC insurance limit for companies to $2.25 million. Meanwhile, neobank Mercury has increased deposit insurance for its customers to up to $3 million.Other ways to increase deposit insurance coverage are using certificates of deposit accounts (CDARS), credit unions, or the MaxSafe program, allowing to increase FDIC insurance to $3.75 million.The U.K. U.K.-based startups can obtain up to £85,000 deposit insurance coverage per bank, per depositor, via the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).


Private banks and building societies (a type of financial institution) offer deposit insurance above the FSCS limit by joining the FSCS Temporary High Balance Scheme (THBS). It may offer extra protection for deposits of up to £1 million for up to six months.Europe. In the European Union (EU), all member countries must have a deposit guarantee scheme (DGS) to safeguard customers in case a bank fails. DGS usually offers coverage of up to €100,000 per depositor, per bank. However, non-EU banks may not offer deposit insurance for companies at all.Some European countries — both EU and non-EU — have supplementary insurance opportunities beyond the DGS. In Norway, deposits of up to 2 million kroner per depositor, per bank are protected by Bankenes Sikringsfond. In Germany, many private banks are part of the Association of German Banks, which provides insurance coverage for deposits of up to €50 million.Due to the lengthy process of opening an account with an A-level bank (6-18 months), many startups prefer e-money institutions such as Wise, Stripe or PayPal instead. In this case, the account opening process is faster (a few weeks) and offers a more seamless customer experience. But financial regulators don't normally protect the funds kept there.


Related: Collapsed Silicon Valley Bank Finds a BuyerTip #4 — Warm banks up to youBy developing a rapport with your bank, you can benefit from more individualized updates on the status of your accounts and investments. One way to strengthen this relationship is by creating an investment account and buying shares or debt obligations through the bank.To establish a favorable relationship with banks, consider entrusting them with the management of your funds. High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs), who possess investable assets of at least $1 million, are the main source of profit for banks through their money management services. In CEE, the standard commission for investment management services averages around 1-1.5%.In my experience as an investor, startups that adopt smart cash management strategies have the edge over their rivals when trying to raise funds.


Create a plan for how much money you will have/need for the upcoming month; check and update it every day. Keep track of when you have to pay bills and when you expect to receive funds. Make sure to have a process for approving money transfers to avoid fraud; try to use the ""four eyes principle.""If you anticipate any financial difficulties, notify your executive team and board, and reserve a credit line from one of your key banks to support the company's operations for at least six months (but use it only if necessary).Related: Beyond the Basics: 5 Surprising Qualities Investors Seek in a Winning Team

102,Don't Let Inflation Kill Your Small Business. Here's How to Secure More Funding and Give Yourself a Financial Cushion.,"May 5, 2023",Rich Rao,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/3-ways-to-shore-up-your-business-finances-in-a-tight-economy/450168,"
Around the country, many small businesses are feeling the burden of inflation. Increased costs on everything from raw supplies and shipping to labor and utilities are cutting into the already razor-thin margins that many of them operate with. Add to this the threat of a looming recession and other macroeconomic headwinds, and it's easy to see why entrepreneurs are looking for ways to shore up their finances and save money.Recently, I joined Intuit QuickBooks, specifically because I wanted to help small businesses better manage their finances amid these challenges. Based on what I've seen, the good news is that despite these challenges, there are many ways that businesses can improve holistic cash flow — often with some easy operational changes and simple-to-use tools and platforms.Here are three strategies for shoring up finances that I recommend to entrepreneurs to best position themselves for success.Related: How Great Entrepreneurs Find Ways to Win During Economic Downturns1. Assess your inventoryOne of the first things I recommend for product-based businesses looking to improve their finances is to critically analyze your sales and inventory to better understand your customer base as well as what's driving expenses and profits.



For example, soon after joining QuickBooks, I heard the story of our customer, Jessica Spaulding, the founder of Harlem Chocolate Factory. While many of us may not realize it, chocolate is both a capital- and time-intensive business, with high overhead in the form of quality, fair trade ingredients and talented chocolatiers who develop recipes and even individual treats by hand. Soaring prices of raw ingredients as well as supply chain issues threatened to disrupt the business Spaulding worked so hard to build — a message many small business owners can relate to.To combat this and move forward strategically, Spaulding took a step back and looked at what her books were telling her. What products were selling the most? What wasn't selling? Using these insights, she redirected her team to be laser-focused on the products and flavors that were driving the most business and profit. She was also able to decrease her overhead in the short term, as she cut back on the ingredients needed to create less popular flavors.As I mentioned, closely examining your inventory and sales history is something that all product-based businesses can do. Use your bookkeeping solution to analyze the sales of individual SKUs and look for any trends in your sales — whether it be seasonal, channel-based, location-based or influenced by another factor. You can also work with your accountant or bookkeeper to better understand where you may be able to trim costs or double down to boost profits. Finally, once you're armed with these insights, put them into action like Spaulding did — honing in on the products that are resonating most with customers.Related: 6 Key Tips for Leading Transparently in Economic Uncertainty


2. Secure working capitalIt's often been said that it ""takes money to make money."" The more I talk to entrepreneurs, the more I think that's true. The importance of working capital for businesses that are growing or getting off the ground cannot be understated. Unfortunately, the traditional lending system — with long, drawn-out processes and an emphasis on past business credit — is not designed to support many fledgling businesses.The good news is that now more than ever there are alternatives for business owners to explore when it comes to securing funding. One option is crowdfunding through websites like GoFundMe and Kickstarter, which allow businesses to launch digital fundraisers. Peer-to-peer or marketplace lending via platforms like Lending Club or Prosper that connect borrowers and lenders online are another avenue to explore. There's also a multitude of small business grants out there — from federal and regional-based programs, those sponsored by corporations, or some specifically designed for members of certain communities like veterans or women. Be sure to store your applications in a Word or Google document to reference later, rather than just submitting via the online form. This will save you some leg work when filling out future applications.Another path I learned about recently was that of QuickBooks customer, Grace+Love Candle Co., who secured funding through us when they were originally denied by traditional banks. Unlike a bank loan, QuickBooks Capital doesn't require an extensive application process. Rather, it determines creditworthiness by analyzing the company's history as shown by the data in their books.The most important thing to remember when working to secure capital is not to get discouraged. While you may hear many ""nos,"" during your journey, it only takes one ""yes,"" — and as I've outlined, there are a myriad of different options available to explore.


Related: 3 Steps to Effectively Lead Through Uncertain Financial Times or Company Restructuring3. Speed up and diversify paymentsNow more than ever, consumers (and even businesses) expect to be able to pay seamlessly in a variety of ways — from credit cards to PayPal, Venmo, ACH and more. This means businesses need to embrace and diversify integrated payment systems, allowing customers to pay across multiple channels (i.e. mobile, online, etc.) and accept multiple forms of payment. In addition to meeting customer expectations and helping to increase sales conversion, digital payments also mean money hits a business's bank account faster.While it may not seem significant, the impact of real-time payments can be tremendous. For example, instant payments — rather than a delay of a few days — may help a small business owner who needs to make payroll, pay rent or place an order for supplies. Take a look at how quickly your payments are currently processed. If it's longer than a day, there are likely options you can look into that are faster.Entrepreneurs have shown their resiliency in spades the past several years. While we may be entering a difficult economic climate, I have no doubt they will continue to overcome these challenges. The more small businesses can do now to shore up their finances — from strategically evaluating their inventory and analyzing sales to understanding the funding sources available and embracing integrated payments, the better positioned they'll be in to succeed despite looming challenges.

104,7 Reasons to Trust Your Gut When Starting a Business,"May 4, 2023",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/7-reasons-to-trust-your-gut-in-entrepreneurship/450378,"
Starting a business is an exciting but daunting prospect. You need to consider many factors when taking the plunge and deciding whether or not you can make it a success. One crucial factor that shouldn't be overlooked is trusting your gut.Trusting your gut means more than just relying on instinct or being impulsive. It's about trusting your intuition and decisions when starting a business. It's about learning how to recognize the signs that something isn't right and taking action accordingly rather than having an emotional reaction to every situation. Knowing how to trust your gut can help you make decisions confidently, even in uncertain times.Related: Should You Actually Trust Your Gut Feelings?Why should you trust your gut? You know what's right for you. Every decision you make needs to be right for you and your business. While opinions from family and friends are valuable, ultimately, you should make the final call based on what you believe is best for you and your business. Only by listening to what feels right internally can you make the right decision for yourself and your venture.Recognize patterns. Experienced entrepreneurs know how to identify patterns in their businesses that signal opportunities or challenges ahead. Learning to read between the lines will help inform decisions that lead to growth and success for your business. Recognizing patterns also enables you to spot potential problems before they become too big of an issue so that issues can be addressed quickly as they arise.Make quick decisions. Trusted entrepreneurs take decisive action when faced with difficult situations rather than dwelling on them for too long or overthinking their options. This helps them move quickly from one challenge or opportunity to another without getting bogged down in analysis paralysis or second-guessing themselves due to fear of failure or change. By identifying patterns in their businesses, trusted entrepreneurs can make quick decisions with confidence that align with their core values and goals for their company without hesitation or indecision, delaying progress or putting them at risk of missing out on potential opportunities down the line due to lack of action now.Stay true to yourself. One crucial thing successful entrepreneurs understand is staying true to who they are as individuals while running their businesses regardless of external pressures from peers, industry trends, etc. Staying true allows them to remain focused on achieving their goals rather than being distracted by temporary fads or industry hype since trust relies heavily on consistency over time.Don't get caught up in the details. Many entrepreneurs get caught up in details when starting a business instead of focusing on what matters most: the people involved in making things happen! That's why trusted entrepreneurs prioritize relationships over tasks; they understand that building strong relationships between key stakeholders is essential for long-term success, even if it requires extra effort during tough times like start-up phases which may require everyone to work together diligently until stability sets in!Listen to advice but ignore the noise. A successful entrepreneur understands where the advice comes from before accepting it; advice from experienced professionals should be taken seriously, but input from random strangers should be ignored since chances are it might not have a basis in reality nor provide any tangible benefits, either short term or long term! That's why trusted entrepreneurs listen carefully before acting upon feedback received because sometimes ""no"" is just as important as ""yes""! Additionally, if the advice does come from someone reputable, then there's no harm double checking facts provided out of precaution because mistakes can happen, so always verify information correctly before proceeding!Embrace failure. Ultimately failure happens, but it doesn't mean destruction; failure provides valuable lessons which can help shape future decisions made by trusting entrepreneurs who embrace adversity instead of running away from it because when done correctly, failure leads us closer to our desired outcomes, not away from them due diligence coupled dedication paying off eventually if persistent enough!Related: Know When to Trust Your Gut and When to Seek Outside AdviceConclusionStarting a business requires courage and conviction. Trusting your gut is just one way successful entrepreneurs learn how to manage risks while navigating uncharted territory successfully!



It's all about learning how to recognize patterns within our environment, spotting opportunities, taking decisive actions while staying true to ourselves, never allowing outside noise to distract us and focusing solely on what matters.Energy is spent unnecessarily, so always trust your gut and never settle for anything less than the best. Strive higher — only then will you reap the rewards.

The sales presentation is often the make-or-break moment in the sales process. It's the time when you have to captivate and convert your audience. But that's not easy! After all, the audience's average attention span during presentations is just five to ten minutes, and their receptiveness to promotion is decreasing by the day. So, does that make sales decks obsolete?Not at all! A well-designed sales deck presentation can still make all the difference by grabbing your audience's attention and converting them to customers. A clever design based on a strategic approach will ultimately drive your sales to new heights, but you need to play your cards right.Here is a proven strategy I apply to build winning sales decks that hook the audience and compel them into action.Related: These 4 Pitch-Deck Essentials Can Help You Get the Meeting That Changes Your LifeStructuring your sales deck for maximum impactThe first and foremost component of a good sales deck strategy is structuring your sales deck. This is because the structure of your presentation plays a crucial role in capturing and maintaining your audience's attention. So, your deck should be structured to take your audience on a journey from the beginning to the end. Here are some tips to help you structure your deck.



Start with a clear and concise introduction that sets the tone for the presentation.Use visuals and graphics to break up the text and make your presentation more visually appealing. This will help your audience stay engaged and focused on your message.Divide your deck into sections that are easy to follow. Each section should have a clear purpose and a logical flow.Use headings and subheadings to guide your audience through the presentation.Don't overwhelm your audience with too much information on one slide. Instead, keep your slides simple and easy to read.Engaging your audience from the startThe first few slides of your sales deck are critical in capturing your audience's attention. Most of the audience that leaves usually does so within the first 15 seconds. So, you have very little time to prove that you're worth your audience's time. What's the solution?Start with a hook that grabs their attention quickly and makes them want to learn more. You may use a question, statistic or fact that is relevant to your audience and highlights the problem you are solving for this purpose. Also, ensure your hook is followed by a clear and concise value proposition explaining how your product or service solves the problem.Maintaining interest throughout the presentationCapturing your audience's attention is a great start, but it's now important to maintain their interest throughout the presentation. So, how do you do this? There are multiple aspects while you make a sales deck to ensure its engaging power, but here are some key pointers for you to follow-Use a mix of visuals and text to keep your presentation visually appealing and engaging. Add infographics, images and even videos to your presentation to boost its engaging power.Keep your slides simple and avoid cluttering them with too much information. Properly organized and easily understandable decks are often the most effective.Use storytelling to make your presentation more engaging. People love stories, and they're more likely to get interested and remember your message if it's presented in a story format.Use case studies and real-life examples to illustrate your points and make the presentation more relatable. This will help your audience connect with your message on a deeper level.Don't be afraid to use humor in your presentation! Humor is a great way to keep your audience engaged and relaxed. It also makes the presentation more memorable. Use relevant and tasteful humor that aligns with your brand and message.Use interactive elements to make your presentation more engaging. Polls, quizzes, and surveys are great ways to get your audience involved in the presentation. They also provide valuable feedback that can help you improve your sales pitch.You don't have to do all the explaining manually! Unleash the power of explainer videos to attract, engage, and convert your audience. After all, 61% of customers say they've been convinced to buy a product or service by watching the brand's video.Improving your sales deckSales decks are complex, and getting them right in one go is not practical. So, you need to get feedback on your sales deck and improve it continuously. Here are a few steps you can take to get feedback on your sales presentation-


Share it with colleagues or other professionals in your industry and ask for their honest feedback. Ask them to provide specific feedback on what they liked and didn't like about the deck and how it could be improved.Use tools like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to create a survey and gather feedback from a larger group of people. This can help you get a more comprehensive understanding of what people think about your sales deck.Schedule a meeting with your sales team or stakeholders and present your sales deck to them. Ask for their feedback and suggestions on how to improve it.Consider hiring a professional consultant or coach who specializes in sales to review your deck and provide expert feedback.Once you have gathered feedback, you must carefully review it and make the necessary changes and updates to your sales deck. Ultimately, your goal should be to create a deck that generates interest in your product or service by explaining and validating its benefits for the user.Example of an effective sales deckIt's time for a real-life example to demonstrate the discussed points and help you make a sales deck. So, check this successful sales deck from SalesForce. Salesforce provides leading CRM solutions, and its sales deck features visual diagrams, flowcharts, images and text overlays to make its complex processes easy to understand.This sales deck directly addresses the audience's problems and explains how the software streamlines sales and helps prospects along their buying journey. It provides clear explanations with convincing statistics and usage cases.ConclusionBuilding a winning sales deck requires careful planning and multiple rounds of improvements, but it indeed pays off big time.

However, I've found it imperative to always start with comprehensive market analysis and audience research to make a presentation that is relatable, informative, and persuasive. Take your time for the research, then apply my tips to make a winning sales deck and close those deals.

108,How to Build Sustainable and Meaningful Business Relationships,"Apr 28, 2023",Ray Titus,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-tips-for-building-meaningful-business-relationships/450043,"
One of my most satisfying, long-lasting business relationships began at a trade show organized by a new promoter. Year after year, we saw each other at the show and built an excellent relationship through good times and challenging periods. Today, we refer new business opportunities to each other all the time.I can call that relationship a true friendship because it's not all about business, and it's not a transactional arrangement anymore; we don't make referrals to get something in return, like taking turns picking up the check at lunch. We've come to know and trust each other over the years, so when someone needs help, we know whom to recommend. We know our most valued customers will be in good hands.That's the first rule of relationships in business: Help the other person without expecting anything in return.Related: 4 Strategies for Building Deep Business RelationshipsThe more you give, the more you gainOffer your support and resources from a sincere desire to help, not because your colleague will owe you something. I believe that the more you give and the more freely you give, the more you gain — a reputation for generosity and credibility as the ""go-to"" person for help and advice. In addition, customers you refer to other businesses may look at you more positively because you helped them in addition to helping the company you referred them to consider.



Take a cue from LinkedIn, the online business connection platform. Read the posted content, and you'll notice that while many ask other members to do business with them, a large proportion simply offer helpful insights and information. They hope it will lead to new business, of course, but no such strings are attached.Like LinkedIn connections, in-person business relationships begin by offering opportunities to help. Real, lasting business success comes from the relationships you nurture, person to person — and if you're doing it right, it comes before your product or its price. Of course, you can't dismiss product and price; your customers certainly won't ignore them if they are significantly different from your competitors. But if you have established a solid relationship, it can get you through a lot. When there's not much difference between your product or service and your competition's, a good relationship can tip the customer's decision in your favor.Related: 7 Amazing Ways to Build Long-Term Relationships With Your Customers5 tips for creating and nurturing relationships that matterCheck your attitude: It's almost like falling in love. You must genuinely enjoy being with sales prospects or the people you work with. Get excited about what you offer them. Put on your most positive attitude, wear a smile on your face, and be able to laugh with them. If you show them how much you enjoy your work, they'll want to feel the same way.Find a connection: Finding a common interest with the other person helps. Learn what they need and want — but not what you can sell them (and you don't have to be subtle about it. Just ask them; they'll be flattered). Since I've traveled so much, I know interesting places to sightsee and good restaurants to try, so if a customer or colleague is visiting a place where I've been, I recommend the locations to them. It gives them a positive feeling about me, which they'll remember.Make gift-giving meaningful: I like to send a gift at Thanksgiving, as I have found that Christmas and New Year gifts can pile up, so yours may get lost in the stack. But I don't just give during holidays. During the year, I will give books I have read and found worthwhile or send one of my own authored books with a personal note written inside.Join a networking or lead-referral group: They're excellent ways to connect with new businesses, especially if you find it hard to get out and meet prospects yourself. But remember, networking isn't a contest you win by handing out the most business cards; it's the starting point for new relationships (some people leave their cards behind, so they won't be tempted to go on a card-dropping spree). Approach these events with the intent of finding contacts you can help, not people who can help you.Relax: I'll go back to the analogy of falling in love. It's often said that love happens when you least expect it, and the harder and more intentionally you look, the less success you have. Whether you're prospecting at a networking event or just chatting with customers, don't make everything about you and your needs. Relax and get to know the other person authentically. If they think you're only interested in them because of what you'll get out of it, they'll break up with you before your first date.It all comes down to offering help with no expectations of payback. Just keep doing the right things, and eventually, a reciprocal relationship will grow. Many people have helped me in the past and never asked for anything in return. I remember each of them, and I will always look for opportunities to help them in the future. The key is knowing your customers better than you know your products or services.Related: Want Strong Business Relationships? Avoid These 3 Mistakes.

109,How to Raise Funds as a Startup in a High Interest Rate Market,"Apr 28, 2023",Shannon Scott,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-raise-funds-as-a-startup/450069,"
The world's best surfers will tell you that to be incredible, you have to wait for the right wave. Every wave you choose to paddle consumes an incredible amount of energy, time and mental concentration. If you're able to channel all of your skill and stamina into that one beautiful wave, you will be much more successful than trying to ride 50 bad ones.As a new founder, you don't have the resources to catch every wave — nor is it prudent to do so. You must be calculated and strategic so you can make the most of your chance to make it.The traditional bank routeFor startups considering going the bank route, this probably isn't your wave. With interest rates soaring to nearly double what they were last year, free money is no longer an option. Most startups don't have the luxury of deep pockets to begin with, making traditional lending unviable. One of the few exceptions is for those running a minority-owned business or a member of a group with historic barriers to capital; in these cases, SBA loans are still worth considering because of their adjusted terms.



If you don't qualify for SBA and the bank route is your only option, here's a word of caution: wait until the rates stabilize. As with any market instability, the next twelve months will tell the country's financial future.For those unwilling to wait out the storm, think about basic accounting: if your company is running at 50% gross profit and 30% net profit, don't make the mistake of assuming that a 4% increase in sales will make up for a 4% increase in interest on your loan. It won't. You need to increase your profit by 4% — you need to increase your sales by 12-15%. If you choose to lock yourself into a high-interest loan, be prepared with a solid money strategy and solid reasoning that justifies giving away that much money.


Another option worth considering is a line of credit. They're easier to manage, and you can see your borrowed total shrinking, similar to a checking account. At any given time, entrepreneurs are juggling a thousand different things to make their business successful, so do anything you can to simplify the financials.Related: 4 Ways to Deal With High Interest Rates in Every Part of Your BusinessThe VC routeWhile the bank wants to know about your assets before writing you a check, VCs must be approached differently. Your asset is your three-year business plan, and it better be rock solid. As an investor, I'm looking for founders willing to eat, sleep, drink, and marry their business — and I want to make sure I know all of that about you in the first three minutes we're talking. That may sound like a lot of pressure, and it is — so is starting a successful business from the ground up.As a VC, I'm looking for a founder who knows the market, their product, how much money they need and what they will spend it on. The minutiae can come later, but if you can't convince me that you're fired up about your idea, and you've done your homework, it's a waste of both of our time. One of the first red flags is when entrepreneurs aren't willing to commit all their time and money to their own endeavors. If you're hoping to maintain another job or want VCs to invest money into a plan you're not willing to invest in yourself, you have the wrong approach.


When you approach a VC, ask for more than you need. The person who comes to me and tells me they need $300k but is asking for $500k is the person I want to talk to. At the end of the year, entrepreneurs often find themselves back at the VC's door asking for more money simply because they failed to plan for how much they'd realistically need. Asking for the wrong amount the first time is a mistake, and that second investment will cost you significantly more.Related: 3 Ways to Raise Capital and Take Your Business to the Next LevelAlternative optionsNumerous micro-funding organizations have popped up in the last few years. These non-bank lenders are gaining popularity, offering microloans for anything under $50,000 with a streamlined credit process. Unlike traditional loans, these microloans are designed to give small business owners a leg up without drowning them in debt, making it a smart option for entrepreneurs who only need a small amount of money to launch their businesses.Related: What is the Federal Funds Rate and How Does it Impact Loan Rates?


Preparedness is your biggest assetTo secure funding for your business, the first step isn't to ask for money; it's to determine exactly how much you'll need. I always encourage entrepreneurs to create an expense budget that includes all their bills for one year. Whatever budget you come up with, increase that amount by 15% because you will need a cushion. Whatever you forecast in revenue, deduct 15% because you likely won't hit your revenue targets. Within that final number lies the truth of how much lending you need.This isn't pessimistic; it's just the way that it works — you figure out what's reasonable, and then you add a safety net for everything unforeseen. We tend to overvalue our ability to create something quickly without any hiccups. By accounting for these contingencies before they crop up, you can better prepare to face them when they inevitably appear.Plan your move wiselyWhere and how you choose to obtain funding could make or break your business. Take a breath, look for advice, and try to make smart financial decisions. If the time doesn't feel right, trust your gut; no one will steal your idea overnight, so it's OK to wait. As you consider your options, look at the bigger picture, like economic stability, interest rates, and future implications, before making your move. After all, it may be the only move you have.
