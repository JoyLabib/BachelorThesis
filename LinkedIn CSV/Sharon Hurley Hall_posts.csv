Sharon Hurley Hall,Female,2023-08-27,"So, yesterday I started recording the audiobook of I’m Tired of Racism. So exciting!Instructions from the studio were to avoid wearing clothes that rustle and jewellery that jingle. Given that I’m usually in trousers or shorts and tee-shirts and wear silver bobs most of the time, it was easy to meet those requirements.The studio happens to be five minutes from my home at the end of an industrial estate. Despite that, it’s surprisingly quiet. Though it’s pretty unassuming from the outside, the mixing equipment is pretty impressive.I had a flask with a warm honey and lemon drink with me - that worked surprisingly well any time I started feeling a little hoarse. They also supplied water. That initial session was about 4 hours, and I’m doing another 2-hour session today.Once I finish my bit, the sound engineer will go back and edit out any mistakes (he described it as a clean recording, but there were still a few times where I stumbled over words and had to repeat stuff), and then the audio will be mastered. The guy who does the mastering will be out of town for a while, so I may not get the final version till late October, early November. There’s still lots to do in the meantime - audiobook cover design, for example. I’ll keep you posted.",224,75,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAB0e8ABVuvHk1GL7bPB4sMl_bEmmMPoci4%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAB0e8ABVuvHk1GL7bPB4sMl_bEmmMPoci4&keywords=sharon%20hurley%20hall%20(she%2Fher)&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=037cf45f-368e-471c-ae0d-6ce59d68386b&sid=O!O&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Sharon Hurley Hall,Female,2023-11-27,"I've been shaken by some recent events, both personal and global, and I've had low capacity to create my own posts. That's how it goes sometimes, and it may last for a while longer.However, I have continued to share and amplify the voices of others, especially those better informed than I am. I saw something on Instagram recently that resonated (and lost it immediately, the feed being what it is). The gist of it was that as welcome as a ""pause"" is, you don't just pause a genocide; you have to stop it completely. I agree.Free Palestine. Permanent ceasefire now!What I said before still stands:I will not celebrate anyone's death.There is no excuse for genocide.There is no excuse for killing innocent civilians. There is no excuse for apartheid. Oppression is wrong. Occupation is wrong. And nothing good ever came from colonialism or imperialism.Finally, a reminder of what I believe and do my best to live: I am against bigotry, racism, discrimination and inequity. I'm for creating equality for deliberately disadvantaged folx and for everyone. I'm committed to continuing to learn and grow and to always doing better.

Sharon Hurley Hall,Female,2023-10-27,"I've been trying to gather my words for days but they remain stubbornly ungathered. So here's where I am: I've felt ill-informed and have been trying to fill my knowledge gaps without resorting to biased media outlets.

There is no excuse for apartheid. Oppression is wrong. Occupation is wrong. And nothing good ever came from colonialism or imperialism. As a Black woman, watching people spew vitriol on other Global Majority people awakens all kinds of trauma, both generational and from my own experience. The inhumanity of killing innocents is also traumatic.I will not celebrate anyone's death. And I will not countenance Islamophobia or antisemitism.

It’s an experiential learning event for senior leaders and leadership teams of organisations committed to providing safe and equal work experiences for their people. It will share what we’ve learned about creating equality in organisations, which is a LOT!We’re aiming for mid-May in New York City, but we don’t yet have a venue. A few people are already helping us find one (thank you!), but I’m also asking you, LinkedIn network, for your help. Ideally, we’d like a donated space for one day that can hold around 100-120 people. (A low-cost space would also work.) The space should have projection facilities and should allow for us to break into smaller groups within the room. Comping us a space is a great way to 1) work towards equality 2) support Global Majority founders. In exchange, you’ll get a mention whenever we mention the event, and we’re happy to offer free event tickets to a few people from the sponsoring organisation or organisations. We’re happy to talk about other forms of value exchange too.Can anyone help?Thank you!

Sharon Hurley Hall,Female,2023-07-27,"GETTING TO KNOW ME (August 2023 update)Hey LinkedIn folx, I was chatting with a new connection recently and realised it had been a while since I’d done a reintroduction. So here’s where I’m at: FOR AND AGAINSTI am against bigotry, discrimination and inequity. I'm for creating equality for deliberately disadvantaged folx. I'm committed to continuing to learn and grow and to always doing better.WHAT I TALK ABOUTHere on LinkedIn, I talk mostly about equality, anti-racism, self-publishing and book marketing, with occasional posts about startup life and wellbeing. If you want to see my content, you’ll need to follow, ring the bell on my profile, and hope for the best. I’ve been critical of how this platform treats Black and Global Majority creators, and I sincerely believe that’s resulted in a drop in visibility. That won’t stop me from writing, but if you want to keep up to date, it’s a good idea to subscribe to my newsletters. I have two - one on anti-racism which has paid subscriptions - and a free one where I republish (and sometimes expand on) some of the stuff I post here. Some people see my content there before they see it here, which is kind of wild. MY ROLESI am a Co-Founder of Mission Equality CIC. Our name is our goal. We believe in education as a driver of change on the path to equality. We’re working hard on a series of Mx of Equality programmes to shift the way we think so we can do better. The first two will cover business and anti-racism, and we’ll also set the scene with a foundation course for all our programmes. We’re yay close to releasing the first parts.I'm the author of ""I'm Tired of Racism: True Stories of Existing While Black"" - the book where global majority people feel seen and would-be allies get an insight into global Black experiences. Released in October 2022, the book hit several bestseller milestones, including:- #1 new release in Essays (Kindle)- Top 10 Discrimination and Racism Studies (Amazon Canada)- Top 20 Discrimination and Racism Studies (Amazon US)- Top 50 Discrimination and Racism Studies (Amazon UK)- 80+ five star ratings on Amazon, Goodreads and Kobo (if you've read it and you have the bandwidth to write a short review, I'd be grateful, as that boosts Amazon visibility).The book is available digitally in multiple stores, though only Amazon has the print versions. I’m just about to start work on the audiobook, which I hope to release later this year. As I mentioned, I am the founder and curator in chief of Sharon's Anti-Racism Newsletter, where I offer my global perspectives on racism (via articles and a mini podcast) AND a platform for other activists and Black founders (via interviews). It has more than 5000 subscribers, of whom 300 or so are kind enough to offer their financial support. (I’d really love to find another 200 people who feel the same.)Thanks for being here.

Sharon Hurley Hall,Female,2024-02-27,"Just when you think you’ve seen it all, you find there’s another way for people to attempt to exploit would-be writers. One of my soon to be ex-connections asked me to get involved in a scheme - I can only call it a scheme - which sounded like vanity press meets MLM. He said I’d be a featured author and all I had to do was persuade 10 more people to write a chapter in a co-authored book. I’d get my spot for free; they’d have to pay $1300 apiece. And we were guaranteed bestseller status.I’m internet old, and my spidey senses tingle at anything that seems too good to be true. And this did, big-time, on many fronts. In addition to being outraged that he’d think I’d invite anyone to this “nopertunity”, I’m concerned that some people might fall for this, but it's definitely a case of ""buyer beware"". As far as I can tell:- The person who offered the nopertunity will be getting $13,000 per book - the writers get nothing up front- There’s a promise of an unspecified revenue share (not sure for what) plus 30% of online sales royalties (for comparison, I get 70% of the royalties on my self-published print on demand books)- My friend Jenn, who’s a whiz at these things, has detected a whiff of the link farm in how his site is set up (which will result in Google penalties)- It looks like after the book is published, you’re encouraged to buy more tools and services to boost sales (so more revenue for his company and less for the writers)That’s without even digging into who owns the book and the material in it, and other pertinent questions. For example, what if his company stops promoting the book? Because 30% of nothing is nothing. In short, the people contributing chapters would be getting the very short end of a particularly crappy stick, in my opinion. As a writer, if you decide to go the self-publishing route, it’s best to have your own platform. And while it makes sense to pay for some services, like professional editing and cover design, there’s a lot you can do yourself. No, you probably won’t become an instant bestseller (though you never know), but you will get all your royalties, and you’ll be able to sleep at night, too. cc Jennifer Mattern#publishing #selfpublishing",53,38,6,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAB0e8ABVuvHk1GL7bPB4sMl_bEmmMPoci4%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAB0e8ABVuvHk1GL7bPB4sMl_bEmmMPoci4&keywords=sharon%20hurley%20hall%20(she%2Fher)&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=037cf45f-368e-471c-ae0d-6ce59d68386b&sid=O!O&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

I mentioned this in conversation with a friend recently and she immediately donated $12. (And yes, not everyone can and that's totally fine.

Sharon Hurley Hall,Female,2024-04-25,"I don't know about you, but issues about anti-racism and equality are never far from my mind. Once you are aware of oppression, it's hard to avoid that being a lens through which you make sense of the world.So it's not a surprise that while I was doing some light reading, I noticed something odd about the characters in a book. It was moving along nicely when the writer threw in a mention that one of the characters was Black. But it was odd, in that it seemed a gratuitous mention at that point in the story. So I went to check who the writer was. She appeared to be white. Which is fine but the way she was writing about the Black characters suggested  she had no experience of the Black community. Which is not fine.How did I pick up on that? Because in just a few pages she managed to trot out some stereotypes about anger, violence and hypersxuality in relation to Black people. Apart from that the characters were largely one-dimensional.No amount of Black with a capital B (sprinkled liberally throughout the book) could camouflage the fact that the author was too far removed from what she was writing about and therefore couldn't make the characters well-rounded. What's also worrying is that her portrayals are adding to the mass of stereotypes that are already out there.This isn't the representation we need or deserve.",44,10,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAB0e8ABVuvHk1GL7bPB4sMl_bEmmMPoci4%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAB0e8ABVuvHk1GL7bPB4sMl_bEmmMPoci4&keywords=sharon%20hurley%20hall%20(she%2Fher)&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=037cf45f-368e-471c-ae0d-6ce59d68386b&sid=O!O&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Sharon Hurley Hall,Female,2024-03-27,"For those wondering how long it takes to put together my newsletter, here's an interim report. I publish approximately 8 articles/interviews and 2 podcast episodes a month. I batch write in advance when I can so that when it's time to schedule I have only the editing to do. Each original piece can take up to an hour to write - they're usually around 700-800 words long. Some write themselves, some take longer. When it's time to edit and schedule, that's usually another hour apiece.Interviews are submitted via a form and usually only need light editing. Editing and doing the graphics can take around 45 minutes to an hour for each piece. (And yes, mistakes and typos still slip through occasionally - I'm human.)When I can, I write podcast content before recording it. The episodes are short, but they probably take 30-45 minutes each when you include recording and re-recording, creating transcripts and graphics and doing the actual post. That adds up to around 15 hours a month just on the content creation piece. That does not include backend admin, keeping track of stats, tweaking templates, responding to comments or dealing with tech issues. And it definitely doesn't include social media or other marketing.",20,11,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAB0e8ABVuvHk1GL7bPB4sMl_bEmmMPoci4%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAB0e8ABVuvHk1GL7bPB4sMl_bEmmMPoci4&keywords=sharon%20hurley%20hall%20(she%2Fher)&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=037cf45f-368e-471c-ae0d-6ce59d68386b&sid=O!O&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Sharon Hurley Hall,Female,2024-01-27,"What does equality mean to you? What about equity?At Mission Equality CIC, we believe that equality means everyone gets their needs met in the way that works best for them and allows them to thrive. That doesn’t mean what’s needed is the same for everyone. (Also, having needs isn’t pathologised - we ALL have needs.)And equity? That’s what we do to level the playing field till true equality exists. Equity steps are necessary now. When true equality exists, we won’t need them - and won’t that be something?!I personally love the vision of a time when people who are currently deliberately disadvantaged aren’t playing catch-up, don’t you? Getting there will take strong, committed leadership which operates from a different paradigm. It’s something we’re doing - and learning from - in our company. If you aspire to be that kind of leader, I’d love to talk to you about how we’re already working to realise that vision, and how we’d like to help others do it too.
