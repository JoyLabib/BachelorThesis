Alexis Scott,Female,2024-01-26,"Not every disability or diversity qualification is visible.My daughter has Tourette‚Äôs Syndrome.  99% of those she meets have no idea, and will never know.  But she has it.  We‚Äôve got the doctor diagnosis to prove it.For those who aren‚Äôt familiar, Tourette‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt mean that she‚Äôs yelling obscenities.  She‚Äôs got physical and vocal tics that flare up, usually when she‚Äôs very tired or stressed.I‚Äôm not sure if her employer even knows about this‚Ä¶Which just goes to show: you do not always know if someone has a disability.Some people feel comfortable sharing openly, others are very private.But leading with compassion is 100% a good idea if you see someone struggling.  Whether it be completing something, focusing, communicating, etc, there could be an underlying issue you know nothing about.And frankly it‚Äôs totally up to the person on whether or not they want to share.Just my thought of the day after a specific convo yesterday with someone who is neurodivergent and I would have had absolutely had no idea if they hadn‚Äôt felt comfy sharing.(And for those who are surprised I‚Äôd share this info about my kid: she‚Äôs very secure and has no problem talking about her Tourette‚Äôs)#disability #leadership #neurodiversity #bekind #workingmom",1635,166,24,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Alexis Scott,Female,2024-02-26,"üõëTo anyone who has been laid off - your post about looking for new work doesn't need to thank the organization who tossed you aside.  The last company I worked for just did yet ANOTHER round of layoffs this past week.They raised $30 million just a little over two years go.I am not sure what the financial expertise of leadership is comprised of, but they went on a hiring (and spending) frenzy in late 2022 and into early 2023, to do multiple rounds of layoffs in the last 6 months.These layoffs are all too common, and they are beyond frustrating given the state of the market as a wholeWhile I understand that organizations must make ""tough"" business decisions, situations like this make me flat out angry.I am angry for every single person who joined that organization and was promised the moon and instead got a taste of leadership with no compass, terrible company culture, and now unemployment.The job hunt won't be easy, it most likely won't be quick, and it will require some extroardinary effort on the part of those trying to land a new role.‚≠êÔ∏è Make sure you DO share what your skills are, what your expertise is comprised of, and what exactly you want to do next. ‚≠êÔ∏èThere are people reading these posts who WANT to help so make sure you‚Äôre clear on how they can.I'll get off of my soapbox here but this is just a dang shame.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-01-26,"After owning his own business for over 20 years, my husband is now officially an ‚Äúemployee‚Äù.He‚Äôd built a luxury home automation business in Silicon Valley with no website, just word of mouth referrals, and eventually so much business that he had to turn clients down.He was at capacity.  Mentally and physically.When we moved to Idaho, we started out with him spending 75% of his time still in CA.  Then it gradually went to 50/50. Then it went to 25% in CA‚Ä¶ and as you can imagine, it‚Äôs hard to run a service business when you aren‚Äôt physically present for pop up issues.In 2022, he decided that he‚Äôd had enough. He wanted to be with his family 100% of the time.  So he closed up shop and came home.Being in a demanding industry with elite clients took a toll on him. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon for him to be receiving calls and texts from about 4am -12am each day. Yes, he was making excellent income, but he was exhausted. It took him almost 2 years to ‚Äúheal‚Äù.  And last month he made the decision NOT to start a new company - despite the fact that he‚Äôs been an entrepreneur his entire life.He joined a local home automation company to lead their sales function.  And he is crushing it!He loves it because it‚Äôs just a small fraction of running his own business and the owner of the company loves it because not only did he need 0 training, but he‚Äôs an intrapreneur - my husband has the drive and business acumen of an owner.Anyway - this got long, but I‚Äôm really really proud of him.For recognizing the fact that he‚Äôs not willing to do all be all, and for taking a step back to help and teach someone he works for everything he knows about the industry.And of course, we love a paycheck every two weeks. üòÖüôèüèºHappy Friday!

Our first discovery calls... looking back... let's just say there were some very open ended convos in that first week! üßê Legal counsel - I tell ya, having a lawyer to ask contract questions has been an absolute godsend.  We found one who is patient and responsive and I am so grateful!üßê Lean into what makes you you (or in our case us-us) - when we started we were thinking that we'd niche down into B2B and within a week we knew B2B, B2C - those definitions were not important to us at all.  It was the people we were serving who mattered.üßê Flexibility is everything.  So much has changed in the last 30 days, we are adapting quickly and doing more of the stuff that a) works and b) feels good.With that said, the biggest and most important adaptation for us has been our target customer for Verbatim.  After about 5 or so calls with potential customers I noticed a theme.  It was not company size, it wasn't male or female, it wasn't B2B or B2C, it wasn't a certain industry.  It was founders of MISSION DRIVEN companies - companies that are looking to make an impact on the world beyond just making money.And that resonated so loudly with the both of us - to know that our skillset could be the catalyst to amplify this impact through marketing.  We both agreed that our ideal customers are brands looking to make a difference - and with this clarity, we have now completely revamped our messaging to reflect that.As two women of color, we are more confident than ever that our strength lies in what makes us DIFFERENT.  And that our unique life experiences and diversity of thought allows us to provide next level inclusive marketing.So - cheers to month 1! ü•Ç. To everyone who has supported us, cheered us on, offered advice or guidance - we see you, and we appreciate you.Brianna Doe and I are truly just getting started.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-09-26,I‚Äôm a new advocate of ‚Äúfor now‚Äù choices because I firmly believe that we hold the keys to our own survival.If you‚Äôve been looking for a job for many months and are worried about your finances: make a ‚Äúfor now‚Äù problem solving choice.Work part time to pay some bills.Side hustle Door Dash.Volunteer for gigs locally and get paid doing things others are willing to pay for.

I was employed full time and had hourly coaching slots open in the early morning and evening.My tech stack was a carrd website and calendly.

Rip off the bandaid reality - I didn‚Äôt think I was worthy.But, here‚Äôs what changed.My mindset.Yup that‚Äôs it.  I realized that just because there are others who offer the same services that I do doesn‚Äôt mean that people won‚Äôt want to work with me.I realized that there are people who see value in the work that I do and are drawn to my experience and expertise.I realized that while no, I‚Äôm not for everyone, I am for someone and that I am gonna do my best to make sure that the ‚Äúsomeones‚Äù can find me.And last but very not least I realized that my biggest regret would be never trying.So, if there‚Äôs something you‚Äôre dreaming of, I‚Äôd highly encourage you to turn your dreams into reality.Take responsible action.

And all of the cheesy sayings about the biggest job you'll ever have is being a parent - all true.Being a parent isn't a job that you take and ""see how it goes""... it turns you into a ""lifer"" on day 1.Best to know what you are getting into... Except that is impossible until you've done it. Go figure!Parenting has taught me about patience, determination, coaching, emotional intelligence, teaching, mindset, and unconditional love.And while I don't quite feel old enough to be the mom of a 16 year old, I actually enjoy my kids growing older.So, today I am celebrating my smart, kind, caring, compassionate, determined, and beautiful daughter.

Instead I focus on what I want to share.When I write here on LinkedIn, I have what we call in sales an ""ICP"" or an ""Ideal Customer Profile"".  Aka: Who do I want to read what I have written and identify with or enjoy what I am about to say?The volume of readers does not cross my mind unless the post dies a sad death and I am sad.

I am open, but I am not reckless.There is a fine line between the two, and if you are a job seeker, I would encourage you to err on the side of caution.Remember: as a job seeker, you are marketing yourself to potential employers.Is something you want to share:- polarizing- negative- defamatory- potentially offensive- TMI If the answer is yes to any of these: DO NOT POST IT.And I know some might say: I am who I am, they can take it or leave it...Having that stance is fine, but it's not going to help you get hired.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-11-26,"‚úÖ TLDR : 40 is not too old to get a degree, change a career, or make more money.  And ""tech money"" is pretty nuts compared to the rest of the economy. Keep reading to find out WHY I am talking about this!I am part of many online communities - one of which is specifically for women in technology. As I was drinking my coffee this morning, I came across a post in the community from a woman who stated that she is 40 years old and makes $93k a year in tech CS.   She was asking if, because she does not have a college degree, she has peaked in her earning capability.  And if because she is 40, it is too late to go back to school?There is a lot to unpack here but let me start with the answer that NO:  It is never too late for you to pursue your education or passions or career opportunities.The time will pass anyway - it's what you do with it that matters.(Also as a 40 year old woman who started 2 businesses this year... I am just getting started! ü•Ç üöÄüî•)Second, I know for a fact that there are MANY people in this country, and in this world, who would be thrilled to make $93k a year.I am of the mindset that ""tech money"" or salaries, skew perspective on what normal income looks like for the rest of the industries.  And in general, if you already have years of practical experience, a degree doesn't matter quite as much.So, while I completely understand her desire to earn more, $93k isn't a ""low"" salary for customer success.  Do some CS people get paid more? Sure. Do some get paid less? Also yes.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-11-26,"Sharing your budget doesn‚Äôt mean a salesperson will take advantage of you.I share this because I can‚Äôt tell you how many conversations start with someone ‚Äúnot knowing‚Äù their budget.We all have a general idea internally - it‚Äôs totally ok to not have it down to the penny.But here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a good idea to share at least a range with a salesperson:1. Disqualification.  Seems counterintuitive but if your budget is completely off what a product or service costs, save your time and their time and agree that now is not THE time to work together.2. Flexibility.  Maybe there‚Äôs some wiggle room for the salesperson if they know what your budget is and it‚Äôs close to their pricing.3. Customization.  At Verbatim we custombuild packages for our clients based on their needs. If you give us a range we will build three tiers for you:  lowest end of the range, mid range, top of range and include everything we can in each to maximize your budget!So, communication is key.

Is it in line with the rate being offered?‚úÖ Is it a one time post? Or a bundle?The answers to these questions should help you navigate through whether or not you want to work with the brand... And keep in mind: the very best deals are WIN-WIN.  You get paid what you want, and the brand gets the exposure/wins that they want from your audience.If the results are one sided, chances are it'll be a one and done.And if you are reading this with 10 or more followers and want to join the Creator program... head on over to the Influence by Verbatim website!#influencermarketing #influencers #creatoreconomy #creators #growth",214,36,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

So that's technically working (but super fun - I can't wait to meet her!!)!We also have a few proposals to send out this week which will require some focused work time... the list goes on.With all of this said, I am the happiest that I have been in over a year.   I get to build a business with someone I adore, work with inspiring clients, and have the freedom to work from anywhere my heart desires.There is a whole lot to be said for controlling your own destiny.

Going on Dictionary and Thesaurus sites.Then one afternoon we hopped on a call and she had the word Verb on the spreadsheet.... and Verbatim just popped into my brain!  BOOM!She loved it.  I loved it.  The word is powerful.  It's rooted in clarity (one of our company values).  And it speaks to our love of content and language.So - I took this screenshot very purposefully.  I want to be able to continue to look back on Day 1 and remind myself just how far we have come.In a month. In a year.  In yearS.Every great company starts with an idea.

The timing just is not right.And if we aren't meant to be in business together now, it doesn't mean we aren't ever.Just another example of the rollercoaster of entrepreneurship.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-02-26,"Yesterday was Rare Disease Day‚Ä¶ it is rare itself, only recognized once every 4 years on Leap Year.1 in 7 people are affected by a rare disease. It is estimated that Pathological IKH affects about 1 in 1/2 million.A dear friend of mine has a daughter who has pathological idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia.  This means for no reason that they can find, she gets low blood sugar and her body goes into starvation mode when she doesn't get enough carbohydrates.  It stated with another rare disease called hyperinsulinism that affects about 80 children born in the US per year.  The journey for them has been excruciating.  To keep Ella alive, it takes someone following her 24/7 to ensure the gtube is properly working.  Kids with her symptoms have died in the past due to failed pumps.  And during the day they must do a check on the tube line every 20-60 minutes. Ella is a pretty happy kid despite a lot of pain and trauma from all her pokes and medical interventions.  She loves to dance and loves her little sister.Rare diseases are of little interest to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries because due to the low numbers of people, it doesn't make good business sense.  That is why on World Rare Disease Day (or any day, frankly) it is important to remember and advocate for all the kids on this planet who live in the shadows due to illness, hoping one day to find a cure to just make them normal, NOT rare or unique.Also adding Ella‚Äôs mom sent a really interesting clip of her friend and advocate speaking about Rare Disease Day at EU Parliament - will share the link in the comments.Praying for all of the kiddos and parents and even adults bravely fighting rare diseases‚Ä¶ praying they get some answers and some relief.üôèüèº#medical #parenting #awareness #love #miracles",117,13,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

And for those of you who know me, know that Teal is my number 1 recommended AI resume tool.¬† If you decide on option B, here‚Äôs the news: You can still leverage AI and be in control, AND Teal does so much of the heavy lifting for you!With their Resume Builder, you can pull in the job description and select the requirements that you satisfy and THEN it will generate your bullet points for you based on what you check off (this is called Matching Mode).

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-03-26,"Yesterday I had a zoom call with someone in Karkiev, Ukraine, and I asked him what I could do to help.The very first thing he said was: talk about the war.  The second: support Ukrainian owned businesses.So here we are.I asked about his daily life (he is on the side of Ukraine near Russia, so close to the front lines) and he said that it‚Äôs a hard place to sleep.  The night before Russian drones had been circling and then he could hear the Ukrainian forces trying to shoot them down.The week prior, there was a complete blackout. No power or internet for the region.And of course, so many of his friends are on the actual front lines, fighting.Now keep in mind, this was a business networking call.  And we‚Äôd connected initially in a bigger networking group event.I absolutely cannot imagine being able to focus on work while living through a war, let alone want to ‚Äúhop on a zoom‚Äù to network.But that‚Äôs what the people of Ukraine are living - and have been living for two years,With no end in sight.Whose reality is much different than ours.And the other countries at war as well - they too need support‚Ä¶ our world is suffering.So, as we think about our TGIFs, our happy hours, and the easy weekend ahead, let‚Äôs pause and also think about those who are living through war right now and if possible, make a donation to a humanitarian organization or support a business that would be so very grateful.#ukraine #support #partnerships #networking #connections",67,20,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-08-26,"Had my third call with a client today and he had a lot of questions surrounding clarity in his next move.Additionally I was on a LinkedIn live today with Amy Looper and the topic of clarity came up also.So here‚Äôs a post about my thoughts on clarity (and it‚Äôs been a hurdle that I‚Äôve overcome).First let me say that when you become ‚Äúclear‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a forever vision.  It‚Äôs how you feel at your current place in life.And if you‚Äôre struggling to find clarity I personally think the best place to start is with your ‚Äúhell nos‚Äù.   You know the things you absolutely will not do a lot better than what you want to do.Once you‚Äôve got that down, start a list of maybes.And explore! Learn as much as you can about each option - weed through.  Add some to your ‚Äúno‚Äù pile and keep some alive.Rinse and repeat until you form a vision of what you want.Is this scientific? No.  Not a lot is with our souls.But you‚Äôve gotta start somewhere.

And they also leverage smart partnerships!!!I recently discovered Anchor for contracts/payments and have been loving it... but I just use it for that.  Very simple.But Anchor is SMART.   They have a partnership with Zapier - and not only are they leveraging that partnership, they are also finding ways for their customers to  get even stickier - through integrations!The more someone can automate and streamline their business with Zapier zaps, and make using Anchor a no brainer.... the more likely Anchor is to retain them as a customer!This is NOT a paid post - I just am a happy customer and got this email and was impressed. #partnerships and #marketing teams both get a 10/10 on this email campaign!We love teamwork AND really awesome solutions that actually work and help businesses succeed.Have you seen any standout co-selling or co-marketing partnerships hit your inbox lately??
