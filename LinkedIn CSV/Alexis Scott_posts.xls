Alexis Scott,Female,2024-01-26,"Not every disability or diversity qualification is visible.My daughter has Tourette’s Syndrome.  99% of those she meets have no idea, and will never know.  But she has it.  We’ve got the doctor diagnosis to prove it.For those who aren’t familiar, Tourette’s doesn’t mean that she’s yelling obscenities.  She’s got physical and vocal tics that flare up, usually when she’s very tired or stressed.I’m not sure if her employer even knows about this…Which just goes to show: you do not always know if someone has a disability.Some people feel comfortable sharing openly, others are very private.But leading with compassion is 100% a good idea if you see someone struggling.  Whether it be completing something, focusing, communicating, etc, there could be an underlying issue you know nothing about.And frankly it’s totally up to the person on whether or not they want to share.Just my thought of the day after a specific convo yesterday with someone who is neurodivergent and I would have had absolutely had no idea if they hadn’t felt comfy sharing.(And for those who are surprised I’d share this info about my kid: she’s very secure and has no problem talking about her Tourette’s)#disability #leadership #neurodiversity #bekind #workingmom",1635,166,24,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Alexis Scott,Female,2024-02-26,"🛑To anyone who has been laid off - your post about looking for new work doesn't need to thank the organization who tossed you aside.  The last company I worked for just did yet ANOTHER round of layoffs this past week.They raised $30 million just a little over two years go.I am not sure what the financial expertise of leadership is comprised of, but they went on a hiring (and spending) frenzy in late 2022 and into early 2023, to do multiple rounds of layoffs in the last 6 months.These layoffs are all too common, and they are beyond frustrating given the state of the market as a wholeWhile I understand that organizations must make ""tough"" business decisions, situations like this make me flat out angry.I am angry for every single person who joined that organization and was promised the moon and instead got a taste of leadership with no compass, terrible company culture, and now unemployment.The job hunt won't be easy, it most likely won't be quick, and it will require some extroardinary effort on the part of those trying to land a new role.⭐️ Make sure you DO share what your skills are, what your expertise is comprised of, and what exactly you want to do next. ⭐️There are people reading these posts who WANT to help so make sure you’re clear on how they can.I'll get off of my soapbox here but this is just a dang shame.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-01-26,"After owning his own business for over 20 years, my husband is now officially an “employee”.He’d built a luxury home automation business in Silicon Valley with no website, just word of mouth referrals, and eventually so much business that he had to turn clients down.He was at capacity.  Mentally and physically.When we moved to Idaho, we started out with him spending 75% of his time still in CA.  Then it gradually went to 50/50. Then it went to 25% in CA… and as you can imagine, it’s hard to run a service business when you aren’t physically present for pop up issues.In 2022, he decided that he’d had enough. He wanted to be with his family 100% of the time.  So he closed up shop and came home.Being in a demanding industry with elite clients took a toll on him. It wasn’t uncommon for him to be receiving calls and texts from about 4am -12am each day. Yes, he was making excellent income, but he was exhausted. It took him almost 2 years to “heal”.  And last month he made the decision NOT to start a new company - despite the fact that he’s been an entrepreneur his entire life.He joined a local home automation company to lead their sales function.  And he is crushing it!He loves it because it’s just a small fraction of running his own business and the owner of the company loves it because not only did he need 0 training, but he’s an intrapreneur - my husband has the drive and business acumen of an owner.Anyway - this got long, but I’m really really proud of him.For recognizing the fact that he’s not willing to do all be all, and for taking a step back to help and teach someone he works for everything he knows about the industry.And of course, we love a paycheck every two weeks. 😅🙏🏼Happy Friday! And to all the entrepreneurs turned employees - proud of you for making the decision you needed to at that time.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-12-26,"This is my cousin, Cara.  Cara is a stay at home mom to 5 kids.And yet I come to her with career discussions often.Because:A) before kids, she had a busy career in higher education.B) she’s running her own business - called life.  Balancing budgets, schedules, transport, quarterly planning, leadership, organizational change …. It’s a family of 7 and someone has to be the CEO!When her kiddos are all in school, she plans to re-enter the workforce, and I often wonder what her experience getting hired will be like.🌈 Will companies discount her for such a large gap?🌈 Will she start a totally new career?🌈 Will she experience discrimination if/when people find out she is a mom of 5?🌈 Will she feel empowered being back in the workforce? Or overwhelmed?And before people come with “it’s a luxury to be able to stay home…” - yes and also no. Luxury - not.  Privilege to have the option? Yes.She works harder than any person with a day job I’ve ever met.  Her job is 24/7 on call with no time for PTO or calling out sick.Anyway - these are my thoughts after watching her plan, host, entertain, deal with sick kids, and overall show up like a boss this Christmas.Stay at home parents are MVPs too! ❤️#parenting #family #career #sales #marketing",1214,109,8,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-10-26,"I recently lost 50 lbs.  I’m not sharing this for pats on the back… I’ve lost 120lbs from my very heaviest in 2012, and gained and lost and gained and lost the same 40-50 a handful of times since.But what’s interesting to me is the commentary around people’s exterior shell.That somehow I’m either a) healthier or b) happier.FTR I am happier… but what if I’d lost all of the weight due to sorrow?Or what if I was ill and therefore losing weight?But friends, family, and acquaintances have all been very kind and positive and even asked “what is your secret??? you look amazing!”.Skinny privilege is real folks.  As someone who has lived life at 245lbs and at 125lbs - people are a whole lot nicer to me when I’m small.I share this after a conversation yesterday about our body.Our body is simply a vessel by which we experience life.  It changes in appearance and we get to decide if we prefer a smaller or larger shell… and live a life that supports what we feel happiest in.As someone who has struggled with weight her entire adult life, I know that is easier said than done.So, I just take it a day at a time.  And I try to make the choices that put me into the body I want.I know this isn’t a “LinkedIn” post but it’s something that is on my mind and I know that there are many other people who struggle with weight and body positivity.You are not alone.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-10-26,"Officially 1 month in business as the co-founder of Verbatim - it's been a wild ride. Here are some wins...and some learnings.Wins:🚀 Signed multiple clients at Verbatim🚀  Signed multiple brand partnerships for Influence by Verbatim🚀 Revamped our website (more on this below)🚀 Created frameworks, policies, and procedures 🚀 Assigned ourselves job titles (that's Ms. CEO, thank you!)And then some learnings that were very quickly apparent to us:🧐 A defined sales process is essential.  Our first discovery calls... looking back... let's just say there were some very open ended convos in that first week! 🧐 Legal counsel - I tell ya, having a lawyer to ask contract questions has been an absolute godsend.  We found one who is patient and responsive and I am so grateful!🧐 Lean into what makes you you (or in our case us-us) - when we started we were thinking that we'd niche down into B2B and within a week we knew B2B, B2C - those definitions were not important to us at all.  It was the people we were serving who mattered.🧐 Flexibility is everything.  So much has changed in the last 30 days, we are adapting quickly and doing more of the stuff that a) works and b) feels good.With that said, the biggest and most important adaptation for us has been our target customer for Verbatim.  After about 5 or so calls with potential customers I noticed a theme.  It was not company size, it wasn't male or female, it wasn't B2B or B2C, it wasn't a certain industry.  It was founders of MISSION DRIVEN companies - companies that are looking to make an impact on the world beyond just making money.And that resonated so loudly with the both of us - to know that our skillset could be the catalyst to amplify this impact through marketing.  We both agreed that our ideal customers are brands looking to make a difference - and with this clarity, we have now completely revamped our messaging to reflect that.As two women of color, we are more confident than ever that our strength lies in what makes us DIFFERENT.  And that our unique life experiences and diversity of thought allows us to provide next level inclusive marketing.So - cheers to month 1! 🥂. To everyone who has supported us, cheered us on, offered advice or guidance - we see you, and we appreciate you.Brianna Doe and I are truly just getting started.   And PLEASE NOTE: We WILL be on a magazine cover one day.  I've said it from day 1.  It will happen (and if you are a media or PR person who wants to highlight a women of color owned business - our DMs are open!).  Manifesting this and our continued success.HAPPY MONTH ONE friends!xoxo,Alexis Rivera ScottCEO, Verbatim",915,151,4,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Alexis Scott,Female,2023-09-26,I’m a new advocate of “for now” choices because I firmly believe that we hold the keys to our own survival.If you’ve been looking for a job for many months and are worried about your finances: make a “for now” problem solving choice.Work part time to pay some bills.Side hustle Door Dash.Volunteer for gigs locally and get paid doing things others are willing to pay for.  You’d be amazed at the odd jobs people are looking to have completed.All of these can be done while you continue to look for full time employment. All of these can be stopped if you want to once you land your full time job.But the thing about “for now” choices is they bridge a gap.  They get us safely to a more permanent solution.There’s absolutely no shame in doing what you need to do to keep a roof over your head or food in your belly.Do what you gotta do and don’t think twice about it.Your next career role is out there - we just unfortunately don’t control timeline.#gethired #sidehustles #solutions #jobseekers #justdoit,817,107,5,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Alexis Scott,Female,2023-12-26,"If you’re ending this year feeling defeated or stressed: You are not alone.2023 was one of the hardest years for most people that I know and love - self included.But, with 2024, we start a new.

Remember that every door that closed this year placed us exactly where we need to be for a new one to open.Personally and professionally.The amazing thing about living life is that as long as we are breathing, the story is not over.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-01-26,"Every day I think about how I can purposefully and intentionally “make noise” here on LinkedIn.🎁 Whether it be motivating others.🎁 Driving leads for my businesses.🎁 Connecting with new people.🎁 Sharing the good news about a brand I’m partnered with.🎁 or even Being part of a larger community discussion…I show up.  And I make noise.  I want to be seen, heard, and understood - a basic part of human nature really. So when I talk to someone and they say: “I open up LinkedIn and I always see your face!” Yes. That means I’m doing a good job.😁 The algorithm is showing you my content and wants you to “listen” to what I have to say!

I can tell that you were working really hard to sound professional and you did…But I know the hiring manager well, and she’s gonna want to hear the real you.So when you meet with her, take a deep breath, and just be yourself.”Did I penalize her for trying her best but sounding a little stiff?

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-02-26,"💡Gen Z truly views career and work differently than other generations.I was shocked yesterday listening to a young man, about 18, tell his dad that he wanted to start an Amazon drop shipping business. 💪🎉His dad told him to avoid these “get rich quick” schemes and to think of other options.

I keep lists in my head.⭐️ Operations: I have ideas and vision.  She executes them makes them a reality.⭐️ Interests: I am more interested in big picture. She loves the details.⭐️ Process: She can structure a detailed process and/or workflow for anything.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-07-26,"Fun fact about me: when I started college, I was an Agricultural Business major.  Shocker!!!Me: a girl born and raised in San Francisco. Not the burbs.  City proper.  Agriculture = a plant in the kitchen.Going to college for agricultural business?!It was actually a “hack” to get into Cal Poly SLO at the time.Everyone said: don’t apply to be a business major, go in Ag Business, and then you can transfer to Business later.That plan worked. And guess what happened?I freaking LOVED it!  There’s nothing more relatable and interesting than the economics behind the food we buy and eat every day.So my plan was to get into viticulture (hence this amazing image 😆🍷🍇).  The wine boom was happening in central California and I was ready!Aaaaand then the plan got derailed and long story short:  I ended up with a sociology degree from SFSU and a career in sales.Oopsies 😬🤣Sometimes our best laid plans aren’t quite the way things work out.  In life and in business.But adaptation and flexibility are what take us from failure to a different version of success.This hasn’t changed for me in 20 years.  Still learning, still adapting, still recognizing that even the best laid plans need improvisation sometimes.Is what you set out to do in your career what you are doing now?

I hadn’t advertised this, I had never ghostwritten, but I took the call because this person seemed nice enough and wrote a really thoughtful request to discuss.They’d seen my posts and liked the energy I put out, and wanted to know if I could help them build their personal brand.Well, within about a week, I had my first executive ghostwriting client.Was I ready?

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-12-26,"Last January I found a lump in my breast.  Promptly scheduled a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound.  Out of pocket cost was around $700 WITH an ""upgraded"" health insurance selection from my employer.This year, I diligently scheduled an annual follow up.On the call, the appointment setter asked me if I had any issues that needed to be addressed.  To which I mentioned the reason for scheduling, and I asked if that follow up needed to be outside of the 1 year mark for insurance to pay for it.What I was told was:Preventative mammograms (aka no issues present) are completely free every 366 days.Diagnostic mammograms are not.  Regardless of the time frame.So basically if you have an issue, you've got to pay to find out what is wrong with you.But if you need the same medical service and don't ""think"" anything is wrong, it is free of charge.IT IS THE SAME SERVICE!!!

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-10-26,"So - Verbatim has been a lesson for me in the idea of “building to scale”.Brianna and I have been very thoughtful about our vision and how to build an infrastructure to support growth of the business.🚀We have a tech stack.  🚀We have integrations working.🚀We have a lawyer.  🚀We wrote out job descriptions. 🚀We have an absolutely gorgeous website thanks to her talents in web design.It’s like a mini startup company.And the reason this is so important and/or significant to me is because when I look at building The Fairy Job Mom - it was none of those when I got started.When I started The Fairy Job Mom it was started as a side hustle.  I was employed full time and had hourly coaching slots open in the early morning and evening.My tech stack was a carrd website and calendly.  And adding in Mailchimp was a big deal for me!And for many people, that works and they’re doing fine.  But are they able to grow and scale?

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-11-26,"Top 4 reasons someone isn’t replying to your LinkedIn DM:1. It isn’t personalized/too generic/not applicable.(That might be 3 but bucketing them together)2.

It just flat out got buried in the sea of messages because the LinkedIn inbox has zero organization… never read/saw it.4. They don’t want to.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-09-26,"Yesterday someone asked how to overcome the imposter syndrome of believing that people won’t find value in what you have to offer.This right here is actually what prevented me from starting my own business for years.  YEARS.I was worried that the market was too saturated and that no one would want to hire me.Bare my soul. Lift the mask. Rip off the bandaid reality - I didn’t think I was worthy.But, here’s what changed.My mindset.Yup that’s it.  I realized that just because there are others who offer the same services that I do doesn’t mean that people won’t want to work with me.I realized that there are people who see value in the work that I do and are drawn to my experience and expertise.I realized that while no, I’m not for everyone, I am for someone and that I am gonna do my best to make sure that the “someones” can find me.And last but very not least I realized that my biggest regret would be never trying.So, if there’s something you’re dreaming of, I’d highly encourage you to turn your dreams into reality.Take responsible action.  Make sh-t happen.  Go after what you want.It’s worth it.  The ups the downs and in between are all worth it.If anything to prove to yourself that you’re capable. ❤️If you’re reading this thinking damn, she’s right….This post was meant to reach you today.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-11-26,"The best way to get hired is from a warm intro—hands down. But you STILL need a resume!Imagine this: Someone you know makes an intro and graciously shares how amazing you are… and then the person on the other end says the magical words: “Great! Please send over your resume!”You tell them they’ll have it shortly, but internally are FREAKING OUT because you haven’t updated your resume in forever and haven’t even looked at it this year…BIG MISTAKE!  And I know this from experience.It is so important to continue to update your resume whether or not you are actively job-seeking.  And this very real example is exactly why!Even if you aren’t an active job seeker, best practice is: 1. ALWAYS take the conversation.  Even if it isn’t the job for you, it is an introduction and a new connection for the future.2. Send over a resume that you are proud of. This document is a reflection of your work experience and should be polished—even if being sent to a warm recruiter lead.If you haven’t updated your resume, I HIGHLY recommend checking out Teal.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-04-21,LinkedIn is not Facebook. Which is why we are all here… It’s uniquely a mix of business meets personal and that’s why it works.Here’s the news:  YES a large component of your content should (in my opinion) be centered around your professional expertise. But unless you’re a company founder whose goal on LinkedIn is 100% to drive leads and thinks the only way to do this is through constant educational posts…You also have space to be human and talk about other interesting things.→ Your lessons & learnings→ Your interests→ Your industry & events And for the really wild folks…→ Your family/friends experiences Beating the drum here… people connect with people.And guess what: → People hire people→ People connect with people→ People are influenced by people This is SOCIAL media.  If people wanted to read a “how to guide” they would.  Yet here they are.  Looking for PEOPLE to learn from and connect with.I myself have seen and experienced the massive benefit of being my 100% true self on here and I know there are other creators who also share personal stories alongside their professional experiences very effectively.Business isn’t always transactional.  It can be personal.TLDR: post about what you find interesting.  Your tribe will find you. ***And if one of your goals is for customers or recruiters to find you on here: talk a lot about your expertise and the work that you do.

There are no words to express how grateful I am for the people in my life who have helped me on this entrepreneurial journey.  I truly don’t know if I would even be in business without their help.🧚🏼 Social proof is mandatory.I’m finally feeling some traction and recognition because my clients are happy and achieving… and writing reviews and recommendations to share the news!🧚🏼 Be prepared to pivotJust like in “keep going”, the ability to see what’s working, try new ideas, and be flexible is so so so so so important!!!🧚🏼 You’ve gotta learn how to run a business from head to toe very quickly.I knew sales and I knew content marketing - I didn’t know finance, legal, demand gen, web design, etc etc etc.  But let me tell ya, I’ve been on a crash course for all of the above!The past 6 months have been some of the most stressful yet happiest all combined - and I know for a fact the next 6 are going to be very exciting.Big plans in the coming months…And a big thank you to my LinkedIn community for the continuous support!#sales #marketing #founders #entrepeneurship #recruiting",391,44,4,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Alexis Scott,Female,2023-10-26,"🔥Text I just got from a former boss:  Before you post on LinkedIn does it ever cross your mind that you are about to hit send to a stadium of people?Me: No it does not. And that is the truth.  I don't think about how many people will be reading.  Instead I focus on what I want to share.When I write here on LinkedIn, I have what we call in sales an ""ICP"" or an ""Ideal Customer Profile"".  Aka: Who do I want to read what I have written and identify with or enjoy what I am about to say?The volume of readers does not cross my mind unless the post dies a sad death and I am sad.  Because this famous ""algorithm"" does us all dirty every now and again.But I share this for folks who are hesitant to start posting: Pretend like you are writing for one person.  What does this person need to or want to know?  Tell them!As you start to gain traction in your writing and confidence in your knowledge it DOES get easier.  And you DO have something to share, I promise.We all bring a unique set of expertise and experiences to this platorm, and the willingness to share is what keeps things interesting.And if you need help with branding...

It’s worth the time, and it’s (usually) worth the cost, if you can spend time amongst your peers and potential customers.People buy from people - so events are an opportunity to be the awesome human you are and just build great connections.I’m still reflecting on last week and the people who I met while at the B2BMX conference.When I got home my husband asked me: did you get any new business???No.  I didn’t.But I certainly made some meaningful connections.Some were familiar faces, but others were brand new …Here’s the thing: when you sit and talk to someone over dinner, or have a great conversation that stretches because it’s so interesting…That is a valuable connection.  A memorable connection.  And a connection that makes your attendance worthwhile.And for that purpose I’d call it a massive success.Will these connections lead to deals down the road?Quite possibly.

Their booking link is meant for sales calls, not for you to book time on their calendar to ask for employment.3. To ask them on a date.Yes, creativity is great, but mixing business with romance is NOT.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-09-26,"One HUGE content mistake I see amongst founders here on LinkedIn is using the platform simply as an advertising space.Look at my product.Look at my company.Look at my press release.Look at my event.And while yes, LinkedIn is absolutely the right channel to share all of this news, no one really cares if they don’t know YOU.Here’s what I mean:Founder A shares content about how she got to where she is today.She talks about building her company.  She talks about her perspectives on hiring.She talks about the challenges she’s faced.She talks about balancing life and work.She talks about her inherent beliefs.Founder B posts solely about product, company, events, and shares marketing created content.Who do you connect with more?Who do you want to support more?Who do you root for more?Who comes to mind first?🔥 The answer is Founder A.  🔥So if you’re thinking about what to write here on LinkedIn, don’t be afraid to share a peek at who YOU are.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-02-26,"When you hire someone to join your company, you are essentially saying “I trust you to do the job”. Unfortunately, this hasn’t always been the case in my experience.A few years ago, I was reprimanded for having a drink in my hand at the start of a company sponsored happy hour.“You’re here to work, not to drink.” - my bossI’d shown up early to help set up the event and work - an event with the title bearing the word Cocktails. My job was to mix and mingle and network and build connections… you now, sales/marketing/ambassador type work.The 95% male sales team was present - all with drinks in their hands and no reprimands for them drinking “on the job”I was flabbergasted.  And quite frankly offended.I’ve never in my entire career had an incident where I was unable to control myself around alcohol.And I’ve been in sales/events/marketing for over a decade - 99% of people are holding a drink, alcoholic or otherwise.Why was I being singled out???I’ll never know the answer, but I can tell you that when you hire an adult to join your company it is (or should be) a sign that you trust them to represent the company in a way that you are proud of.At work, and at any events for your company.Respect is a two way street - give your employees the opportunity to show up and do the right thing.  9.9 x out of 10, I’d bet there’s no need for intervention.So here’s me today.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-02-26,"🎯 If you are looking for a job in corporate America, you have to play by corporate America's rules.

I am open, but I am not reckless.There is a fine line between the two, and if you are a job seeker, I would encourage you to err on the side of caution.Remember: as a job seeker, you are marketing yourself to potential employers.Is something you want to share:- polarizing- negative- defamatory- potentially offensive- TMI If the answer is yes to any of these: DO NOT POST IT.And I know some might say: I am who I am, they can take it or leave it...Having that stance is fine, but it's not going to help you get hired.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-01-26,"Leaving entrepreneurship to join a company is not failure.The skills and business acumen you bring to the table after entrepreneurship are so valuable - be proud for learning, growing, and making a choice that’s right for you.I am part of a women’s marketing group and someone was asking if hiring managers would see her as a failure for closing her agency to re-enter the corporate world.In my opinion, no.  Not a failure.  It’s a choice.Entrepreneurship is not for everyone.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-02-26,"💡What was once considered “blue collar” now means stability, income, and growth opportunities.If you’re a woman and you’re looking for what’s next: consider a trade.Less than 10% of workers in the trades are female. 😮🫣🫢I’m sure there are 288339 reasons why but what I think is the call out here is: opportunity.MASSIVE opportunity.Seriously.  It is never too late to reskill and enter an industry that will NEVER go out of business.A woman recently made a video talking about this and how she gets multiple job offers a week here on LinkedIn because she’s a female, experienced (4 years) electrician.And the beauty of a skilled trade: once you’ve gained the experience, you can decide if you want to start your own company for that specific trade.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-10-26,"🚩AI tools for LinkedIn comments are not a good choice. 🚩I’ve thought for like 30 minutes on how to phrase the first line of this post as I’m sure there are folks who believe differently.But let me explain with observations:1. AI comments generally just recap what was said in the post.Me: yeah, I just said that…..2. AI comments have no personality.  I have zero sense of energy about who the person is. Me: that was boring….3. AI comments are generally the same structure with sentences broken up with white space separating each “point”.Me: this person is clearly using AI- look at it…If I can tell you’re using AI my interpretation is that you’re either a) gaming the system or b) having a VA do your LinkedIn.🤔Neither one makes me want to engage or cultivate a relationship.🤔Neither one makes me feel seen heard or understood.🤔And neither one piques my interest in who you are and what you do.AI has incredible capabilities for many things - I just believe that for LinkedIn in particular it’s best suited for inspiration. Take the inspo and make it your very own so that not only do you have the opportunity to share - it then inspires connection and conversation.PS.

Two kiddos. 19 months apart.  And a single mama for some time.   That was really really hard.It also caused me to select jobs based on schedule and how time intensive they were because I HAD to work full time - but I also had to balance childcare and wanting to be present for my kids.Sometimes life likes to serve a healthy portion of perspective to remind us how far we’ve come.I do not miss this stage.

They had a post go viral accidentally.And I say accidentally bc true virality is 99% luck. 1% “I followed the algo rules and know what people like so let me say that”.2. They joined a pod.  Yup there are pods on here where people make a little pact to like and comment on each other’s stuff like clockwork to boost the algorithm.I personally do not belong to a pod of any kind because I feel it’s disingenuous and goes against why I’m here.  But there are many, and some “big” LinkedIn creators are in them.3. They’ve got friends in high places who are not in a pod, but have asked friends to boost their content to help them grow.Sometimes “who you know” is the way to “success”….And last but very not least:4. You’re Snoop 🐕 Star power works wonders!I spent some time with a former colleague last night, and she was asking for my help with getting started building her brand here on LinkedIn.She’s senior level with a ton of “receipts” to show that she knows her stuff… so establishing her place as a thought leader won’t be tough.

You were grateful for their time.2. You were listening intently to the conversation.(You do this by referencing the convo and how/why it resonated with you)3. You can see yourself on the team bc of “x”.(and x is always even better when attached to something that was said in the interview!).This particular person who messaged me was concerned with the length of her note - she tends to ramble when nervous, and thus felt like that might be coming through.In general: the length of a thank you note will vary by person but I believe that succinct is the way to go.Heck, I think for almost all business writing succinct is the way to go! 😆Have you been sending thank yous?

In my opinion: no. Your personal social media is not owned by the company you work for.But the reality is, if your boss or HR has a convo with you about social media, it’s the equivalent of a cease and desist letter.So you ask: what should I do???Step 1: Ask yourself if you want to continue to be employed there.If the answer is yes: abide by their rules.If the answer is no: keep on doing your thing on social.This is the way corporate America works.

And the vast majority of folks fund them through a FT job.If you’re reading this thinking: holy guac it’s me…You are not alone. I promise. I’ve had this conversation multiple times with folks from various industries.And they came to me to discuss because I chose option B.I chose myself. And I got fired for it.Because that’s the way it goes when someone who writes your check feels threatened or insecure or simply doesn’t like what you’re saying.Life and learning.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-01-26,"My first apartment post divorce was a 1br on Bancroft Ave in Oakland,CA.  For those not familiar with the area, gunshots were common place.  I prayed my car would still be in its parking spot each morning.And I was grateful that the unit I had was set back off the street just in case any bullets did fly out front.But this is what I could afford as a newly single mom of 2 small kids.Every piece of furniture in the place was donated to me or I sourced for free on Craigslist.Even the kitchen utensils - I worked at a party rental company at the time and the owner gave me everything she could to make sure I had what I needed for me and the kids.It was one of the hardest times of my life, but I was so grateful for the generosity of others.Fast forward a decade.  Circumstances are much different.But I’ll never forget what it took to get to today.That’s the hidden beauty of struggle - you learn.And most of all you learn just how strong and resilient you are.Reflecting on this and wanting to share because I know that there are many people struggling right now - going through really hard times emotionally and financially.You are stronger than you realize.

Pick a lane.  And once you do, market yourself as THE ideal candidate for that lane.Will it be your “dream job”? Probably not. But if the goal is to keep a roof over your head, health insurance, and food on the table:  being very clear on what you want to do is absolutely the answer.Not “I can do x y and z.”  It’s “I can do x and I want to do x at your company because y and I’m the best candidate for the job because z.”The clearer you are, the more a hiring manager can envision you in the role.#gethired #jobseekers #sales #marketing #hiring",274,24,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

It’s out there. And it is what it is.Every single experience we go through in life is one we can learn and grow from.Some with better outcomes than others.I always tell people “closed mouths don’t get fed”, which means if you need help, you have to ask for it.And I did.  I took my own advice and made it clear to the world that right now, I do need help.And guess what?  People cared.  People showed up for me in unexpected ways.And I am so incredibly grateful.Don’t be afraid to be vulnerable. You never know what doors will open when others can see your willingness to be honest and forthright.And to everyone who messaged, checked on me, made intros, sent opportunities: THANK YOU.You have given me so so so much hope for what is to come. 🙏🏼❤️#gratitude #connections #linkedin #comeback #opentowork",273,50,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-11-26,"✅ TLDR : 40 is not too old to get a degree, change a career, or make more money.  And ""tech money"" is pretty nuts compared to the rest of the economy. Keep reading to find out WHY I am talking about this!I am part of many online communities - one of which is specifically for women in technology. As I was drinking my coffee this morning, I came across a post in the community from a woman who stated that she is 40 years old and makes $93k a year in tech CS.   She was asking if, because she does not have a college degree, she has peaked in her earning capability.  And if because she is 40, it is too late to go back to school?There is a lot to unpack here but let me start with the answer that NO:  It is never too late for you to pursue your education or passions or career opportunities.The time will pass anyway - it's what you do with it that matters.(Also as a 40 year old woman who started 2 businesses this year... I am just getting started! 🥂 🚀🔥)Second, I know for a fact that there are MANY people in this country, and in this world, who would be thrilled to make $93k a year.I am of the mindset that ""tech money"" or salaries, skew perspective on what normal income looks like for the rest of the industries.  And in general, if you already have years of practical experience, a degree doesn't matter quite as much.So, while I completely understand her desire to earn more, $93k isn't a ""low"" salary for customer success.  Do some CS people get paid more? Sure. Do some get paid less? Also yes.  The real question is - Is she being compensated fairly compared to other CS managers at her current company?📞 🚀Question for LinkedIn Friends & Fam: Do you think that pursuing a degree once you are already in a role/field/industry is worth the investment?#growth #saas #customersuccess #marketing #sales",267,57,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

I am a massive proponent of partnerships in general and always.Why wouldn’t you want to win together?!Here’s what I’ve learned: 🧚🏼 partnerships make life a whole lot more fruitful. $$$🧚🏼 the best partners are ones who have complimentary strengths to your own and/or can do stuff you can’t or don’t like to do🧚🏼 double the exposure, double the adventure, double the fun (for old folks like me you’re now singing the double mint song 🤣)🧚🏼 A key factor to a successful partnership is effective communication.

In fact I remember telling her “The recruiter will be calling to follow up but I’m making you an offer so hang tight.”She came in and made an impact on our team but also on me as a human.We’ve remained close ever since - even after being laid off together, and then navigating the last 4 years of ups and downs.But here’s what’s different: Ashley has been so present in my life that she knows my husband, my kids, my parents, my cousins, my pets, my other friends… and she consistently shows up.  ❤️We celebrated my daughter’s sweet 16 last night and not only did Ashley come, she baked TWO cakes my daughter requested… and saved the day with special candles.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-03-26,"If you’re a mid-career professional who feels lost, unsatisfied, worried, or over corporate - keep reading.I work with many folks who feel this way and most of them actually have the same problem: they don’t know what they want.They look around at their life, checking the boxes, yet something isn’t right.And I say this with 100% certainty because 2 years ago, this was me.Here’s what I can tell you:The answer is not always: start a business.Entrepreneurship is NOT for everyone.  I promise.  It’s a hell of a lot harder than it looks. And anyone who tells you they magically made $1mil is a liar.The answer IS: put in the work to figure out what it is that is lacking or making you feel unsatisfied.Once you know and can determine what needs to change - you can actually take the steps to change it.Maybe it is a new career direction - or maybe it’s just a different company that is a better fit for you culturally.Maybe it’s a different industry that taps into your interests or skills outside of work.Or maybe it is indeed: start your own business.But regardless, if you cannot clearly articulate what you want to do in your career, it will be challenging to improve your circumstances.I’ve had this convo probably 5x in the last week so just a heads up: you’re absolutely not alone.If you’re 10-20 years into your career, you’re probably looking around wondering “is this even what I want?!”…. And it’s your job to determine that and make decisions accordingly.If this post resonates with you, again, you are not alone. It takes a village to get through this phase of life and there are many people feeling the exact same. 🙏🏼❤️#growth #careercoach #learning #millennials #professionalgrowth",252,43,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Alexis Scott,Female,2023-11-26,"Sharing your budget doesn’t mean a salesperson will take advantage of you.I share this because I can’t tell you how many conversations start with someone “not knowing” their budget.We all have a general idea internally - it’s totally ok to not have it down to the penny.But here’s why it’s a good idea to share at least a range with a salesperson:1. Disqualification.  Seems counterintuitive but if your budget is completely off what a product or service costs, save your time and their time and agree that now is not THE time to work together.2. Flexibility.  Maybe there’s some wiggle room for the salesperson if they know what your budget is and it’s close to their pricing.3. Customization.  At Verbatim we custombuild packages for our clients based on their needs. If you give us a range we will build three tiers for you:  lowest end of the range, mid range, top of range and include everything we can in each to maximize your budget!So, communication is key. Transparency is key.  Trusting that the person you’re doing business with wants to help is key.Sales doesn’t have to be icky.

And I’m even less interested now that you’ve essentially insulted me.************A better wording of this email (in my humble sales opinion):Hey Alexis,I noticed that Verbatim doesn’t have many google reviews, and x% of buyers rely on them to make buying decisions.We’ve worked with x y and z companies and were able to increase reviews by x.Is this something you’re interested in working on improving for Verbatim?*********The above was written on half a cup of coffee but what I know for sure is the second message is not shaming someone and telling them their competitors are doing so much better.Outbound sales is a hard job.

Or Different?I’d like to say they’re “intertwined”.Thought leadership showcases deep expertise in your role and industry.It teaches your audience about the subject matter, and, if you’re good at it - markets you as a subject matter expert in your field.“Marketing” content (from personal LinkedIn accounts) is more about the intersection of your expertise and how you specifically help others.For me, I market myself most often via storytelling.Subtle. Easy to connect with. Relatable. I share this because yesterday I had a ghostwriting consultation where I was asked to provide an example of thought leadership writing.And I had to really assess: which of my posts demonstrate thought leadership rather than marketing?It gets tangled when your thought leadership is literally about how to market yourself! 🤭Ultimately regardless of the manner in which you’re attempting to write, the goal is to spark conversations.Conversations lead to opportunities - and I’m pretty sure that’s why you, me, we all- are hanging out here on LinkedIn.Here to connect, learn, and OPEN DOORS to opportunities!#marketing #founders #content #growth #gethired #sales",228,26,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

You hired them for their expertise and experience.  Get your money’s worth 😉So long as they’re coming back with data (and a solid plan before the trial), understand that marketing as a whole is largely about trial and error.Marketing is also about keeping up with trends, your buyers, the market, and ….

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-04-05,"Yesterday someone posted that LinkedIn isn’t your career diary and to be cautious about what you post.Fair advice.  (And I cannot remember who it was, otherwise I’d tag them!)Any social media platform is a public space - your content is accessible to people you don’t even know exist.And when I read that post, I immediately thought about my own content.Some of which is more on the personal side.And I’ve determined that the answer lies in what your goal is with this platform.If you’re looking for a job, I would recommend a personal social media audit.  Companies do research you.  If there’s anything you don’t want them seeing - delete it.   And moving forward, remember that anything you post is a digital footprint.The job search is super tough right now.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-11-26,"🔥 🔥 🔥Monetizing brand partnerships as a Creator/Influencer Lesson 1:One of the benefits of being a part of the Influence by Verbatim Creator Program is the ability to ask questions about potential brand deals and their terms.Brianna and I have worked with handfuls of brands and negotiated for numerous creators, and are happy to give our feedback to our creators if a brand approaches them with an offer and they are not sure if it is a ""good"" deal.With that said, I shared some questions today with one of our creators that I am going to share here as a general checklist for anyone who is considering working with a brand:✅ Do I like and or align with the product/person asking?✅ What would I be realistically willing to accept as a rate?✅ What is the deliverable? Is it in line with the rate being offered?✅ Is it a one time post? Or a bundle?The answers to these questions should help you navigate through whether or not you want to work with the brand... And keep in mind: the very best deals are WIN-WIN.  You get paid what you want, and the brand gets the exposure/wins that they want from your audience.If the results are one sided, chances are it'll be a one and done.And if you are reading this with 10 or more followers and want to join the Creator program... head on over to the Influence by Verbatim website!#influencermarketing #influencers #creatoreconomy #creators #growth",214,36,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Basically this person had been seeing signs of something ""not being right"" with her child, and had gone to the doctor numerous times requesting help, only to be dismissed.She saw my post and something clicked - maybe this is Tourette's.Sure enough, with that insight she was able to get a diagnosis from the pediatrician and get her child the care and assistance they need moving forward.Human to human content.

I recently met with a client who understands the value in building his personal brand on LinkedIn, but is overwhelmed with the thought of it.In ""theory"" it's great.  In practice, he feels strange sharing content and attracting attention to himself.We had a really great strategy session and one thing that I brought up to him is that building a brand, for a business, or for a person, is a flywheel for exponential growth.Once someone notices you and offers an opportunity, that opportunity can then lead you to 5 more.  And those 5 can lead to 10 more, and so on.There is so much to be gained from sharing your expertise with the world.And if you need proof that people notice and that opportunities come to you if you are willing to share: I am recording a TV segment this morning.

Working at the airport during my layover - have a call in 30 minutes!And I get to meet with a client while I am there.  So that's technically working (but super fun - I can't wait to meet her!!)!We also have a few proposals to send out this week which will require some focused work time... the list goes on.With all of this said, I am the happiest that I have been in over a year.   I get to build a business with someone I adore, work with inspiring clients, and have the freedom to work from anywhere my heart desires.There is a whole lot to be said for controlling your own destiny.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-08-26,"You do not have to start posting on LinkedIn to get a job.Sometimes I think my clients expect me to say the opposite - but I always ask “how do you feel about posting?”, because there are multiple ways to leverage LinkedIn in your search.Yesterday my client hesitated before answering and I just told him: listen I’m not here to insist you post.  But here’s what you can do instead:1. Create a “hit list”.What are your target companies?Who works there that is either a) a leader in your field or b) on your potential future team?2. Start commenting on their posts.The goal is visibility.  Create a memorable imprint.  The more I see the same people commenting on my posts the more I think “ah yes, Susie! She comments a lot!” - and now there’s some recognition.3. Remember that these comments are seeds you are planting.  They take a little time to bloom, but when that company posts a job you want to apply for you now have a little leverage to connect and message that you’ve loved their content and just applied to work at x company for y role.Much like any part of the job search there are lots of ways to get hired but what I can tell you is:  by the time I applied for my job at Aspireship in 2020, all THREE founders knew exactly who I was and were excited to speak to me.Be kind, be friendly, share ideas.

Hell no.  But my advice was simple: ✔️refresh your resume ✔️start putting feelers out✔️start thinking about exactly what you want to say when asked “why are you looking for a new job?”In this economy and market and day and age, it’s more acceptable than ever to see movement on a resume.  Any job search is tough - but please don’t stay miserable because of fear.And please don’t let fear of judgement keep you in a bad situation.Take care of yourself, your mental health, and pursue something that you enjoy.Design the life YOU want to live.

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-09-26,"I promised to build ""out loud"" - here is literally the FIRST meeting Brianna Doe and I had after naming our company Verbatim.Partnership can be challenging.  It can start out super well.  Or it can be rough from the get-go.  It's not just one person's ideas or way or thoughts.  You've got two distinct points of view, and have to consistently be open minded.Now with that said, choosing a name for the company was something we thought about for about a week-ish...Brianna, being Brianna, immediately had ideas in a spreadsheet.  Me, being me, just started saying stuff out loud.  Googling.  Going on Dictionary and Thesaurus sites.Then one afternoon we hopped on a call and she had the word Verb on the spreadsheet.... and Verbatim just popped into my brain!  BOOM!She loved it.  I loved it.  The word is powerful.  It's rooted in clarity (one of our company values).  And it speaks to our love of content and language.So - I took this screenshot very purposefully.  I want to be able to continue to look back on Day 1 and remind myself just how far we have come.In a month. In a year.  In yearS.Every great company starts with an idea.

You didn’t spend $10 - you SAVED it.🔥You return an item for $20, and buy a new item for $30…. That’s winning because you’ve only spent $10!

No is not a bad word.  It’s clear.  If your answer is no, please don’t say “maybe”. You’re wasting everyone’s time.If your answer is no, please don’t ignore someone. You’re wasting their time.If your answer is no, just say no! There’s a lot of power in owning that decision.

But I most certainly struggle with it now.My number one favorite way to calm it is to get outside.Walking has become therapy for me.  Along with actual therapy.

I’m so grateful that as a society we are becoming more aware and accepting of mental health issues and removing the shame associated.2.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-04-19,"One of the biggest mistakes you can make: disqualifying an opportunity without even having a conversation.I had a call this week for a potential opportunity and the founder that I spoke to was explaining that he has been following me for awhile now.We’ve exchanged brief messages, and he said that he appreciated that I’d followed up with him.His company isn’t a large or super well known organization (yet!), but he’s successful and planning upcoming growth.He also shared that there was someone else in the industry who he’d considered and reached out to, but that person wouldn’t give him the time of day.I liken this to a salesperson at a jewelry store who doesn’t want to help the person dressed in casual clothing… they’re looking for the customers who appear a certain way…And in doing so they miss out on opportunities!My advice here is this: unless you are 100000% certain that an opportunity is not for you, have the convo.And honestly sometimes I still have the convo even when I know the opportunity isn’t for me so that I can either A) make a new connection OrB) refer a friend who might be great for itLife works in mysterious ways - and opportunity loves to hide where you least expect it!#opportunity #sales #marketing #opentowork #linkedin",144,28,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-04-22,"This morning I saw a really great post from Jake Wolpert about picking a lane as a candidate.Jake and I are friends, so I texted him my thoughts on the post... which include the fact that my ""multipotentialite"" self still struggles with this to this day! We briefly chatted about how I like driving on the freeway rather than a single lane road and it's been a blessing and a curse throughout my career.And then something magical happened: 30 minutes later I had a discovery call with a founder for ghostwriting, and she shared that one of the reasons she was so excited to meet with me is that I have past experience in her industry!Is it my all in, all of my content revolves around it, 100 years of experience industry? No it is not.  But because I have spent time working in it, I do have a solid grasp on the industry, its challenges, and its rewards.Which sure makes writing about it a whole lot easier!Is it my current industry? Nope.  But guess what... it is one of my lanes.And so is running a company.So while YES, I absolutely agree (and know from my own experience) that picking a lane and sticking to it is the path of least resistance for getting hired,  I am also here to say this:✅ You can do more than one thing.  ✅ You can learn more than one thing. ✅ You can enjoy more than one thing. ✅ You can be knowledgeable about more than one thing.The sum of your experiences is your secret sauce and the spice you bring to the table.BUT I do agree with Jake: if you are interviewing for a particular role - be all in on that role.  Pick THAT lane for the purpose of the convo.  *** And if you are curious about how I help execs build their personal and company brands, my DMs are open :)#growth #sales #marketing #founders #executives",127,26,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

And yes, it’s time consuming.Additionally, the more senior a role you are looking for, the fewer there are in existence… so you’ve got to elevate your search strategy.If you have recently gotten a new job - how long did you search?

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-07-26,"Today I had to press stop on what would have been a major development for The Fairy Job Mom.My future partner is dealing with some personal things that come before business opportunities.So you know what I did?I called him and gave him ""permission"" to be human.  And I use permission lightly - he IS human.  But I know he is hard on himself and did not want to disappoint me by backing out of our partnership.Sometimes not doing something IS the answer.  And that's ok.As I told him: things happen for a reason. I firmly believe that.   The timing just is not right.And if we aren't meant to be in business together now, it doesn't mean we aren't ever.Just another example of the rollercoaster of entrepreneurship.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-02-26,"Yesterday was Rare Disease Day… it is rare itself, only recognized once every 4 years on Leap Year.1 in 7 people are affected by a rare disease. It is estimated that Pathological IKH affects about 1 in 1/2 million.A dear friend of mine has a daughter who has pathological idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia.  This means for no reason that they can find, she gets low blood sugar and her body goes into starvation mode when she doesn't get enough carbohydrates.  It stated with another rare disease called hyperinsulinism that affects about 80 children born in the US per year.  The journey for them has been excruciating.  To keep Ella alive, it takes someone following her 24/7 to ensure the gtube is properly working.  Kids with her symptoms have died in the past due to failed pumps.  And during the day they must do a check on the tube line every 20-60 minutes. Ella is a pretty happy kid despite a lot of pain and trauma from all her pokes and medical interventions.  She loves to dance and loves her little sister.Rare diseases are of little interest to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries because due to the low numbers of people, it doesn't make good business sense.  That is why on World Rare Disease Day (or any day, frankly) it is important to remember and advocate for all the kids on this planet who live in the shadows due to illness, hoping one day to find a cure to just make them normal, NOT rare or unique.Also adding Ella’s mom sent a really interesting clip of her friend and advocate speaking about Rare Disease Day at EU Parliament - will share the link in the comments.Praying for all of the kiddos and parents and even adults bravely fighting rare diseases… praying they get some answers and some relief.🙏🏼#medical #parenting #awareness #love #miracles",117,13,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

That top talent is still demanding top salaries -But are they getting it?I had a chat with someone last week who is looking for work and I cautioned him that he might have to lower his salary expectations if he actually wants to get hired (based on convos with hiring managers and what their roles are paying).Yes, we are all valuable and “worth it”.But you’ve gotta realistically price your employment and understand that the market dictates average salary ranges.And so does industry.  There can be massive deltas in average salary dependent on industry.So - research.  Research and find out what companies are paying. Because in this market, if your desired comp is out of range, there’s a great chance that conversation will be over before it started.No one wants to pay $17 for a bagel they can get for $7 elsewhere.Thoughts on this???Where have you found the best salary info if you’ve searched?And if you need help with where to research I’ll drop some links in the comments but wondering where everyone else has been researching!#salary #sales #marketing #gethired #recruiting",117,85,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Start with gratitude.Thank you so much for…2. Decline.I am not able to xyz…3(a). Explain (this step is optional)I’m booked/busy/etc…3(b). Offer an alternative (again optional)Would love to chat again in…Let’s reconnect in…You might want to reach out to…4.

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-01-26,"Yesterday I had a The Fairy Job Mom call with a product manager who was recently laid off, and has been struggling to get interviews despite a solid background and experience.The first thing I do in this situation is triage. If you aren’t getting interviews there is a 99% chance your resume is not conveying what you want it to to recruiters and hiring managers.Sure enough,  the resume needed work, and we talked through just how to make achievements and impact shine in order for this person to cut through the noise of applications and (fingers crossed!!) start getting those recruiter replies!Now, all of my clients have two choices upon the conclusion of our call:They can a) handle the creation of bullet points and modifications themselves.Or b) use a tool like Teal to help. And for those of you who know me, know that Teal is my number 1 recommended AI resume tool.  If you decide on option B, here’s the news: You can still leverage AI and be in control, AND Teal does so much of the heavy lifting for you!With their Resume Builder, you can pull in the job description and select the requirements that you satisfy and THEN it will generate your bullet points for you based on what you check off (this is called Matching Mode). So cool. Additionally, it makes formatting a breeze. Simply select the resume design you want and fill in (or have it fill in for you) the necessary fields and voila!  No need to fight with Word or Google Docs.Smarter not harder continues to be the theme of 2024 for me.  🙌 🏅Per usual, stay tuned to hear when this candidate lands… and until then, if you are thinking of refreshing your resume, DO IT!!!  This is your sign.📌 🎯 Check out Teal (and Teal +): https://tealhq.co/alexis : Teal’s core platform is free, but Teal+ gives you advanced insights to see if your resume is using the right keywords, as well as unlimited AI-generated resumes and cover letters.GET HIRED in 2024!!! 🧚🏻‍♂️ 🙌 🚀#resume #jobseekers #ai #gethired #ad",94,39,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-01-26,"Smarter not harder is the vibe for 2024.I will admit, I was hesitant to embrace AI in my life.  But my 2024 AI Usage Update: AI is NOT the enemy. You can still leverage AI in your job search and be in control.  AND use it to make your life easier. Can you imagine not having to think of how to phrase all of your achievements for every job you’ve ever had for your resume?! 😲🙏🏼And in fact, when used properly, I realized that AI can inspire me, get me started, and even suggest ideas that I myself had not thought of. For resume AI, I use Teal. Teal has built-in GPT functionality so it can write strong resume achievements tailored specifically to the job description. This is truly my most favorite thing that Teal does. Literally being able to say “speak to this” and voila!  SO COOL. 🤩Of course, AI isn’t necessarily going to have all of the answers, but it is a heck of a lot easier to quickly add in your specific metrics to AI-generated bullets rather than having to think about how to phrase all of your achievements from scratch to speak to what a company is asking for.If you are working on landing your new job for the new year and need some guidance and are interested in how AI can make the process a whole lot easier, I highly highly highly recommend checking out Teal.New Year, New Career.  Here for it in 2024!!!🚀 📌Check out Teal (and Teal +): https://tealhq.co/alexis***All of their tools have a free version so you can run a complete job search end-to-end—but Teal+ (their premium offering) includes more robust analysis and insights (and unlimited AI use!).#resumes #jobseekers #gethired #goals #partnership",90,28,4,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

She turns 16 in November.But there was another part of me that was sad.Older kids understand when family finances change.They’re watching, listening, and learning from their parents.But if there’s anything that I hope they are learning from me, it’s to believe in yourself and do great things….big things… things that may feel scary, but have the opportunity to change lives in the best ways.Will you look back on life and your career with “I wish I had”?

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-12-26,"As 2023 wraps up, my one piece of advice for job seekers is to take this time over the holidays to make sure that your resume is top-notch for 2023.What I mean by this: taking a break to solely focus on making your resume top-notch will actually be a key piece of success when 2024 job postings hit come Jan 2.Per usual, my recommendation for those who need help on where to start: Teal.It is my go-to, tried and true resource when it comes to all things resume: Formatting, AI-generated bullets, making sure that your accomplishments touch on what the job posting is asking for, etc.The reality is that a resume is about enhancing your career story, not fabricating it. You can customize the AI prompts in Teal to include specific keywords from the job description—which again is so important when it comes to showing up as someone the recruiter or hiring manager needs to talk to.So GOAL for the end of the year: get that resume spruced up.GOAL for 2024: GET HIRED!!!

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-09-26,"You’re not a real Latina - you don’t speak Spanish.Someone said this to my cousin yesterday who, like me, is 1st gen, AND on both her mother and her father’s side.I was infuriated for her.What some people fail to understand is that 1st gen kids have it one of two ways:A) Parents who only speak their native tongue and so at home, they’re not speaking English at all.Or B) Parents who are insistent that their family speak the best English possible and want their kids to assimilate to American culture ASAP so English is spoken in the home to enforce this.We were raised with mostly option B.  Interestingly the adults spoke Spanish to each other, but not really to us.But the bigger, underlying issue is to me, being a Latina lies in my roots. In the culture that I was raised in. The foods that we ate and the traditions we celebrated.It never once has occurred to me that I’m not Latina because I don’t speak fluent Spanish.And who is anyone to tell me what my heritage is or isn’t???As for my cousin, she’s embraced being Latina more in her adult life than ever.She’s learning, sharing, impacting her community, and growing, all because she wants to be closer to her roots.Anyway - I’ll step off the soap box but diminishing others’ identities is not the biz.And photo of my mom who is actually NOT Latina but majored in Spanish in college and also speaks it very very fluently.

But what I didn’t take into account was the tactical marketing necessary for long term success.✅ An email list is great - but do you have sequences?✅ A webinar is great - but have you thought out how to nurture the attendees?✅ A newsletter is great - but what’s the plan to grow your subscribers? And will you be consistent with sending one?✅ Is your messaging on point to resonate? ✅ Do you solve a specific problem? ✅ What differentiates you from the crowded market? ✅ Have you nailed down your ideal customer profile? Because even thought you want to help, you aren’t for everyone.All of the tactics and strategies can be absolutely overwhelming, particularly for someone who is just good at what they do and wants to serve others with that talent.Building a business is far beyond “I’m a consultant”.You’re now: a ceo, a marketer, legal, admin, finance, etc etc etc.Learn from my mistakes and get super clear on how you plan to grow your business for sustainability from the beginning.#entrepreneurs #consultants #marketing #sales #learning",73,20,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-03-26,"Yesterday I had a zoom call with someone in Karkiev, Ukraine, and I asked him what I could do to help.The very first thing he said was: talk about the war.  The second: support Ukrainian owned businesses.So here we are.I asked about his daily life (he is on the side of Ukraine near Russia, so close to the front lines) and he said that it’s a hard place to sleep.  The night before Russian drones had been circling and then he could hear the Ukrainian forces trying to shoot them down.The week prior, there was a complete blackout. No power or internet for the region.And of course, so many of his friends are on the actual front lines, fighting.Now keep in mind, this was a business networking call.  And we’d connected initially in a bigger networking group event.I absolutely cannot imagine being able to focus on work while living through a war, let alone want to “hop on a zoom” to network.But that’s what the people of Ukraine are living - and have been living for two years,With no end in sight.Whose reality is much different than ours.And the other countries at war as well - they too need support… our world is suffering.So, as we think about our TGIFs, our happy hours, and the easy weekend ahead, let’s pause and also think about those who are living through war right now and if possible, make a donation to a humanitarian organization or support a business that would be so very grateful.#ukraine #support #partnerships #networking #connections",67,20,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-02-26,"My number one piece of advice for anyone working in corporate America: ALWAYS keep your resume updated, fresh, and ready to send.If opportunity came knocking on your door in the form of a job opportunity, would you be ready?Especially if it was a job that interests you… would you be ready when the person says “Great! Please send over your resume so that I can get it in front of the right people.”Here’s the thing.  A resume is a necessity in corporate America.I know that some people go off about the “hidden job market” or just getting hired because you know someone. But the reality is that for 99% of opportunities and professionals, you MUST have a strong resume in order to land a new job.If I asked you right now what your resume looks like - what would you say?Willing to bet money that most answers would be “It needs some work!”.Great news - that work is made a heck of a lot easier with resume tools.  My favorite: Teal.Instead of being pressed to figure out your bullet points or how to position your experience for an opportunity, with Teal’s Resume Builder, you can pull job descriptions from your Job Tracker, and with Matching Mode and AI, you can choose the specific parts of the job description you want to respond to with your achievement. (AND you can also use this to make your existing resume achievements better, FYI!)🚀 Make sure to check out Teal and Teal+ and let me know what you think!https://tealhq.co/alexis 🎯Stay fresh out there folks!!!*** And for full transparency: Teal’s core platform is free, but Teal+ gives you advanced insights to see if your resume is using the right keywords, as well as unlimited AI-generated resumes and cover letters. 🧚🏻‍♂️#resumes #jobseekers #gethired #sponsored #tealpartner",59,22,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Alexis Scott,Female,2023-08-26,"Had my third call with a client today and he had a lot of questions surrounding clarity in his next move.Additionally I was on a LinkedIn live today with Amy Looper and the topic of clarity came up also.So here’s a post about my thoughts on clarity (and it’s been a hurdle that I’ve overcome).First let me say that when you become “clear” that doesn’t mean it’s a forever vision.  It’s how you feel at your current place in life.And if you’re struggling to find clarity I personally think the best place to start is with your “hell nos”.   You know the things you absolutely will not do a lot better than what you want to do.Once you’ve got that down, start a list of maybes.And explore! Learn as much as you can about each option - weed through.  Add some to your “no” pile and keep some alive.Rinse and repeat until you form a vision of what you want.Is this scientific? No.  Not a lot is with our souls.But you’ve gotta start somewhere.  And I promise once your vision takes shape it’s a whole lot easier to achieve it!Happy hump day!!! 🧚🏼❤️#vision #sales #marketing #leadership #growth",44,19,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-03-26,"Brianna and I spent a lot of time working through what tools we wanted and needed to build Verbatim.   It was overwhelming.  Truly.  Especially having worked in SaaS and both of us being familiar with many many different options. Investing in multiple tools is expensive and going back and forth between different softwares is not only time consuming - it can be distracting.Also - there are so many tools that only do ONE thing. Which is great - if you only need one thing. But we need a LOT of things.  So really, one tool that does MANY things was the wish.I had personally known Dropbox for sharing and storing large files securely, but after trying Dropbox Business, I realized that Dropbox is one tool that handles multiple business needs - centralized and at a reasonable price.   My favorite products: eSignatures and PDF editing - I use them ALL THE TIME. Bonus: Not only can I send documents through Dropbox, but I can track analytics on receipts and views, and ensure that my clients are receiving documents securely.As a marketing agency, we’re constantly working with new clients, sending them files, keeping track of edits and revisions, and I am just super thrilled that we found a solution for us that works.If you are in need of a swiss army knife tool, I’m telling you, Dropbox Business is where it is at.It doesn’t matter if you are a team of 2 like us, or a team of 2000, having so many tools simplified and in one place is a game changer for saving time and being more efficient with your workflows.I am so grateful that we found it and have streamlined and centralized our business to make life SO MUCH EASIER.  Highly recommend checking out Dropbox’s plans for teams: https://lnkd.in/g2B9kc3f#marketing #contracts #efficiency #partnerships #dropboxpartner",34,10,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHHtF4BANxcNxhHse2HU3RPg-hTGAUtp_0&keywords=alexis%20rivera%20scott&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=f95e8a4f-fddf-42c4-96bb-1f4e2e61dbfc&sid=V6*&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Alexis Scott,Female,2024-04-22,"Smart brands create sticky customers. And they also leverage smart partnerships!!!I recently discovered Anchor for contracts/payments and have been loving it... but I just use it for that.  Very simple.But Anchor is SMART.   They have a partnership with Zapier - and not only are they leveraging that partnership, they are also finding ways for their customers to  get even stickier - through integrations!The more someone can automate and streamline their business with Zapier zaps, and make using Anchor a no brainer.... the more likely Anchor is to retain them as a customer!This is NOT a paid post - I just am a happy customer and got this email and was impressed. #partnerships and #marketing teams both get a 10/10 on this email campaign!We love teamwork AND really awesome solutions that actually work and help businesses succeed.Have you seen any standout co-selling or co-marketing partnerships hit your inbox lately??
