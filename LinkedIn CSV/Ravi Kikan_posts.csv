Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-03-27,"State of #Mentalhealth is up close and personal.This is as real as it gets.It is in fact no more about IIT, IIM or an ivy league it is purely about the state of mind.To be honest not everyone is alike e.g. for some if it is work pressure however for some it is infact hustle BUT the caveat is to understand and ensure a great mental health for the folks across is the right balance.We will keep harping on the fact and spend millions of dollars in building culture but the fact remains if we don't invest into building superlative mental health for the employees and the employers things might go south.This isnworse than a pandemic.Makes me sad at the state of affairs when we are focussed on just performance without looking at how people are taking that journey.Mentally fit workforce is a billion times more productive, agile and innovative to hustle at a fantastic pace if really the right amount of care is given towards mental health.Our vision at UWC remains to put the most effective deep tech towards preventive healthcare including mental health and wellness and close the loop by extending the human touch with the best of clinicians, therapists , coaches etc network.I wish and pray that things like these can be minimized with the leaders putting their minds and money into building a great mental health for the organization at large.Godspeed.United We Care Ritu Mehrotra Sourav Banerjee Shumita Kakkar sheetal sharma Leann Sims Dan Gardner #mentalhealthmatters #humanresources #leadership #culture",154,38,8,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-04-13,"Never forget to build this....Ever.The Growth Mindset: Your Secret Weapon for Success.By working with some of the best founders and entrepreneurs globally this is what inspired me to change the way I looked at things. This also helped me to reach out to some amazing folks globally and write one of my books called Don't Sit and Brood.What did I really learn ?Having a growth mindset isn't just a buzzword - it's the foundation for thriving in today's dynamic world. Whether you're a hustler, marketer, leader, founder, or part of a startup, embracing challenges as opportunities to learn and grow is the key to unlocking your full potential. Here's how a growth mindset gives you an edge:Resilience in the Face of Setbacks:Setbacks are inevitable, but with a growth mindset, you see them as stepping stones, not roadblocks. You bounce back stronger and learn from every experience. Continuous Learning:  Believing your skills and knowledge can develop fuels your hunger to learn and adapt. This keeps you ahead of the curve in a constantly evolving landscape.  Embracing Challenges:  Challenges become exciting opportunities to test your limits and discover new possibilities. This fosters innovation and opens doors to unexpected successes.   Collaboration & Teamwork:  You recognize the value of diverse perspectives and are open to feedback. This fosters strong, collaborative teams that achieve more together.  How to Cultivate a Growth Mindset:Focus on Effort: Recognize that success comes from hard work and dedication, not just innate talent. Celebrate Progress, Not Perfection: Growth is a journey, not a destination. Acknowledge your progress, no matter how small. Reframe Challenges:View setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow. Ask yourself, ""What can I learn from this?""By adopting a growth mindset, you'll gain the resilience, adaptability, and drive to excel in your career and personal life.

But here's the real truth: Knowing and showing your worth isn't about arrogance, it's about self-respect and empowerment.Here's why owning your worth really matters:Life:  When you value yourself, you attract healthier relationships and set stronger boundaries. You make choices that align with your needs and values, building a life that feels authentic and fulfilling.Work:  Confidently showcasing your skills and contributions leads to more recognition, opportunities, and even promotions. People who respect their worth don't settle for undervalued positions or toxic work environments.Business:  Standing behind your brand and product's value attracts the right customers and inspires loyalty.

At every 50 kilometres in India , things change , the dialect changes, the tradition changes, to keep things aligned you always need a leader who understands that diversity.A leader can ""also afford to be a showman and speak and share how he/she feels about the country"" and give accountability as a preferred  option for getting things done by everyone in his/her team.Here is the catch word - Getting Things Done.I think Modi ji does that with style.Wouldn't you agree ?#JaiHind #MadeInIndia",28,19,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

But what if there's more to our purpose? As hustlers, founders, leaders, entrepreneurs and aspiring ones we have the incredible opportunity to be creators. We can build solutions to problems, leave a positive impact, and shape a better future.  Think about it:Hustling is essential, but it's not the end goal. It's the fuel that gets us started. True fulfillment comes from crafting something meaningful, something that solves a real need.Consumption is passive. Creation is active.We can be inspired by others, but simply consuming their ideas keeps us stuck.  Let's use our talents to bring new ideas to life. Leadership isn't just about driving results. It's about inspiring others to create. When we empower our teams to contribute their unique perspectives, innovation thrives.The world needs our creativity.Let's move beyond the ""hustle"" mentality and embrace the power of creation. There is a small caveat though.This mindset needs to be percolate not only in your minds but within your peers, teams and everyone around you to get to the next level of personal and professional growth.So, What will you build today?Godspeed.#entrepreneur #leadership #innovation #creativity #purpose #growthmindset #startups",27,8,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Focus on discussions that will move the needle.-   Liars gonna lie. Don't be surprised when they do. Instead, focus on building trust with those who are genuine.-   Let go of what you can't control. It's a recipe for frustration. Channel your energy into the things you can influence.-  Life throws curveballs, but it's still amazing! Don't let bad choices, people, or situations cloud your perspective.-  Empowerment through choice. You have the power to make decisions that shape your journey. Choose wisely!-   Struggle is part of the story. Hard times build resilience and pave the path to success. Embrace the journey! ‍-   True growth comes from honest relationships. Surround yourself with people who inspire you and challenge you in equal measure.By internalizing these truths, you can navigate the challenges with greater clarity and purpose.

As part of this startup community make the full use of it and feel free to ask any questions or queries that you might have.Growth on Your Terms: A Founder's Short Guide to Hyper Growth Entrepreneurs and Aspiring Ones, Ready to blast off ? Here are a few inspiring truths to keep at the forefront of your mind as you plan your venture's growth:1. Passion is Your Fuel, Not Your Compass: Passion may ignite your journey, but a clear vision charts the course. What problem are you solving, and WHY does it matter? This ""why"" will guide your decisions and inspire your team even during challenging times.2. Your Customers Are Your North Star: Don't be seduced by vanity metrics. Obsessively understand your target audience & ICPs. Who are they? What keeps them up at night? Become a master of their needs and desires. Growth comes from serving them, not just selling to them...""Key point""3. Embrace the Rollercoaster: Growth isn't linear; it's a thrilling, unpredictable ride. Celebrate wins, big and small. Learn from setbacks, and never lose sight of your long-term vision. Resilience is your superpower!4. Build Your Dream Team - Together: Surround yourself with passionate, talented individuals who complement your skillset. Foster a culture of collaboration and open communication. Remember, a strong team is a force multiplier that propels your venture forward. A great team beats everything else hollow. Period. Spend time and energy scouting and building it.5. Celebrate Progress, Not Perfection: Don't wait for everything to be perfect before launching. Get your MVP out there, collect feedback, iterate, and improve. Growth is a continuous process, not a destination. Find customer who are ""happy"" buying your product/services AND are ""willing"" to pay to buy.Entrepreneurs and Aspiring Ones, the world needs your audacious ideas and relentless spirit! Remember, growth on your terms is possible. Embrace these core values, and you'll be well on your way to achieving the extraordinary.Small caveat as ever that you should ideally know.Building a growth mindset is an important part of being a successful entrepreneur.

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-03-27,"Things get sorted the moment you pick this.Optimism.Why Optimism is Your Secret Weapon ?The hustling work and startups throws challenges your way like a fastball machine. But founders who thrive share a secret weapon: unwavering optimism.It's not about burying your head in the sand. Optimism is the belief that even in the face of setbacks, there's a path to success. It fuels the creativity to find solutions, the resilience to bounce back, and the determination to keep pushing forward.Here's how optimism supercharges your leadership:Innovation thrives on a ""can-do"" attitude. Optimists see problems as puzzles to solve, not walls to climb. This opens doors to fresh ideas and out-of-the-box thinking.Your team feeds off your energy. A positive leader inspires confidence and motivates others to push past obstacles. Optimism is contagious!Setbacks become stepping stones. When things get tough, optimists focus on learning and adapting. They see challenges as opportunities to improve.But wait, isn't optimism just wishful thinking?Not at all. Optimism is about believing in a better future and taking action to make it happen. It's the fuel that gets you moving, even when the road gets bumpy.Cultivate optimism! It's a superpower.There is one small caveat though.You should be willing to unlearn, relearn and get to the other side of your learning curve in the positive frame of mind which is growth bound.Godspeed.#optimism #leadership #entrepreneur #mentalhealth #startuplife #innovation",19,11,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-02-27,"Laser Focus: The Secret Weapon for Startup ScalingEver feel like there's just too much to do when scaling your startup? You're not alone. But here's the truth: Distractions are growth killers. I have gone through this multiple time and have seen many go through it as well.Trust me when I tell you this - you can really bring any venture down if you focus on too many things like a super man/woman and not focus on the right essential things.So you might want to consider thinking about some key pointers which can come super handy for you. Here are some small pointers for the entrepreneurs, seed/early/growth stage founders, marketers and growth bound hustlers.We start with one - the most important one actually - Super focus.Why focusing on the critical few and eliminating the rest is crucial for achieving global success - Just look at companies like Zoom . They didn't try to be everything to everyone. They started early BUT focused only on video conferencing, mastered it,and when the right time came became a household name.Here's why super focus is your scaling superpower:-   Clarity breeds efficiency: Knowing your priorities means fewer wasted resources and faster decision-making.-   Stronger value proposition: A focused offering resonates deeply with your target audience, attracting quality leads.-   Sustainable growth: You build expertise and momentum in your niche, setting yourself apart from the noise.So, aspiring entrepreneurs, ditch the FOMO and get laser-focused! Here's how you can work it out - Identify your core competency -What are you truly good at? Where do you bring unique value? Define your ideal customer- Who are you solving the biggest problems for? Set clear, measurable goals -What does success look like for your venture? Ruthlessly prioritize - What activities directly contribute to your goals? Delegate or eliminate the rest.Remember, scaling isn't about doing everything; it's about doing the right things with relentless focus.

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-02-27,"Why Small Steps, Not Giant Leaps, Lead to Bigger JourneysHere is a change manual one pager for you.This could come super handy for founders, leaders, hustlers, managers, startups, entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs. This is just not about a fictional to do list but a reality check for you.Forget sprinting towards your goals with 100 steps at once. The marathon of life rewards those who embrace the power of small, intentional steps. Here's why:1. Overwhelm is real: Imagine climbing Mount Everest. Trying to conquer it in one go leads to exhaustion and setbacks.Taking one step at a time, enjoying the view, and appreciating the progress keeps you motivated and moving.2. Momentum matters: Small wins fuel big results. Completing achievable tasks builds confidence and propels you forward. Each step becomes a stepping stone, building momentum and making the next step easier.3. Flexibility is key: Life throws curveballs. Taking small steps allows you to adapt and adjust as needed. You can learn from each step, refine your approach, and navigate challenges effectively.4. Building habits takes time: Lasting change comes through consistent effort, not one-off bursts. Small, daily steps help you build sustainable habits that become ingrained in your routine, leading to long-term success.5. Celebrate the journey: Big goals can feel distant and daunting. Focusing on the small wins in your journey allows you to celebrate each accomplishment, no matter how seemingly insignificant. This keeps you engaged and positive,reminding you of how far you've come.One small caveat though.Every journey begins with a single step. Don't underestimate the power of small, consistent actions. They might feel insignificant, but they pave the way to reaching your biggest dreams, one step at a time.Take the first step.Godspeed.#leadership #growthmindset #mentalhealth #personalgrowth #motivation #startups #success #takeaction",18,4,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-04-06,"The Founder's Tightrope: Balancing the Short-Term Sprint with the Long-Term Marathon ‍Entrepreneurs, founders, leaders – we all wear many hats. But one of the biggest challenges is mastering focus: keeping our eye on the prize (that long-term vision) while tackling the daily hurdles (those short-term goals).Here's why both are crucial:Short-Term Wins Fuel Momentum: Daily victories, big or small, keep us motivated and our teams engaged. They're the stepping stones building the path to success.Long-Term Vision Guides Direction:Without a clear vision of where we're headed, all those short-term wins can feel scattered.  Our long-term vision is the compass that ensures we're moving in the right direction.So, how do we walk this tightrope? Set SMART Goals:  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals bridge the gap. They keep short-term tasks aligned with the long-term vision. Celebrate Milestones:  Acknowledge both the daily wins and the bigger achievements. It keeps everyone motivated and reinforces the connection to the long-term vision.  Regular Vision Review:  Don't let the daily grind cloud your long-term vision.  Schedule time to revisit and refine your vision to ensure it still aligns with the market and your goals.Small caveat what it seems for the long run sometimes looks Topsy turvey in the current scenario.This is where you need to hold to your horses.The journey is a marathon, not a sprint.

The key to staying afloat is prioritization.  But you may always ask - why prioritize? It's not just about work—it's about life! By tackling the must-do's first, you:Free up mental space:No more swirling anxieties about looming deadlines. Boost productivity: Focused work on high-impact tasks gets more done in less time. Reduce stress: Feeling in control of your workload prevents burnout. Increase quality: Dedicated attention leads to better results in everything you do. Prioritization applies beyond work, too! ‍Want to spend more time with family? Schedule it!  Dreaming of learning a new skill? Block out time to practice! Here's how to prioritize like a champ and you can do it everyday - 1. List everything: Brain dump all your tasks, big or small. 2. Analyze urgency and importance: Not all tasks are created equal!  Identify deadlines and the impact of each task. 3. Schedule strategically: Block out dedicated time for the most critical tasks, ensuring they get your focused attention. ️4.

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-03-27,"Recharge to Reignite: Why Saturdays Matter in the Hustle ?The startup grind can be exhilarating, but it's a marathon, not a sprint. That's why I'm a huge believer in the power of the Saturday Recharge.Small caveat though.The hustle may not be just limited to startups and founders but all entrepreneurial minds too working in enterprises , SMBs and small businesses too.The hustle remains the same, the degree changes.So, here's why prioritizing Saturdays is essential for founders, leaders, and aspiring entrepreneurs:-   Sharpened Focus: A break from the daily firehose of emails and meetings allows you to return on Monday with renewed clarity and focus.-   Spark Creativity: Stepping away from the routine can spark fresh ideas and innovative solutions you might have missed in the daily grind.-   Boosted Morale: Feeling recharged translates to a more positive and inspiring presence for your team.-   Stronger Relationships: Devoting quality time to loved ones fosters a healthy work-life balance, leading to a more fulfilling life overall.-   Sustainable Hustle: By avoiding burnout, you ensure you have the energy and passion to lead your venture for the long haul.Also one thing which always you need to keep in mind.Remember, you're not a machine. Taking this Saturday to unwind, recharge, and reconnect with yourself is an investment in your success and well-being.Feel free to share an inspire someone today, you never know who might change their trajectory today for the greater good.Godspeed.#leadership #growthmindset #mentalhealth #selfcare #saturdayvibes #leadershipdevelopment #startups",15,12,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-04-20,"Only if you can ""Really Understand"" this massive learning.Power of Potential: Why We Should Invest in the Right PeopleHere is something would love to share with you all so that whether you are a leader, hustler, marketer, founder, entrepreneur or someone itching to be one understands this from a long term perspective.A little deep but read on.We've all been there – the sixth-grade art competition where everyone's wielding crayons and watercolors, hesitantly creating masterpieces. Then there's you, the bold outlier, standing out with a canvas and a set of oil paints.My oil painting wasn't a masterpiece by any stretch when I made it in 6th standard open art class. In fact, it was probably average at best. But when my art teacher saw it, his reaction surprised everyone. he bought it, not for its artistic merit (let's be honest, it wasn't a Picasso), but for the sheer audacity of using oil paints in sixth grade.Those were the times the folks hardly knew how to paint on canvas and good oil paints weren't available at handy like these times.My art teacher bought the oil art for INR 50, my fees was around INR 25 per month so it was a steal deal for me. This learning is not just about selling the art piece it is beyond that.This experience has stayed with me. It's a testament to the power of seeing potential – not just in polished portfolios and proven track records, but in the raw talent and willingness to take risks.My art teacher bet on the potential that he saw, that's leadership.As founders, leaders, and those building teams, it's easy to get caught up in past accomplishments and pedigrees. But what truly separates good teams from great ones is the ability to see the potential within individuals. Can they take that giant leap? Do they have the hunger to learn and grow? These are the questions that should guide our hiring decisions.Here's the challenge: Invest in your human capital with a different lens. Look for the spark, the willingness to experiment, the drive to push boundaries. These are the qualities that will propel your team forward, not just past achievements.So, the next time you're evaluating talent, remember the sixth-grader with the oil paints. There's a Picasso in all of us waiting to be discovered.Feel free to share an inspire someone today.Pass it on.Godspeed.#leadership #humanresources #hiring #talent #futureofwork #startups #mentalhealth #success #recruitment",15,2,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Imagine a world where AI can:-   Solve complex problems beyond human capability.-   Revolutionize industries like healthcare, materials science, and energy.-   Enhance human potential through brain-computer interfaces and more.This future is closer than you think. The graph shows exponential growth, and experts predict the Singularity could arrive by 2045. The question is: Are you ready?For entrepreneurs: How will your business adapt to leverage AI?For learners: What skills will be most valuable in an AI-powered world?For everyone: How can we ensure this future benefits all of humanity?There is a small caveat though.While lot of things will disappear faster than you think, more things will reappear at the same speed as well.Think over this.All sectors which will have dependencies cut because of the advent of AI will also boom in new jobs, prospects and better possibilities.The point is, AI needs handholding and human touch, it cannot just go rogue.Remember Mission Impossible ?Share your thoughts and predictions in the comments.#GenAI #AI #singularity #futureofwork #artificialintelligence #technology #machinelearning #innovation #healthcare",13,7,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-04-13,"No one tells you about this.Hope vs. Fear: The Action Advantage As leaders, hustlers, startups and entrepreneurs, we navigate a constant dance between hope and fear. But what if I told you taking action on both could be the ultimate recipe for success?The below diagram builds that mindset that we always know of however .....Here's the twist:Hope on Autopilot Limits Growth: Passively hoping for the best rarely leads to breakthroughs. However, taking action fueled by hope propels us forward, turning dreams into tangible possibilities.Fear Can Paralyze, But It Can Also Protect: Unchecked fear can be debilitating. But acting on a controlled fear forces us to consider potential risks and plan for contingencies, fostering a healthy sense of caution.The key lies in flipping the script sometimes which very few can think of doing and very rarely some do:Hope:  Don't just wish for success. Take action to make it happen.  Develop a plan, set goals, and take that first step. Pull into action.Fear: Don't let fear stop you completely.  Acknowledge it,  analyze the potential risks,  and then take calculated action to mitigate them. Hedge the risk, take the action.By taking action on both hope and fear, we create a powerful momentum. Hope fuels our drive, while calculated action informed by fear ensures we navigate challenges strategically.The result? A  brighter future built on proactive steps, not passive wishing.Small caveat though - Be willing to unlearn and relearn.Godspeed.#leadership #entrepreneur #startup #growthmindset #action #success #motivation #mentalhealth",13,4,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-04-06,"Why Perfectionism Hinders Innovation  As founders, leaders, and aspiring entrepreneurs, we often fall into the perfectionist trap.  The relentless pursuit of a flawless product or idea can stifle creativity and stall progress. Here's why it's time to break free:Perfectionism Paralyzes: The fear of making mistakes can prevent us from taking risks and getting our ideas out there. Speed Wins: The market craves agility.  Getting something ""good enough"" out there allows for iteration and adaptation –  key ingredients for long-term success. Out-of-the-Box Thinking Takes Flight: When we let go of the need for everything to be perfect, space opens for bold ideas and unconventional solutions. The Key Takeaways: Don't wait for perfection. Embrace the power of the prototype.  Get your ideas out there, test, learn, and iterate.  True innovation happens when we free our minds and embrace the messy process of creation.Keep in mind just one thing.Enjoy the joy ride in whatever you do so that you don't have to look back tomorrow and regret even for a single second.Godspeed.#founders #leadership #entrepreneur #startup #growthmindset #innovation #perfectionism #outsidethebox #creativity",13,5,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-04-26,"The Secret Weapon of Startup Success  In the whirlwind of a startup, distractions are dime to a dozen. Between chasing funding, building a team, and launching your product, focus can feel like a luxury. But here's the truth: super focus is the secret weapon of successful startups.Super focusDeep focusDeep focus Why? Because it allows you to:Prioritize ruthlessly:  With laser focus, you can identify the tasks that truly move the needle and ruthlessly eliminate distractions. This ensures your limited resources are used for maximum impact.Execute flawlessly: When your mind is laser-focused, you enter a state of deep work, where you can produce high-quality work in a shorter amount of time. This translates to faster progress and quicker wins.One more key and most crucial point -Boost team productivity: Your focus sets the tone for your team. By demonstrating a commitment to focused work, you inspire your team members to do the same, leading to a more productive and efficient culture. So, how do you cultivate super, deep focus in your startup or business ?Plan your day ruthlessly:  Block out dedicated time slots for focused work on high-priority tasks. Eliminate distractions during these periods (silence notifications, close unnecessary tabs etc.).Embrace the power of ""No"":  Learn to politely but firmly decline requests that don't align with your immediate goals. Your time is precious - protect it fiercely.Optimize your environment:  Create a dedicated workspace that minimizes distractions. Consider factors like lighting, noise levels, and clutter. Leverage technology:  Use time-management apps, website blockers, and noise-cancelling headphones to further enhance your focus.Prioritize mental well-being:  A well-rested mind is a focused mind. Ensure adequate sleep, manage stress, and maintain healthy habits.By mastering super focus, you can transform your startup from scattered to unstoppable.

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-01-27,"This story blew me up today.Story of courage, collaboration,  friendship, empathy, faith and divine intervention.Humanity restored.On the morning of September 11, 2001, Stanley Praimnath was at work on the 81st floor of the World Trade Center’s South Tower when he witnessed an American Airlines jet heading directly toward his building.You need to visualize this episode to understand the faith that was infused in this episode. In a split-second decision, he prayed and took cover under his desk just as the plane struck the tower above his office level.The collision tore a hole in the wall behind him and sucked out almost everything in his office, leaving only his desk, which providentially protected him from the ensuing fire and debris. Trapped amidst the wreckage, Stanley’s pleas for help were heard by Brian Clark, another survivor, who bravely came to his aid.Together, they navigated the stairs and managed to flee the building mere minutes before it collapsed. Stanley attributes his miraculous survival to divine intervention and sees Brian as a lifelong friend.Following this life-changing experience, Stanley turned to pastoral work and motivational speaking, maintaining a deep friendship with Brian.credits: @Fascinate, Twitter #empathy #humanity #faith",11,4,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-01-27,"The Great War Within: Conquering Yourself Forget beige cubicles, boardrooms and quarterly reports. The real battleground, according to Tyler Durden, lies not in boardrooms, but within. Our greatest war, he declares, is a ""spiritual war."" A fight against complacency, apathy, and the erosion of our true selves.Isn't it so factual ?In the gritty underworld of Fight Club, Brad Pitt's enigmatic Tyler delivers punches (both literal and metaphorical) that resonate far beyond the screen. His words pierce through the corporate sheen, urging us to confront the shadows lurking within, the limitations we self-impose, and the flickering embers of our potential waiting to be reignited.Here is one of the best Tyler's ""great war"" nuggets that inspire a growth mindset and well-being revolution:Fight Club, despite its dark undertones, is a potent call to action. It urges us to break free from societal cages, confront our inner demons, and forge a life guided by authenticity, purpose, and connection.This ""great war"" isn't about brute force.

Share your thoughts in the comments below. Let's ignite a revolution of well-being,growth, and living life on our own terms.Remember, the first rule of the ""great war"" is: You do not talk about the great war.......But the second rule is: Start your own fight for discovery today :)What do you think ?Godspeed.#leadership #GrowthMindset #Mentalhealth #Wellbeing #Authenticity #SelfDiscovery #BreakFree",10,3,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-04-20,"The Rule of 1: Why Quantity Can Lead to Quality in OutreachFor leaders, founders, marketers, sales folks, startups, entrepreneurs and aspiring ones here is some food for thought.Ever feel like your outreach efforts fall on deaf ears? Blasting out messages to hundreds of connections with minimal response? We've all been there. But what if I told you that focusing on just one favorable response could be the key to successful outreach?Whether you are - -  Searching for a new assignment-  Looking for a new client-  Building a new product for customers-  Looking for an investor-  Looking for a new jobHere is one things you should alway keep in mind and try to follow if you can.Welcome to the Rule of 1.Instead of chasing mass connections, prioritize quality interactions. Here's why:Personalization is Power: A generic message gets ignored. Take the time to understand each recipient's interests and tailor your outreach accordingly. This one genuine connection can be the difference between a ""meh"" and a ""YES!""Focus on Value: Don't just ask, offer value. Are you reaching out for a job? Highlight a relevant skill or experience. Pitching a product? Showcase its benefit to their specific needs. Make the recipient feel like you've done your homework.Quality Over Quantity: Spend less time sending out generic messages and more time crafting targeted outreach to the right people. This allows for deeper, more meaningful connections.Remember, the Rule of 1 isn't about settling for one response. It's about maximizing your chances of getting a positive response from every interaction. The more personalized and valuable your outreach, the higher your chances of securing that ""one"" favorable response that leads to a new client, partnership, or dream job.One small caveat again.Be willing to unlearn and relearn always and keep improving, like I have been doing that for some time now, never too late to do that any day, any time :)Share with someone who might want to read this today, you never know who you end up inspiring anyday.Godspeed#growthmindset #networking #entrepreneur #sales #marketing #hustle #ruleof1 #persuasion #careeradvice #hiring #recruitment",10,2,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-02-27,"This Got Me Thinking.Most Of Us, Neglect This Topic Or Don't Want To Discuss About It.Here is my nudge :)Why A Family Needs a Mentoring Magic Touch for Success PlanningPlanning for success in a large family or network often feels like navigating a bustling marketplace. While goals and values may intertwine, individual dreams and aspirations can create a complex ecosystem. That's where coaching and mentoring come in as game-changers, offering far more than just a workplace perk.Here's why your family dynasty needs a mentoring program:Empowering the Next Generation: ‍‍‍ Imagine young family members receiving guidance from seasoned mentors within the network. These seasoned figures can impart valuable knowledge, share hard-won lessons, and provide crucial support as younger members forge their paths.Bridging the Gap: Communication and understanding can be tricky across generations. Mentorship programs foster meaningful connections, bridging the gap between young and old, fostering empathy, and strengthening family bonds.Navigating Ambitions: Not everyone shares the same ambitions, and that's okay! With diverse mentors, individual family members can receive personalized guidance aligned with their own goals, whether it's pursuing entrepreneurship, excelling in academia, or carving a unique path.Sharpening Family Vision: A shared vision is the cornerstone of a strong family unit. But how do you achieve that with so many voices? Mentorship programs can facilitate open communication, ensuring everyone feels heard and contributing to a vision that reflects the collective aspirations of the family.Building Long-Term Success: The benefits of mentoring extend far beyond individual growth. Studies show families with established mentoring programs experience greater financial stability, stronger communication, and higher levels of personal fulfillment.Why only large family structures ?Not really , nuclear family structures can also prepare for the same once they understand the path to bigger and higher responsibilities that might just crop up anytime in life.The best answer to the above is to reach out to a mentor or a close relative or a family friend who can guide you in the whole process.Well sometimes you should have to be prepared - just prepared.What do you think ?Does this really make sense to you ?#Leadership #GrowthMindset #Mentoring #FamilySuccess #MentorshipMatters #EmpoweringGenerations",10,4,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-04-24,"#GrowthMindset : The Secret Weapon of Aspiring ChangemakersThis competitive world and specially the startup world thrives on hustle, but what separates the fleeting trends from the truly disruptive forces? It all boils down to mindset.However.Very few people understand this and adopt this.Here's why a growth mindset is the secret weapon for aspiring founders and changemakers:-  Challenges become stepping stones, not roadblocks. With a growth mindset, you see failures as opportunities to learn and iterate. Every obstacle becomes a chance to refine your approach and emerge stronger.-   Embrace the journey, not just the destination. The road to success is rarely linear. A growth mindset fosters the resilience and adaptability needed to navigate the twists and turns of entrepreneurship.-   Lifelong learning becomes a superpower. The world is constantly evolving, and a growth mindset equips you with the insatiable curiosity and openness to learn that fuels innovation.Small caveat to understand and really think about - A growth mindset isn't just about personal success. It's about building a better world.Imagine a generation of founders who approach challenges with a ""we can do this"" attitude. A world where setbacks are seen as opportunities for collective learning and progress.  That's the power of a growth mindset for the greater good.I certainly feel this mindset should be imbibed very early in life , perhaps in school conditioning to build a resilient and competitive youth.What do you think ?Feel free to share this with your peers and specially with someone who might need to hear this today.

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-02-27,"How GenAI blasted off the funding sceneThe explosion of generative AI saves the AI sector from the worst of the venture drought.Although AI venture activity slowed down in 2023, the sector — and particularly, generative AI — remains the one clear bright spot in an otherwise somber fundraising environment. Based on our deep dive below, here is the TLDR on the state of AI:In 2023, AI startups raised $42.5B across 2,500 equity rounds. Although down 10% year-over-year (YoY), AI funding fell far less than broader venture funding (-42% in 2023). AI deal volume decreased by 24% YoY — also less than the decline seen in venture as a whole (-30%). However, the year’s 2,500 deals marked the lowest annual deal count in AI since 2017.-   The US saw AI funding jump 14% YoY in 2023, fueled by mega-rounds. AI funding in Europe, on the other hand, slipped 29%, while it fell a whopping 61% in Asia. The US continues to lead in AI deal share worldwide, with nearly half of all AI deals.  -   Generative AI dominated in 2023, attracting 48% of all AI funding. This was up significantly from 2022, when genAI startups grabbed just 8% of the total. 2023’s surge was driven by massive rounds to large language model (LLM) developers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection.-   AI deals got bigger in 2023, with the average deal size climbing 21% YoY to $23.4M. The median deal size also held steady YoY at $4.4M — the second-highest level on record — indicating that bigger checks are being doled out across the board, not just to a few AI heavyweights.-   M&A exits rebounded in 2023 to 317, a record high. The acceleration in M&A points to a wave of consolidation, as incumbents look to quickly bring AI capabilities on board so they don’t get caught on the back foot.-   The AI sector minted 22 new unicorns in 2023, down 39% from 2022. However, that’s a much softer decline than other sectors, like fintech and digital health, experienced over the same period. GenAI companies, in particular, are seeing their valuations soar as investors compete for access to deals.-   Google was the most active investor in AI in Q4’23, backing 9 AI startups. It was followed by KB Securities , NVIDIA, and Plug and Play Tech Center with 8 companies apiece, and then Lightspeed Venture Partners with 7.Great reading and thanks to CB Insights for this amazing report.Full Report - https://lnkd.in/dCiMSuJCMore power to startups and founders.Cheers.#venturecapital #funding #GenerativeAI #GenAI #Startups #Technology",9,2,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-02-27,"You can always pick this road.Ever feel tempted to broadcast every step of your journey? We've all been there. But sometimes, the most powerful moves happen in quiet focus, silently actually.Here's why hustling in silence might be the key to unlocking true fulfillment:1.  Focus breeds mastery: When you drown out the noise, you laser-focus on the craft. It's in those deep dives that skills are honed and breakthroughs occur.2.  Let results speak for themselves: Achievements carry more weight when they arrive as a surprise, a testament to your dedication, not self-promotion.3.  Avoid the comparison trap: Constant updates can feed negativity, making others' journeys seem more glamorous.Focus on your own path, celebrate wins privately.4.

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-01-27,"No Storm Lasts Forever: A Small Message on PerseveranceThis small message might change your perspective if you listen to it carefully, very carefully indeed. In the face of challenge, it's easy to feel lost in the clouds. The rain pummels down, the wind howls, and hope can seem like a distant flicker. But Kobe Bryant, Mamba himself, had a powerful message for those weathering life's storms: Keep Going.Watch this short video clip where Kobe reminds us that:Storms are inevitable: Challenges, setbacks, and failures are part of the journey. They test our resilience and build our character.Persistence is key: Giving up is easy, but it's in pushing through the darkness that we find the light. Every step forward, however small, is a victory.The sun always rises: No matter how long or intense the storm, it will eventually pass. Brighter days and calmer seas lie ahead.This message applies to all aspects of life:In work  > When deadlines loom and projects feel overwhelming, remember In business  > When market forces batter your venture, don't lose sight of your vision. Adapt, innovate, and weather the storm with grit and determination.In life  > When personal struggles cloud your path, hold onto Kobe's fighting spirit. Lean on loved ones, stay true to your values, and believe in your ability to overcome.So, the next time you find yourself in the eye of the storm, remember to take a deep breath, dig deep, and keep pushing forward. The sun will rise again, and the view from the other side will be breathtaking.Small caveat - Don't give up in the hustle.Feel free to share this with you peers, you never know who you end up inspiring today.Godspeed.#MentalHealth #Leadership #Startups #Motivation #Perseverance #NeverGiveUp #Resilience #Success",8,Comment,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-04-13,"Honestly, When was the last time you did this ?Hustlers, Just Breathe: Why It's Time to Sometimes Ditch The Survival Mode and Live Your Best LifeEntrepreneurs, founders, leaders – we wear the ""hustle"" badge with pride. But what if I told you there's a way to achieve greatness and live a life that's truly fulfilling? Yes, there is a way.Let's ditch the constant ""survival mode"" for something more.Here's the final on the face truth though: Constantly grinding burns you out. It hinders creativity, stifles innovation, and zaps your passion in the long run. You ask this from any successful, happy and persistent leader or super achievers, they shift gears and like how.So the million dollar question.So, how do we shift gears?-    Prioritize Rest & Recharge: Schedule breaks, delegate tasks, and disconnect when needed. A well-rested, mentally agile mind is a sharp mind, ready to tackle challenges with renewed vigour.-    Fuel Your Passions: Make time for activities that light you up, outside of work. It could be a hobby, spending time with loved ones, or simply getting lost in a good book.-    Embrace New Experiences: Step outside your comfort zone. Travel, learn a new skill, say ""yes"" to unexpected adventures. Fresh perspectives and inspiration fuel innovation in all aspects of life.-    Practice Gratitude: Focus on the good – your achievements, your team, the simple joys. Gratitude fosters a positive mindset, attracting more abundance and success.Here's what happens when you shift from surviving to thriving mode:1.  Enhanced Creativity: A recharged mind sparks brilliant ideas and innovative solutions.2.  Stronger Relationships: You become a more present and engaged leader, team player, and friend.3.  Sustainable Success: You build resilience and fuel the drive to keep pushing boundaries over the long haul.Small caveat as ever - Remember, leaders, hustlers, entrepreneurs, founders, you're not just building a business or a mode of living ; you're building a life. Don't wait for success to start living. So what do you do in a gist ?Embrace the journey, prioritize your mental well-being, and watch your potential soar like a herculean space ship.Pass on and share the positive vibes.Godspeed.#entrepreneurlife #leadership #growthmindset #mentalhealth #wellbeing #success #inspiration #breakthestigma #startups #founders",8,5,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-01-27,"Why Waiting for the Right Time Can Lead to Blossoming SuccessEver stare longingly at a rosebud, wishing it would hurry and bloom? Honestly, we've all been there, impatient for things to unfold exactly when we want them to. But here's the thing: sometimes, the most beautiful things happen in their own perfect time.Think of a seed buried deep underground. No amount of tugging will bring it to life. It needs the right temperature,moisture, and sunlight to crack through and unfurl its petals. Similarly, in life, work, and business, forcing things before they're ready can often lead to stunted growth or premature wilting.Impatience brings delusional pitstops.One more thing.Waiting for the right time isn't about passivity. It's about active preparation, mindful awareness, and trusting the rhythm of life. It's about:Cultivating the fertile ground: Just like the seed needs the right soil, we need to prepare ourselves with knowledge, skills, and experience. This is the time to learn, build resilience, and refine our ideas.Embracing the unpredictable dance: Life rarely follows our rigid scripts. Opportunities often show up disguised as detours, delays, or even closed doors. Letting go of expectations allows us to see the unexpected pathways and recognize the right opportunity when it truly arrives.Creating space for serendipity: Clinging to a specific path can blind us to unexpected blessings. By letting go of control, we open ourselves to chance encounters, hidden connections, and moments of inspiration that could lead to even greater possibilities than we imagined.Finding power in surrender: The tighter we grasp, the less influence we have. By trusting the natural flow of things, we free our energy for creative problem-solving, mindful preparation, and a more empowered response when the perfect moment emerges.Remember, waiting for the right time isn't about wasting time. It's about investing in ourselves, being open to the unexpected, and trusting that when the time is right, the universe will unfold its petals before you in all their glorious beauty.So, take a deep breath, release the tension, and watch the magic unfold. There is a small caveat though, be willing to be patient in the whole process.Godspeed.#mentalhealth #growthmindset #startups #patience #success #inspiration #leadership #founders",6,5,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-03-27,"Why cant these be emulated across the world ?How Green Corridors are Transforming Cities Imagine a city that's cooler, cleaner, and teeming with life. That's the reality for Medellín, Colombia, thanks to their innovative green corridors project. These corridors are networks of trees, plants, and vegetation strategically placed along roads and waterways. Here's why they're a game-changer:Temperature Tamers: Green spaces naturally cool their surroundings. Studies show Medellín's corridors have reduced average temperatures by up to 2°C - 4°!  This makes a huge difference for urban heat islands.Pollution Busters: Plants act as natural air filters, absorbing pollutants and releasing fresh oxygen. Breathe easier with every step!Biodiversity Boosters: Green corridors create habitats for birds, pollinators, and other wildlife, fostering a more vibrant ecosystem in the heart of the city.Wellbeing Winners: Studies suggest increased access to green spaces can improve mental and physical health. A happy and healthy city is a thriving city!Green corridors are a win-win for the environment and city dwellers.What other sustainable urban design ideas can we all explore?Have you seen green corridors implemented in your city or towns ?Do share your thoughts and tag someone who might influence to bring this into effect in your city or town.Godspeed.Narendra Modi Incredible India, Ministry of Tourism, India United Nations Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs #sustainability #urbangreening #climatechange #innovation #UNSDG",6,2,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-04-27,"Key Principles of Design That Your Should LearnDesign is all around us, from the physical products we use to the digital experiences we interact with every day. Great design has the power to inform, persuade, and delight. But what are the fundamental principles that underpin great design?This infographic shared highlights some of the essential principles of design:Balance: This refers to the arrangement of elements in a way that creates visual stability and harmony. There are three main types of balance: symmetrical, asymmetrical, and radial.Proportion: Proportion refers to the size and scale of elements relative to each other. Effective use of proportion creates a sense of order and hierarchy.Emphasis:  Emphasis is about drawing the viewer's attention to the most important part of a design. This can be achieved through various techniques such as contrast, color, and size.Contrast: Contrast refers to the juxtaposition of opposing elements. It can be used to create visual interest, hierarchy, and separation.Repetition: Repetition involves the use of similar elements throughout a design to create a sense of unity and rhythm.Motif:  A motif is a recurring element or pattern that adds visual interest and reinforces a design's concept.Rhythm: Rhythm is created through the repetition of elements or patterns at regular or irregular intervals. It can guide the viewer's eye through a design and create a sense of movement.Unity: Unity refers to the way all the elements in a design work together to create a cohesive whole.By understanding and applying these principles, founders, designers, and marketers can create more impactful and successful products, marketing campaigns, and user experiences.Pass it onGodspeed credit image; pinterest #designthinking #userexperience #design #engineeringdesign #creativity #startups #designinspiration #marketingstrategy",4,1,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-03-27,"Mighty change foreseen for board directors.The Economic Times, citing a study by Hunt Partners, AZB & Partners, and PwC. The survey findings show that around 83% of independent director appointments at BSE-200 firms and other large companies will be on the basis of ""digital and tech skills"". Cybersecurity and product development will be key for 70% and 50% appointments, respectively.For leaders to get into the boardroom getting digitally, technologically and product management savvy will be a key requirement.I feel data management, security which again is a part of cybersecurity will also be key which the studies also says.Beyond this IMHO leaders will have to be more of active hustlers in the boardroom to not only sketch out plans and strategies but also share how those can be done. Their understanding of online space with a digital prowess should be key to drive any plans.If you are a leader or an entrepreneur planning to extend your boardroom then I guess these are some of the key things you should have a look at.What has been your experience ?Feel free to agree to disagree :)#leadership #boardofdirectors #independentdirectors #digitaltransformation #techskills #cyberskills",1,2,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAC_QYoBIfb8UL2HbgiRbzHhMFNjtu34ojo&keywords=ravi%20kikan&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=8803ca92-00a2-41b3-bb5b-45a746d382d7&sid=pJ.&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Ravi Kikan,Male,2024-01-27,"When something goes wrong, there are people who are exceptionally good at figuring out the *reasons* why it went wrong.Those people are valuable.There are others who take responsibility for what went wrong -- even though it wasn't entirely their fault. They learn from whatever mistakes were made.They rally the team around a resolution and reduce the chances that the mistakes are repeated. Those people are priceless. Be one of those people.One of the most immaculate statements and thought process from Dharmesh Shah for building the right culture, team and growth mindset.
