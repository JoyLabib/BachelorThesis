He never heard of, or saw, Disney world. We took him and our family to Orlando for midwinter in January 2016. Through a close family friend, David Goldis, I was introduced to the Rabbi of the Chofetz Chaim community and spent that midwinter shabbos at their home. They told me about the issue with their small Yeshiva about to get thrown out of the building and together with 1,000 of you - my LinkedIn network - campaign was launched to help save that Yeshiva. In 45 days $1.855mm was put together and they were saved. I never dreamed that 7 years later I would be bringing my granddaughter for her first day of school while I am vacationing once again in Orlando. They were 59 student then and now they have 191 including my granddaughter!If you were one of the 1,000 please like and tag.

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-05-27,"Thank you God for bringing GPARENCY to this day!All of you were with me from day one - when this was just a dream - and as such I owe it to you to bring this industry changing news to you first. Within the last hour we just released the beta of two of the last three signature products which makes this a reality!These feature are for everyone in the commercial real estate space and, as per my last post, they are free! (Details in comments). If you are a broker, lender, service provider, or vendor and want me to introduce you to all of my clients then read down to the second feature. Feature 1:We understand that real estate investors often struggle with accessing information on deals they have come across in the past. It's common to hear statements like ""I know I saw that deal before, but I can't remember who sent it"" or ""I saw a deal in that area, but I forgot the address."" For the first time, we have a solution to this challenge. Our ""Map-based Acquisition Pipeline Management"" feature allows users to mark any commercial property on the map as a favorite and add notes. Users can then confidentially filter the map to only display their favorited deals, providing a comprehensive view of their real estate activities, such as deals passed on, offers made, and more. Additionally, every GP or LP can now view their schedule of real estate overlaid on a map with alerts.Feature 2:We have also addressed the need for investors to connect with individuals who possess in-depth knowledge of specific neighborhoods, while also providing an opportunity for lenders, brokers, vendors, and service providers to engage with investors/GP's. Our ""Movers and Shakers"" feature facilitates this connection by allowing vendors to mark their connections to a property and appear as a public contact for that property.Please help me pay it forward by liking this post and tagging a few people that you know in the CRE space that can benefit as an investor or vendor.",188,44,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI&keywords=ira%20zlotowitz&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=5b92b410-b505-477f-a2c0-4c74dbd5b9b1&sid=BOL&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-05-27,"LIGHTBULB MOMENT!Let me give you some background... As many know, my drive to pursue GPARENCY  was always focused on one end goal—not about the money or going public at a 100x return—but about how I could utilize technology to help organizations and give back. Even before GPARENCY's official launch, I envisioned how I could utilize the success to uplift others.I decided a few months ago I didn't want to wait for that milestone to embark on building some of those dreams. Thank God, GPARENCY is seeing continued momentum, and now is the time to start giving back! One of my big dreams was launching a Shidduch matchmaking app honoring the memories of my mother and the son of my Eastern Union cofounder Abraham Bergman. I reached out to Sholom Rubin from Forwardslash, a company collaborating closely with our internal team at GPARENCY with an idea to develop the Shidduch app. Recognizing the potential, he recommended connecting with Clark Valberg, the founder of InVision and current Managing Partner at Tiferes Ventures, who he believed would be highly interested in supporting this initiative and helping it take flight.Clark is an incredible and accomplished mind in business, but here's the catch: our initial meeting was not centered around business; rather, it was for charity. Although I typically live on Zoom USA, for charity work I felt compelled to meet Clark in person. Thank God we hit it off right away! I knew I would love to talk to him about GPARENCY, but I stuck with the matter at hand and decided to save it for another time. I proposed Clark also meet with my brother Rabbi Gedaliah Zlotowitz who took over Artscroll, and he was very interested in seeing if he could use his expertise to give back there as well. He came up with an idea on how Artscroll could enhance their current searches using AI while still staying within the confines of Jewish law with no errors. I once again was very impressed with his business acumen, but I left my questions on GPARENCY aside and focused on charity.The very next day, this past week, Clark arranged to have another meeting with me to learn more about GPARENCY and possibly investing (he is a VC). For charity and Artscroll, I met him in person. When it came to talking business, I went back to Zoom and connected with him and his COO at Tiferes Ventures Michael Rubin. I shared with him that we had finally perfected the mortgage side—we just had our best month yet with 120 new deal submissions in May alone, we're expanding rapidly, and the market has been following us. But I also expressed that I didn't see a clear path forward on how to roll out the technology and tools we have for investors.While doing a demo of the technology, the questions he asked and our back-and-forth brought instant clarity. It was a lightbulb moment! Not only did it become evident to me, but it also resonated with everyone on our GPARENCY team as we discussed it afterward.

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-12-27,"Shlomo Chopp owes $360!I had a chat with industry legend Shlomo Chopp, where we debated how tenants find space. We both agreed that while LoopNet and Crexi will always be major players, GPARENCY’s new leasing platform was game-changing, but on one point, Shlomo was skeptical: ""Retail tenants filling out a form?  Forget it!"" So, we made a friendly wager: $360 to a charity of my choice if even one tenant took the bait. Well, guess who's picking the cause now?Turns out, tenants love the one-and-done approach. No more endless searches, broker chases, or listing site battles. Our platform connects them with qualified landlords and their rep – boom! And the proof is in the (virtual) pudding:   • Launched beta 1 week ago, already...   • 3 NJ tenants on board!   • 4 ice cream parlors drowning in space offers (thanks for spreading the word!)So, LinkedIn fam, let's settle this wager! Tag a respected charity of your choice in the comments. The one with the most likes by Thursday midnight wins the $360! Only the first tag of each charity counts, duplicates don't win.Let's show the doubters the power of innovation, while giving back to a worthy cause. ❤️And to all the happy landlords and their leasing reps out there: GPARENCY is revolutionizing CRE leasing, and we're just getting started!

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-05-27,"A learning perspective regarding the trending  post about Syndicators and LP investing. I have read several posts and their back and forths comments. The most viral and vocal of them came from Judah Aderet Shimshi Kronglas Joseph Kahn and Eli Fried. LinkedIn has limits on characters in a post so I won’t be repeating it all here :)At the root they have amazing points and sentiments. The goal of this post is to share four concepts that we can all actually learn from and apply to future investments, and quite frankly, every business relationship we get involved with. 1. Investing with a trustworthy and quality syndicator is more important than a better deal. A bad deal with a good syndicator can potentially be saved. A good deal with a bad syndicator almost never works out. 2. My Dad always said that a person can deal with anyone if they know what they are advance. Spend a lot of time doing due diligence on the person and then make sure the agreement addresses any and all concerns that you heard. 3. Everybody has ulterior motives!! It is important that your motives align. A deal isn’t bad because a syndicator takes a huge upfront fee or a huge promote. Obviously, all else being even you want a syndicator that takes less all around. Sometimes a deal seems like a homerun and the syndicator wants, and IMHO is entitled to, more than the norm. However, if the LP is looking for a long term deal with upside then for that deal they should be investing with a syndicator that puts their fees towards the backend - even if the syndicator is taking a higher than normal split. 4. Our job is to do the hishtadlus (inputs) and God takes care of the success and outputs. Rabbi Berel Wein said (this quote is old as it uses the multiple of rent analogy instead of cap rate but still stands) a person that paid 12x rent and then the market crashed is just as smart as the person that paid 7x and sold for 9x. The difference is the Mazal of when God said the game is over. To trash a syndicator solely based on taking a floater is wrong. A value added deal that had major short term upside warranted a floating rate with a cap which most syndicators took. No one could’ve predicted when the music was going to stop.

I cover the basics of agency lending, what was changed, and how these changes benefit commercial real estate attorneys.Here are some of the benefits:Increased demand for legal services: As Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae encourage more clients to go direct, more borrowers will need to engage their attorneys earlier on in the transaction. Higher fees: Real estate attorneys can charge higher fees for complex transactions and for representing borrowers who are seeking direct loans from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.Increased visibility and reputation: Real estate attorneys who are experts in agency lending can position themselves as thought leaders in the industry and attract new clients.Where else do you see new any positive opportunities from these changes?Please tag a commercial real estate attorney that you know in the comments below![Link in comments to YouTube so you can watch on 2x]Jeffrey Zwick Chaim Zlotowitz, Esq.",85,26,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI&keywords=ira%20zlotowitz&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=5b92b410-b505-477f-a2c0-4c74dbd5b9b1&sid=BOL&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

This feature changes that and it is totally free plus it is overlaid on a map with public data on 35mm properties and sales and finance comps with listing brokers actively listing over 50,000 properties!Retail tenants can track their locations as well.

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2024-01-27,"This video is my number 1 sales advice (and you also can learn how to bowl 😃)!!!We can only control the “inputs” (hishtadlus) and God controls the “outputs” the results. Before you spend hours and thousands on learning how to sell be like Nike and Just Do it! By being like Nike I mean just get on calls and social media and START the process of origination and only focus on taking the first 2 steps. Every sales professional will tell you that some leads they thought were garbage became the best and others that looked good were total wastes of time. As such, keep focusing on the first steps of your process and plant as many seeds and then watch and wait for them to explode beyond your wildest dreams. I am taking this approach with the hiring at GPARENCY. As you know from my New Year’s resolution, I made a decision to keep the recruiting on even though I hit my goal of hiring 100 brokers. As I told you, 21 of the first 100 brokers didn’t show up.  So right of the bat, had I stopped the recruiting, I would be at only 79 brokers and over time there are natural dropouts. By keeping the spigot on I still have 100 brokers and there are a couple of superstars within the last 21 and, God willing, in about 2 months when the real time comes for each of them to produce we will explode because we will always be a full 100 strong!How do you apply the video into your situation?",83,24,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI&keywords=ira%20zlotowitz&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=5b92b410-b505-477f-a2c0-4c74dbd5b9b1&sid=BOL&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-10-27,"Commercial Real Estate Market PredictionBased on history and conversations with senior banking and CRE professionals, I believe the following actions and timing will trigger an uptick in commercial real estate transactions:*Banks will offset some of their massive Q3 earnings by taking paper losses in Q4 on their CRE portfolios by writing down valuations.*Since revenue is up at the banks, they will be hailed as being prudent and doing the right thing by marking to market, and they won't get penalized for showing these paper losses.*Then, sometime between Q2 and Q4 of next year, they will start selling the paper at slightly higher prices than their current write-down valuations, so that the sale will be an actual realization of profits.Once this happens, the floodgates of dealmaking will open up.Please like and comment with what do you think?",63,22,4,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI&keywords=ira%20zlotowitz&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=5b92b410-b505-477f-a2c0-4c74dbd5b9b1&sid=BOL&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-07-27,"Thank you, God! I am thrilled beyond words to announce that our incredible GPARENCY community has reached a significant milestone: 10,000 users!In celebrating this achievement, I can't help but reflect on the personal journey I've undergone since launching GPARENCY in 2021.Since then, with God's help, we've eliminated the barrier to entry in commercial real estate and empowered people to find, finance, underwrite, and track their deals for free.While some may see 10,000 users as ""small,"" I see it as a powerful stepping stone on the path to 100,000 users—and it reminds me of a story my father used to tell.Whenever someone told him that things were ""so far, so good,"" my father would recount this story about a man who jumped off the top of the Empire State Building. As he passed the 70th floor on his way down, a window washer asked him how he was doing, and he replied, ""So far, so good!""It was always a powerful reminder that appearances can be deceiving, and we can't take our current progress for granted or assume that success will come effortlessly. Instead, we must remain vigilant, adaptable, and committed to continuously improving our product or service.Every single user represents an integral part of our success story—a connection, a story, and a positive impact on their lives. And to me, that is priceless.This milestone was only possible because of the unwavering dedication of our team and the overwhelming support from all of you.

One can pray and only mention spiritual things and others can pray and mention all of the mundane. As I say in my yearly Yom Kippur message, my Dad would point out that on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year, in the holy place of the Beit Hamikdash (temple), in the holy of holies, one would think that his prayer would only be about spiritual things.

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-07-27,"You must adapt!!!!As the eternal optimist, I was holding back from posting this article and recent similar ones appearing in The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, and others. I was forwarded this New York Post article (link in comments) from a very prominent commercial real estate professional and I felt the need to share this. There is a famous top selling book called Who Moved My Cheese. The book describes two executives, one that stayed in the loop of all the changes in the world and the other that felt safe in the company he was at. After 25 years they both got laid off. The first person had no issue getting a new job and the second is stilll looking. I keep talking about technology and AI. I will repeat what I posted almost a year ago, AI WILL NOT REPLACE ANYONE! HOWEVER, THOSE USING AI WILL REPLACE THOSE THAT ARE NOT! My advice to my network is to start embracing every technology. The less experienced employee using AI is more advanced than the senior executive who is not - no question!!!What is exasperating the situation even more is that with remote work, the gig economy is taking off even more to the point that companies can hire consultants and vendors for many targeted skillsets vs keeping a top tier person on house that is a Jack of all trades. For example, at GPARENCY, we have the most amazing marketing coordinator and every other marketing role is outsourced to people and firms with specific talents and the team is working out amazingly with incredible results. Take this as a positive wake up call to adapt, then with God’s help each of you will be better off than you were before.

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-08-27,"🚀 Food for Thought! 🤔These musings have been swirling in my mind, and watching this video crystallized my perspective.When I entered the world of Commercial Real Estate, one fundamental lesson stood out: single-family home ownership and rentals at scale rarely lead to substantial profits. The reasoning was simple - if one tenant faced a financial setback or your property needed a major repair, your income could plummet. Conversely, with a 10-unit property, you could weather the storm of a problematic tenant or significant expense.However, the game changed with the rise of technology, Airbnb, and the power of social media. Suddenly, connecting with essential vendors for buying, managing, and renting these homes became seamless. The shift from monthly to daily rentals significantly boosted net income, even if cash flow at times seemed tight.But now, as the outlook for property values dims and rental growth stalls, the scenario presented in this video seems increasingly plausible. It's quite likely that we'll witness a surge of homes hitting the market.I'm eager to hear the insights and thoughts from my incredible network. What are your views on this evolving landscape?",55,22,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI&keywords=ira%20zlotowitz&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=5b92b410-b505-477f-a2c0-4c74dbd5b9b1&sid=BOL&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-07-27,"How is the advancement of technology, and AI in particular, affecting your industry and business?There are more pictures being taken than ever before. The change is that 90% are taken on a phone or digital camera and using editing apps that any amateur can use on their phone. The last 10% is reserved for those special occasions and life moments when they still use special cameras and professional photographers. Similarly in the brokerage industry, there will always be brokerage firms. As clients have better access to data and technology, the way we utilize and pay for these services is what is changing. Furthermore, I am finding that more and more brokers are realizing it is more about them than what firm they are part of and they are only staying at firms that allow the splits to go north of 70% in the broker’s favor.

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2024-01-27,"400 applicants applied yesterday to be commercial mortgage brokers at GPARENCY -  can use your perspective!As you know, my New Year’s resolution was that I won’t shut off the hiring spigot when I hit the 100 broker mark. Instead we would lower the spigot to ensure that we stay above the watermark. We noticed that we were starting to dip below the  100 mark so two nights ago we turned the spigot on. Last night, while flying to the National Multifamily Housing Council I was sitting next to a top HUD lender at Greystone talking to him about our expansion as well as our new agency direct product and I opened our proprietary recruiting app to show him the process and saw that we would be hitting 400 new applicants just for yesterday!!! What is interesting about the recent group is that they are very diverse, spread throughout the country, their average age is probably in their high 30’s, most have some to very strong real estate experience. Interestingly, a few are currently syndicators and top real estate listing brokers that want to capitalize on the fact that we now have a full fledged conventional mortgage broker product where we pay our brokers 80% of that full commission and they can offer their network another product and revenue stream. It is the morning after and I am still blown away by the numbers - we advertised in the same spots -  and would love to hear if anyone has a perspective as to why the surge in interest?",46,15,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI&keywords=ira%20zlotowitz&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=5b92b410-b505-477f-a2c0-4c74dbd5b9b1&sid=BOL&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-07-27,"God decided that the music has to stop!!!My last posts and all its comments reminds me about the one and only real estate parable my father (in blessed memory) would say over from Rabbi Berel Wein. Rabbi Wein would say that if someone buys a building for 1x the income and then flips it for 2x the income and then that person flips it for 3x the income and over the next couple over years it keep moving up and then after someone buys it for 14x the income the market crashes. Now the building is worth 8x the income. Is the person that bought it for 13x and sold it for 14x smarter than the person that bought it for 14x and had to sell it for 8x?NO! God decided that the music is over and the cycle kicked in after 14x. As an orthodox Jew our job is to do the inputs (hishtadlus) and God takes care of the outputs. As such, you can’t just buy or sell because everyone else is just buying and selling at certain prices. However, if a person did their due diligence then the end result will be decided by God. As the eternal optimist and believer in people, I would like to believe that 80%+ of all syndicators did the proper due diligence.

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-09-27,"Prediction: SFR and Airbnb Owners Will Start Selling Like Crazy and causing home values to drop even more!For the same root reason as the article points out, I predict that many single-family rental (SFR) and Airbnb owners will start selling like crazy and directly to end users.Real estate used to be about bricks and mortar and slow and steady wealth building. However, over the last 25 years, and especially in the last 7 years, with the advent of technology, social media, and real estate becoming an accepted investment asset, it has turned into a financial engineering mechanism that saw values rise as interest rates dropped and rents increased faster than inflation.On the commercial and multifamily side, which is much more driven by the above factors and where almost all buyers are real estate investors, we are now seeing lower values and much less deal volume as rent growth slows and interest and cap rates rise.On the 1-4 side, you have end users like you and me who buy because we want to live here, not because it is a good investment, plus investors who buy to get a good cash-on-cash return plus the big pop when they sell.As such, what used to be fix-and-flips to end users turned into fix-and-flips to investors and end buyers.However, now that home values seem to be flat and maybe trending down, these investors realize that they are at the peak from a cash flow and value perspective. If rents stay flat, then every new capital expense affects the bottom line and they won't be able to make it up when they sell since the pricing is flat. This cycle will cause more SFR investors to start selling, which will also affect the total number of Airbnb rentals available as their revenues should potentially drop.On the positive side, those that do still hold on as rentals might get a little higher rents than now, but that won't help the values when they sell.What do you think?#RealEstate #HousingMarket #SFR #Airbnb",37,31,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI&keywords=ira%20zlotowitz&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=5b92b410-b505-477f-a2c0-4c74dbd5b9b1&sid=BOL&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

I want to give you the opportunity to not just be a part of GPARENCY's journey, but to have a stake in the company you helped grow. I am excited to extend to you the investment opportunity outlined below before we conclude this funding round.Here is a summary of the email I sent to GPARENCY's investors last week:I wanted to follow up on my recent email (https://bit.ly/48bwbDW) and let you know that I'm personally investing an additional $125,000 in this round, in addition to the $750,000 investment from Abe and myself a few weeks ago. My confidence in this opportunity has only grown.This round is particularly unique because it's the last chance to leverage potential QSBS benefits and secure a liquidation preference on your capital. Personally, I'm using this opportunity to allocate funds in my children's names.As you saw in last week's email update, thank God, GPARENCY is thriving despite the challenges in the commercial real estate market. Our site traffic and membership signups have continued to grow. This is despite of a slow real estate market, which has negatively affected the number of people signing up for mortgage brokerage type services. The signs point to an even more substantial market exit than originally projected.In light of this, before I open the end of this round to the broader market, I've set aside $2mm l to reconnect with you and a select group of my initial investors. This will give you the opportunity to join me in this round and to be a part of something I believe in so strongly.I'd love to hear your thoughts on participating in this round before we open it to the broader market. Personally, it would mean a lot to me if you could consider an additional investment of between $25,000 to $250,000.I'm eager to receive your timely and positive response, and I'm excited about the potential we have to achieve great things together!This is not intended to be an offer or solicitation to purchase or sell any security.

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-12-27,"Would love your honest opinion on the topic of college. (After going back and forth with Google Bard we settled on this version of the post 😀)Recent revelations surrounding elite colleges have ignited a critical discussion about the value proposition of higher education, particularly within these institutions.Post ChatGPT's launch, I predicted that advancing AI would challenge the necessity of traditional college degrees, except for specialized fields like law or medicine. I envisioned alternative pathways, such as on-the-job training and online learning platforms, rising to prominence.This perspective contrasted sharply with my upbringing. Both my parents, a Rabbi and an early childhood educator, instilled the importance of education in me - they both had college degrees!When I initially voiced my prediction, the primary objection revolved around the irreplaceable ""network and branding"" effect of an elite degree. However, the recent issues at elite colleges have left parents of college-aged students disillusioned. With the prestige of these institutions in question, alternative options like on-the-job training and certificate programs are gaining traction, even offered by many colleges themselves.This begs the question: Is college still the essential stepping stone to success in today's world? Or are we entering an era where adaptability and lifelong learning will surpass the value of a prestigious degree? Join the conversation!

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2023-09-27,"Never Realized the Surcharge from Uber Eats!This morning, I was telling a family member that I was going to Krispy Kreme. He told me that it was cheaper to pay the small Uber Eats fee than the cost of gas and the 10 minutes of driving each way. I didn't mind the ride and wanted the added Krispy Kreme smell, so I went ahead and drove myself.When I got back, I asked my family member to place the same order on Uber Eats just to see what the difference would be. The order came out to $40 plus a service fee, while I had only paid $29 at the store. That's a crazy difference!I'm sure many of us have used Uber eats or other food delivery apps at some point, but I don't think most people realize how much the surcharge can be. In this case, the total surcharge was over 50%!I showed this post to Google Bard and it added the rest…So, next time you're thinking about ordering food delivery, be sure to compare the prices to the cost of picking it up yourself. You might be surprised at how much you can save.Any other ideas?One way to save money on food delivery is to join a membership program like Uber One. Uber One members get free delivery on select orders over $15. You can also save money by ordering from restaurants that offer their own delivery service. Many restaurants offer lower delivery fees than Uber Eats and other third-party delivery apps.Another way to save money on food delivery is to order in bulk. If you know you're going to be ordering from a certain restaurant on a regular basis, consider placing a large order and storing the leftovers for later. This can save you money on both the food and the delivery fees.Finally, don't forget to tip your delivery driver! Delivery drivers work hard to get your food to you hot and fresh, so it's important to show your appreciation. A 20% tip is a good starting point.",30,9,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI&keywords=ira%20zlotowitz&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=5b92b410-b505-477f-a2c0-4c74dbd5b9b1&sid=BOL&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Are you looking for the best way to get banks to list their “notes” through you? Look no further! According to a my recent LinkedIn survey, over 80% of participants believe that the 10-year trend will remain steady or increase. This means that more borrowers and lenders are realizing that many loans won’t be able to be refinanced out of the mess, resulting in an uptick of foreclosures and note sales. My video explains why many real estate brokers are getting involved in the debt side and why those with in-house debt shops are not just referring deals over but staying involved. Please tag a commercial real estate broker in your market who is looking to buy notes. For those real estate brokers that want to get involved in the debt side but don’t have a direction, please look at the link in the comments about how to become a “broker affiliate” with GPARENCY and earn money on the debt side while having an in with the lenders.

As such I looked into the reason why volume is picking up even though rates have spiked back up and the feedback is consistent. Borrowers and lenders alike are starting to feel more and more that these rates, as Michael Comparato called it are “high forever.”*As such, waiting doesn't benefit you with lower rates, but it can be detrimental to value. Currently, foreclosures haven't significantly increased, but when they do, property values will likely drop. Therefore, financing now allows borrowers to secure the best rates and highest valuations.

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2024-02-27,"Please read the post before taking the pollWhile no lone knows where rates are going, everyone in real estate or business has to make decisions based on where they believe the 10 year Tbill is going. As I mentioned in previous posts, while it is hard for anyone individual to actually be able to peg where rates are going, as a group our “collective wisdom” should be very close to being right. What triggered this post is that in the last 45 days, GPARENCY brought in almost 70 new loan submission and we already converted 12 of them. It got me thinking as to why the extra quick spike in new volume and converting of deals. My thoughts are the following:In CRE it is really important to have a belief about rates because while in the past I saw so many people have this wishful thinking that rates will go down I am sensing that more and more are coming around that the range we are currently in is the best and lowest to expect. If that is true, then transactions will continue to pick up because those that have to refi will do it now without waiting and those that can’t refi will make the move to sell.

Initially, our client believed that their existing DUS relationship offered the only viable agency options. We opened their eyes to the diverse terms and unique benefits available through different DUS shops. By employing a strategic approach, we enabled them to enjoy direct engagement advantages while we expertly packaged the deal, delivering the best of both worlds.The results were outstanding! We prepared the initial package for our client to submit directly, managing everything else discreetly from behind the scenes. This method allowed the client to benefit directly while still leveraging our competitive brokerage edge. By finding an agency with superior financing rates, we secured:🔍 Creation of competition and securing a new lender at a lower rate spread.💰 New loan closed with proceeds 7% over the initially app'd amount.⏱️ Closed in under 45 days.💵 Total fee to the client ONLY $4,500.To further cater to our client's needs, within the flat $4,500 fee, we also presented the deal to CMBS and other competitive local banks.

Ira Zlotowitz,Male,2024-04-06,"My Three Criteria For Success in Early-Stage Companies(The third one will surprise you!)This is from an email I received this morning from Marc Randolph. Absolutely a jem! Would love your thoughts in comments. I’ve been a part of starting six companies. I’ve mentored several dozen founding teams.  I’ve invested in more than 100 early-stage companies, and I’ve heard countless pitches.  All of that has given me a finely tuned sense of the factors that really matter for the success of an early-stage company. Here are my top three (in order): 1. The Team2. The Team3. The Team  Hopefully this comes as no great surprise (well, maybe that third one does). And if it does, then let me explain for a minute why your team matters more than everything else combined.  When you’re in your early stages, there are a lot of unknowns, and plenty of elements that are guaranteed to change. Your initial product is just a hunch, you don’t have product/market fit, and you’re basically guessing about pricing, go-to-market, and customer type. Eventually, you’re going to realize that the only constant is your team.  What really matters at this stage isn’t what you’re making, or how well-funded you are. Instead, it’s all about execution, flexibility, and persistence. And that all depends on the quality of your team.  Not only that, but you’ll also realize that employee talent works on a power-curve: the best people are not just marginally better than average…they are many orders of magnitude better. So while my “Top Three” list is obviously tongue-in-cheek, my belief in the importance of talent isn’t. And if you’re curious, I’ve put together another (more genuine) list, of the Top Six Ways I go about attracting and retaining the best possible talent:  1. Interview for what you expect someone to accomplish for you, rather than just reviewing what they accomplished elsewhere. My friend Patty McCord used to suggest picturing what every new hire will have accomplished a year from now, then imagining all the things they would have to do—and the skills they would need—to get there. 2. Be thoughtful about why someone may want to come work for you. The best people are not motivated by money, title, or perks. They want to be excited about what they are building and the role they will play in building it. 3. Exceptional people put a premium on working with other exceptional people. This requires that you not only hire well, but cut smartly. It means taking the “no jerks” policy seriously, even for high-performing jerks.  4. A high-performing team needs a manager that they respect. A good manager’s job is not to make decisions for their team (or worse, review decisions). It’s to make sure that the right people are in the right seats, and that everyone has the information and context to make great decisions on their own. And after that, their job is to clear away roadblocks.Last two in comments.",17,6,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAACLh-UBAabHGjZ6tXgzeFeDFY3RKkQxljI&keywords=ira%20zlotowitz&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=5b92b410-b505-477f-a2c0-4c74dbd5b9b1&sid=BOL&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Currently, the tenant's journey is quite cumbersome. They must visit multiple listing sites like LoopNet  and Crexi browse available spaces, fill out forms for each site and specific space, or contact brokers directly and wait for a response.But why should tenants go through all that trouble? Why isn't there a platform that streamlines the process, eliminating the need for tenants to waste time searching through listings? Instead, they could fill out a single, comprehensive form, and all relevant landlords and brokers would receive that lead.Don’t agree there is an issue with the current way?Please take this quick survey and let us know which option you prefer: Option 1: Traditional Tenant Journey-Tenants search for spaces on multiple listing sites-Tenants fill out forms on each site and for each specific space-Tenants contact brokers directly and wait for a responseOption 2: Streamlined Tenant Experience-Tenants fill out a single comprehensive form-Relevant landlords and brokers receive the lead Your feedback will help us create a more efficient and user-friendly platform for tenants.

Now that it seems that rates started to hover, many people got comfortable with these new rates and value. When rates drop, more people can afford the values plus some current homeowners that weren’t selling will now sell because they wont mind giving up their lower rates as much because the newer rates aren’t as high as yesterday.

With certain exceptions, historically, as the stock market rises people sell their treasuries bonds and buy more stocks. This causes the bond prices to drop and the interest rates, which are inversely effected,  go up. When stocks go down the opposite happens. Basically, it is a fight for your money. When the stock market is going up and you feel secure, you would rather invest in the market so the yield on the treasuries have to go up to get you to keep your money in bonds. With that said, if you voted the stock market up then count on higher rates. Remember when you read in the paper that the feds are dropping rates, that has direct correlation to treasuries.
