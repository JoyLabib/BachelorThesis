Jake Karls,Male,2024-04-13,"From almost bankrupt to profitable… Mid-Day Squares is finally in the BLACK.Today is a special day for us. After working hard for 5.5 years, we've reached two big goals: - We had our highest sales month ever, - We finally started making a profit. It has been a painful 5.5 years, to say the least.Lots of uncertainty:We had many moments where we almost gave up, Facing tough times and nearly going bankrupt. But our team stayed strong under pressure. Many people doubted us, common statements people made:“This isn’t going to work.”“Too risky of business.”“The world doesn’t need another chocolate bar.”“You’re wasting your money and others.”The noise didn’t matter, we kept believing in ourselves. We made promises to each other, to our community, and to our investors… Today, is a testament to keeping those promises. This is just the beginning; We still have many challenges/headwinds ahead, But we're ready to face them straight on.Shoutout to the entire Mid-Day Squares team for all your work.Shoutout to our CFO/COO Vanessa Olivia Palumbo CPA,CGA,EMBA for executing and getting it done.The road to $100 million continues. #cpg #profitable #entrepreneurship",1628,199,8,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM&keywords=jake%20karls&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=0a9217c2-208d-439e-9c73-893af792b480&sid=s0L&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Jake Karls,Male,2023-10-27,"We Need To Do Better In Canada… We need to invest in our local entrepreneurs early on.65% of jobs in Canada come from small businesses. If we invest in our own we can build a powerful ecosystem here in Canada.We have raised 17 million dollars to grow Mid-Day Squares.80% of our investors come from the USA. 20% of our investors come from Canada. This was not by choice… We’re based in Montreal, Quebec.We built our factory/HQ here in Montreal.Our business (revenue) breakdown today is 60% USA and 40% Canada.I share this because:Early on, very few investors in Canada would even look at us.We were told by investors “You’re too small and risky.” This forced us to have to go south to the USA and find partners…And we found amazing partners… Size and risk was not an issue. These investors believed in a big vision and wanted to take a chance.We’re grateful for both our CDN and USA investors…But, it makes me sad that it was so hard to find capital here in our home country.Today, I make a pledge that as soon as I have the capital and resources,I will devote them to investing and helping Canadian and Quebec entrepreneurs!I will make it my mission to help entrepreneurs from here.Canada has so many great small businesses that never see the global arena due to capital restrictions.

Jake Karls,Male,2024-02-27,"Celebrating Our 5th Anniversary Together… And 350,000 bars sold in under 5 years, in 6 stores. Stuart and I have been dancing for 5 years straight. For those of you who don’t know Stuart, he’s a legend.He takes care of our account at the retailer: Les Marches TAU !He makes doing business really fun. He’s also unapologetically himself. I try to hand deliver to him his order weekly, And everytime I do it, we do a dance show together.We celebrate our friendship and business partnership. We create momentum. Also, shoutout to Marche Tau for being an epic partner. In 5 years, we managed to sell 350,000 bars in their 6 stores.That is equivalent to 18 sold out NHL stadiums (in terms of people/bar). They believed in us 5 years ago, and they continue to believe in us.  When partnerships are a 2 way road, everyone WINS (retailer, brand and customer).

Jake Karls,Male,2024-03-27,"5 Years Ago Today… An Old Friend Asked Me: What’s new in your life?I replied: I just launched a chocolate bar company.He then responded: “Lol, no… What do you actually do? Like your day job?”I replied:” I just told you... I started a chocolate bar company.”He looked at me as if I was not NORMAL…He didn’t believe it was possible to win. He reminded me that the world doesn’t need another bar.5 years later… It’s still not normal, some may even say insane. But it’s slowly starting to working, in 5 years we have:- Sold 30+ million bars.- Took our gross margin from -18% to 58%. - Went from hand making bars in our condo, to building a chocolate bar factory that can make 90,000 bars per day.- USA sales went from 5% to 70% of our business in 2 years.- Our PB flavour became number one selling (U/S/W) in our category across 2 countries (Canada/USA).- Launched 4 successful innovative products with a 5th one coming soon.In the end, I decided to ship him a box of the bars, He absolutely loved them. He’s now a fan of the brand and someone who helps us a lot.Moral: Block out the noise, don’t get shook up by people who may not believe.

Jake Karls,Male,2024-03-27,"1 year ago, I had a nervous breakdown…Now let me tell you how I know that when someone says they gave 110%, They're not necessarily just bad at math.Because this week is the first anniversary of the day that wrecked me.Not almost wrecked me. Really wrecked me.I was at Natural Products Expo West. It's a trade show, but it's like the Super Bowl for the CPG industry: 60,000 to 80,000 people show up.Every year, it's where I wave our flag. As the company's hype man, it's where I shine.I yell. I scream. I dance. I meet everyone. And I have 110%. The thing is, you've only ever got 100%.Last year at this time,Halfway through the show, I collapsed. Physically. I burned out. Pretty much literally.I have an old hockey injury that always hurts, and I lost the mental capacity to hold that pain.I lost the mental capacity to deal with any of the things I need to deal with in my life;Some of my insecurities. The fear of failure. The anxiety.It all just fell on me.I flew home, and took a 37 day SABBATICAL.I didn't care to see my friends. I didn't care to see my family. I didn't care about my business. I couldn't bring myself to care enough about anything to get out of bed.I saw a therapist every one of those days.I got better.A year later, I'm probably back to about 90%.I'm back at the Expo, and I had so much fun!!Truth is; I learned I am not unstoppable. That I can't just go and go and go forever. 100% is 100%. You can't give any more without serious fallout. And you can lose it all with the snap of a finger.LFG Mid-Day Squares.#expowest2024 #naturalproductsexpowest #cpg #mentalhealth #entrepreneurship #entrepreneur #founder #sales #retail",1031,136,5,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM&keywords=jake%20karls&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=0a9217c2-208d-439e-9c73-893af792b480&sid=s0L&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Jake Karls,Male,2024-04-06,"Canada, we must do better...We need to prioritize investing in our local entrepreneurs from the outset.Small businesses account for 65% of jobs in Canada. If we channel our investments into our own entrepreneurs, We can build a robust ecosystem right here in our country.Consider this:80% of our investors come from the USA, With only 20% originating from Canada. Montreal, Quebec is home and we have established our factory and headquarters here.Our revenue breakdown stands at 75% from the USA and 25% from Canada.Why am I sharing this? Because initially, Canadian investors were hesitant to even entertain us. We repeatedly heard, ""You're too small and risky."" Consequently, we had no choice but to seek support south of the border, Where we found enthusiastic partners undeterred by size or risk. These investors embraced our ambitious vision and were eager to seize the opportunity.While we're grateful for the support from both our Canadian and American investors, It's disheartening that accessing capital was such a challenge in our own backyard.Today, I pledge that when I have the means, I will dedicate them to investing in and supporting Canadian and Quebecois entrepreneurs.

Jake Karls,Male,2023-12-27,"I Helped A Competitor Of Ours Win Yesterday… Abundance Mindset Is Critical To Winning. The game doesn’t have to be a zero sum game. Yesterday, I was shopping for groceries and saw both: Mid-Day Squares & Perfect Snacks merchandising wasn’t great in the store. The impression it gave wasn’t great. This is the second time this has happened in a month. So I decided to fix both of our merchandising. There’s plenty of room for everyone to win (It’s a big pie). Why is merchandising so important?- Visual appeal speaks volume for a brand.- First impressions can be a deciding factor for a consumer.- Navigational ease: Simplifies the shopping experience. Makes it easier to find.- Impulse buying magic: When it looks good, people discover more. - Boosts sales: An attractive presentation encourages customers to explore and, ultimately, make more purchases.- Brand Loyalty: Beyond products, consumers connect with experiences. A well-merchandised store contributes to positive brand experiences, fostering long-term relationships.When a set looks good everyone wins.

So, when they suggested the roadshow, involving 13 days of rigorous sampling sessions spanning 10-12 hours each day, We embraced it wholeheartedly. Our team was fired up. The essence of the ground game cannot be overstated. I've always been a staunch advocate for the power of personal engagement, of showing up and being present.Those long days spent in the aisles of Costco, face-to-face with members, have been invaluable. It's through this in person approach that we've connected with Costco's membership base.The significance of the ground game extends far beyond our Costco endeavor. Whether you're an entrepreneur, a salesperson, or a politician, The principle holds true. While grand strategies and high-level maneuvers have their place, they are meaningless without a solid ground game. Ultimately, success hinges on genuine connections with people. Without that, making a sale—or winning support—is an uphill battle.",673,77,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM&keywords=jake%20karls&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=0a9217c2-208d-439e-9c73-893af792b480&sid=s0L&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

When we started, selling a million bars felt out of reach.Entrepreneurship isn't all that glamorous:- It's a daily grind with no guarantee. - I've contemplated quitting many times.- Always one mistake away from the entire dream collapsing.- Loneliness and depression creep into the journey often. - Constantly judged and misunderstood by others. - Rejection and failure becomes your best friend. But today, we've hit a milestone, And no words can explain how we feel.The adrenaline rush and feeling of momentum is unparalleled.

Jake Karls,Male,2024-01-27,"I live on the road 50% of the year… Last year alone, I took 120 flights for work.People always ask me: “why do you travel so much?” My response: Canada’s entrepreneurship has steadily fallen since the early 2000's. Small business is the foundation and lifeblood of Canada’s economy. With less interest and trial in entrepreneurship and innovation, Canada might slowly start to fall behind on the global level.Entrepreneurship isn’t for everyone and that’s okay! But there’s lots of folks in Canada who want to take that plunge but are afraid to take the first step.That’s why I give these talks, keynotes, host meet & greets...To bring together Canadians across the nation and inspire them to:Believe in themselves, take risks and be unapologetically themselves… My mission is to get Canada rocking again, And most importantly to ignite momentum and boldness into our culture.

Jake Karls,Male,2023-10-27,"Yesterday, I Felt Deeply Depressed, Lonely & Unmotivated…Literally Felt Like Throwing In The Towel.No energy or momentum.  So I did some deep thinking last night, asking myself: Why do I feel like this? The first thought that came to mind was: I am deeply exhausted.70 flights this year, 40 keynotes, 7 college tours (teaching 20 classes),  20 retail meetings, 15 press interviews, 25 podcasts & 30 investor meet ups.Definitely tiring. But it wasn’t that… All of those experiences are me living my purpose & my why:“To go out and spread positivity, make people feel something deeply and,Show that you win by being unapologetically yourself.”So I did some more deep thinking.I realized that I have skipped THERAPY sessions for the last 5 weeks. I made excuses to skip them “too busy, too tired or I am traveling”. So this is what happened to me when I stopped working on myself. I started feeling depressed. Consistency is everything and working on yourself is a forever investment. Today, I am back in therapy for a session… I am excited 🙂All in all, therapy allows me to clear my mind, think clearly and execute.

Jake Karls,Male,2023-09-27,"Today, I Checked Off 2  Items From My Bucket List:I had the privilege of being featured on not one, but two billboards:A digital billboard: At the iconic Nasdaq in Times Square, NYC.A traditional, old-school billboard: Right on my college campus.This year, I had the  fortune of seeing both of these come to life.For as long as I can remember, I've admired those who were featured on billboards. Because most of the time, they were inspiring people.To be completely honest, I never believed that I would find myself on one. I never thought I was ""worthy"" or ""good enough"".The experience of being on the Nasdaq billboard was undeniably cool. But what really fires me up is the billboard on my college campus this month, And here's why:- I wasn't the most academically gifted student during my college days; My grades were below average and I struggled. - I never imagined I would receive an invitation to return to my alma mater.On October 19th, I have the honour of going back to Western University To deliver a talk on entrepreneurship. My mission is clear: I want to ignite a spark in the hearts of these students. I want to show them that taking risks is not just an option but a pathway to greatness.

Jake Karls,Male,2024-02-27,"We were interviewed on CP24 Breaking News Today… Canada’s largest morning show. Millions of Canadians start their morning with this show. We were asked to come on to discuss the state of entrepreneurship in Canada. Over the last 20 years, entrepreneurship is down 60% in Canada. The entrepreneurial spirit is down. Canadians feel like it’s more risky than ever to start a business. Small business is the foundation and lifeblood of Canada’s economy. With less excitement, opportunity and trial in entrepreneurship, Canada might slowly start to fall behind on the global level.Our mission is to get Canada’s momentum back. To inspire more Canadians to take the risk and try. We will continue to get out there to encourage Canadians to:Believe in themselves and to be unapologetic.

I didn’t make it past the 1st interview in any of them. I got rejected and felt like a loser. In my head all I was thinking was that I was a “failure.”On top of that, all of my friends got their dream jobs. The pressure I felt to “fit in” was crazy. To be fair, I was failing school (had horrible grades), And I showed up to the interview not in a suit.  I thank them all for not hiring me, Because the rejection is what got me curious about entrepreneurship.I had no choice but to figure it out and I did.

Jake Karls,Male,2024-03-27,"My siblings all became entrepreneurs… One of my favorite quotes ever is from Teddy Roosevelt:“There is no effort without error and shortcoming.”There are more famous lines from that same speech from more than 100 years ago, But that's the heart of it for me.It’s why it’s so tough to be an entrepreneur, or anyone on your own. And it’s why you need people in your corner.I’m lucky. I founded this company with my sister and her husband. And our brother is also an entrepreneur (his company’s called Wilder Toys, which he founded in Montreal in 2019).This is something that 99% of people don’t even attempt. And of that 1%, most fail. We all fail. I’ve failed.And when you fail doing something like this, it’s like getting injured doing backflips on a snowboard. People will be sorry you got hurt, but somewhere, they’re saying, What did he expect?You need people who feel it with you. The risk-takers and backflippers. People who know “great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end of the triumph of high achievement,and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.”I’m lucky. But you don’t have to be lucky. You don’t need family members who get it. But you do need your people. LinkedIn is actually a pretty good place to find them. Or maybe at school. Or a trade show.But you need to find them. They’ll be the ones who get it when you’re sad. When you fall on your face. When everyone else is saying, “Of course.”You need what Teddy Roosevelt called “the man in the arena” in that same speech. Someone who risks it all, every day.Someone who gets it.Someone like you.#family #entrepreneurship",498,64,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM&keywords=jake%20karls&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=0a9217c2-208d-439e-9c73-893af792b480&sid=s0L&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Jake Karls,Male,2023-11-27,"Dear Canada, We Must Do Better…   Over the last week I have gone on tour across Canada.Giving keynotes about entrepreneurship, storytelling & authenticity. Hosting meetups and gatherings with hundreds of local Canadian entrepreneurs.In the last 2 weeks, I went to Saskatoon, Toronto, Windsor, Winnipeg & Montreal. The common theme and conversation among all of these amazing entrepreneurs is:They have a very difficult time finding capital early on here in Canada. They can’t get early funding to scale their innovation. “Too risky and too early.”The danger of this is that:- We will lose out on the potential of innovation being built here in Canada.-We lose out on the potential of future job creation. -We lose out on the hope of creativity. -We lose out on the spirit and motivation to become an entrepreneur. Over the last 20 years we have declined from:Being 3/1000 entrepreneurs to now being only 1/1000.Small businesses in Canada are responsible for 60% of our jobs. Canada has so much potential, but something needs to change. We must do better and we must invest in our own ecosystem. Especially during hard times. I said it last week; As soon as I have the capital and resources, I will make it my mission to fund our own entrepreneurs.

Jake Karls,Male,2024-02-27,"Inspiring The Next Generation. Today, I returned to my high school to give an assembly...A moment that holds special significance for me. As someone who faced academic challenges during my own time there, An opportunity to speak to the students and share my journey was meaningful.15 years ago, I struggled to graduate high school.I never thought I would be the one giving an assembly.So I wanted to convey a simple yet powerful message: Anything is possible. Despite setbacks or doubts, Each of us possesses the potential to achieve our dreams.

Jake Karls,Male,2023-12-27,"A 10-Year Journey With Doubt: A Persistent Companion... After getting rejected by every investment bank for a job, For 2 years straight…My dream of being an investment banker or an actuary was shattered. So, I decided to try out entrepreneurship. Most people I told judged me, it felt like they didn't believe that it would work… They looked at me like I was crazy or weird. After closing 1 business and going bankrupt on the other.People would say:“I told you so, it’s too hard…”“Maybe it’s time for you to get a “real” job now.” It seemed like society was pushing me to conform, Pushing me to doubt myself, because listening to the noise seemed like the easier path. When we launched Mid-Day Squares, people started saying different things: “So what’s your actual day job?”“Chocolate bars are your hobby, what do you do for a living in the day?”Again, doubt being pushed on to me. Now I am 10 years into the game of entrepreneurship, And I have  learned 5 extremely important things:- Be yourself with passionate intensity.- Hardships are the potent “fuel” to achieve human greatness. - Stay around a little longer and you will WIN.- Doubt is just another way of people not understanding. - Being able to endure pain is one of the most important skills.All in all, I used to give in to the doubt, it made me feel bad about myself.Now, I know it’s just another part of the game, it’s noise that doesn’t matter. Go win this MONDAY and have relentless self belief. #entrepreneur #smallbusiness #entrepreneurship #cpg #grocery #foodandbeverage #mentalhealth #chocolate",456,56,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM&keywords=jake%20karls&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=0a9217c2-208d-439e-9c73-893af792b480&sid=s0L&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Jake Karls,Male,2024-01-27,"Our business began with a simple promise… To dream big and think global.We didn't want to be just known in Canada; We wanted to be a brand that people were fans of across North America.And after North America, we want to be a global/international staple. In just 2.5 years, We went from selling our bars nowhere in the USA to being sold in over 3,500 stores in the USA.Now, most of our business is in the USA—68%, to be exact. On top of that, 75% of our investors come from the USA. Mid-Day Squares is becoming a force in the USA, we have the #1 selling bar in velocity per week in our category in the USA. Why am I sharing this? First, a big shoutout to the USA. We're thankful for the chance to do business here. And shoutout to our awesome retail partners and investors, Thank you for having our backs and continuing to believe in us.I'm also writing this to tell my fellow Canadians: Take a leap. Do business in the USA. It's scary, it’s really hard,But it's worth it. As Canadians, we must get gutsier, take risks, and dream bigger.Our mission continues to be: Put Canada on the map for chocolate globally.An ""expert"" in our industry once said to me:“Mid-Day Squares won’t survive in the USA, it’s too hard and it will drain all your money.”Well, to that person I say: “We hustled, got creative, and guess what? Our mission is very much alive and thriving.”Cheers to all the dreamers, never stop dreaming and never stop executing. #retail #cpg #foodandbeverageindustry #entrepreneurship #entrepreneur #grocery #chocolate #usa #investors #vc #finance",451,106,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM&keywords=jake%20karls&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=0a9217c2-208d-439e-9c73-893af792b480&sid=s0L&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Jake Karls,Male,2024-04-20,"Rejection changed my life path forever...My dream job was to be an investment banker. The movies made it look cool. When every investment bank I applied to turned me down,It felt like a heavy blow. On top of that, all of my friends and peers landed investment bank jobs. I realized my academic performance wasn't great, And I wasn't well-prepared for interviews. I was very insecure.After each rejection email. I doubted myself and wondered if I'd ever find my place in the working world. But instead of letting it get me down,I saw it as an opportunity to explore different possibilities. That's when I started thinking about starting my own business. I watched shark tank and it energized me. It was a scary thought, but I decided to give it a try. Starting my own business taught me to be brave and persistent. Despite the challenges, I kept pushing forward. Looking back, those rejection letters were painful, But they also gave me the push I needed to find my own path to success. As I journeyed through the highs and lows of entrepreneurship, I discovered strengths and talents I never knew I had. I learned the value of resilience, adaptability, and perseverance. Each setback became a stepping stone, Propelling me towards my goals and shaping me into the entrepreneur I am today.Rejection doesn't need to be a bad thing. #entrepreneurship #cpg #chocolate #finance #investmentbank Mid-Day Squares",450,44,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM&keywords=jake%20karls&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=0a9217c2-208d-439e-9c73-893af792b480&sid=s0L&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Embrace it rather than fear it. - Make friends first then do business. - Think like a TV producer rather than a marketer. - Always be campaigning, as if you’re running for an election. - Entrepreneurship is a lonely road but very liberating. - Building out loud is your secret to winning. - Always show up in person for a meeting. - Therapy is a game changer, a tool to help you win.  - Unaverage decisions always lead to unaverage outcomes. Always better to be an outlier than average.  - Always be unapologetically yourself. It will always pay the highest dividend. These are just some of my favourite ones.Over the next couple of years we will be scaling the business to:$100 million in revenue, I am excited to see what I will learn.

Too much travel, too much rejection, too much pain; just too much.Thirty-six times I've wondered, Is it worth it?And 36 times I've woken up and said YES.This journey has taught me a lot of things, but one of the biggest is the value of being yourself, Of the freedom to figure out who that is, and to enact it every day.I've discovered I'm a good speaker, a decent salesman. I've discovered that I can whip a crowd into a good mood just by standing in front of them and speaking my truths.I've discovered dancing can be part of my toolkit. I love dancing, and that's probably my best discovery so far.But there are more to come. This journey’s just beginning.And it's worth it.

Jake Karls,Male,2023-07-27,"Yesterday, I watched 60,000+ Chocolate Bars Get Produced...When we started in August of 2018, Our max capacity was 80 bars per day in our condo kitchen (by hand).Here’s the story: Building a chocolate factory against all odds.As we set out to scale, we encountered numerous hurdles, Visiting 26 co-manufacturers along the way. They told us to alter our bars, change ingredients, And adjust textures to align with their machinery. But we refused to compromise the essence of our innovation.So what did we do? We went against all odds, experts opinion and conventional wisdom:We decided to build our own chocolate factory. Today we can produce over 60,000 bars per day on our custom line. Soon we will be able to produce 90,000 bars per day. The moral of the story: Anythings possible. The second moral: Don’t be afraid to challenge conventional wisdom.

I barely passed in school… I was always in the “extra help” class for English and writing. Being at the bottom of the class academically always made me feel like a “failure.”So for 25 years, I avoided public speaking and writing… I was worried what others would think of me, I was scared of the judgment or failure. After starting Mid-Day Squares, I started to lean into the fear more and more. Slowly, I started to get more comftorable and confident in myself.

Storytelling allows you to break through the attention economy. Storytelling is not new, we as humans have been communicating for thousands of years through telling stories. Stories will allow you to earn the attention of a customer/client.3) Be authentic in your storytelling. Authenticity seems to be rare in this world, so when you truly act yourself people are attracted to that energy. Authenticity will earn you the trust of the customer/client. If you invest and put effort in these 3 tools, I can guarantee you will have the best chance possible at winning. These 3 strategies focus on building fans/friends rather than just transactions.

Jake Karls,Male,2024-01-27,"My take on the future of MARKETING... Stop investing in cheesy “marketing” tactics... They worked in 2010, not today.It’s a disservice to you, your brand or the company you work for. Start investing in storytelling & authenticity. The world has changed dramatically. Marketing by pushing/forcing information, features, benefits etc… Down the customer's throat is not hot and barely works. Today, we live in an “attention economy”.It’s extremely difficult to get someone's attention.You have to earn the privilege of people's attention.So how do you earn it?Simple but hard: Share authentic stories as your marketing tactics. 4 reasons why storytelling as a marketing tool is powerful:- Emotional Connection:Stories have the unique ability to evoke emotions and create a deep connection between you and the audience.- Memorability & Recall: Facts and figures may be forgotten, but stories are remembered.- Persuasion & Influence: Stories are persuasive tools that can shape opinions, influence decisions, and inspire action.- Differentiation & Branding: In a world filled with information overload, a well-crafted narrative helps your message stand out, creating a distinctive identity for your brand or idea.Stop investing in “old” marketing and start investing in your storytelling.LFG Mid-Day Squares. #marketing #branding #storytelling #cpg #retail #grocery #foodandbeverage",289,69,6,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM&keywords=jake%20karls&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=0a9217c2-208d-439e-9c73-893af792b480&sid=s0L&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

The worst case: You spent $ on two nights at a Double Tree and on a ticket from Spirit Airlines.LFG Mid-Day Squares.   #chocolate #entrepreneur #cpgmarketing #cpgbrands #cpgindustry #grocerytrends #foodandbeverage #marketing #retail #icr #media #cpg #grocery",274,99,5,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABlJ2B8BI930goyvs6OM8Gcsda7NVckq9TM&keywords=jake%20karls&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=0a9217c2-208d-439e-9c73-893af792b480&sid=s0L&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

This insecurity even hindered me from fully enjoying life.I used to face questions like:""Why don't you smile for photos?""""Why are your teeth slanted?""""Have you ever had braces?""People's stares at the slant only intensified my discomfort.Today, I no longer view my slanted teeth as a deformity. But rather as a unique superpower. I have chosen to embrace my smile rather than hide or deny it.
