Economists have noted the ‚ÄúTaylor Effect‚Äù that her tour has on entire economies, with some leaders begging her to bring the traveling stimulus program to their countries. She was even mentioned in a¬†report by the Fed¬†this summer. Her tour came at a time when people were desperate to have meaningful in-person collective experiences.

Arianna Huffington,Female,2024-01-27,"There's no doubt that it takes some exceptional qualities to get to the top. Especially when on the way up, a woman will be dogged by charges of ""ambition,"" ""drive,"" and ""pushiness."" But the biggest obstacle isn't the media or male colleagues (or even some of our fellow females). Worse than the culture's approach to women in power are our own fears about power: the fear that we're setting ourselves up for attack, the fear that we'll alienate others, the fear that we may actually become the caricature of the obnoxious, shrill, she-devil boss.

This year's theme focused on cultivating care and connection in an evolving workplace, and in my conversation with Michael, we talked about how healthcare costs are rising for self-insured employers even as outcomes are getting worse, but at the same time there are incredible opportunities with AI to help employees make better decisions that lead to healthier, fuller lives. That‚Äôs why at Thrive Global we're building personalized AI health coaches to help people no matter where they are on their health journeys and connect them to the benefits they need at the right time.

Never spend any meeting time with someone walking you through a deck and reading you the contents of each slide.‚û°Ô∏è Don‚Äôt default to 30-minute meetings. Can a meeting be reduced to 15 minutes?‚û°Ô∏è Can you make your meeting a walking meeting? One of my favorite Microsteps is turning at least a couple of my meetings into phone calls so that I can take them while walking. You can walk in your neighborhood or even walk around your house while speaking on the phone. There is no universal law that every virtual interaction has to be on video.‚û°Ô∏è Create a shared doc for each meeting so the owner can assign action items to everyone who attends.‚û°Ô∏è Block off time on your calendar for deep work.

Arianna Huffington,Female,2023-10-27,"Much like snooze alarms themselves, the great Snooze Button Debate ‚Äì thought to be largely settled ‚Äì is ringing once again. In TIME magazine, Jamie Ducharme reports on a new study casting doubt on the view of many experts ‚Äì and this non-expert ‚Äì that hitting the snooze button isn‚Äôt great for your sleep. The study, published in the journal Sleep, was conducted by Stephen Mattingly, a serial snoozer and post-doctoral researcher at the University of Notre Dame. The results showed that snoozers didn‚Äôt sleep less in total or feel more tired during the day than non-snoozers. But, the study notes, snoozers were found to be sleeping more lightly before waking and had elevated resting heart rates, which suggests their stress responses were being set off in advance of their alarm being set off. Mattingly says that simply means they can break through their ‚Äúsleep inertia‚Äù more quickly. But as Kathryn Roecklein, a professor who researches sleep at the University of Pittsburgh, points out, there are better ways to do that, like turning on the lights when you wake up. The larger point is if you find you can‚Äôt get up when your alarm goes off, that‚Äôs a loud message your body is sending that you‚Äôre not getting enough sleep. And Roecklein notes that repeated snoozing in the morning can also make it harder to get to sleep at night and keep a consistent sleep schedule, which keeps our circadian rhythms in sync. So snoozers of the world unite ‚Äì and throw off your buttons ‚Äì you‚Äôve nothing to lose but lighter sleep, elevated heart rates and out-of-sync circadian rhythms! But if you must snooze, at least do it with a real alarm clock and not your phone, since charging it by your bed can cost you sleep on both ends of the night. https://lnkd.in/dVqqG8pN#Sleep #Snooze #Sleeping #TheSleepRevolution #TheSnoozeDebate",386,147,13,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAiQnR8Bj7ttPrS-H8IYUsLsAB2iZh1Ka0o%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAiQnR8Bj7ttPrS-H8IYUsLsAB2iZh1Ka0o&keywords=arianna%20huffington&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=c082eb50-b224-45a1-b2be-c17959802413&sid=7xc&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

I first wrote about the apostrophe crisis back in 2005 when the headlines had constant mention of ‚ÄúWMD‚Äôs.‚Äù There were no WMDs, but there were definitely zombie apostrophes and nothing seems to be able to stop them from being deployed.¬†My crusade began in earnest when my daughter Isabella was in middle school and wrote an essay about a school camping¬†trip, which involved, as she wrote, a ‚Äúrope‚Äôs course.‚Äù I gently corrected her, and she responded by saying that, in fact, her teacher agreed with her. She kept the apostrophe and, sure enough, it went uncorrected by the teacher.¬†¬†Sure it‚Äôs minor, but it‚Äôs a grammar version of the broken windows theory. Once one broken grammar window becomes normalized, where does it end? Thanks to texting, we‚Äôve already done away with capitalization and punctuation at the end of sentences. Emojis are an invasive species we‚Äôve all accepted. But we have to draw the line somewhere. And the apostrophe isn‚Äôt decorative ‚Äì it actually has meaning.¬†So here we are, with our apostrodemic still raging, and one for which there‚Äôs apparently no vaccine. Since we humans seem to have proven ourselves incapable of using this punctuation tool responsibly, perhaps this is one of those beneficial humanity-enhancing uses for AI.¬†The¬†LLMs will do it for us.

At Pompeii, whose people were wiped out in the first century by a violent volcanic eruption, there had been many warning signs, including a severe earthquake, tremors, springs and wells that dried up, dogs that ran away and birds that no longer sang.

One way she does this is to close each chapter with a question, exhortation or small assignment for the reader. For example, in the first chapter that‚Äôs all about her difficult childhood having two young parents who were dealing with addiction, she asks readers to ‚Äúwrite three beautiful memories from your childhood‚Äù so that we don‚Äôt stay stuck on the pain. Or in chapter 2, she asks readers to ‚Äúwrite a list of the parts of yourself you might want to reclaim ‚Äî that didn‚Äôt feel safe enough to embrace as a child.‚Äù A major theme of the book is her spiritual journey, and her hope for her readers that they‚Äôll ‚Äúfind the golden threads to weave the inner kingdom that supports the making of your chosen life.‚Äù It‚Äôs a beautiful book ‚Äì and one in which you‚Äôll learn not just about Jada‚Äôs life, but about your own. https://lnkd.in/dA3M866H#Worthy #Journey #JadaPinkettSmith",278,30,11,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAiQnR8Bj7ttPrS-H8IYUsLsAB2iZh1Ka0o%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAiQnR8Bj7ttPrS-H8IYUsLsAB2iZh1Ka0o&keywords=arianna%20huffington&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=c082eb50-b224-45a1-b2be-c17959802413&sid=7xc&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Arianna Huffington,Female,2023-09-27,"At¬†Thrive Global, our mission has always been to help people be their most productive, most creative selves, sustainably ‚Äî without burning out. To do that, we meet employees where they are by embedding well-being and productivity tools into the workflow itself. That‚Äôs why I was so excited to be able to launch Thrive For Slack at¬†Dreamforce¬†last month,¬†along with¬†Slack‚Äôs amazing CEO¬†Lidiane Jones.Slack is where work happens, and #ThriveforSlack is where productivity without burnout happens. We focus on the six key daily behaviors that shape our well-being and productivity: our sleep, food, movement, stress management, focus and connection. Our behavior change platform pushes real-time, personalized nudges directly to employees in the places where work happens ‚Äî like Slack.Think of it the way elite athletes see it: well-being and recovery are an essential part of peak performance. And the same is true for the rest of us: Well-being and recovery are essential for sustained productivity. How we sleep, eat, move, manage our stress and connect with our colleagues has a dramatic impact both on our physical, mental and emotional well-being, and on our productivity. So think of Thrive on Slack as a productivity multiplier.One of my favorite productivity multipliers¬†from Thrive on Slack is the 60-second Thrive Reset, which helps employees reduce stress with 60-second breaks pushed directly to them where their work happens. We‚Äôve found that with just three 60-second Thrive Resets a day we achieve measurable increases in well-being and productivity.In addition to Reset, also included in Thrive for Slack is a new integration with Sales Elevate, which is based on an idea from Salesforce‚Äôs Chief Engineering Officer during a meeting we had. We all know about sales quotas, but sellers also have energy quotas ‚Äî and if they aren‚Äôt meeting their energy quota, they‚Äôre less likely to hit their sales quota. Our integration with Elevate sends sellers personalized Microsteps that help them meet both their energy and their sales quotas. For example, if a seller marks a deal as closed lost, we‚Äôll push Microsteps and Resets to help them bounce back faster and focus on their next opportunity.And second, we‚Äôre launching Thrive‚Äôs Well-being Template in Canvas, which automates tailored well-being plans for key moments that matter in the employee lifecycle ‚Äî like onboarding, switching managers, or returning from leave. Features like Thrive‚Äôs Entry Interview and Re-entry Interview help #employees and their #managers communicate directly, clarify responsibilities, and reach their goals ‚Äì all directly in Slack.What makes these innovations particularly game-changing is that they‚Äôre powered by #AI, so they‚Äôre deeply personalized with what most resonates with users. Thrive for Slack is already live at Salesforce,¬†and we are¬†excited to bring it to even more partners.Read more about our partnership here:",255,19,16,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAiQnR8Bj7ttPrS-H8IYUsLsAB2iZh1Ka0o%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAiQnR8Bj7ttPrS-H8IYUsLsAB2iZh1Ka0o&keywords=arianna%20huffington&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=c082eb50-b224-45a1-b2be-c17959802413&sid=7xc&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Arianna Huffington,Female,2024-04-06,"Amid the sea of grim news, which is always with us, and as we head into a contentious election season that will remind us how divided we are, here are some examples of how spirituality ‚Äî that fundamental human need we all share to connect with something larger than ourselves ‚Äî is in the zeitgeist.Example one: Savannah Guthrie‚Äôs beautiful new book,¬†Mostly What God Does: Reflections on Seeking and Finding His Love Everywhere. I just finished reading it and couldn't wait to get copies for my daughters and everyone I love. It‚Äôs a series of essays about six core themes of faith ‚Äî love, presence, grace, hope, gratitude and purpose ‚Äî and how those play out in her own spiritual life. As Guthrie writes, ‚ÄúI have just this one life, and it is certainly not an example to hold up for others or a monument to great righteousness or faith. It‚Äôs just a life of a person who has felt the love of God and been saved by it, over and over and over again.‚Äù And yet others ‚Äî many others ‚Äî are indeed turning to her example, as the book has been sold out both in stores and online and demand is so great that people are actually selling fakes (hopefully the fakesters also read the book and asked for forgiveness).Example two: Andrew Huberman. Much of what draws a growing fan base to the neuroscientist and¬†podcaster¬†are the many science-backed strategies he shares on how to optimize our physical health. But on a recent podcast with AI researcher Lex Fridman, Huberman¬†said¬†he‚Äôs recently started a prayer practice.

Arianna Huffington,Female,2023-11-27,"Machine learning is all the rage, but how, exactly, do machines learn? The best way, it turns out, is to learn the way children do. In¬†The Wall Street Journal, psychologist Alison Gopnik¬†reports¬†on a new¬†study¬†in the journal¬†Nature Human Behaviour¬†showing that the best AI imitates children. To illustrate how, Gopnik uses the example of how unruly kids can be at an airport (as a mother of two daughters, I can declare this hypothesis validated). In the same way,¬†AI systems can have different temperatures. Hotter temperature AI means more creativity and wildness. Cooler temperatures produce more reasonable but banal answers. The best AI starts out wide-ranging and hot ‚Äî like kids ‚Äî before cooling down to settle on plausible, adult-like responses. This mirrors our own process. ‚ÄúWe need to start out as those crazy kids in the airport to become effective, intelligent adults,‚Äù writes Gopnik. ‚ÄúBut, of course, the children can only thrive if the grown-ups take care of them, too.‚Äù Which means the best AI will need adult supervision. As for us, even though we ‚Äúcool‚Äù with age, we also need to run hot and keep that childlike sense of wonder and exploration.

Obese since his teens, John was pre-diabetic and diagnosed with pneumonia, high blood pressure, and congestive heart failure. Since April 2022, John has lost over 200 pounds by taking Microsteps, gradually moving toward his weight loss goals and a healthier lifestyle by habit-stacking ‚Äî consistently building one good habit onto another. He began walking his dogs on a daily basis, starting with a thousand steps and gradually improving his stamina and endurance. He‚Äôs now up to five miles a day. Once he was stronger, John began working out at the gym and lifting weights. John also made changes to his diet, starting with Microsteps like drinking water to start his day rather than reaching for diet soda. But he‚Äôs not on this journey alone: John and his wife Rachel (also a Walmart associate) are taking the Thrive Challenge together, motivating each other, experimenting with healthy recipes as a family, bonding over calming walks in nature, and even finding that their shared commitment has brought them closer together.A heavy smoker since his teens, John gradually cut down on cigarettes and has been able to quit completely ‚Äî again by taking Microsteps, like drinking more water. ‚ÄúNow, when I‚Äôm stressed, instead of picking up a cigarette, I‚Äôll calm myself by watching a Thrive Reset ‚Äî I really like the one with mountain scenes,‚Äù he says.John‚Äôs committed to continuing the Thrive Challenge.

We were there for a family trip and I was able to join in the fun. It felt so great to be an active dad. It's hard to explain what that means to me ‚Äî I was overcome with joy.
