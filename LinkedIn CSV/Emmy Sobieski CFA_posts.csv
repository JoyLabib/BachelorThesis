Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-06-27,"Stop taking notes during meetings. Seriously. üìù‚ùåAt first, like any good analyst, I took notes. I wanted to remember everything that was said.But as we walked out of a meeting one day, my previous boss told me, ""You‚Äôre smart enough to remember what was said for thirty minutes. Don't take notes.""Here's why you should ditch the notepad and embrace a new approach:In today's fast-paced business world, it's common for professionals to enter meetings armed with notepads or laptops, ready to jot down every detail of the conversation.However, my old boss challenged this approach by encouraging his analysts to stop taking notes during meetings. Instead, he recommends retaining information mentally and jotting down key points after leaving the room.Why should you adopt this unconventional method?The idea is that taking notes during meetings can make others feel guarded and less open to sharing valuable information. By refraining from writing down every word, you can maintain eye contact and focus on the speaker, making them feel important and heard. This subtle shift can lead to richer, more insightful conversations and ultimately, better networking experiences.Another critical aspect of networking is mastering the art of conversation.To become a better conversationalist, ask open-ended, neutral questions followed by relevant follow-ups. This hopscotch method allows you to delve deeper into a topic without making the other person feel uncomfortable or pressured to overshare. Remember, the key to successful networking is to talk less, ask more, and listen intently.#careers #entrepreneurship #venturecapital",33,20,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-11-27,"I have worked for 5 billionaires and networked with many more.What they all have in common is spectacular networks.Here‚Äôs their secret that helps them build great networks üëáIn 2006, I had breakfast with John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco.I had just spoken at Cisco‚Äôs annual kickoff in Monterrey, California, for 2,500 director-level (and up) managers. I was overseeing $6 billion in tech investments at OppenheimerFunds, the second largest holder of Cisco shares. Bill Clinton, a super-connector, was the keynote speaker. Over breakfast, John shared with me Bill Clinton's secret to networking: ‚ÄúIn that moment, treat the person you are with as the center of the universe.‚ÄùThat day, my whole perspective changed‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how to apply this uber-networking strategy in your life:1. Understand people‚Äôs basic needs never change    We all want to be seen.     But how often do we receive or give undivided attention?     Giving your complete attention to someone builds a stronger connection faster.2. Apply this understanding to your networking dailyAvoid multitasking when networking. At the same time, we are all busy. We don‚Äôt have unlimited time.Focus all your attention on one person for that moment, and you‚Äôll have a massive edge. Here‚Äôs how:Give your undivided attention to someone in ‚ÄúMicro-Moments‚Äù. Micro-moments can be a few minutes, or up to five, ten, or twenty minutes of conversation where you have 100% of your attention, curiosity and questions focused only on the other person.Good networkers may give 90%, 95% or even 99% of their attention.

I call them the 3Ô∏è‚É£ B‚Äôs:üéØBreak InüéØBuild EquityüéØBreak Out1Ô∏è‚É£Break In:Get a job in investment banking, management consulting, or investing.You need to know the path and options early enough to get the grades, to be able to break into investment banking (IB) or management consulting. You can break in later by working at a great startup or getting an MBA and then a job in IB or consulting.‚Äã2Ô∏è‚É£ Build EquityGet paid for performance, not based on your salary, but based on the inherent leverage in the business. When managing money (PE/VC/Hedge Fund), equity comes in the form of being paid in carry, ie your share of profits of the funds run by you and/or the firm. In startups, building equity separates your time from money earned.In the Building Equity phase of your career, you build multiple paths of wealth generation. You earn equity in your full time job. You can invest in other companies. You can scout for a VC firm. You can be on company boards.If you think this sounds far-fetched, two of my friends who hit $100M by age 50 from diverse backgrounds both live the above model (running companies, on boards, working with VCs).To make $100M, you need to build equity. You don‚Äôt necessarily need to go further. Bill Gurley started as an engineer at Compaq computer, transitioned to an analyst on Wall Street, moved from analyzing computer stocks to internet platforms (by switching jobs), took Amazon public, got a partner role at Benchmark (a VC firm), focusing on internet platforms, invested in Uber, and is worth billions.3Ô∏è‚É£Break OutBuild your own firm, either a startup or asset management company.The very wealthiest in the world all Broke Out.

The key is knowing yourself and your options.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-11-27,"üì¢There are 25,000 households that are self-made 100 Millionaires in the US.It's totally doable.Here are the 5 fastest paths to $100M (aside from being a talented entertainer or criminal):üí≤Private Equityüí≤Hedge Fundüí≤Startup Founderüí≤Venture Capitalüí≤Board DirectorVenture Capital VC is all about financing startups and small businesses. It's finding and investing in those with long-term growth potential. Although this varies based on the size, location, and tier of VC, starting pay (salary plus bonus) can range from $100-200K. Moving up to $400-600K for mid-level VCs (5 years in). The endpoint is to be a Venture Capital Fund Partner or Founder. This is where you can make tens of millions to billions (Bill Gurley, Marc Andreeson, Peter Thiel are all worth billions). Private EquityPE is about investing in already established private companies or buying out public companies and delisting them from the public market. The average pay as an associate here is about $247,500. The endpoint here is to be a PE Fund Partner or Founder. Here success is measured in tens of millions to billions (the founders of Blackstone, Apollo, KKR, and more).Hedge FundHedge funds are aggressive investments in a wide variety of industries. The median salary for hedge fund managers is around $135,706. This is because most funds try and pay a minimum salary and pay you everything else as carry. The endpoint here is to be a Hedge Fund Partner or Founder. Those who found their own firms (or run one) can make hundreds of millions in a single year and billions over their career. Founder/C-Suite Founders make the companies. C-Suite is a fancy name for the collection of executive officers, like CEOs and CFOs. Depending on the position, median pay can be as high as $754,700 (Chief Executive Officer) or as low as $217,140 (Chief Information Security Officer). But these pay averages include public companies, which is not where you‚Äôre going to make big steps up in wealth. The endpoint here is to be a Founder or C-Suite of an IPOed unicorn company and get in before it IPOs. Board DirectorThese are governing bodies of public companies, elected by the shareholders, who meet regularly to set the company‚Äôs course in terms of mergers and investments. Board member compensation comes mostly in stock options and is thus based on the company‚Äôs value. This can be into the millions to tens of millions every year. The endpoint here is to be a Board Director of multiple IPOed unicorn companies. The real benefit to board service is you can do this with 4 or more companies at once.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-12-27,"Top board directors can get a $10M+ signing bonus.Yet, most people don‚Äôt know how to break in until it‚Äôs too late.There is a simple, yet not easy, path to being on a board: üëáHow to Break Into a Board Director PositionThe top way to break into a board director position is to be the person they wish they could hire, the one that will fill the gap, that they can‚Äôt afford.  How do you become this person? 1. Build P&L responsibilityRun sales at a mid-sized high-growth company or run a division of a larger company like Microsoft or Google.Sometimes small companies have important partnerships they want to protect, so you may be asked to join a board to preserve the partnership. This can be a launchpad for your board director career.2. Grow your companySales responsibility or executive roles in marketing are the best at showing your direct impact on the topline growth of a company. Sales isn‚Äôt just for salespeople. Executives at startups are selling to customers, investors, and partners. Growth is what all private companies treasure most, so you will be in high demand as a board director if you show the ability to grow a company (or two or three).3. Make yourself knownHow do people know what you‚Äôve achieved?  Everyone is busy.  Be an active networker in person and on social media. Companies select board members by reaching out to them (instead of through applications), so your network is the only way you will be considered. You may need to start as an advisor for a startup, then move to an advisory board, and later a board of directors. Build your skills, grow your accomplishments, and network to get there.

Start there, then use your great track record to run and own your own company, fund, or financial firm.That‚Äôs why after you break into a great firm and build a track record, run your own fund, then you need to have an ownership or equity stake to increase your chances of getting to $100M (and beyond).  ‚ùå Mistake #3: Not having big enough goals After working nearly a decade of 80-100 hour weeks, when Palantir shut down, I slept for 3 months.  It‚Äôs fine to take breaks.But what I did next was not fine.Part of my issue was I thought I had hit my goals because my goals were too small (work at a top hedge fund), and I cover this issue of sizing your goals big enough to be personal moonshots in Why You Should Go For $100M. Moonshot Your Career and in Dream Big - $100M Big.Once I hit my goals, I languished.I got more jobs doing the same thing: being an analyst.

If you find yourself feeling restricted in a single company role, consider exploring board director opportunities.Board directors have the unique advantage of working with multiple companies simultaneously.

This experience can be incredibly fulfilling, as it allows you to broaden your horizons and make a significant impact across the business world.A successful startup background can also pave the way toward a career in venture capital, private equity, or even hedge funds.

If you are stuck in the breaking in phase of your career, how can you transition to building equity?2. Taking long breaksI kept taking my foot off the gas in my career, instead of compounding my efforts.First, you need big, audacious goals to go after. Then celebrate milestones and keep your foot on the gas pedal!3. Not having a personal CRM soonerI'm in my fifties and I look back at how my college friends did. The smartest ones are not the wealthiest. The ones who systematized their networking are the wealthiest. Build your personal CRM and system.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-10-27,"Why You Don‚Äôt Have to Be First: The Second-Mover AdvantageBrand-new industries can take a long time to emerge. Long enough for you to run out of money before you find the one you‚Äôre looking for.How do these first movers get it right? IBM was producing software before Microsoft. Bill Gates just separated the hardware from the software. Then he got IBM to let Microsoft make software for IBM and resell it to others. He launched the entire PC industry through the wording of one contract! Microsoft focused on operating systems, word processing, and spreadsheets. WordStar also made word processors, but Microsoft bundled its software with its real asset, the operating system. IBM had allowed them to sell to others even though it was built at the request of IBM.Gates was late enough to see how it had been done wrong. And early enough to provide significant improvements to customers and grab an entire industry.Before Oracle, databases were all built by IBM and Wang. And they were an afterthought at Microsoft. Oracle went on to own that market.Gates and Elison started back in the 1970s. What about the future?The Internet‚Äôs scale and network effects make being early crucial. Take Marc Andreesen. Born in 1971, Marc created the Mosaic browser (Netscape) as a computer science student. Today he‚Äôs one of the most powerful venture capitalists.But even the Internet is full of second movers.As websites multiplied faster than rabbits, finding what you're looking for became difficult. Most systems like Yahoo used human indexers and editors. But Google used the power of math running on cheap, networked computers to rank pages and predict the answers users most wanted.Google is an example of second-mover advantage. They were early enough to have tons of growth ahead, but late enough to learn from others‚Äô mistakes. Facebook, now Meta, is another example. The company arrived after MySpace and Friendster.  Founder Mark Zuckerberg saw what didn‚Äôt work and what did.The trick is getting in early enough to capture most of the gains while being able to learn from others‚Äô failures. And the Internet‚Äôs network effects mean that the upward curve of progress in users, sales, and profits is geometric. That makes it far harder to catch the leaders once they have product-market fit.#entrepreneurship #startups #careers",16,2,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-11-27,"How to Break Into Private EquityThe end goal is to become a Fund Partner or Founder. Here are some paths to that goal:Your best starting point to getting into PE is getting a job at an investment bank.¬† This is because about 95% of people that work in PE come through investment banking.¬† First, you start out at a top-tier investment bank as an associate for two years. You attend the Private Equity superdays for the firms you like. Then, you‚Äôre hired into a private equity firm as an associate. From there, you focus on moving up the ranks. Eventually, you get to the point where you‚Äôre running a fund. Then, you work your way into becoming the partner founder of a private equity fund. Either by founding your own firm or launching your own fund at the firm where you work.Another way, but honestly less likely, is you could start in management consulting for three years. From there, you get hired into a private equity firm as an associate. Then, like the path above, you start moving up to the point where you‚Äôre running a private equity fund. Once you‚Äôre at that stage, you work your way into becoming a partner or founder of a fund.A third path you could take is to be more senior at a VC firm that is doing deals alongside PE firms, both investing in late-stage growth companies. You could then make a lateral move as a partner from VC over to PE. This is also far rarer than the first example. Again, you‚Äôre aiming to run a private equity fund, and from there, leverage your experience into founding a fund or firm.You could also start out as a company founder, or hold a key role at a company acquired by a private equity firm. From there, you can work to leverage your position into becoming a principal or partner in that firm. Then, like all the above, you want to run a private equity fund, and from there, become the partner or founder of a fund.#venturecapital #investing #careers",16,5,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Build a Foundation of HealthJust like a house, your life can crumble without a healthy and strong foundation.  Your sleep, nutrition, and exercise are your strong foundation. Try to get or catch up on quality sleep.Fuel yourself with water and whole foods. Move a little (or a bit more) each day. You may be surprised at your results. It‚Äôs how I was able to be world or nationally-ranked in 3 sports while working 80-100 hour weeks. 2. Grow and strengthen your network with micro-momentsSlow down, breathe, and savor the micro-moments of connection.When you meet someone, focus intently and entirely on them - for a limited amount of time. Treat the person you are with as the center of the universe. Giving them 100% (not just 95%, or even 99%) of your attention one moment at a time makes them feel seen. The limited amount of time removes the pressure and saves time. These moments add up, like deposits in a bank account. 3. Create systems that support your goalsProductivity systems shouldn‚Äôt only be about fitting more in.List out your values, future vision, and mission. Make your systems work for you by cutting out what you don‚Äôt want to do and automating what you can. This includes networking, social media, book writing, and anything else that aligns with your goals.Your systems should support your mission, vision, and values and give you more breathing room.Without your foundation of health, you can‚Äôt enjoy the present or your end destination.Without a network, it will be harder and less enjoyable to get where you are going.Without systems, you may get caught in the minutiae and not go as far.What was most surprising to you?",16,13,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Taking risks can lead to valuable learning experiences, new connections, and opportunities you wouldn't have encountered otherwise. 4.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-11-27,"Your career, like your life, has phases. I call them the 3 B‚Äôs:‚Üí Break In‚Üí Build Equity‚Üí Break Out1.Break In:Get a job in investment banking, management consulting, or investing.You need to know the path and options early enough to get the grades, to be able to break into investment banking (IB) or management consulting. You can break in later by working at a great startup or getting an MBA and then a job in IB or consulting.‚Äã2. Build EquityGet paid for performance, not based on your salary, but based on the inherent leverage in the business. When managing money (PE/VC/Hedge Fund), equity comes in the form of being paid in carry, ie your share of profits of the funds run by you and/or the firm. In startups, building equity separates your time from money earned.In the Building Equity phase of your career, you build multiple paths of wealth generation. You earn equity in your full time job. You can invest in other companies. You can scout for a VC firm. You can be on company boards.If you think this sounds far-fetched, two of my friends who hit $100M by age 50 from diverse backgrounds both live the above model (running companies, on boards, working with VCs).To make $100M, you need to build equity. You don‚Äôt necessarily need to go further. Bill Gurley started as an engineer at Compaq computer, transitioned to an analyst on Wall Street, moved from analyzing computer stocks to internet platforms (by switching jobs), took Amazon public, got a partner role at Benchmark (a VC firm), focusing on internet platforms, invested in Uber, and is worth billions.3. Break OutBuild your own firm, either a startup or asset management company.The very wealthiest in the world all Broke Out. Elon Musk. Bill Gates. Warren Buffet. Sarah Blakely. Founders whose startups grew to some of the most valuable companies in the world.Breaking Out is also the most risky, and the most littered with lost fortunes.If your goal is $100M or even a billion dollar career, your path may not need to take on the risk of entering the Breaking Out phase. The key is knowing yourself and your options. Pick the best path for you.My book, $100M Wealth, helps you build that path. #careers #venturecapital #entrepreneurship",14,13,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-04-27,"Why You Don‚Äôt Have to Be First: The Second-Mover AdvantageBrand-new industries can take a long time to emerge. Long enough for you to run out of money before you find the one you‚Äôre looking for.How do these first movers get it right? IBM was producing software before Microsoft. Bill Gates just separated the hardware from the software. Then he got IBM to let Microsoft make software for IBM and resell it to others. He launched the entire PC industry through the wording of one contract! Keep in mind, Bill Gates‚Äô dad was a contract lawyer. Microsoft focused on operating systems, word processing, and spreadsheets. WordStar also made word processors, but Microsoft bundled its software with its real asset, the operating system. Which IBM had allowed them to sell to others even though it was built at the request of IBM.Gates was late enough to see how it had been done wrong. And early enough to provide significant improvements to customers and grab an entire industry.Before Oracle, databases were all built by IBM and Wang. And they were an afterthought at Microsoft. Oracle went on to own that market.Gates and Elison started back in the 1970s. What about the future?The Internet‚Äôs scale and network effects make being early crucial. Take Marc Andreesen. Born in 1971, Marc created the Mosaic browser (Netscape) as a computer science student. Today he‚Äôs one of the most powerful venture capitalists.But even the Internet is full of second movers.As websites multiplied faster than rabbits, it became difficult to find what you're looking for. Most systems like Yahoo used human indexers and editors. But Google used the power of math running on cheap, networked computers to rank pages and predict the answers users most wanted.Google is an example of second-mover advantage. They were early enough to have tons of growth ahead, but late enough to learn from others‚Äô mistakes. Facebook, now Meta, is another example. The company arrived after MySpace and Friendster.  Founder Mark Zuckerberg saw what didn‚Äôt work and what did.The trick is getting in early enough to capture most of the gains while being able to learn from others‚Äô failures. And the Internet‚Äôs network effects mean that the upward curve of progress in users, sales, and profits is geometric. That makes it far harder to catch the leaders once they have product-market fit. #entrepreneurship #investing #startups",14,9,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-09-27,"Private Equity vs Venture Capital for your $100M CareerPrivate Equity is a lot like Venture Capital. Private Equity firms tend to invest side by side with late-stage venture capital firms.Which do you do?Those who thrive in Private Equity love the mathematical side of things. They love modeling and they‚Äôre more risk averse, preferring to model out business decisions.My most successful mentee in PE loved modeling, creating regressions, and being pulled in on important deals. At the same time, he doesn‚Äôt like a lot of uncertainty. Picking a stock, thinking about the future, and considering the possibilities of what might happen are not interesting to him. But, looking at how he can structure super complex deals is fascinating to him. He enjoys getting rid of almost all the risk and creating a whole bunch of upside (the asymmetric trade).People like that flourish in private equity.Venture Capitalists spend lots of time in deep thought on where the future is headed. From this thought and research, they build a thesis or a way they can invest around that future. Then, they figure out how to deploy capital using the thesis.The firms that invest in seed and Series A and Series B, they‚Äôre very different from PE. As a VC, you‚Äôre imagining how the team might change the future with their innovation. You're envisioning how that might fit with one of your themes or theses for how the future will play out. There‚Äôs not much financial modeling.As a VC, you‚Äôre going to wade through a ton of pitch decks. Some will be passed on to you. Some will be sent in. Some pitch decks you‚Äôll solicit. Then you‚Äôll decide which founders you want to meet with. You‚Äôll be chasing hot deals and trying to avoid the dogs while picking out diamonds in the rough.You‚Äôll also be spending huge amounts of time networking with groups of founders and board directors.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-11-27,"Venture Capital: A high-risk, high-reward career choice.üíºIs it the right path for you? ü§îDiscover the pros, cons, and what it takes to break into the industry.üëáVenture Capital (VC) is an alluring career choice for those seeking a high-stakes, high-reward path. It's a field that requires intellect, resilience, and persistence to make a mark. But is it the right fit for you? Let's dive into what a career in VC looks like.VCs spend their time researching and predicting future trends, navigating through pitch decks, and networking with founders and board directors. They have the power to shape the future by investing in promising companies and innovations. But with enormous rewards come significant challenges.Positives of a VC career include intellectual stimulation, focusing on future innovations, and the potential for wealth-building. However, there are negatives: dealing with large egos, risks with other people's money, and long hours spent on networking.Breaking into VC can happen through various paths, like starting in investment banking, being part of a successful startup, or even beginning as a scout. But if you find that VC isn't the right fit, there are plenty of opportunities to pivot into related fields, such as operational support for portfolio companies or investment banking.Regardless of the path you choose within VC, there are several factors to consider when identifying high-leverage opportunities. Focus on industries that are timely, sustainable, and have a catalyst for growth. VCs must identify bottlenecks and find solutions to address them. By focusing on industries that unlock these bottlenecks and cater to the evolving needs of businesses, a career in VC can lead to immense success.Ultimately, a career in Venture Capital is not for the faint-hearted. It requires dedication, resilience, and a keen eye for future trends. If you're up for the challenge, the rewards can be life-changing.#entrepreneurship #startups #careers",14,12,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Once you understand these concepts, it's time to apply them to your chosen career path. Let's dive deep into the five high-leverage positions that can lead to wealth beyond your wildest dreams:1. Venture Capital: As a venture capitalist, you invest in startups with long-term growth potential, ultimately becoming a partner or founder of a VC firm. Successful VC professionals like Bill Gurley, Marc Andreessen, and Peter Thiel have amassed immense wealth in this field.2. Private Equity: In private equity, you invest directly in private companies or buy out public ones. The endpoint here is to be a private equity fund partner or founder, positions that can make tens of millions to billions.3. Hedge Fund: Managing investments in various industries, hedge fund partners or founders can make hundreds of millions in a single year and billions over their careers.4. Founder/C-suite: Founders create companies, and C-suite executives run them. By becoming a founder or C-suite executive of a successful company, you can increase your wealth exponentially, just like Jeff Bezos (AMZN), Bill Gates (MSFT), and Larry Page and Sergey Brin (GOOG).5. Board Director: As a board director, you govern public companies, making decisions that impact their future success. By joining the board of multiple successful companies, you can increase your wealth and influence dramatically.If you want to build generational wealth, focus on positions with high leverage and ownership potential through equity.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-09-27,"Want to unlock real wealth?Leverage: the secret to unlocking real wealth. üí∞Discover how high-leverage industries can skyrocket your income with minimal effort. üëá""Leverage is one to many."" This nugget of wisdom was shared with me during grad school by a successful investor. Unlocking real wealth comes down to influencing the most people and money as a single individual. The ability to affect many with minimal effort is the key to leverage, and it can be found in high-leverage industries like financial services, technology, and entertainment.Why leverage? To reach significant levels of wealth, you need to be compensated for your value-added contributions, not your time. By leveraging your value within a one-to-many structure, you can exponentially increase your income without breaking a sweat.Take financial services - brokerage houses, venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, and money management all have the potential to manage millions, billions, or even trillions of dollars with a similar effort as managing one million. High-leverage roles in this industry include partners, principals, or portfolio managers.In technology, software, platforms, internet businesses, and AI can be used by millions of people. Social media platforms and business tools like Salesforce demonstrate the power of one-to-many structures. Founders, CEOs, and owners/investors are the high-leverage roles in this sector.As for entertainment, the reach of a single TV show or performance can influence millions. Here, the high-leverage role belongs to the talent - the actors, singers, and performers who can parlay their value into ownership.Sales can also be a high-leverage position in some of these industries. Interestingly, a majority of CEOs spent part of their careers in sales.Next step: Analyze your current position and identify opportunities to increase your leverage. My book, $100M Careers, can help you do just that and map your career path.

Or Silicon Valley. Or AI.Or even entertainment! There are multiple paths to wealth‚Äîmany know about but few take. So starting now, figure out what skills you need to be successful. Begin networking with people who can get you into the career paths and positions you‚Äôre on the lookout for. And as you network and work, think about what steps get you closer to the money. For instance, in a company, sales is closer to the money flow than accounting. This sounds backwards, but it‚Äôs not.The flow of money comes into the company via sales; accounting just records it (nothing against accountants). And a company is valued on a multiple of its sales and sales growth. So salespeople (customer-facing, front-facing, or front-office) get paid far more than those in the back office.It‚Äôs not about starting right, it‚Äôs about starting right now and making the smart moves that bring you success. In investing, the person who decides what stocks or companies to buy and brings in clients based on their track record picking great investments is paid far more than the equivalent seniority person in risk management or accounting (called mid and back office, respectively).

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-11-27,"Did you know that MICRO-MOMENTS can make a lifetime impact in just minutes? ü§ØWe often rush through our day, missing out on these precious opportunities to connect. But what if we could harness the power of micro-moments to transform our personal and professional lives? Let me show you how: In our fast-paced world, we tend to view life as a never-ending checklist, always moving on to the next task or conversation. But by slowing down and savoring micro-moments, we can invest a little energy and attention to get a big return. These moments can consist of deep, focused conversations where you give 100% of your attention and curiosity to the other person, ultimately building a stronger connection. People often think they need grand gestures to create connections, but it's really about these micro-moments of connection. These moments add up like deposits in a bank account, and each one counts.To make the most of micro-moments, practice active listening and ask open-ended questions. This will help you build a stronger connection with the other person. Also, remember to pause and give the other person space to process what's going on, allowing for a mutual grounding and energy.By focusing on micro-moments, we can build stronger connections in our personal and professional lives. Whether it's networking with colleagues or maintaining relationships with family members, it's not about the amount of time spent together but rather the quality of the interaction. So, next time you find yourself rushing through your day, remember to slow down and seize the power of micro-moments.

To create a real connection, let the other person do the talking. ‚úÖStart by using the word ""What"" and keep it between four to seven words.Ask them questions that will get them engaged in the conversation. Remember, your goal is to build a connection, which happens by being curious about the other person and holding space for them.Examples of such questions include:- What led you to your career path?- What are you noticing?- What challenges have you faced?- What is that like/What was that like?- What are your favorite accomplishments?Although these questions may seem simple, you'll be amazed by the results when you try them out.Practicing pausing and allowing the other person to finish speaking can be a powerful tool in connecting with others.‚ùåWhen asking questions, avoid using ""How"" or ""Why"" as they can create defensive answers.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-07-27,"Looking to join a board of directors or advisors for a startup?üëÄKnow the differences between the two and how to position yourself for success.üåüüëáBoth boards of directors and advisors play essential roles in startups. Directors have a legal duty to shareholders, while advisors offer informal guidance.Understanding their distinct functions is crucial.Boards of directors are more common in larger companies or those with outside investors. They approve significant decisions and protect shareholders' interests.üõ°Ô∏èSuch boards are vital for maintaining trust and accountability.On the other hand, boards of advisors offer more casual support to early-stage startups.üë•They share expertise and connections, without being fiduciaries. Their informal nature allows for flexibility and adaptability.To become an attractive board candidate, invest in your personal brand. Promote your expertise and be a thought leader in your industry.A strong personal brand will open doors to new opportunities.üí°When evaluating board offers, perform a SWOT analysis. Assess the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This will help you make an informed decision about potential rewards and risks.üö©Companies with too many advisors might raise red flags. They might be using them as window dressing to hide deeper issues or even list them without consent. A high-quality company will maintain a small, carefully selected group of advisors.Once on a board, be proactive in learning about the company and its culture. Seek mentorship from fellow board members and add value to the organization.Your contribution can help lead the company to greater heights. üöÄ#entrepreneurship #startups #investing",11,2,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

The year before, I‚Äôd made my previous boss $24M personally by running the #1 fund in the world at his firm.I stayed in the breaking-in phase of my career for too long. Making money for others.Break in, build your accomplishments, and use your great track record to run and own your own company, fund, or financial firm.After you break into a great firm and build a track record, an ownership stake will increase your chances of getting to $100M (and beyond).  Mistake #2: Taking the gas offNever take the gas off.  Mental breaks refresh you for the next push.  But when you stop pushing and get complacent, your bank account will quickly move in reverse.Compounding and growing wealth takes commitment year in and year out.  Stay the course. Often people take the gas off because they have reached their (too small) goals.

As a board director, you'll have the opportunity to work with multiple companies, giving you the chance to diversify your equity portfolio while working with varied management teams. This role allows you to focus more on strategy, especially in private companies with fewer regulatory requirements. Over time, a great reputation will lead to more lucrative offers and the option to choose where you spend your time.Being a board member also comes with non-monetary perks, including frequent flier miles, visiting beautiful locations, and networking with high-performing individuals.However, there are also challenges to being a board member. Landing your first board seat is no easy feat, as companies are the ones to approach you based on their specific needs. Board composition depends on factors like employee count, equity availability, and current company goals.Additionally, the role of a board member is not for everyone. If you dislike meetings or have a micromanagement approach, this job might not be suitable. Board members need to maintain a bird's-eye view and focus on shareholders' interests, strategic advice, and advising the C-suite.In crisis situations, board members may face immense stress and even risk losing their positions and being sued. Furthermore, real wealth building comes from joining companies with a rising stock price, while joining a static or failing company offers fewer benefits.When joining a small private company board that only pays in equity, be aware of tax liabilities associated with stock options as they're not liquid. Many of my friends require a minimum cash compensation to cover tax liabilities from options grants.Being a board member can be a rewarding and high-stakes career for those with the right skills and mindset.

It's finding and investing in those with long-term growth potential. Although this varies based on the size, location, and tier of VC, starting pay (salary plus bonus) can range from $100-200K. Moving up to $400-600K for mid-level VCs (5 years in). The endpoint is to be a Venture Capital Fund Partner or Founder. This is where you can make tens of millions to billions (Bill Gurley, Marc Andreeson, Peter Thiel are all worth billions). üëâPrivate EquityPE is about investing in already established private companies or buying out public companies and delisting them from the public market. The average pay as an associate here is about $247,500. The endpoint here is to be a PE Fund Partner or Founder. Here success is measured in tens of millions to billions (the founders of Blackstone, Apollo, KKR, and more).üëâHedge FundHedge funds are aggressive investments in a wide variety of industries. The median salary for hedge fund managers is around $135,706. This is because most funds try and pay a minimum salary and pay you everything else as carry. The endpoint here is to be a Hedge Fund Partner or Founder. Those who found their own firms (or run one) can make hundreds of millions in a single year and billions over their career. üëâFounder/C-Suite Founders make the companies. C-Suite is a fancy name for the collection of executive officers, like CEOs and CFOs. Depending on the position, median pay can be as high as $754,700 (Chief Executive Officer) or as low as $217,140 (Chief Information Security Officer). But these pay averages include public companies, which is not where you‚Äôre going to make big steps up in wealth. The endpoint here is to be a Founder or C-Suite of an IPOed unicorn company and get in before it IPOs. üëâBoard DirectorThese are governing bodies of public companies, elected by the shareholders, who meet regularly to set the company‚Äôs course in terms of mergers and investments. Board member compensation comes mostly in stock options and is thus based on the company‚Äôs value. This can be into the millions to tens of millions every year. The endpoint here is to be a Board Director of multiple IPOed unicorn companies. The real benefit to board service is you can do this with 4 or more companies at once. This increases your chances of success, and if more than one has this success, you can be making this money in parallel by being on multiple boards.#startups #careers #entrepreneurship",10,2,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Systems built for a lifetime of leverage. üóÉÔ∏èIn today's fast-paced world, it's easy to miss high-leverage opportunities that can propel our careers forward. One common mistake is failing to build systems that reinforce relationships, such as using a personal CRM tool to keep track of contacts and follow up with them over time. Without these systems in place, we may miss out on valuable connections and opportunities.Consider the story of two investment bankers, Cindy and Marie. While both are successful and hardworking, Marie uses a CRM to help maintain and deepen her relationships with clients and colleagues. This systematic approach gives her a significant advantage over Cindy, who relies on more traditional methods that ultimately waste time and effort.So, how can you make the most of low-leverage opportunities? Start by collecting business cards at meetings, connecting with attendees on LinkedIn, and adding their information to your CRM. This simple practice can help you build a network of decision-makers, such as CEOs and portfolio managers, who can support your career growth in the future.Remember, it's not just about networking; it's about building systems that work for you. These systems can save you time and effort, allowing you to focus on what truly matters in your career. Whether it's a CRM, a spreadsheet, or another tool, find a way to keep track of your professional relationships and leverage them for success.By focusing on high-leverage opportunities and investing in systems that streamline your work, you can increase your visibility and accelerate your career growth.Don't let high-leverage opportunities pass you by.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-11-27,"How do you know if a money management career is for you?I found out with $30K in debt and a horse.Here's how üëá At 25 years old, my work experience was riding horses and filing lawsuits. I‚Äôd been investing on and off since age 16, with bouts of huge success (and big losses). As I entered my MBA at USC, I had just experienced a huge loss, ending up with $30K debt and a horse which I sold for $30K. I convinced the brokerage firm to let me run with 50% margin debt (allowed by the exchanges at the time)..I doubled that $60K ($30K cash, $30K margin) to $120K in just six months, and my friend Trish said: ""You know, people would pay you to do that!""This was the first time I thought about being a professional investor. My MBA and developing an investing system that fit with my style and personality helped me make the career switch. No company would hire a horse trainer to run millions of dollars, thus the MBA.No company will let you go through the kind of losses I went through, even with the gains, thus the investing system. The first thing I did was to get a 3 year track record managing money at an insurance company. A 3-year track record against the stock market is the same no matter where you work. Then you can take that and get a job anywhere, even if you didn‚Äôt go Ivy.In 1999, I co-ran the #1 Mutual Fund in the world, up 493%, AND delivered an up 20% year in 2000 when markets retreated.

Just look at @Elon Musk, whose aggressive goals and share grants have earned him billions. And he's not alone - numerous CEOs have made well over $100 million in a year. But it's not just about the money. You'll have more control and freedom to make decisions and direct your company, and you'll gain invaluable experience that could lead to board positions in the future. If you can put on your resume that you scaled a company up from $5 million to $50 million, or to $500 million in revenues, people will want you on their board of directorsPlus, you'll be doing what you love, which is essential for success in the startup world.However, the C-Suite lifestyle isn't without its negatives. Building a unicorn often means helping wealthy investors make even more money, which may not provide the job satisfaction you're after. Additionally, the lack of structure and clear direction in startups can be challenging. If you need a well-defined path to follow, a startup might not be the best fit for you.

We hurry from one task to another, always eager to move to the next thing. However, we must learn to pause, breathe, and savor the micro-moments. These are opportunities to invest a little energy and attention, resulting in significant returns on our relationships and connections.Micro-moments can be as short as five, ten, or twenty minutes of deep, focused conversation. By giving 100% of your attention, curiosity, and questions to the other person, you create a powerful connection. Contrast this with the hours spent ""networking"" at events, where real connections rarely form. High performers, whether friends or life partners, will appreciate your ability to make the most of your time together, rather than requiring hours to get to know you.‚ùåIt's important to debunk the myth that connections must be built through grand gestures. Instead, it's all about micro-moments of connection.

Everyone's talking about getting into PE, but is it really for you? ü§îLet's take a closer look at the positives and negatives of this industry üëá‚ûï Private Equity Positives:1. Private equity offers more stability compared to investment banking or venture capital, thanks to a lesser cyclicality and business ownership. Even if deals dry up, PE firms still have businesses to monitor, and larger firms are often diversified to perform well in different economic scenarios.2. If the risk and volatility of the market aren't your thing, focusing on private businesses with a track record might suit you better.3. Working in private equity can be a high-trust business, allowing you to build strong relationships with management teams who rely on your capital, direction, and expertise in future mergers. If job satisfaction for you also includes helping other businesses, this industry might be quite appealing.‚ûñ Private Equity Negatives:1. The entry-level position in private equity involves a lot of grunt work like modeling pro-forma financial statements for firms you own, potential deals, mergers in progress, and more. 2. If you started in investment banking and despised the modeling and the stress of deals, private equity might not be the right choice.3. If you're not a fan of ""fire drill"" behavior, late nights, and lack of control over your calendar ‚Äì a common lifestyle for those involved in numerous deals ‚Äì you might want to reconsider diving into private equity.If the positives outweigh the negatives, private equity could be a rewarding career choice.

Smart work: In VC, you'll be working with intelligent people, analyzing trends and making calculated decisions.2. Future-focused: By funding innovation, you'll help shape the future and support promising companies.3.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-06-27,"Are you missing high-leverage opportunities in your career? üöÄEven if you're a networking pro and exercise daily, you might still overlook the chance to build significant leverage.The key to success? Systems built for a lifetime of leverage. üóÉÔ∏èIn today's fast-paced world, it's easy to miss high-leverage opportunities that can propel our careers forward. One common mistake is failing to build systems that reinforce relationships, such as using a personal CRM tool to keep track of contacts and follow up with them over time. Without these systems in place, we may miss out on valuable connections and opportunities.Consider the story of two investment bankers, Cindy and Marie. While both are successful and hardworking, Marie uses a CRM to help maintain and deepen her relationships with clients and colleagues. This systematic approach gives her a significant advantage over Cindy, who relies on more traditional methods that ultimately waste time and effort.So, how can you make the most of low-leverage opportunities?Start by collecting business cards at meetings, connecting with attendees on LinkedIn, and adding their information to your CRM. This simple practice can help you build a network of decision-makers, such as CEOs and portfolio managers, who can support your career growth in the future.Remember, it's not just about networking; it's about building systems that work for you. These systems can save you time and effort, allowing you to focus on what truly matters in your career. Whether it's a CRM, a spreadsheet, or another tool, find a way to keep track of your professional relationships and leverage them for success.By focusing on high-leverage opportunities and investing in systems that streamline your work, you can increase your visibility and accelerate your career growth.Don't let high-leverage opportunities pass you by.Build systems that work for you, focus on high-leverage opportunities, and watch your career soar to new heights.#careers #personaldevelopment #management",8,6,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-05-27,"How to Break Into Private EquityThe end goal is to become a Fund Partner or Founder. Here are some paths to that goal:Your best starting point to getting into PE is getting a job at an investment bank.¬† This is because about 95% of people that work in PE come through investment banking.¬† First, you start out at a top-tier investment bank as an associate for two years. You attend the Private Equity superdays for the firms you like. Then, you‚Äôre hired into a private equity firm as an associate. From there, you focus on moving up the ranks. Eventually, you get to the point where you‚Äôre running a fund. Then, you work your way into becoming the partner founder of a private equity fund. Either by founding your own firm or launching your own fund at the firm where you work.Another way, but honestly less likely, is you could start in management consulting for three years. From there, you get hired into a private equity firm as an associate. Then, like the path above, you start moving up to the point where you‚Äôre running a private equity fund. Once you‚Äôre at that stage, you work your way into becoming a partner or founder of a fund.A third path you could take is to be more senior at a VC firm that is doing deals alongside PE firms, both investing in late-stage growth companies. You could then make a lateral move as a partner from VC over to PE. This is also far rarer than the first example. Again, you‚Äôre aiming to run a private equity fund, and from there, leverage your experience into founding a fund or firm.You could also start out as a company founder, or hold a key role at a company acquired by a private equity firm. From there, you can work to leverage your position into becoming a principal or partner in that firm.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-06-27,"Venture Capital: A high-risk, high-reward career choice.üíºIs it the right path for you? ü§îDiscover the pros, cons, and what it takes to break into the industry.üëáVenture Capital (VC) is an alluring career choice for those seeking a high-stakes, high-reward path. It's a field that requires intellect, resilience, and persistence to make a mark. But is it the right fit for you? Let's dive into what a career in VC looks like.VCs spend their time researching and predicting future trends, navigating through pitch decks, and networking with founders and board directors. They have the power to shape the future by investing in promising companies and innovations. But with enormous rewards come significant challenges.Positives of a VC career include intellectual stimulation, focusing on future innovations, and the potential for wealth-building. However, there are negatives: dealing with large egos, risks with other people's money, and long hours spent on networking.Breaking into VC can happen through various paths, like starting in investment banking, being part of a successful startup, or even beginning as a scout. But if you find that VC isn't the right fit, there are plenty of opportunities to pivot into related fields, such as operational support for portfolio companies or investment banking.Regardless of the path you choose within VC, there are several factors to consider when identifying high-leverage opportunities. Focus on industries that are timely, sustainable, and have a catalyst for growth. VCs must identify bottlenecks and find solutions to address them.

Look for leverage in everyday moments, and don't be afraid to reframe unleveraged situations into leveraged ones.Then, create systems that support your goals. This involves cutting out what you don't want to do, automating what you can, and fully concentrating on where you enjoy and deliver the most value.

Curiosity & First Principles Thinking üß†Top fund managers approach investing with a sense of curiosity and a penchant for first principles thinking. This mindset enables them to dig deep into the underlying factors that drive a company's performance and uncover hidden truths that others may miss. This keen sense of curiosity has led to the discovery of frauds like Enron and Worldcom, saving investors from significant losses.2. Endurance, Self-Reliance & Single-mindedness üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èManaging a fund is a marathon, not a sprint. The best fund managers possess unwavering endurance and self-reliance, allowing them to work long hours and maintain focus on their goals. They understand the importance of staying on their own path, taking in ideas from others, but ultimately remaining true to their own system and strategy.3. Flexibility & Confidence üí™Balance is key in the world of fund management. Top fund managers strike the perfect balance between humble confidence and flexibility. While it's essential to stay true to one's strategy, it's equally important to adapt when necessary and avoid becoming married to a losing approach. Embracing cognitive dissonance and remaining open to new ideas is crucial in staying ahead of the curve.Bonus qualities: Hypervigilance & Oversensitivity üëÄWhile not necessarily traits to envy, hypervigilance and oversensitivity have proven beneficial in the world of investing. Top fund managers can sense changes in people's moods and energy levels, allowing them to anticipate shifts in company performance. This heightened sense of awareness can provide valuable insights and inform investment decisions.Stay true to yourself, keep learning, and success will follow.

They paid for net performance, or ""Alpha,"" with the famous two and twenty fee structure (2% of Assets Under Management and 20% of returns). This aimed to align clients with hedge fund managers, focusing on absolute returns in any market.However, the problem with hedge funds is that a poor manager can lose money both ways. Two things happened as a result: talent dilution and client institutionalization.Talent dilution occurred as the attractive fees brought in managers who didn't know what they were doing, leading to losses on both shorts and longs. This drove the emergence of leveraged long strategies like 120/20 and 130/30 in the late 1990s.Client institutionalization shifted hedge funds from being solely for the rich to an asset class for institutions like college endowments. This led to the implementation of risk management practices, transforming the hedge fund landscape and spawning firms like Citadel, which perfected Reversion to the Mean and Pairs trading.The Market Neutral strategy emerged, going long and short on two similar names to minimize tracking error. Citadel could run billions of dollars in this manner, charging two and twenty while reducing volatility.Today, multiple hedge fund strategies exist, catering to various investor needs. Though the market share of hedge funds is decreasing, opportunities can still be found as long as one is aware of the challenges.#investing #venturecapital #careers",7,1,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-09-27,"How to Break Into Private EquityThe end goal is to become a Fund Partner or Founder. Here are some paths to that goal:Your best starting point to getting into PE is getting a job at an investment bank.  This is because about 95% of people that work in PE come through investment banking.  First, you start out at a top-tier investment bank as an associate for two years. You attend the Private Equity superdays for the firms you like. Then, you‚Äôre hired into a private equity firm as an associate. From there, you focus on moving up the ranks. Eventually, you get to the point where you‚Äôre running a fund. Then, you work your way into becoming the partner founder of a private equity fund. Either by founding your own firm or launching your own fund at the firm where you work.Another way, but honestly less likely, is you could start in management consulting for three years. From there, you get hired into a private equity firm as an associate. Then, like the path above, you start moving up to the point where you‚Äôre running a private equity fund. Once you‚Äôre at that stage, you work your way into becoming a partner or founder of a fund.A third path you could take is to be more senior at a VC firm that is doing deals alongside PE firms, both investing in late-stage growth companies. You could then make a lateral move as a partner from VC over to PE. This is also far rarer than the first example. Again, you‚Äôre aiming to run a private equity fund, and from there, leverage your experience into founding a fund or firm.You could also start out as a company founder, or hold a key role at a company acquired by a private equity firm. From there, you can work to leverage your position into becoming a principal or partner in that firm. Then, like all the above, you want to run a private equity fund, and from there, become the partner or founder of a fund.#careers #money #investing",6,2,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-08-27,"I have been working in finance for over 25 years.These are the 3 simple (but effective) pieces of advice I'd give anyone starting out (or who wants to get started):1. Build a Foundation of Health üí™Just like a house, your life can crumble without a healthy and strong foundation.  Your sleep, nutrition, and exercise are the interconnected rebar in your strong foundation. Invest time and energy into getting enough quality sleep, drinking water, cutting out sugar, eating whole foods, and moving more daily.  Invest each day to love yourself, move a little, and eat something healthy - you‚Äôll see big returns. It‚Äôs how I was able to be world or nationally-ranked in 3 sports while working 80-100 hour weeks. Without a foundation of health, you won‚Äôt be able to enjoy what you are working so hard for.2. Grow and strengthen your network with micro-moments üåêInstead of seeing life as a never-ending checklist and rushing through,  slow down, breathe, and savor the micro-moments of connection.When you meet someone, focus intently and entirely on them - for a limited amount of time. Treat the person you are with as the center of the universe. Turning towards someone and giving them 100% (not just 95%, or even 99%) of your love, connection, and caring one moment at a time. The focus makes them feel seen. The limited amount of time removes the pressure and also saves time.  These moments add up, like deposits in a bank account. Micro-moments of connection are your power networking move, in business, friendships, and at home.3. Create systems that support your goals üèÜProductivity systems shouldn‚Äôt be only about fitting more in.List out your values, future vision, and mission. Then make your systems work for you by cutting out what you don‚Äôt want to do and automating what you can. Then fully concentrate on where you enjoy and deliver the most value. Your systems should support your mission, vision, and values and give you more breathing room.Honestly, I wish someone had told me these 3 things earlier in my career.But I'm at least glad I can pass them along to you.

Work on operational support teams If networking and deal-making aren't your strong points, you could find your niche in a VC firm's operational support team. In this role, you'll be helping portfolio companies with their day-to-day operations, rather than climbing the VC ladder to eventually run your own fund.3. Move into investment bankingIf you find yourself working at a larger VC firm that helps companies go public and decide it's not the right fit for you, consider transitioning into investment banking. In this role, you could help companies with their initial public offerings (IPOs) and other financial transactions.4.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-08-27,"VCs play ""Where's the Bottleneck?""üîçIn today's economy of excess capital and information, we need a new approach.The venture capital landscape has evolved dramatically over the past four decades. From a time of scarcity, we now face a problem of capital abundance. With nocode democratizing access to technology, the question arises: what should VCs focus on in the years to come?When faced with excesses, it's crucial to identify the new bottleneck. Right now, it's people. We need to figure out how to keep them, leverage their work, and compensate for the lack of available engineers. For each business VCs invest in, they should ask, ""Is it unlocking a bottleneck?""Historically, bottlenecks have shifted over time. From slow PCs to slow internet, each era had its pain point. Companies like Intel, Cisco Systems, and AMD were able to capitalize on these bottlenecks and make fortunes. The trick is to ask, ""Where has the bottleneck moved to?"" and ""Does the bottleneck have a far better solution that can be monetized for years?""Timing is essential. Investing in AI stocks or any other trending sector should be done with caution, as market valuations can be inflated. As a VC, it's important to wait for the right opportunity, ie when public stock markets pull back, more attractive valuations in private companies may arise.So, how do you find bottlenecks? Stay observant. Pay attention to pop culture, conversations with friends and colleagues, and trending topics on social media platforms. Look for emerging trends and ask yourself why they exist, how long they'll last, and what solutions can be derived from them.Moreover, VCs should also consider the sustainability, catalyst, timeliness, and value of a venture. Overvalued investments might not yield significant profits, so it's vital to assess potential ventures thoroughly.#venturecapital #investing #entrepreneurship",6,2,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Rather, a career is ""right"" if it's close to the money machine and has embedded leverage, ultimately setting you on the path to $100M.How did they reach such heights of success?

Whether it's networking with colleagues or maintaining relationships with family members, it's not about the amount of time spent together but rather the quality of the interaction.So, next time you find yourself rushing through your day, remember to slow down and seize the power of micro-moments.They just might change your life.#personaldevelopment #careers #management",5,6,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-08-27,"Hedge funds: A world of brilliance or a pressure cooker? ü§îThe industry is known for its brilliant minds, but it's also infamous for its high-stress environment.üëáHere's a look at the pros and cons of a career in hedge funds: Hedge funds are known for attracting the smartest minds in investing and providing a fast-paced, challenging work environment. When working at a top hedge fund, you'll have access to the smartest management teams and clients, and be viewed as ""smart money."" This environment can be incredibly stimulating for those who thrive on intellectual challenge and personal growth.However, with great rewards come great challenges. Hedge funds are notorious for high-stress, high-pressure work environments. Eighty to ninety-hour work weeks are not uncommon, and the constant demands can take a toll on your health and well-being. Working alongside brilliant, yet stressed-out individuals could lead to tense situations and even personal meltdowns.Moreover, the pressure to perform and generate profits for already wealthy clients can feel empty and devoid of personal meaning. If you value a sense of purpose in your career, you may want to think twice before diving into the world of hedge funds.Lastly, the high-stakes, high-pressure environment can sometimes push individuals to bend or break the rules. You might find yourself pressured to engage in illegal or unethical activities, which can have severe consequences on your career and personal life.A career in hedge funds offers incredible opportunities for growth, intellectual challenge, and working with some of the brightest minds in the industry. However, it comes with significant drawbacks such as high stress, long hours, and potential ethical dilemmas. It's essential to weigh the pros and cons and consider whether the hedge fund environment aligns with your values, goals, and personality before pursuing a career in this field.In my book, $100M Careers, I dive deeper into the hedge fund career and show you how to map your career path. #careers #investing #management",5,Comment,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Here‚Äôs the anatomy of a great pitch üëáThat 90 seconds is broken down into 2 main sections. In the first 10 to 30 seconds, you need to state what I call ACT:‚Äì Action: Which stock should I buy, sell, or avoid, and what is the target price/return?‚Äì Catalyst: What‚Äôs the 1 thing that‚Äôs going to move the stock? What will make the stock go up or down? You need to identify and define it. For instance, for Netflix, it‚Äôs user growth.‚Äì Timing: When should I buy or sell it? What‚Äôs the expected return over what period?In the next 30 to 60 seconds, you need to elaborate:‚Äì Support the catalyst and the timing with TWO or THREE well-curated facts or data points. Why is this positive catalyst happening now?  Why is it sustainable?  ‚Äì Address the resistance. What counter-argument will people have? What alternative investments might they have in mind? EXAMPLEFirst 10-30 seconds: Buy XYZ at $193 for 40% upside to the $275 level in the next year. Their role in blockchain payments will be far greater than anticipated. Next 30-60 seconds: XYZ has done this before, where people didn‚Äôt believe in their ability to profitably lend to small businesses.  Their CEO and founder has been involved in crypto payments since the early days of Bitcoin.  XYZ itself has already built the infrastructure for crypto payments.  XYZ is poised to be the leader in connecting small businesses to crypto payments.Delivering great stock pitches was the key to me winning EVERY job offer in my career, each time over candidates with better resumes.

Venture Capital: As a venture capitalist, you invest in startups with long-term growth potential, ultimately becoming a partner or founder of a VC firm. Successful VC professionals like Bill Gurley, Marc Andreessen, and Peter Thiel have amassed immense wealth in this field.2. Private Equity: In private equity, you invest directly in private companies or buy out public ones. The endpoint here is to be a private equity fund partner or founder, positions that can make tens of millions to billions.3. Hedge Fund: Managing investments in various industries, hedge fund partners or founders can make hundreds of millions in a single year and billions over their careers.4. Founder/C-suite: Founders create companies, and C-suite executives run them. By becoming a founder or C-suite executive of a successful company, you can increase your wealth exponentially, just like Jeff Bezos (AMZN), Bill Gates (MSFT), and Larry Page and Sergey Brin (GOOG).5. Board Director: As a board director, you govern public companies, making decisions that impact their future success.

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-07-27,"Old Money, New Rules: The Hedge Fund CareerToday, there are multiple hedge fund strategies for this high-leveraged career:1. Short Only: This involves hunting down overvalued stocks, and often snooping around to find trouble signs ignored by other investors; if they can find accounting fraud or another type of malfeasance, they can earn big!2. Quantitative: This is all about using a lot of statistical models, called Quantitative Analysis, or QA. They often use technology to make trades based on these mathematical models, or even implement machine learning. 3. Event-Driven: This focuses on buying the debt of companies in financial distress, as that can yield high potential returns. 4. Global Macro: This is all about examining the global macroeconomic trends, focusing on how they will impact interest rates, currencies, commodities, or equities all across the globe.5. Merger Arbitrage: This is all about deriving returns from takeovers. Takeovers are subject to a lot of conditions, like regulatory approval and a favorable vote by the target company‚Äôs shareholders, so funds bet whether or not the mergers will get done.6. Convertible Arbitrage: This is all about thriving on volatility, focusing on trading convertibles, a type of hybrid bond.7. Fixed Income Arbitrage: This focuses on eliminating credit risk by focusing on risk-free government bonds, buying them in one market and selling them in another. 8. Market Neutral: This is all about trying to get zero net-market exposure, where shorts and longs have equal market value.9. Credit: This is focusing on credit rather than interest rates, trading in complex structured debt vehicles.10. Equity Long/Short: This is the classic, the old school; bet on the expected winners with long positions, and bet on the expected losers with short.11. Multi-Strat: Funds like Millenium have many types of managers with different strategies chosen from the above menu of 10 strategies as well as ones I haven‚Äôt listed. It‚Äôs a one-stop-shop for clients who can move money between managers while keeping it in the firm. This segment has grown rapidly as assets are more sticky for the hedge fund company while institutional investors have more choice. Research the areas that you‚Äôd like to be in. But keep in mind, hedge funds are a smaller percentage of institutional investors‚Äô overall allocation, as they have invested more in passive long-only strategies, as well as VC and PE funds during long bull markets.Though the market share of hedge funds is decreasing, opportunities can still be found as long as one is aware of the challenges. üìà#investing #careers #venturecapital",4,Comment,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Emmy Sobieski CFA,Female,2023-07-27,"Mastering micro-moments can skyrocket your career and personal relationships üöÄWe often underestimate the power of focused connection and deep listening.Here's how these skills can make all the difference: ‚¨áÔ∏èIn today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in our own thoughts and ambitions. However, taking the time to pause, be curious, and ask questions can significantly improve our professional and personal relationships. To truly excel, one must learn to incorporate advanced micro-moment skills into their interactions.ü§îFirst, learn to use specific asks. Instead of asking a vague question like, ""Who do you know who could help me?"", try being more precise. For example, ""I noticed you worked with Joe at your last firm. Could you introduce me so I could ask him about what skills I should add to break into FP&A at a firm like his?"" This approach demonstrates that you've done your research and value the person's time and connections.‚åõSecond, practice time blocking. When engaging someone, always mention how much of their time you'll take and stick to it. Though it may be tempting to extend the conversation if they seem relaxed, respecting their time demonstrates professionalism and leaves a positive impression.üíéLastly, believe that you can give value. Even as a college student or someone early in their career, you can offer value to seasoned professionals by understanding their pain points and offering creative solutions. The benefits extend beyond your professional life‚Ä¶By genuinely listening and focusing on others during interactions, you'll forge stronger personal connections with family and friends. It's not about the quantity of time spent with loved ones but the quality of those moments that truly matter.By practicing these advanced micro-moment skills, you can open doors to new career opportunities and enrich your personal relationships. #careers #personaldevelopment #entrepenurship",2,1,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABWFie8B8fDf38Kg9hW8O1evNvA7A8s8fII&keywords=emmy%20sobieski%20cfa&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=3fec08fe-0c77-48db-b257-20fe7cbb3609&sid=%3BE%2C&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
