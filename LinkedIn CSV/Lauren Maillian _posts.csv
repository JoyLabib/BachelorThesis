Lauren Maillian ,Female,2023-12-27,"In 2023, the goals I wanted to achieve were guided by a simple yet powerful question: ""What would happen if I ____"" every day, week, or month? It became my compass for intentional change. Every year, I set goals aimed at becoming the best version of myself, seeking breakthroughs that resonate across all aspects of my life.üìàThis past year, I invested time and resources where I knew consistency was critical. In 2024, my commitment is to continually ask, ""How can this be more efficient and productive?"" üôèüèæ I aspire to be more than just a productive professional in 2024. I aim to be a present and productive mom, wife, family member, and friend, armed with systems and procedures for maximum effectiveness.üîëHaving a breakthrough last year meant standing still, investing in myself, and walking away from draining aspects of life and work. 2023 became a year of taking inventory, regaining control of things that I felt were running me, investing in family, and sparking positive change in my surroundings to foster transformation at scale.üí°As we step into the New Year, here‚Äôs my simple advice: focus on efficiency and productivity to make space for you to be able to give your all consistently. You don't want to find yourself wondering, ""What would've happened if‚Ä¶.""üöÄ Success demands consistency, commitment, mental toughness and the ability to analyze and adapt. Prioritizing my vision led to personal and professional transformation. I intentionally stepped away from leading a nonprofit I scaled to 5x to embrace new opportunities. I became  Cartier Women's Initiative DEI Jury President, took e.GO Mobile public on Nasdaq with Athena Capital, was tapped to lead Hero Media Inc. as President, became an Advisor to Overtime and helped acquire a $100M Black-owned hair care brand.‚ú®This transformative journey extended to my family, pushing us all to be our best. Parenthood urged me to raise my standards amid a changing world.ü´∂üèæ2023 brought unforgettable personal moments, from Chloe's 8th grade graduation to Jayden's varsity soccer championship and the launch of JaydenMaillian.com - witnessing my children grow into young adults was a profound joy.üí™üèæ My husband, Robert, reached new heights in his career as an Executive Health and Performance Coach, leaving an indelible impact on ambitious leaders. I benefited from his coaching and the routine I crafted in 2023 for my own success. #BeExceptional üí´Transforming my setup to match my life goals reminded me that I'm worth it, and no mountain is too high. Imperfect as it may be, progress brings improvement and valuable lessons. #ThePathRedefined üí°In 2024 you will see efficiency powering my approach to business in aligninment with my promise not to miss precious family moments. I encourage you to focus on challenging yourself daily to make things run better so you can show up better. #HappyNewYear!

Lauren Maillian ,Female,2023-11-27,"In 2020, I wanted to do something that would become a driving force for changing the narrative around women of color as CEOs. I had a bold vision that created #TheNewCSuite with Cosmopolitan, in collaboration with my dear friend & publishing veteran, Nancy Berger. The New C-Suite list was the first of its kind, sparking critical groundbreaking dialogue about the roles women and women of color can have in business and executive leadership. By creating an opportunity to honor and recognize women of color as CEOs of their own businesses, we gave visibility to new voices. As the then CEO of digitalundivided, I launched the inaugural class of The New C-Suite during COVID in 2021 with Venus Williams as a fellow judge and Cosmo‚Äôs cover star. Last year, in 2022, Nancy and I made it massively bigger with a lunch at Philippe Chow, an all-day summit at Hearst Tower and an advertorial and Cosmo magazine spread for the founders in partnership with Saks OFF 5TH. This week, the 2023 list was announced and the vision had a life of its own without us. I am so happy to see familiar faces recognized as this year's honorees and to see this list live on! Many thanks to Cosmopolitan for seeing the importance of creating voice and visibility for women of color. Congratulations, ladies!

Scott still made time to mentor and guide me at the kitchen table for 2 hours and for us to have lunch to celebrate his publication day in between calls and press interviews.I ended up reading most of the book on our way home from Aspen back to Puerto Rico. Even after 22 years of friendship, reading about what I‚Äôve watched Scott navigate over the last 2+ decades - the highs and lows of industry and career - taught me so much.

Lauren Maillian ,Female,2023-11-27,"Like many of you, I‚Äôve been closely following the changes unfolding at OpenAI. It‚Äôs been an interesting study as someone who‚Äôs been on the Board of Directors at large institutions and more innovative non-profits for 10+ years, Chaired a nonprofit Board of Directors and has reported to a Board as CEO while pushing for innovation, social change and delivering unprecedented growth. There are key lessons here (in no particular order):- Innovative leadership requires a Board that believes in innovation and knows it‚Äôs an iterative exercise to achieve sustainable growth and impact at scale.- Hiring ambitious private sector talent in a nonprofit will almost always have its issues. Aligning on performance and incentives for the CEO should be iterative too.- Young leaders are bold and tenacious, it‚Äôs a skill and a gift that requires management. It is literally continuing education at its absolute best. When doing what‚Äôs never been done before, find a coach to nurture their vision strategically. - Boards are in place to govern the company and its CEO. You need different BODs for different stages of growth. Both CEO and BOD members have the ability to outgrow or grow apart from each-other. Find ways to have productive conversations about change. - Most young companies and leaders, fill their BOD quickly focused on brand-name affiliation or access to capital over skill-set and relevant experience. BODs need a balance of these factors to be effective.- Not every Board Director is an effective leader. They can have their own agenda and exhibit bad judgement too. Especially in nonprofits, when a singular board member or group thereof, may have their own motives. - Power imbalance is real. When or if, the BOD undermines the mission, it‚Äôs impossible for the CEO to lead and vice-versa. This happens in companies of all shapes and sizes. - A CEO‚Äôs job description generally includes board management. That is most difficult in a nonprofit, where the BOD isn‚Äôt incentivized either and the legal structure of being a public charity makes the CEO a non-voting member of the board, yet they lead the company and team every single day.- When the CEO creates the partnerships that fuel the growth, losing the leader will show everyone how integral and critical their leadership was.- As an executive or team member, when you know your worth, you know you can walk. If you built it, you know you can build it again and you learn from every single lesson to do better next time.- Being innovative creates options. Breaking the mold and building new approaches to business increases your value and that of everyone on your team who worked with you.

The data doesn't lie. It indicates what is really happening and why change is necessary. My job: to create the most powerful ways to story-tell the statistics we are pressed to share so we can create the change. I have been shaking up storytelling for the culture. For most of my career, I've been a brand strategist, marketer and storyteller. Now, I am armed with the data that's going to determine how inclusive the future truly is in business, brand and innovation. #WomenLeaders#WomenINBusiness#Tech#Diversity#Innovation#digitalundivided #Startups#Funding",42,Comment,4,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAJ5V3ABY_CuyDBMHONPLrxkcX5KmTlPSyQ%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAJ5V3ABY_CuyDBMHONPLrxkcX5KmTlPSyQ&keywords=lauren%20maillian&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=9ecbb674-cdae-4def-8b8f-22f3d1e10e0e&sid=x7K&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
