Indra Nooyi,Female,2024-04-27,"As I prepare to pass the baton tomorrow to a remarkable leader, Ramon Laguarta, I’ve had the chance to reflect on my 24 years at @PepsiCo. Looking ahead, I know our future is bright, not only because we’re fueled by an unmatched team of dedicated, passionate professionals, but also because Ramon is a seasoned operating executive and a hard-working, humble person. Leading and learning from the PepsiCo family has been the privilege of a lifetime, and saying goodbye will be one of the hardest things I do. I wanted to share the letter I sent our associates today to convey how much this group means to me, the profound impact they've had on my growth, and how excited I am for the next chapter.",38694,"1,508",0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAB-kxvABo1R6qNdFmbEv2VzlACGCdghNEqw%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAB-kxvABo1R6qNdFmbEv2VzlACGCdghNEqw&keywords=indra%20nooyi&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=00b35727-2703-41b9-a68d-c793e92bf969&sid=3(u&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Indra Nooyi,Female,2024-04-27,"When I was a child in India, my mother would ask my sister and me a simple but compelling question: “What would you do to change the world?” By the time I became CEO of PepsiCo in 2006, my answer was clear — I want to lead a company that is a force for good. Twelve years later, my answer is unchanged, and our sustainability mission — what we call Performance with Purpose — is more central to our business than ever before. I’m proud to share the progress we've made over the past year towards our 2025 goals — progress that’s good for our products, our planet, and our people  – and even prouder to share our PwP journey with the amazing team of PepsiCo associates who make our progress possible!",9145,264,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAB-kxvABo1R6qNdFmbEv2VzlACGCdghNEqw%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAB-kxvABo1R6qNdFmbEv2VzlACGCdghNEqw&keywords=indra%20nooyi&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=00b35727-2703-41b9-a68d-c793e92bf969&sid=3(u&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Indra Nooyi,Female,2024-04-06,"I recently read two books that I would strongly recommend to all.  The first is titled  “Education is freedom. The future is in your hands” written by my friend, James Keyes. In this book, author Keyes explores the ways education empowers people to take control of their lives, to pursue their dreams and to contribute to the world in meaningful and fulfilling ways. It is a captivating and easy read.  The second book that has me somewhat shook up is titled “ The anxious generation. How the great rewiring of childhood is causing an epidemic of mental illness” written by Jonathan Haidt. In his book, the author talks about the psychological damage caused by our phone based generation. But, he does not stop there.  He describes steps we can all take to end the epidemic of mental illness and restore a more humane childhood.  It is brilliantly written, and I am confident you will relate to every line, every chart, every conclusion in it.  After you read one or both, do send me your comments.  Or, more importantly, what you will do to address some of the issues and opportunities surfaced in the two books.Happy reading.",6454,180,109,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAB-kxvABo1R6qNdFmbEv2VzlACGCdghNEqw%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAB-kxvABo1R6qNdFmbEv2VzlACGCdghNEqw&keywords=indra%20nooyi&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=00b35727-2703-41b9-a68d-c793e92bf969&sid=3(u&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
