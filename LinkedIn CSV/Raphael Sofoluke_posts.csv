Raphael Sofoluke,Male,2023-07-27,"Congratulations to the 2023 AXA startup Angel competition winners in collaboration with Evening Standard ü§© The two winners won ¬£25K, business insurance for a year thanks to Axa and mentoring from myself and my fellow judges This years competition was fierce but these two winners Sistren and Intotum really stood out. Intotum ‚Äì Through collaboration with the disabled community, Hanan Tantush has created the UK‚Äôs first range of stylish functional clothing that works with your disability. After Hanan‚Äôs grandad faced his third battle with cancer, it resulted in a necessary stoma and urostomy bag. Post-surgery, he went from a well-dressed outgoing man to a much more reclusive lifestyle. He started wearing tracksuit bottoms for comfort and to cover the bag. Hanan believed that her grandad and others deserved better, and that‚Äôs why she launched Intotum. Sistren created by Olivia H. is a community building app that creates more equitable outcomes for Black women Through Sistren, Black women can gain insights, and forge meaningful connections that lead to better health, better job prospects, and better life chances. The app is revolutionising the way Black women build networks, develop knowledge, and access opportunities, creating a future where Black women are empowered, celebrated, and able to access what they need to succeed in all areas of life. This is not just good news for Black women, but for society too. Looking forward to mentoring these two great businesses !
