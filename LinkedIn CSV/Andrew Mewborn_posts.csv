Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-02-26,"The biggest lie ever...The more hours you put in, the more valuable you are.Let's dig into this:🚫 Hours worked are a mere quantity.✅ Value created is about quality.Ever had that one coworker who's first to arrive, last to leave, but you're never quite sure what they did all day? Or how about that rockstar team member who seems to get everything done in half the time?Remember:1 -- Efficiency trumps hours. Working smart is key. Know your goals, strategize, prioritize, and execute.2 -- Breaks enhance creativity. Moments of rest often birth the best ideas. Ever had that Eureka moment during a walk or a shower?3 -- Burnout kills value. Overworking diminishes the quality of work. Exhausted brains make mistakes.4 -- Redefine 'hard work'. It's not about hours clocked in but challenges overcome, solutions found, and results achieved.So next time you're burning the midnight oil ask yourself:Am I doing this for the illusion of productivity or am I genuinely creating value?Don't measure worth by the ticking clock.Measure it by the impact you make.Play full out,Andy___P.S.

Priceless. ==> 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 - The best ideas often come from those pillow talks. ==> 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 - They keep you grounded when the career-high gets too dizzying.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"One thing I’ve learned...  ""How to be great at anything?""  ↳This question haunts many.   But the answer is simpler than you think.  Here’s the no-BS, unsexy truth behind success:  1. TRY 2. BE BAD 3. BE GOOD 4. BE GREAT  It's a progression. A journey. A commitment.  The majority stall at step one, overthinking the ""how"" or the perfect moment. They wait for the stars to align, to feel 'ready'  Spoiler: You don't ever feel 100% ready.  Start NOW. Start BAD.  Because being bad at something is the first step to getting good at it.  Forget knowing 100% of everything. Own the mess, the mistakes, and the f*ck ups.  They're not just part of the process.  They ARE the process YALL.  And somewhere along that bumpy road from 'bad' to 'good,' something awesome happens.  You don't just learn how to do something well—you learn how to do it like a maestro. With your unique flair.  That's when you become GREAT.  Not flawless. Not infallible.  Just authentically, undeniably great.  Because in the end, mastery isn't about avoiding failure, it's about building resilience.  So, what are you waiting for?  The 'right' time is a myth.  The 'right' way is a trial.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-01-26,"Here's a truth bomb:  You're playing sales ALL WRONG.  Why? Because you're fixated on the 3%.  Yes, ONLY 3% of your leads are ready to buy NOW.  And what about the rest?  You're missing a HUGE opportunity with the other 97%.  Let's break it down:  3% are ready to swipe their cards. 17% are gathering info, weighing their options. 20% know they've got a problem but aren't sure how to solve it. A whopping 60%... they don't even REALIZE they have a problem yet! You’re chasing a tiny slice of the pie.  And ignoring the LARGER portion.  It's not just about pitching and closing deals.  It's about STRATEGY.  It's about NURTURING.  Imagine this:  You're fishing, but you’re only trying to catch the fish that jump into your boat.  Sounds ridiculous, right?  That’s exactly what you're doing in sales!  ↳ You need a system to capture and nurture leads at EACH stage.  • Create awareness for the 60%. • Educate and guide the 20%. • Offer value to the 17%. • And yes, close the 3%.  But you don't want to hear that, do you?  You want quick fixes. Instant results.  But here's the hard truth:  Your sales strategy isn't cutting it. Your effort is misplaced. YOU need to level up your game. I challenge myself EVERY DAY to understand these layers.  Next time you're wondering why sales aren't coming in, PAUSE.  Go to a mirror.  Ask yourself:  Are you REALLY addressing the full spectrum of your leads?  Ditch the tunnel vision.  Embrace the WHOLE journey of your customer.  Start nurturing. Start building.

The world is ours to conquer, no map needed.  At 30:  We've faced a few dragons, maybe slayed some, got burned by others. Now, we're all ears for a good battle strategy.

Here's the raw truth:  • Companies come and go. • Your personal brand? It's forever. • LinkedIn? It's your digital handshake.  YES.  That's right, I'm laying it out:  A. It's not your company's resume. B. It's your personal billboard. C. It's your career story.  It's more than just a job title. ↳ It's your legacy:  • Authenticity: Be genuine, be you. • Networking: Connect, don't just collect. • Growth: Share your journey, not just your job.  You might think it's just another platform.  But here's the deal:  1. Your LinkedIn is your first impression. 2. Your LinkedIn is your professional narrative. 3. Your LinkedIn is your control.  It's not just about the now.  I challenge you to take ownership every single day.  Here's the deal.  The next time your company wants to dictate your LinkedIn, STOP.  Ask yourself.  Is this my voice?

Scared? - The fear, the doubt, the what-ifs.4. Do It Scared - The courage, the bravery, the triumph.Let's get one thing straight:• Imposter syndrome? Kick it to the curb.• Perfectionism? It's just procrastination in disguise.• The need to be flawless? Dumb.Feeling 'ready' is the dividing line. The winners? They lace up and run the race with hearts pounding and palms sweating.Because in the end, 'ready' is not when everything's perfect.It's when you're brave enough to embrace imperfection and dive in anyway.So, who's with me?Let's redefine ready.

Showing up is not a secret...  but we often overlook it.  That’s 95% of winning. No, seriously.  ➟ Showing Up - It’s the commitment, the grind, the consistency. ➟ Other Stuff - It's strategy, skill, luck, or whatever else you bring to the table.

Winners aren’t the ones with just talent or good fortune—they’re the ones who show up, day in and day out.  So every morning when the alarm rings remember:  Showing up isn’t half the battle...

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-01-26,"Marketers, we've been living in a fantasy.  We've worshipped at the altar of the funnel:  A neat, tidy, color-coded pathway from awareness to purchase.  But let's face reality:  The consumer journey? It's not a sleek funnel.  It's a wild, tangled, unpredictable scribble.  That's how consumers ACTUALLY behave.  They don’t just glide smoothly down our funnels.  They loop back, take detours, and sometimes jump out entirely.  Sounds chaotic? Because it is.  But you're probably not ready to accept that.  You want the security of a funnel. The illusion of control.  Here's your reality check:  1. Your neat marketing funnel is too simplistic. 2. Your strategies need to account for real human behavior. 3. YOU need to navigate the complexity, not shy away from it.  The customer journey is a labyrinth.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"An idea I can’t stop thinking about...  9 months ago, I wouldn't have believed it.  My friend circle looked more like a packed theater than a cozy living room.   But as I've gotten older, I've noticed the seats emptying.  Elementary School → College → Now  It’s like watching the circle shrink in real-time.  Here's why it's actually been the best thing for me:  In elementary we're all about collecting friends like Pokémon cards.  In college, the circle gets tighter.   (Quality over quantity, right?)  Now, if my friend circle were a dot, I’d say it's more precious than a diamond.  I've learned something profound through this natural attrition:  ↳ Every season sheds the superficial.  ↳ What's left is solid gold.  I don't miss the noise.   I’m more interested in depth.  My friend circle?  It's not a circle anymore.  Honestly it's more like a dot (LOL).  Because at the end of the day, when the crowd thins out...  It’s those few precious dots that stick around.  They are the ones who make this journey freaking awesome.  ↳ Are you experiencing this too?  PS I used to think a packed party was a sign of success.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2023-12-26,"Don't do sales. Do nurturing.   Think of every interaction as planting the seed.   No one likes to be sold to:   → people want to be educated → people want to be entertained → people buy from people  Here's the reality:   At any moment, 3% of potential customers are ready to buy now. The other 97 percent fall into three categories:  • 60 percent are not problem aware. • 20 percent are problem aware. • 17 percent are in information-gathering mode.  Your goal should be to capture and nurture this 97 percent.  This is a mind f*ck to most.   If you're a CRO or CEO and you think it's all about top-of-funnel....  You are playing a losing game.    Here's how to think about it instead:   1. Nurture everything that's CLOSED - LOST.   • Nurture sequences • Invite to in-person events • Connect their c-levels with your c-levels   2.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-04-05,"Walk into many of today's startup offices, and you'll be greeted with perks. Pizza on Fridays. Cold beer in the fridge. A ping pong table waiting for the next match. But let's be clear:  That's not culture. That's decoration.  Culture is the vibe of your workplace.   It's the values lived so loudly you can feel them.  It's how you treat people from the interview to the exit interview—and every day in between.  Here's what REAL culture looks like:  • Transparency • Mutual Respect • Support for Growth • Recognition • Authentic Leadership  Now don't get me wrong, pizza's great and cocktails can be a blast.   But they’re the cherry on top, not the sundae.  The real meat?   How your team interacts when the chips are down.  ↳Do they have each other's backs? ↳Can they speak freely without fear? ↳Is there a shared purpose driving their daily hustle?  That's the stuff of legendary culture.   That's the glue that keeps teams fighting through thick and thin.  So, next time there's a ""culture-building"" event, ask yourself:  Does this reflect our core, or is it just another feel-good façade?

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-02-26,"An important truth:   You've been playing sales ALL WRONG.  Why? Because you're fixated on the 3%.  Yes, ONLY 3% of your leads are ready to buy NOW.  And what about the rest?  You're missing a HUGE opportunity with the other 97%.  Let's break it down:  → 3% are ready to swipe their cards. → 17% are gathering info, weighing their options. → 20% know they've got a problem but aren't sure how to solve it. → A whopping 60%... they don't even REALIZE they have a problem yet!  You’re chasing a tiny slice of the pie.  And ignoring the LARGER portion.  It's not just about pitching and closing deals.  It's about STRATEGY.  It's about NURTURING.  Imagine this:  You're fishing, but you’re only trying to catch the fish that jump into your boat.  Sounds ridiculous, right?  That’s exactly what you're doing in sales!  ↳ You need a system to capture and nurture leads at EACH stage.  • Create awareness for the 60%. • Educate and guide the 20%. • Offer value to the 17%. • And yes, close the 3%.  But you don't want to hear that, do you?  You want quick fixes. Instant results.  But here's the hard truth:  Your sales strategy isn't cutting it. Your effort is misplaced.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-01-26,"You've heard of building good habits.  But what about breaking the bad ones?  James Clear has your blueprint in his book Atomic Habits:   The four laws of behavior change.  Let's reverse engineer them to dismantle habits that hold you back.  1. 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗜𝗻𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲: Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment. 2. 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗨𝗻𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲: Reframe your mindset to highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits. 3. 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁: Increase the friction to make the bad habit harder to do. 4. 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗨𝗻𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝗳𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴: Create a consequence for the bad habit to make it seem less appealing.  It's a system, a formula, to rewrite your behavior.  But let's be real:  You probably don't want to confront your habits.  You're looking for an easier way out.  Here's your reality check:  1. Your environment is shaping your behavior. 2. Your mindset is reinforcing your bad habits. 3. YOU need to put in the work to change. It's not just about adopting new habits.  It's about shedding the old, limiting ones.  I challenge myself to apply these laws daily.  And I urge you to do the same.  Next time you catch yourself in a loop of negative habits, PAUSE.

Cold email still works if you do it right ;)   2) KEEP THE TEAM SMALL  Currently, I'm a solo founder.  We'll be bringing a couple people on shortly.  I've seen a friend get to $10M ARR with 6 people - seems like a good benchmark.    3) HIRE A+ PEOPLE AND PAY THEM 1.5X MARKET RATE  I'm a big believer in that the ROi of A+ people is like 10x that of a B-player.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2023-10-26,"In 9 months, we grew our SaaS startup from $0-$1m ARR with 0 salespeople.Here's my 5-step playbook for building a sales engine:Step 1) Create lead magnets• You can't expect people to go from 1 -> 10on the trust scale when buying your product. Create lead magnets that help you provide value, nurture prospects, and get them to a 5 on the trust scale. So when you ask for a sale they are already at a 5.____Step 2) You are NOT doing sales. You're doing nurturing.• At any moment, 3% of potential customers are ready to buy now. The other 97 percent fall into three categories:• 60 percent are not problem aware.• 20 percent are problem aware.• 17 percent are in information-gathering mode.Your goal should be to capture and nurture this 97 percent.____Step 3) Leverage influencers• Content is the new way to create demand. And your marketing team... probably not the best content creators.• Move your paid spend away from ads that produce 0 ROI and into striking deals with influencers that give you street cred.___Step 4) Experiment like CRAZY.• What works today, may not work tomorrow. You GOTTA build a culture of experimenting if you wanna make it. Test, test, test.___Step 5) Create an affiliate program• Affiliate programs are VERY underrated. I'm doubling down on building an affiliate program for Distribute. Why hire 1 salesperson when you can hire 100s?This may not be the move for everyone, but we saw success.Hit me with questions in the comments! 👇TL;DRStep 1) Create lead magnetsStep 2) Dial in your nurturing processesStep 3) Leverage influencersStep 4) Experiment like CRAZYStep 5) Create an affiliate program- Tio Andy",214,131,6,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAkQk7MB0tiY-Gcq0djXnh2wScE715lS9-I%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAkQk7MB0tiY-Gcq0djXnh2wScE715lS9-I&keywords=andy%20mewborn&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=5583466b-5adf-48d1-b2c4-af788ba180c3&sid=CTG&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"Everyone is saying ""Outbound is dead""   But then use the exact same playbook.   So what's the solution?   Here’s the reality:  Outbound has always been a game of attention.   And oh, how the game has changed.  → Content is now your opener, your intrigue, your reason why they'll listen.  Think about it:  That cold email?  ↳It gets clicked because your article just articulated their pain points.  That cold call?  ↳It’s answered because your video just showed up in their feed, solving a problem they had yesterday.  That meeting request?  ↳It’s accepted because your infographic was forwarded to their inbox, highlighting industry gaps they didn’t even know they had.  The sales game hasn’t changed.  The way we play it has.  → Content is your new first move.  The sales teams of today need to pivot.  From scripted calls to stories that sell. From mass emails to messages that matter. From playing the numbers to making the numbers work for you.  Here's my February breakdown for context:  • Outbound efforts? Same as always. • Results using old methods? Down by half.  But when we focused on content?  ⬆ Leads are up.  ⬆ Engagement is up.  ⬆ Conversions are up.  Don’t let your sales strategy be a relic.  Content is the future.  → It’s time to learn the new rules of the game.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-01-26,"Steal my secret to getting things done.  It's built on one principle:  Default To Action.  But you hesitate, don’t you?  ""I'm not ready,"" says that little voice in your head.  Here's the secret:  You'll never feel fully ready.  And that's exactly why 'Default to Action' is your mantra.  Because action is the antidote to uncertainty.  Here's your reality check:  1. Your quest for readiness is a procrastination disguise. 2. Your wait for the perfect moment is an illusion. 3. YOU need to pivot from planning to executing.  It's a simple choice. Act or stall.  I challenge myself every day to choose action.  And now, I challenge you:  Next time you catch yourself saying ""I'm not ready,"" flip the script.  Take the leap.  Move forward.  Because the truth is in the doing, not in the contemplating.  This isn't just about productivity.  It's about courage.  As for me?  I’m right here, making moves, not excuses.  Ready or not, I act.  This post? It’s a battle cry.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-04-05,"The simple sales pitch mistake you can't afford to make...  You've seen it.   The flashy product demo where they say: '𝙊𝙪𝙧 𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙞𝙨 10𝙭 𝙗𝙚𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙩!'   But let's get real—prospects aren’t looking for the next shiny object.  They're asking: What about the aftermath?  ↳ HANDLING old contracts. ↳ SWITCHING their data. ↳ TRAINING their team.  That's the meat and potatoes.  The real MVP of the sales game.  This chart below doesn't lie.  What buyers want to hear isn't a feature dump.   It's three simple words:  'WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED!'  Because when you take the burden off their shoulders, that's when they listen.  Here's the sales pitch evolution:  𝟭. 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 - ""Our product does X, Y, Z..."" 𝟮. 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀 - ""You'll achieve A, B, C..."" 𝟯. 𝗔𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲 - ""We'll handle EVERYTHING.""  Guess which one seals the deal?

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"How to stop getting ghosted.   Do these 3 tricks.   First, let's start with why you are getting ghosted:   1. It's the easy thing to do 2. They aren't the person who says YES 3. They don't owe you anything  And of course...  The problem you solve is currently a vitamin and not a painkiller.   Now...  What can you do to prevent the ghost:   ↓  1. Get their commitment to tell you if ""no"" is the answer  You can say something like:  ↳ ""Can we agree to maintain open communication if I can resolve your issue, and to inform me if we're not a good match?""  ____ 2. Set your own expectations  At any moment, 3% of potential customers are ready to buy now.   The other 97 percent fall into three categories:  • 60 percent are not problem aware. • 20 percent are problem aware. • 17 percent are in information-gathering mode.  Your goal should be to capture and nurture this 97 percent.  SOLUTION: Nurture the prospect with a sequence, process, system, etc.  It may be a ""no"" now.  But not a forever no.   ____ 3. Find another champion  Big mistake I see people make:   Think only 1 person can champion your product.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"If you use it right, cold email is the most powerful channel in the world. But 99% of salespeople make these DUMB mistakes. Here are the 3 mistakes most salespeople make (and what the 1% do instead):  MISTAKE 1: Ask for the meeting  This REEKs of being a sales email.   Instead:   • Offer a lead magnet • Give them an offer they can't refuse • Mention insights you've gathered from their team (like a detective)    MISTAKE 2: You use a 20-minute warmup  People have 10x more things fighting for their attention.   It’s important to understand:   • You must use a lot more curiosity • There’s a lot less buildup before you get to the point  People used to be open to the 20-minute warmup.   People aren’t that way anymore.   → Grab them → Get their attention with curiosity  → Drive them to the point you’re trying to make   MISTAKE 3: Using ""I"" like you are in love with yourself  Look for these words in your writing:   → I → me → my → we → ours  Why?   Those words show where you talk about yourself.   Your prospects don’t want to hear this.   They want to hear things that will benefit THEM.   Use these words instead:   - you - your - yours  That’s it.   Just rephrase a couple of sentences.   No: I want to tell you something here.” Yes: “Here’s something YOU need to know”   Now....

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-01-26,"You're out there, chasing leads like they're wild game.  But what if I told you there's a map to this maze?  Look at this blueprint – it’s the anatomy of lead generation.  There are FOUR core methods you need to nail:  1. Warm Outreach: You're knocking on doors where you're already a familiar face.  2. Cold Outreach: Here, you're the stranger with a handshake, making the right impression.  3. Post Free Content: Be the go-to resource, the well of knowledge that never runs dry.  4. Run Paid Ads: Put your money where your market is. Targeted, strategic, and to the point.  But wait, there's more.  It's not just you telling people about your stuff.  Others should be singing your praises too:  → Customers: Your satisfied clients are your cheerleaders.  → Affiliates: They're spreading the word, widening your reach.  → Employees: Your team can be your most powerful advocates.  →Agencies: They amplify your message, boosting your signal.  Sounds like a lot, doesn't it?  But you don't want a simple solution.  You want a reliable system.  Here's the truth:  • Your current lead gen strategy is probably too narrow.  • Your efforts are fragmented.  • YOU need to orchestrate your lead sources like a symphony.  This isn’t a sprint. It's a marathon with a relay team.  I challenge myself daily to optimize these channels.  Next time you're about to put all your eggs in one lead gen basket, STOP.  Take a step back.  Evaluate:  Are you utilizing the Core Four?  Are others advocating for you?  This is not just another strategy.  This is the ecosystem of lead generation.  As for me?  I'm here, building bridges, not just casting nets.  I'm aligning every piece of the puzzle.  No single thread, but a web of strategies.  This post? It's just the beginning.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"I went from being a bad salesperson to a good salesperson after working with 100s of sales teams.  After 5 years, I couldn't believe how simple it was.  I'll tell you the main tricks here so you don't have to figure it out on your own:  • 90% of sales is copywriting.  Copywriting is all about capturing attention. Capturing attention is about clarity and simplicity. A good attention-grabber in 3 sentences is better than a great attention grabber in 100 sentences. Copywriting is the best sales training available.  • A problem well stated is a problem half solved.  Sales means solving problems. Don't worry whether you are using MEDDPIC, BANT, SPIN, or SANDLER. You think the methodology you use is what closes deals. It's not. Just pick one. Then, learn how to problem-solve.  • Pipeline cures all ills.  Your pipeline is your insurance plan.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2023-10-26,"A company CEO doing $1.8M in ARR reached out for Lead-Gen advice.   Here were the 3 things I told him:   1. ""The most important part of your emails is not the subject lines. It's not the copy in the body. It's two things: (1) ensuring that they land in the freaking inbox and (2) the name of the person that is sending the emails. This is why creating content as the CEO is important. How much more likely is someone to open their email if they know your name?""   2. ""You sales team isn't doing 'sales' 97% of the time. At any moment, 3% of potential customers are ready to buy now. The other 97 percent fall into three categories: 60 percent are not problem aware, 20 percent are problem aware, 17 percent are gathering info. SOOOO......They are nurturing. Give them the tools to be the best at nurturing. When a deal is lost due to timing, who do you think has the better chance of winning the deal? The person that nurtured the prospect the best!""   3. ""You gotta get more people into your ecosystem through LEAD MAGNETS. Remember when I said 97% of people aren't ready to buy at any point in time? Ok then you gotta find those 97% of people that WILL buy at some point and grab their email""  Helpful for you?

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-02-26,"I spoke to the CEO of a $225,000,000 revenue company.  His team is launching a new product.  Me: ""How did you hear about me?""  Him: ""I spoke to a ton of people in the valley and your name came up like four times.""  Me: ""Haha I probably TEEPEED their house as a teenager or something! How can I help?""  Him: ""We are launching a new product. I need your take on go-to-market for new product launches.""  Me: ""Ok so here's the deal. I feel bad for companies relying solely on cold outbound to build pipe in 2023.""  Him: ""So what would you do then?""  Me: ""I'd focus on four pillars. 1 - cold outbound. 2 - top of funnel organic content. 3 - retaining and upselling your current customer base. 4 - community""  Him: ""Why organic content and not paid?""  Me: ""Because if you can't figure out organic, you won't figure out paid. Find what's working organically, then pour the gas on that.""  Him: ""It sounds like I'm talking to the right guy....""  Me: ""I'm just the guy that TEEPEED your house as a teenager! Now onto my next point...""  After ~25 minutes of chatting, he asked me to be an advisor.   A few lessons here:  1. Cold outbound in 2024 isn't enough. Have you seen your own inbox?!  2. If you can't figure out organic, you'll waste money going straight to paid content.  3. Net retention of your customers is WAY undervalued. Something like 70% of SaaS revenue comes from current customers... So what does common sense say?  4. Don't take yourself too seriously.

Nurture Email Sequences: The art of keeping your leads warm and turning them into customers.  Sounds simple, right? But here’s the twist:  It's simple, but not EASY.  Mastering these three? It's like holding the golden keys to a killer business.  But you probably don't want to hear this.  You want to believe there's a secret, more complex formula.  Well, here's your reality check:  •• Your marketing strategy is cluttered. •• You're spreading yourself too thin. •• YOU need to focus and refine. Every day, I see businesses chasing new shiny tactics.  But I challenge myself to keep it straightforward.  Next time you're about to drown in marketing complexity, STOP.  Take a step back.  Look at your strategy:  Are you mastering the essentials?  Or just chasing after the wind?  Remember:  Content is your voice. Lead magnets are your hook. Email sequences are your nurture system.  Simplify. Master these. And watch your business soar.  As for me?  I’m not just preaching. I’m practicing.  This post will spark discussions.  I’m here, focusing on what WORKS.  No fluff.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-01-26,"You're hustling backwards if you think you can jump from 1 to 10 on the trust scale overnight.  Here's how it really works:  Think of trust on a scale of 1 to 10.  1 = Low trust. No chance they're buying. 10 = High trust. They're reaching for their wallets.  But here's where you're tripping up:  Trying to leapfrog from 1 to 10 in one go.  That's not how trust works.  It's a journey, not a sprint.  First, aim for a 5 on the trust scale:  •• Use a Lead Magnet. Something valuable, free, and irresistible. •• This isn't about selling. It's about proving your worth.  Then, elevate them to a 10:  •• Nurture them. Email sequences that educate, inform, and engage. •• It's about consistency and value, not just selling.  And there you have it.  A straightforward path to genuine trust.  But you probably don't want to hear this.  You want quick sales, easy trust, instant success.  Here's your reality check:  1. Your rush to sell is killing potential relationships.  2. Your understanding of trust-building is shallow.  3. YOU need to slow down and focus on genuine connections.  Trust is not a switch you flip.  It's a bond you build, one step at a time.  I challenge myself every day to respect this process.  Next time you're tempted to hard sell to a cold lead, STOP.  Ask yourself:  Are you building trust? Or just pushing for a sale?  This isn't just a tactic.  It's the foundation of sustainable sales.  As for me?  I’m here, nurturing every lead, respecting the trust scale.  No cutting corners.  This approach saves you from wasting six figures on a marketing consultant.  Simple. Effective.

I have had my own share of stress before…  My worst experience was when I was juggling too many projects simultaneously, feeling overwhelmed by deadlines and expectations. It got so bad I had to learn how to cope with it better.  … And unfortunately, there is no solution that fits everyone.  Instead, we have to try different methods before finding the way that works best for us.  So today I want to share my ways of coping with my stress in hopes it will help you too.  Here are the ways I use to deal with stress:  • Prioritizing tasks on pen & paper and setting realistic deadlines. • Daily runs (min 5-miles) to clear my mind • Shutting off work at 5pm exactly to spend time with wife and son  These tips help me a lot to decrease my stress, so I hope they can help you out too.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-04-26,"2 weeks ago, I chatted with the CEO of a LinkedIn paid ads agency doing $30M/year. I asked him the average cost of getting a meeting via LinkedIn ads...The answer: $420. Here’s a QUICK way to cut down your CAC so you aren’t spending $420 for a meeting: But first....a little context…Picture this: 200 marketing buffs in one room, breakout sessions buzzing, and me, just chilling with a CEO who runs a $30 million agency. The bomb he dropped? A cool $420 to snag a meeting through LinkedIn ads. Yep, you heard that right—$420! If you’re anything like me, shelling out that much for a chat is loco. So....1. Organic Content to the RescueHere’s the lowdown: Forget burning cash on ads. It’s time to roll out your very own content factory. Give the people what they want:Content that (1) educates and (2) entertains. 2. Lead Magnets: Your Secret WeaponThink of the coolest freebie you could offer. Something so juicy, your audience can’t resist. That’s your lead magnet, baby! It’s not just about snagging emails. It’s about making a first impression.Lead them from solving a mini problem to tackling the big ones with your help.3. Nurturing: Not Just a BuzzwordHere’s the kicker—only 3% of your tribe is ready to buy at any given moment. So what about the rest? That’s where your charm offensive comes in. Ditch the snooze-fest emails. Each message should be a party invite to your brand, keeping them entertained. QUICK TAKEAWAYS:1. Paid ads? Too pricey! Go organic and save your wallet.2. Lead magnets are your first date—make it memorable.3. Nurture like a pro: Mix fun with facts.Now, what say you?

It's the reason there's a clash between sales and marketing. . .  🚫 Sales thinks Marketing's leads aren't quality. 🚫 Marketing thinks Sales doesn’t value their effort.  YES.  That's right, while Marketing is creating content, Sales says, ""This isn't impactful."" And then...FRUSTRATION.  Here's the hard truth:  1. Sales wants specific content. 2. Marketing needs actionable insights from Sales. 3. YOU need to bridge that gap.  The game-changer?  Making Sales and Marketing create content TOGETHER. Taking insights from the field and using them to fuel content that CONVERTS.  This isn't just my observation.  It's what we're aiming for at Distribute.

Most startups FAIL because they ignore the essentials of a solid GTM strategy.  I've boiled it down to a foolproof plan:  → CONTENT → LEAD MAGNET → EMAIL → WIN  Sounds simple, right?  But let me break it down for you, step by step.  Content is KING, but CONTEXT is GOD ↳ Don't just create, solve problems!  Lead Magnets aren’t just freebies ↳ They’re your first handshake. Make it count.  Email isn’t dead ↳ it’s your sales warhorse ↳ focus on email infrastructure   WIN is the sweet spot ↳ Where value meets the vault.  Here's a deeper dive:  Start with CONTENT that resonates.  • This isn't about going viral. It's about going valuable.  Your LEAD MAGNET must be irresistible.  • It's the bridge between 'hello' and 'let's do business.'  EMAILs are your drip campaign of trust. • Nurture, provide value, and stay top-of-mind.  The WIN is when customers say: • ""Take my money!"" because you've led them down a path paved with value.  Most businesses are not getting this right.  I see too many pitches with no punch. Too many emails with no empathy. Too much content with no call-to-action.  Flip the script. Start with VALUE.  Every. Single. Time.  ___P.P.S.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2023-12-26,"I've spoken to 30+ marketers over the past six weeks about their content process.   Here are the 7 most controversial (and surprising) things I learned:  1. The old marketing playbook is broken af  • gated whitepapers aren't cutting it • focusing on the blog ain't doing anything • who knows where SEO is going   2. Marketing leaders are struggling to get any ROI from most channels  • paid ads is basically gambling • cold outbound isn't working like it used to • BDR teams aren't producing much pipeline   3. Most intent platforms provide mud results  • expensive • don't provide true intent • ""snake oil"" -Someone I will not name   Ok...  So where do we go from here...    Here's what I think:    A. Founder-focused marketing  Teams will pour CASH into building the brands of their founders.   After all...  People buy from people.    B. Influencer-based marketing  Influencer marketing in B2B is on first base (barely).   There will be a HUGE uptick.    C. Cold email paired with founder brand  This is the way.   Build the presence of the founder.   Leverage their name to get in contact with other execs.    D. Double-down on nurturing with email marketing  Only 3% of your target is ready to buy at any one time.   So the other 97%?   CLOSED-LOST.   That mean YOU HAVE TO NURTURE.   Sales needs to be rebranded to nurturing.   'Cause that's what it really is.    What got you here.

It’s not the workload, the office politics, or even the commute—it's the leadership, or lack thereof.  As the saying goes, ""𝙋𝙚𝙤𝙥𝙡𝙚 𝙙𝙤𝙣'𝙩 𝙦𝙪𝙞𝙩 𝙟𝙤𝙗𝙨, 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙮 𝙦𝙪𝙞𝙩 𝙗𝙤𝙨𝙨𝙚𝙨.""  Here's the thing:  • Leaders, your influence is massive. • Your style can make or break the team's spirit. • Your approach can turn a job from a dream to a dread.  And if you think people are leaving for better pay... sometimes, yes.   But often, they're just seeking respect, recognition, and a boss who doesn't drive them up the wall.  So here's a call to action for all the bosses out there:  ↳Be the reason people stay. ↳Lead with empathy, not ego. ↳Build up, don’t belittle.  Transform your leadership, and you’ll not just retain talent—you’ll attract it.

And I'm just kind of like, you know, checking in and checking out. Like we want to do has a passion for it and it's fitting into their vision because they do well in this role. They're moving up roles and they're getting more and they're excited. And I want to help people like that.""  2. On Simplicity in Communication:  ""You think when you get out of school, you have to ask these super tough questions for people and they have to be like some great questions and you know, out of nowhere, the best questions in the world. When really the most simple questions give you the best answers a lot of the time on what you need to know.""  3. On Adaptability and Innovation:  ""We're going to learn things in the market and we're going to find out, oh crap, you know that thing we just spent the last bit of time on, we're just going to throw it away because something else is much cooler now, we're going to go do that. And there's a reason for it.""  4. On CEO Conviction and Leadership:  ""You can do anything you want. I think this is something that CEOs forget, is that they can really do what they want.""  5. On Finding Energy in Work:  ""Focus on stuff that really gives you energy...I think that if you can find where things that give you energy and that you're also good at come together, focus your time on that, and then wherever possible delegate the rest.""

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-04-24,"Over the past 8 years, I've built 5 products that have produced millions of dollars in revenue. And I still make stupid mistakes. Here are the 3 BIGGEST MISTAKES I've made in the past 12 months building Distribute:1. Launching an Affiliate Program Too Early:We invested $12,000 in PartnerStack. We aimed to launch an affiliate program before our product was truly market-ready. Lesson learned? A great affiliate program needs a solid product that users are eager to share. Jumping the gun just cost us money and time without the return.2. Rushing Into Influencer Marketing: Similar to our affiliate misstep, we tried to push influencer marketing too early. Yes, because it’s the “hot” thing. The eagerness to scale outreach overshadowed the critical need to refine our MVP. Without a polished product, influencer endorsements couldn’t resonate or convert as hoped.3. Undercommunicating My Journey: I never shared the journey with y’all. The journey is where the juicy stuff is. The mistakes, lessons learned, and takeaways…You live. You learn. TAKEAWAY:Speed is tempting in the startup world. But it's not always a virtue.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2023-10-26,"In the buzzing world of AI, everyone's asking:  Who's going to clinch the AI race?  I've gone deep into this.  Here's a revelation:   Most AI platforms you're seeing? Not genuinely AI. They're smart wrappers around giants like OpenAI, leveraging other techs to speed things up.  But here's the golden nugget:  It's not just about having AI anymore. AI's become a commodity.  The real winners? Those focusing on key workflows.  → Those integrating AI smartly into existing workflows. → Those putting tight controls around the AI. → Those ensuring AI's governance, tracking brand voice, managing output lengths, especially from a B2B angle.  And the way to truly stand out?  1. Understand the workflows to introduce meaningful controls.  2. Build a strong brand around your AI offering.  3. Cultivate a community around your product.  Simply letting AI do something ""cool"" doesn't cut it. If you're noticing high churn rates with AI products, it's because the next innovator can always do it cheaper.  AI's more than just a tool. It's the future. But to win? You've got to be more than just an AI enthusiast. Be an AI strategist.  P.S. If this resonated with you, give it a share. AI's the race, but strategy's the game.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-04-22,"Last week I spoke to the CEO of Smartlead. After 1.75 years his company has almost 1 million inboxes connected and sends 28 million emails per day. Here are the 3 UGLY TRUTHS about scaling a startup fast: 1. You Have To Invest In Customer Support EarlyCustomer support is a growth hack y’all. It's an opportunity to turn every interaction into a growth engine. Implementing proactive support can transform your customer base into a dedicated sales force. Don’t sleep on this.2. There’s No Magic Bullet to GrowthThe path to scaling isn't paved with shortcuts. Vaibhav Namburi, the CEO, leveraged dark social communities, which required significant effort and engagement but proved crucial for organic growth. It's tough work, but the hard work gets you results.3. Founder Roles: Product First, People Second, Money Third. Your journey as a founder will evolve from managing the product to managing your team and finally to managing finances. Mastering these transitions is key to your startup's scalability and longevity.So other than Smartlead, here are a few companies I see living by these principles: 1. LeadMagic2. RB2B3.

Got it?  When you're:  → Selling → Writing copy → Creating content  Remember this golden rule.  People don't buy a bed. They buy a good night's sleep.  They don't buy a drill. They buy the ability to make holes easily.  They don't buy just a product.  They buy what it DOES for them.  That's a game-changer, isn't it?  But maybe you don't want to hear this.  Maybe you want to keep focusing on specs, features, tech jargon...  Here's a reality check:  1. Your focus on features isn't enough. 2. Your understanding of your customer needs work. 3. YOU need to shift your perspective. It's a common mistake.  But I challenge myself daily to think BENEFITS first.  Next time you're drafting that sales pitch or content piece, STOP.  Think:  Are you highlighting the FEATURES?  Or are you showcasing the BENEFITS?  Look in the mirror.  Ask yourself:  Are you really connecting with your customers' needs?  Drop the feature-heavy talk.  Embrace the power of benefits.  That's how you make them feel understood.  That's how you make the sale.  As for me?  This post is more than words.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"One cold email can make you stupid money. But 99% of salespeople don't know how to write a great one. Here are the top 5 cold email tips to improve your reply rates:   1. The most important part of the email:   It's not the subject line. It's not the body.   ↳It's the name it's coming from.   If my grandma emails me I am sure as hell opening it regardless of the subject line  But....  2. Great subject lines get you up to bat more often.  STRONG subject line + MEDICORE copy  ↳is better than WEAK subject line + STRONG copy  3. People buy the benefits.   A feature is what something *is*.   A benefit is what something *does for you*.  You’ve got to understand the difference when:   → Selling → Writing → Creating Content  Features don’t make people buy.   The benefits of those features gets them to buy.  4. There are only a few parts to a great email.   • Subject line.  • Shocking statement.  • 3 or 4 bullets.  • OFFER (and dear god don't ask for 30 min)  The name on the email is still the most important though ;)   5. People have 10x more things fighting for their attention.   It’s important to understand:   • You must use a lot more curiosity • There’s a lot less buildup before you get to the point  People used to be open to the 20-minute warmup.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2023-10-26,"PLG or Bust? Think AGAIN.  Chatting with three founder friends, 10M+ ARR companies, and guess what topic pops up? PLG (Product Led Growth).  But here's my 2 cents:  Don't morph your main product into PLG and lose your way. Seen many trip over that. Instead, think different.   Introduce a ""lead magnet product"". A teaser. A stepping stone.  Like with Tapio, we didn't push our scheduler straight up. We offered a free carousel generator. And once they bit? Boom! Introduce them to the main deal.  Think: What's the first step someone needs to reach YOUR product?  Sometimes, it's about recreating what's out there but making it FREE. Controversial? Maybe. But you're here to shake things up.  🚫 DON'T twist your main product for PLG.  ✅ DO create a brand-new offer.  For us? We're likely bringing in a dedicated engineer JUST for these lead magnets. Powerful? You bet. New market channels? Hell yeah.  B2B SaaS peeps, before you jump the PLG bandwagon - strategize. Build a NEW product offer.  PS: Adapt or get left behind.

But let me lay it out for you:  → People who LOVE your brand will advocate fiercely for you. → People who HATE it will talk about you (yes, even bad press can be good). → But those who FEEL NOTHING? They won’t even remember your name.  I spend every day making sure my brand evokes a REACTION.  Because I know that's where the real profit is.  You might not want to hear this.  You might prefer to stay in the 'safe zone'.  But here's the brutal truth:  1. Your neutrality is making you invisible. 2. Your fear of controversy is costing you. 3. YOU need to take a stand.  It’s not just about being controversial for the sake of it.  It's about believing in your message SO MUCH that it resonates deeply.  So, the next time you're about to post something bland, PAUSE.  Look in the mirror.  Ask yourself:  Are you making an impact?  Or are you just adding to the noise?  Ditch the neutrality.  Stand for something.  Remember:  There’s no treasure to be found in the land of the 'meh'.  As for me?  I’m out here sparking conversations, igniting passions.  And I won’t stop, even if it means ruffling a few feathers.  Because in this game, it’s go big or go home papi.   🌮  Play full out,  Andy  ____ P.S. Join The #1 Private Community For LinkedIn Creators. 4,300+ people.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-04-05,"Harsh truth:  I have no f*cking clue what I'm doing.   And guess what?  It's liberating to admit that.  It's the dirty little secret that no one talks about:  Most of us are winging it.  We look around, and it seems like everyone else has it figured out. They don't. The world is run by people who put one foot in front of the other, one day at a time.  → We try. → We fail. → We learn. → We improvise.  Behind every ""overnight success"" are years of trial and error, of not having a damn clue, but pressing on anyway.  ••→ This is for the entrepreneurs staying up late googling ""how to write a business plan.""  ••→ For the new parents who can't find the ""sleep through the night"" switch on their baby.  ••→ For the recent grads whose degree didn't come with a job manual.  You're not alone.   We're all part of the 'Making It Up As We Go' club.  And that’s okay.  Here's why:  • Innovation is born from ""I don't know."" • Every master was once a disaster.  So, hold up your sign with pride.  It's not a confession. It's a badge of honor.  Because the ones who don't have all the answers are the ones brave enough to seek them out.  🌮  Thoughts?

Let me tell you about Sally.  She started posting consistently on LinkedIn around late August or early September after joining Brand30 (https://www.brand30.io/). Not even that long, right? And yes, she missed some days.  But guess what?  Even with her ""minimal"" effort, check out these results:  • 8 podcast invitations. • Over $1.5M in pipeline directly tied to her name (mentioned in Gong calls). • An offer to speak at a prestigious conference. • A lucrative partnership opportunity. • Recognition as an expert in an eBook. • Fans, yes FANS, excited to connect with her.  This isn’t fiction. This is LinkedIn at work.  But hey, you probably don't want to hear this.  You'd rather believe it's all a waste of time.  Well, here’s your wake-up call:  1. Your LinkedIn strategy is non-existent. 2. You're underestimating the power of online presence. 3. YOU need to start valuing this platform. It's easy to dismiss what you don’t understand.  I push myself to explore every opportunity.  Next time you scoff at the idea of posting on LinkedIn, HOLD UP.  Go look in the mirror.  Ask yourself:  Are you really utilizing all avenues to amplify your sales?  Forget the doubts.  Forget the hesitation.  Your next big opportunity could be just one post away.  Don’t just sit there.  Start sharing your insights, your stories, your expertise.  Who knows?  You might be the next Sally.  As for me?  I’m not just talking. I’m engaging, connecting, and growing.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-04-19,"In 2015 I joined a startup doing $500k in ARR.   7 years later that same startup was doing $250M+ in ARR.  Here are the 7 valuable lessons I learned that are worth your time:   𝟭// 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗮 𝘀𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗻 𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗻.  So have a conviction about the problem that your product solves.  The internet (and potential customers) reward conviction.  So put your stake in the ground:  • The problem • How your product solves the problem • Why your business is the best at solving the problem  And get crazy about honing in on this every day.   𝟮 // 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗥𝗢𝗜.  This will help you get through tough climates like today.  When businesses cut spending the first products they cut are ""nice-to-haves"".  Don't wait until your customer is wanting to churn to prove ROI.  Do it early.  Do it often.  Don't be the ""nice-to-have"".  𝟯// 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.  Be okay with that.  Treat every day like an experiment.  Try things out. See what works and what doesn't.  Make course corrections along the way.  𝟰 // 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗮 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮, 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴.  You need to build a great team.  The best startups are not about a great idea, they are about great recruiting.  Find and hire the best people you can.  They will be your secret weapon.  𝟱// 𝗡𝗼 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗴𝗲.  They only care if you can get sh*t done.  I sat through 100s of interviews.  Not once did I care about if someone went to Harvard or not.  𝟲// 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 #𝟭 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰 𝗶𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲.  Don't get it twisted y'all.  So many SaaS buzzword metrics out there.  There's 1 thing that should always go up and to the right...  REVENUE.  Companies don't run on email opens and clicks.  𝟳// 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 ""𝗕𝘂𝗧 𝗪𝗲'𝗩𝗲 𝗔𝗹𝗪𝗮𝗬𝘀 𝗗𝗼𝗡𝗲 𝗜𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗜𝘀 𝗪𝗮𝗬""  This is the company killer.  You need to have the conviction to do things differently.  The only way a small company can win is by being scrappy and nimble.  By doing things differently.  Don't get caught in the trap of doing things ""just because"".  Do them because they make sense and will help you grow.    So there you have it.  If you're working on a startup, keep these 7 lessons in mind:  1. Your business is a piece of software with an opinion. 2. Your business needs to have a clear ROI. 3. Treat everything like an experiment. 4. Startups are not about a great idea, they are about great recruiting. 5. No one cares where you went to college. 6. Your #1 metric is revenue. 7.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-01-26,"You're obsessed with shortcuts, aren't you?  Thinking they'll lead you to success faster?  Here's a hard-hitting truth:  Shortcuts are just longer roads in disguise.  Every day, I see it:  • Choosing high-paying jobs over opportunities to learn valuable skills. • Jumping on the latest fad diets instead of developing sustainable eating habits. • Maxing out credit cards instead of budgeting wisely.  We're all guilty of craving instant results.  But here's what you don't want to hear:  It's a trap.  A mirage leading you further from your goals.  1. Your quick fixes aren't solutions. 2. Your impatience is costing you, not saving you. 3. YOU need to rethink your approach.  Real growth? It's not about changing WHAT WE DO.  It's about transforming WHO WE ARE.  Sure, that's more challenging.  But I challenge myself and others daily to embrace this journey.  Next time you're tempted by a ""shortcut,"" STOP.  Take a hard look in the mirror.  Ask yourself:  ☑ Are you building a castle on sand? ☑ Are you really moving forward? ☑ Or just running in circles?  The path to genuine, lasting success?  It's about consistent small growth compounded over time.  Not superficial ""10X"" overnight growth.  As for me?  I’m committed to the long haul.  No shortcuts. No quick fixes.  Just real, meaningful progress.  This post is a call to action.  A challenge to rethink your choices.  And I’m here, walking the walk.  🌮  Play full out, Andy   ____ PS...

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"Over a 24-month period at a startup, I closed $5.5 million in ARR.   Want to know a secret?   I used the same 5-step negotiation framework every time.   𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭: 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝟯-𝟱 𝗻𝗲𝗴𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀  These can be based on:  • Volume  • When the deal closes • Length of the deal (e.g. 2-year deal vs. 3-year deal) • When you get paid (Net 30, 60, 90)  I use a slide to present these items.   Give them options (besides discount)   𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮: 𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺  Throughout the deal process, gather information from them that you can use in negotiations later.  Example: “My VP really cares about adoption”  In this case, you can make a price adjustment on professional services around adoption.   𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯: 𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗻𝗲𝗴𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀𝗻’𝘁 𝟭 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹  Too often we see reps trying to finish a negotiation in 1 call.  This tends to lead to reps negotiating with themselves.  Don’t give anything away without getting something in return.   𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰: 𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗻𝗲𝗴𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀  Executives would prefer negotiating with other executives.  Leverage other executives in a negotiation when possible.  Before adding them to a negotiation call, brief them.   𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟱: 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆, 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱...  1. Get all negotiation items out (steps 1-4 above)   2. Repeat/Ask what you heard. ""So if I got it right you want ____ Is there anything else?""  3.  Prioritize the issues. ""Let me ask, what is most important to you price or...""  4. Qualify the decision maker. If we come to an agreement today can you make the decision by (today)?  5.  Make the offer. Be clear, confident, and concise.  6.  Listen and repeat their counter-offer.  7.  Ask for the deal and add an expiration date.  8.  Agree to consequences if the expiration date is not met.  9. Confirm your conversation with an email:  ""Per our conversation, we agreed to ____ did I get that right?""  10. Once they've agreed in writing follow up with contract: ""As discussed in the email in which we agreed to""   𝗧𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝘁!   My 5-step Negotiation Framework.

I use the same 5 sequences every time.   𝗦𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 #𝟭: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝘂𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲  Buyers aren't always ready to BUY.   When they are, you want to be top of mind.   All nurture sequences have the same format:   • 30 day nurture email • 60 day nurture email • 90 day nurture email • continued...  I each email provide VALUE.

𝗦𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 #𝟰: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲  You connect with the wrong person 99% of the time?   Ask them:   “Who should I be reaching out to?”  Most of the time they'll tell you.   Put that person in a referral sequence.   High output sequence for very little effort!   𝗦𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 #𝟱: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹-𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝘀𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲  Can't find email and/or LinkedIn profile?   Use this sequence.   Especially when:   • Company doesn't have standard naming conventions • Person has hyphenated last name • Person has multiple nick names  They may no longer be at the company.   If you're redoing your sales sequences in 2024, check out these 5 sequences for inspiration:  • The nurture sequence • The cold outbound sequence • The meeting no show sequence • The referral sequence • The call-only sequence  Very different use cases, but all work well.   ***  P.S.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"99% of salespeople make the same cold email mistake. They have first sentences that send prospects straight to SNOOZEVILLE. Save your response rate and avoid these 5 first lines:    𝟭. “𝗜 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗳𝗼𝗿 ... ”  It's boring, unoriginal, and screams to the prospect, ""I'm trying to sell you something!""

Here's how to tell a story in 7 quick bullets:    ""The most powerful person is the storyteller"" -Steve Jobs  I never understood why.   Until..   I joined improv comedy.  4 years of improv later, I learned storytelling is the key to unlocking growth in:  • Writing • Business • Relationships  Here's the 7-sentence breakdown:   𝟭/ 𝗢𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘂𝗽𝗼𝗻 𝗮 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 ____  This sentence is the INTRODUCTION.   It should introduce the setting and main character(s) of the story.   And...  Provide any necessary background information.   It should also establish the tone and mood of the story.   𝟮/ 𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗱𝗮𝘆 ____  This is the RISING ACTION.   The rising action presents the conflict or problem that the character(s) must face.   This sentence should introduce the stakes of the story.   And set the character(s) on their journey to resolve the conflict.   𝟯/ 𝗨𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗹 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘆 ____  This is the CLIMAX.   The climax is the point of highest tension or drama in the story.   It is the turning point that determines the outcome of the conflict.   This sentence should describe the event or decision that drives the story toward its resolution.   𝟰/ 𝗕𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 ____  This is the FALLING ACTION.   It consists of the events that follow the climax and lead to the resolution of the conflict.   This sentence should describe the character(s)' efforts to resolve the conflict and the challenges they face along the way.   𝟱/ 𝗕𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 ____  The RESOLUTION.  This is the end of the story, where the conflict is resolved and the character(s) achieve their goal(s).   This should describe the final outcome of the story...

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"Stop making these mistakes.  I see way too many people making the same mistakes over and over again...  And the worst part is… They don’t even realize they are mistakes.  One common mistake?  ↳Posting content that's all about selling.   Many believe the direct approach of constantly pushing their products or services is key.   Then there's neglecting engagement – posting their content and never interacting with anyone else’s.  Let me share a quick story that encapsulates these errors perfectly:  A friend of mine, let's call him Dave, was STOKED about launching his new consulting service. He went all-in on LinkedIn, posting daily about his services, boasting features and offers. However, despite his efforts, the leads and engagement were minimal. Dave was disillusioned, not understanding what went wrong.  Wrong on so many levels…  Here’s why,  These approaches miss the essence of LinkedIn – it’s a platform for building relationships, not a direct sales channel.   Instead of selling, focus on providing value, sharing insights, and engaging genuinely with your network. This shift not only enhances your brand but also naturally leads to more meaningful business opportunities.  Once you stop making these mistakes, you will be able to significantly boost your LinkedIn engagement and lead generation.  So if you want to:   ↳Build a strong, value-driven personal brand. ↳Generate leads by engaging rather than selling. ↳See real examples of success, like Haithem, who revamped his approach and made $18,000 in one week by focusing on valuable content and genuine engagement.  Then go here to find out how:  https://www.brand30.io/  Brand30 is designed to transform your LinkedIn strategy from pushy sales to baller engagement.

We all know it:  9 out of 10 times you have to pull in multiple stakeholders to get a deal across the line.  No $100k+ deal gets done with one stakeholder involved.  (that's called a Unicorn deal)  ↓  Why multi-thread?  Your bigger deals ain’t going to get done without it.  Think about your own company when someone is trying to sell a product to YOUR team.  Does a salesperson get that done knowing one person?  No? Exactly.  Enough of the fluff, let’s get into the tactics.  ↓  𝗦𝗧𝗘𝗣 𝟭: 𝗗𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗵𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸  You can spend hours researching a company.  Here’s what is most useful from a multi-threading perspective:  • What does the company do? • What other stakeholders should be involved? • Who are the company’s competitors? (are they customers of yours?  For small deals, this could take 5-10 minutes.  For larger deals, count on hours.   𝗦𝗧𝗘𝗣 𝟮: 𝗦𝗲𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮.  Make it about them.   Not you.

Without understanding:  • The priorities of the individual you are speaking to • The priorities of the department they work in • What they are doing today  You are going to have a hard time getting to other stakeholders.  I’ll say it again: priorities, priorities, priorities.   Take the time to understand whether your solution solves a problem that is Priority #58 or Priority #10 for your prospects.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"In 2015, I joined a startup making $18/hr. 7 years later I helped it go from $1M to $250M, started a side hustle that got to $1M ARR in 9 months (sold it for 8 figs), and just raised $2M to build out Distribute. Here's 10 super-quick lessons I've learned along the way:   1. Avoid the quick and easy paths.   Shortcuts rarely work out long-term.   And when they do, you can often get away with them for a while.   But eventually, the consequences catch up to you and it’s rarely worth it.   Shortcuts are longer roads in disguise.   2. Enjoy the adventure, and avoid obsessing over the outcome.  Focus on the journey, not the destination.   Enjoy the process and be present in each moment.   The outcome will take care of itself if you put in the work.   And at the end of the day, you'll always learn new lessons.   3. Be long-term greedy.  Help as many people as you can in the short term.   That way in the long term you can ask people for what you want, whenever you want.   4. Strong opinions, loosely held.  Listen to others, be open-minded, and think critically.   Forming a strong opinion or having conviction doesn’t have to mean being stubborn about it.   Be flexible and willing to change your mind if needed.   5. Make decisions faster than you’d like.  It's easy to second-guess yourself when making decisions.   But the longer you take to decision, the more time and energy you are wasting.   Make decisions faster than you’d like and don’t look back with regret.   6. Don't be realistic.   All too often, we set unrealistic expectations and then get frustrated when we don't reach them.   Instead of setting realistic goals, set ambitious ones.   Believe in yourself and go after the impossible.   7. Stay humble and be kind to others.   Humility is important for growth; it will open up opportunities that may never have crossed your path.   And no matter what, always be kind to others.   Even if they don’t deserve it, you will always benefit from being kind.   8. Simplify everything in life.  Simplicity brings clarity and focus to any task or project.   It can also help alleviate stress and anxiety.   Try to simplify everything you do, from decision-making to living arrangements to your inbox.   9. Don't be afraid to fail.  Fear of failure is the enemy of progress.   We learn more from our mistakes than we do from our successes, so don’t be afraid to take risks and make mistakes.   It's part of the process.   10. Don't take yourself too seriously.   At the end of the day, life is a journey and it should be enjoyed.   Have fun, laugh at yourself, and don’t take things too seriously.   Life is meant to be lived.  P.S.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"don't listen to this advice.  There is a lot of misinformation being spread about LinkedIn marketing and personal branding.  And naturally, many people believe what they are being told because, why would experts lie?  For example, one common myth is “Post anything as long as you post daily.” It sounds practical for staying visible, but it's far from effective.  And even though the truth seems to be common sense, it isn’t always...  Here are the top 3 weirdest pieces of advice I’ve ever heard about LinkedIn:  1 ==> ""Automate everything.""   While automation can save time, overusing it removes the personal touch that’s crucial for building genuine connections.  2. ==>""More connections always mean more business.""   Simply put, not all connections are created equal. Quality over quantity matters more in the long run.  3 ==> ""Endorse everyone for everything.""   Endorsements should be meaningful. Random endorsements can actually dilute your credibility and that of your connections. When I first heard these, my jaw dropped to the floor…  Making people believe stuff that is not true or leaving out important information can have serious consequences…  ... And that’s why I want to clarify the truth right here.  • Automation should be used wisely. It’s there to help you manage your time better, not to impersonate you.  • Focus on building meaningful connections. Relationships with depth are far more likely to lead to business opportunities.  • Be genuine with your endorsements. Only endorse skills you’ve witnessed. This enhances your trustworthiness and strengthens your network.  Now you know what the reality is.  … But there is still much more for you to learn.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"3 years ago I barely knew how to login to LinkedIn. Today we've built a community of over 4,000+ professionals using LinkedIn to grow their business.   My secret to growing ANYTHING?  Lead Magnets.  Here are the 10 lead magnets you can use to print emails, nurture potential customers, and make more sales:   𝟭. 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘁𝘀  Cheat sheets are basically checklists.   They give users guidelines they can follow for a specific benefit.   People love them because they remove the need to think.   𝟮. 𝗘𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗹 𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲𝘀  Benefits of an email course:   • generate new leads • nurture new leads  • very low risk  And... My favorite part...  More touch points = more potential sales.   𝟯. 𝗚𝘂𝗶𝗱𝗲  Guides solve a specific problem.   They can range from 1-100+ pages.   Guides are typically:  • not data-heavy • easy reading • conversational • educational   𝟰. 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁𝘀  Easy to create from instructional ""how-to"" content.  Checklists tend to be very practical so people love them.   Want to create one?   • Take a piece of content • Simplify into bullets  • Remove points with 0 actionable advice • Split into numbered steps   𝟱. 𝗪𝗲𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗿𝘀  Webinars let viewers watch fascinating videos and ask questions.  Each webinar should address a single issue.  Webinars can generate leads for months or years if offered on-demand following the live event.   𝟲. 𝗧𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀  Editable templates help avoid re-creation.   They help people streamline their processes and save time.  You can create templates for anything:   • Social posts • Emails • Spreadsheets • Graphic Designs  Help your audience avoid creating from scratch.   𝟳. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗰𝗼 𝗦𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗿  Try before you buy—who doesn't?  You can give a sample of your:  • Course • Product • Service   My favorite Costco Sampler lead magnet:  ""Give us your email in exchange for the FIRST LESSON of our course (FREE!).""   𝟴. 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗩𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗼𝘀  Create a quick vid that provides:   • techniques  • frameworks • tactics   on one specific problem to solve.   This is a great lead generator if you have:   • complex features  • high-ticket item you are selling • audience that likes sneak previews   𝟵. 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀  Take that list and put it into a public:  • Notion document • Spreadsheet • Google file  I'm always saving hooks, content ideas, and creators to follow.   𝟭𝟬. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗧𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗹s  Very common with SaaS products.  Most software firms' homepages contain a prominent call to action for a free trial or demo.   Why?  They get your email that way.  Some ideas:   • 7-day free trial • 10,000-word credits • 45-min recording length  P.S.

Andrew Mewborn,Male,2024-03-26,"3 Lies you shouldn't believe  (I want to warn you about these lies that are being spread around...)  Influencers and self-proclaimed gurus often spread misleading advice about leveraging LinkedIn for career and business growth.   These lies can be damage and hinder people from achieving their goals…  But I have had it with all these lies. It’s time to end them.  I will expose the most harmful lies in this email and end with the biggest lie that too many people believe.  ==> The first lie: ""Your LinkedIn profile doesn't need regular updates.""  Many say once your LinkedIn profile is set, you can forget it. This couldn’t be further from the truth. An outdated profile is a missed opportunity for growth and connection. Keeping your profile current is crucial for accurately reflecting your achievements and aspirations, making you discoverable to the right opportunities and connections.  ==> The second lie: ""More connections mean more success.""  The quality of your network trumps quantity every time. It's not about how many connections you have, but the strength and relevance of those connections. Building a network filled with meaningful relationships will serve your professional journey far better than a larger, less engaged audience.  ==>The last lie: ""Posting content is a waste of time.""  This might be the biggest falsehood of all. Creating and sharing content establishes your thought leadership, builds your brand, and engages your network. It’s a powerful tool for opening doors to new opportunities and conversations. Those who ignore this aspect of LinkedIn miss out on its greatest benefits.  Now you are warned.
