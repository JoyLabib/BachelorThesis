George Imafidon,Male,2023-11-27,"Allow me to re-introduce myself! 👀My LinkedIn community has grown a lot over the past few months, here’s a re-introduction - especially to those of you who are new.👋🏾 Hi, I’m George! I’m a humanitarian engineer, entreprenuer and speaker passionate about making STEM roles more accessible to ALL young people and building more purposeful leaders. 🔧 From age 7, I became pretty obsessed with building things. I grew up fixing the bikes of my friends in my local community in Peckham, South London, and since then I’ve been creating solutions for underserved communities and worked around the world firms such as Google, McKinsey & Company, Prodrive and Rolls-Royce where, through designing a novel component, I managed to save them over £50 million.❓ I co-founded Motivez alongside Muizz and over the last 8 years our company has directly trained and supported 9,000+ young people to access entry-level STEM jobs. We work with some of the world’s biggest brands on our grassroots, employability and advocacy programmes and have been backed by the likes of Idris Elba, Beyoncé and most recently The Royal Family with funding and an MBE for services to STEM and young people. 🏎️ I eventually traded working on the two wheels for the four wheels, and now work as a Race Engineer for Lewis Hamilton’s electric race team, TEAM X44.🌍 I’ve been working on sustainable solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges through engineering and tech for over a decade. 🤝 My roles extend to the governance level after joining Lewis Hamilton in 2020 on the Board of The Hamilton Commission to improve representation in STEM and becoming a trustee for the Co-op Foundation. It’s been a privilege to raise and distribute millions of pounds for young people.🏃🏾‍♂️ You can often find me running and I’ve done a few marathons to support some amazing causes in the UK and Nigeria 🇳🇬 💡 Linkedin has been a key platform for me over the years to inspire, share the journey, and send the ladder down through connecting with you all.Thank you all for the warm messages, engagement and constant encouragement.
