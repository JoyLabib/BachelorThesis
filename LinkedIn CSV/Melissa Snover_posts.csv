Melissa Snover,Female,2023-04-27,"A question I always get asked is what my morning routine looks like. I'm a big believer that how we start our day sets the tone for the rest of it, so I try to make the most of my mornings. Here's how my typical morning goes: - 4 am: I wake up early and gather my thoughts for the day ahead. With a business and three children to look after, I don’t get much time to myself. Waking up before everyone else gives me an opportunity to prioritise myself and prepare for the day.  - 4:30 am: I typically do a 7-minute workout routine. I have been doing these quick workouts for years now and find them to be extremely effective in keeping my body fit and energised! - 5 am: After my workout, I spend some time catching up on emails and writing out a list of what I will achieve that day.  - 6 am: I will either take my dog for a walk or a run.  - 6:30 am: Once I’m back home, I take a quick shower and get ready. - 7:15 am: I start work! What does your morning routine usually look like?

Schwarzman (Chairman and CEO of The Blackstone Group) and Marcelo Claure (CEO of Claure Group). Particularly striking was Marcelo Claure's summary of the transformative effects of AI, where he highlighted how, just as the internet dramatically reduced the cost of accessing information, #AI is poised to make creativity, cognition, and problem-solving equally accessible, virtually bringing their net cost to zero. Other key discussions pointed towards the necessity for a sustainable financial marketplace blueprint, concerns around the growing cost of living crisis, navigating the challenges of a green energy transition costing between $100-300 trillion by 2050, and leveraging deep tech markets, which is expected to soar as we move forward.  I am grateful for the opportunity to have been involved and wanted to thank Fii for hosting an event filled with inspirational panels and insightful sessions.
