No jobs were available (it was Covid) and this was an awesome job opportunity to turn down.If I didn't give it a go now, when would I? 38 year old entrepreneurVery low/no bank account after rent was paidMoved in with my dad to have him pay for food for a few weeksBuilt up credit card debt to stay afloatI told myself to test having faith. In higher energy.If I just gave as much as I ever have given in my life, would it come back to me?If I didn't test it now, when would I? So I did.I helped folks get introduced to others. To have a space that heard them. Built a community of folks giving to one another.I lost my mother 3 years earlier and I owed it to her to give me the opportunity to break the fear of practicality. I'd been homeless before, and that no longer scared me.Now I was cool living with Dad. So that was even easier. But, I was approaching 40 and needed to figure it out.Put respect on folks figuring it out. So many folks have fear disguised as practicality. Taking SDR and AE jobs to get money in.I was like that. Once you put yourself in a situation to make it happen, you will. Find the place you dig into to make anything happen.Nomatter what.Find that place and watch yourself run the show one day.🌊",250,48,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)

Jared Robin,Male,2023-09-27,"Community saves.After being a top seller in my 20s, I was fired or laid off 3 times in my mid-30s. I found myself directionless in a period when I was supposed to have ‘figured it out’.I lacked confidence in what was next or if I’d ever be successful.And this ate at me. My friends were all doing bigger things and I was going around in circles.After losing my job at the beginning of Covid, I decided to lean into LinkedIn and build a DM chat of others leaning in too.Essentially a small ‘community’ of folks in sales and marketing in SaaS . My goal was to leverage this group to find a new job in Sales leadership.The energy of the the group was palpable; we all fed off each other and because we kept breaking LinkedIn chat, moved to Slack. We added in RevOps & Customer Success pros to the mix to make it a complete 'go-to-market' community.Two recruiters saw the insane growth and told me to stop interviewing for jobs to build this thing out.Building Community was going to be my new job. BUT I NEEDED MONEY NOW! And, we weren't making it (yet).I took a bet that this community, now named ‘RevGenius’ was my calling and went all in.I grew RevGenius to 40k GTM Professionals within 3 years and I hired myself along the way as revenue grew.We did 7 figures in revenue last year.I’m no longer directionless.Community saved me.This is my story.What's yours?🌊",200,66,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)

Jared Robin,Male,2024-04-06,"My mom passed away 6 years ago today; this is our last dinner together.I wrote her a text this morning (I obviously can’t send):I love you so much mom. I'm not sure I told you the full extent and hope you realize it.I wish I could just respond to this text and you'd get it. That I'd see you later. That all would be alright. I wish with all my heart I'd have 1 more day with you. Even if I didn't get more than a couple mins alone with you. I know you'd want to dedicate all your time to your grand daughters. But I also know you'd want to make sure your children were ok, and that they would be ok without you.We are ok and it's because the lessons you taught us. But it doesn't mean we miss you any less. I live every day now trying my best. To be the best person I can be. I stumble at times, but I'm getting much better. I know you'd be proud. You asked me if I was happy the night before you passed. That's all you really wanted for us. I said I was, but I didn't really know. I had a dying mother and job offer that wouldn't pan out. But I've learned happiness is much more than material things and everything going your way, from you. And I'm prioritizing peeling my layers of doubt, anger, and grief away to realize how happy I am. Im a work in progress (let's be real: we all are). Writing this message to you started out as really sad, but now is becoming therapeutic. I feel your love all around me. I hope you're OK, and waiting until we meet again. I know you have your crazy family to keep you company. 😄I know my presence and yours are one, even though you may not be on this earth. In closing:I'm going to be the best uncle I can be, the best partner to Mallory and most importantly love myself. Make sure I'm prioritizing me. Peel back the layers. And love myself so that the love I give others is even more powerful. I love you with all my heart, my sweet and beautiful mom.

Plus a lot of my newsletter inspo for RevGenius comes from Morning Brew & The Hustle and this platform is literally being built by Tyler Denk 🐝 #2 at Morning Brew.They're building hella fast, I help out in their community, I'm going to launch a newsletter mastermind for fun (hit me in the DMs for more info), and I'm also a partner.Oh, and I interviewed Daniel Berk 🐝 a while ago for our content head role (wasn't the right fit) and he ended up there (genius move).2,800 subs organically in 4 months.A platform built for growth.VIBES VIBES VIBESHIVETry out beehiiv for $0 👉 https://lnkd.in/e-baNzSc",161,110,4,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)

Since,  I’ve watched her grow so much through the experiences and job updates she shared on LinkedIn.Seeing her work helping grow Shield and BotSupply made me such a big fan. 2 days into her next job following Shield I asked her to join RevGenius!(Had I known she was looking I would’ve asked sooner)It took about 8 months before she said she was ready. In the waiting period, I got to learn how Pragya was even cooler and more amazing than I originally thought:- She’s an avid runner, competing in many races. Shes prepping for an Ultra!- She’s now married (as of a week or so ago!) - She wants to work from mountains (think Alps).- She is precise and calculated but also a big risk taker!

Jared Robin,Male,2024-01-27,"F*ck the algo. In Q4 I decided I needed to own my media. I decided that launching a newsletter was the move.Found a dope AF platform to do it too - beehiiv.New company. Vibes. Built by #2 at Morning Brew Tyler Denk 🐝.Let's be real - I didn't really know all the differences between Beehiiv, Convertkit, and Substack.I knew Convertkit was expensive. Substack was free (but if I monetized could become expensive). And that beehiiv was built by somebody that built the newsletter I idolized.Turns out I made the right choice. They've invested in building their ad network, added tons of features built for deliverability, growth (paid subscriber acquisition + OG Morning Brew referral program), and a super fun and easy interface for design - both of the CMS and newsletters.The Collab was born in October (hit 2800 subs yesterday!).Excited about hitting the next milestones.I became a community volunteer and partner along the way. Leaning in hard to learn as much as possible to make sure I don't have to rely on the algo for how many people see my posts.I can just create awesome content and optimize based on opens, clicks, and replies. Been obsessed with growth on it ever since.Speaking to the team about what they're building next and I couldn't be more sure I made the best decision.Want to build something you can own too?Sign up for $0 to get started 👉 https://lnkd.in/e-baNzSc🐝",145,83,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)

Not to her.This was the last thing anyone would've thought from:- A girl from a small town in Ohio to a blue-collar family.- Who went to a state school in Ohio.- Who had to nanny for a NJ family to get to NYC.- Who had to take underpaid mediocre internships in the city to get started.- Who entered a male-dominated space where women had it hard.- Who had to sleep on a couch with a dead cat in the freezer.- Who climbed the ranks without any nepotism or help.- Who earned her first chance at Creative Director at Airbnb.- Who lost that chance when Airbnb mag shut down.- Who bounced back to land the top Creative gig at Cosmo a year later.- Who happened to be up for 4 medals at the most prestigious magazine award ceremony...People didn't think she would win.So when I got the first text yesterday that Mallory (my partner) did the undoable, I cried.She said she landed a medal. I ran home in excitement.She was too nervous to celebrate with me (her team was on a zoom) and kicked me out.I waited in the hallway, listening in eagerly.I heard another (positive) shriek of excitement. I texted her asking if that was her second!?She said it was. Before the day was done she had won 3 medals (1 gold, and 2 silver) against the BEST OF THE BEST in magazines. Nobody expected this, not from her.But, that's not who she is. She's an inspiration to little girls in rural towns without a silver spoon or Ivy League education, and just a dream.She's also my hero.

Join it!-results - engagement was up around 50% last week!2. New Partner Alert 🚨!!!! Welcome Seamless.AI  !!!!We will have a formal announcement coming soon but we are above the moon to be working closer with Jonathan Pogact and the Seamless team. They've built something really stellar and we're looking forward to supporting their continued growth in the community.They've been extremely supportive of RevGenius for some time and it's only fitting that we grow our relationship!Also our team already uses them for our data needs because they have killer data (emails and personal cells) and an intuitive platform with the integrations we need (LinkedIn, Hubspot, Salesforce, etc).(See pic of Jonathan and I below).3. This week I announced (yesterday) 📣We are building a list to support emerging GTM Talent. So many lists are the same folks rehashed. We have asked some awesome people to collaborate on this to make it:- More diverse- More inclusive- More emerging / new- Less boring- Less people looking like me (without long hair*)My ask: Tag your favorite emerging gtm creators - make sure to tag just as many women and people of color as you do men.People that have a couple years or less on the LI platform or just started raising their voices...Action items for this week: ✅1. Tag people who should be on our 'Emerging Top 100' list here in threads. 2. Check out our new partner Seamless.AI and hit me up if you're looking for a data provider for an intro!3. Keep helping one another!📸: Jonathan (VP Marketing, Seamless.ai) and I following a meal in my hood recently. He's a homie, say what's up!

Jared Robin,Male,2023-07-27,"Yesterday I asked about which version of Jared you'd hire. Today, I'm going to tell you about the growth I experienced at each stage:Stage 1: First big job. I was an AE at FedEx looking for validation that I was actually good at sales. I was passed over for a promotion 4 times before I secured it. It was because my numbers were the 4th best - super objective. And I realized it was something I could control. So I did.That promotion led me to my dream Field Sales job (where I had to wear a suit every day - see pic 1) and eventually to President's Club. I had a chip on my shoulder from being passed over and vowed to reward the manager and team that took a chance on me. My 'Victor' story helped develop confidence (and cockiness) in my abilities. I decided that the ceiling in logistic sales was too low for my ambition and decided technology was the way.Stage 2: I landed a job transitioning into tech at a company called Granify. I was able to make a lateral move to an AE; but had to take over a $20k base salary pay cut. From $85k base to $60k base to get in. It was a seed startup without any paying customers. Nor product that worked. I'd make up the gap in my fat commission checks I told myself. I believed in the vision fully. And I had a little bit of equity. I was ready to hit it big. This pic (#2) shows me bright-eyed and bushy-tailed on a trip to Edmonton, the company's HQ. I'm wearing a shirt I got from Barney's Warehouse Sale (RIP) and now am opening up my personality at work. My style is improving.What this pic doesn't show you: I didn't make the fat commission checks. It took a while for the product to work (and we did go to Series A profitably). When the product didn't work I decided to build a side project - a fashion mag with my best friend Carlos. That was the tipping point to my style improving even more. As satisfying as it was to be figuring out my path, I imploded. I was barely paying rent on my meager base salary (in NYC). My numbers were nonexistent and landing any lateral job would be just as hard as landing this one was.I couldn't sleep through the night at one point for like a week straight. I went to meditation to survive. It was really bad.And then the product started to improve. I made a commission check or two (never hit $100k in a year though). My side project won Best International Fashion Film and my side hustle was flourishing: 10k monthly site visitors (it was enough to create a small movement, but not enough to make serious money).At this point, I started actually dressing more like pic 3, at least outside of work (I worked from home so was comfy all day).Stage 3:This pic was taken at an art exhibit by my CEO at the time.I was running growth at an art blockchain marketplace a few years ago.I was able to fully transition from who I was 'on the side' to my day job. And found a job and space (the art world!) that valued that. The most interesting 'Jared' to me is (see below)...",105,43,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)

Jared Robin,Male,2023-11-27,"I've found the most potent way to socially sell, is to not sell at all.Counterintuitive, I know.I've built RevGenius by helping others and creating an environment that encourages others to do the same.Because I want us to all win.So much of selling on LinkedIn is pitch-slapping, and being a human and connecting with others is a welcome reprise for so many buyers.When you have a giving mindset, others feel it, and they're much more likely to trust you.This is just one of my tips.

Jared Robin,Male,2023-09-27,"People always love to ask about the best tools to build community.Here are 3 that I love (that I talked about in my newsletter):I. Common RoomCommon Room addresses the challenge that 70% of your prospect’s buying process happens within the dark funnel before a sales intro call – e.g. LinkedIn, Slack, Discord, Reddit, Meetup, etc. Common Room gives you visibility into this so you can make smarter decisions to close more deals. II. LeadDeltaLead Delta is what I use to prune my connections on LinkedIn to make sure I’m only speaking to the most relevant ones. This helps me build my niche audience and community. You can disconnect with 25 at a time. Saturday night I went IN.Note: just found out you can export all your LinkedIn connections data enriched. GAME OVER.III. SuperwaveSuperwave is an awesome community platform built by the folks at Hopin. My homies Dave Schools, Shane Lennox, and co. are taking a content-first approach to building a really interactive space to focus on what Slack/Discord doesn’t - a clean repository of community content.

Creators Program:Which is effectively a UGC engine is the goal. So their goal is to empower people that are thought leaders in the outbound and inbound sales automation space to create better content. So they build a ton of tools and infrastructure to make that process easier for them, kind of allowing them to grow alongside Clay. 2. Experts Program:Which the goal is to create the premier marketplace for agencies and freelancers also in the sales automation space. So kind of a very high bar for people that really, really know how to build these motions at companies. And then people that are other businesses that are trying to incorporate these practices know to come to us to kind of find the best. 3. Templates Infrastructure:So effectively building a way for people to quickly find workflows that have been built by others and reproduce them for their specific use case. And you can go to clay.com templates to learn more.

So, like, you may have someone who's starting out, but they just don't have a bigger follower count, but they have a really niche and engaged audience. Test it out and use, like, affiliates and things of that nature, affiliate links, et cetera.The Influencer:What everyone's doing right now. You pay someone x amount for them to post about your brands, and then you may have some other things that you do with them, some videos, some activations, cool things that we've seen on LinkedIn.The SME (Subject Matter Expert):Morgan believes this is the true north star of B2B influencer marketing. People who have expertise are credible in their field and in their craft, so they're able to develop and create credible content that people actually want to consume and the buyers want to hear from, which leads to you getting more pipeline.

Jared Robin,Male,2024-04-06,A couple weeks ago somebody in my community asked me for an intro for their dream job.They’re so good and have been a major part of the growth of a startup we know and love.But they found themselves looking for their next opportunity. I gave them the intro. Proudly. It was a tough role to land. They said they wouldn’t let me down. They were right. After 5 interviews over 2 days they landed the job.

Jared Robin,Male,2023-05-27,"This picture says a million words.It speaks about collaboration over a zero-sum mindset.Dale Zwizinski and Adam Jay 📈 met when they were interviewing for the same job.They could've acted as competitors but they chose friendship. One got the job and the other didn't. Now they're both not at that company, but they're collaborating on tons of big things.Their life is richer because of it. I have no doubt their earning potential will be too.This picture speaks about the impact of community.They met through me.But it's in a big part because of them that RevRoom materialized. Their desire to give feedback on what was missing in the space and to collaborate on building it helped drive it.Their desire to GIVE.Which is now impacting more people than just the simple intro of 2 incredible leaders.We talk a lot about community-led this and that. And obviously, I'm the number 1 fan of the community movement.But what's missing is not just leveraging community to drive the growth of a company, it's leveraging community to drive the growth of us professionally and personally.

ScribeFounded by Jennifer Smith, Scribe allows you to turn any process into a step by step guide. Picture using Loom for all your SOPs, but it’s actually built for SOPs. Victoria, their head of Influencer Marketing, is the OG starter of Saturday Social. II. ShuttlePriya Mokha, Shuttle’s Head of Growth and Partnerships just wowed the RevGenius community with her pitch of ShuttleHQ, winning our small pitch challenge in Slack. I dove into the product and love it. Shuttle allows you to automate mundane tasks like gathering meeting intel, follow ups, daily rundowns, and soon-to-be gifting. III. SendsparkFounded by Next 50 lister Bethany Stachenfeld, Sendspark is taking the video prospecting world by storm. Use their AI capabilities to shoot just one video and personalize each video for each user with AI. Tons of amazing logos and case studies. On a personal level, I’ve heard the challenges my partner had to go through to reach a high level in a major company.

Jared Robin,Male,2023-09-27,A few years ago I asked a question:Is there really no community for ALL revenue professionals?- there were paid communities- there were sr leader only ones- there were paid + sr leader- there were content sitesWas there really no “community” at no costs for everyone?I wasn’t sure.But it was important to have one imo.So that ICs could be in the same room as sr leaders - and learn from / understand one another. So that all folks could have access at no costs.To level up the space and give all opportunity.So we created RevGenius.And we grew quickly in large part because others saw the need too - at all seniority levels.Proud of what we accomplished in 3 short years:40k GTM Members1 million + messages sent100s of new promotions & jobs 1000s of new connections & friendsTo be a small part in building a space more open and inclusive to allExcited about what’s to come.🌊,75,21,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)
Jared Robin,Male,2024-03-27,"Something not many people know about me:I've spent the past few years losing 45+ lbs I had gained during Covid.It's been a journey with a TON of consistency and showing up.People gave me all the outs - at your age this is normal, things slow down, etc.But, I wasn't comfortable in my own skin. And that was the toughest part. I didn't feel good. :/I tried figuring it out on my own, doing what I used to do when I was more active, and that helped a lot. I even joined 8STR8, which was great.But I still wasn't to where I wanted to be. And while I was happy with the progress I made, I felt like there was more work to do to get back to being 'me'.Then I went to a trainer that helped me be much more strategic and calculated. And I lost 16+ lbs of that in the last 2 months. And now I'm here. Grateful for yet another journey.We will never have all the answers (I didn't). It's up to us to just try our best.

This is why I'm even more excited to announce the RevGenius x Sweep partnership!It all started when I met Ronen, Ido & Danny IRL at an event.When I heard that they were making it easier to implement all processes (including the most complex) in Salesforce through a visual workspace I asked what took so long.Seemed like such a natural and intuitive NEED for RevOps pros. Teams are often made up of small groups of people with tall timely tasks. Do these sound familiar?- The lack of agility and visibility.- Endless requests- The juggling of responsibilities.- The frustrating gap between how GTM works vs. how it’s managed in your CRM.We will be having a Salesforce Velocity webinar series within RevGenius which will be 🔥.We will be bringing in speakers like Mallory Lee, Max Maeder, Aviv Bergman and so many other of the best RevOps leaders.I couldn't be more excited about what's to come.Mollie Bodensteiner and I along with Aviv are cooking up even more stuff to benefit RevOps pros too.

Jared Robin,Male,2023-04-27,"If you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.The excitement I’ve had launching RevRoom mimicked the excitement from RevGenius. It feels like we are solving a major challenge that so many GTM leaders are experiencing.At the turn of the year, many Senior Leaders of the community came to me expressing that they wanted a new, more intimate, and vetted space and weren’t really getting it from anywhere else. Enter RevRoom.We wanted to make sure that RevRoom was an exclusive space. We understood the importance of providing a safe and tailored environment specifically for senior leaders. So curating the RevRoom group exclusively for VPs and C-Suite executives became a critical focus for us.We decided to limit the cohort to 150 members (tops) to safeguard that.  We integrated via Slack Connect to reduce noise and to allow access to the community from members’ company Slacks.  As a result, there are not dozens of channels but just one or two core ones.Finally, we’ve decided to roll out five pillars to provide members qith a more unique and structured experience. Five Pillars of RevRoomCore GroupsThese groups of 8 meet monthly to discuss their biggest challenges in a private setting.  Virtual CommunityOur Slack is unique because of the 150 people/ channel (‘room’) and weekly roundtable discussions in an intimate setting. Our promise? We’ll keep cohorts at 150. Live GatheringsThe in-person community where we’re rolling out dinners and retreats. Expert-Led Insight SessionsLearning series, where we will feature some of the world’s best speakers and subject matter experts, talking about the topics our members ask for.Member BenefitsWe are introducing B2C-like perks and experiences (think hotel discounts, etc.) to meet our members’ lifestyle needs.Collaborating on the Future of B2B GTMThe goal is to create a unique and intimate, community-led experience from the go.We want to grow thoughtfully. We want to grow together and deliver on our promise to make RevRoom the trusted space for revenue leaders.Here are a few of the go-to-market VPs and C-level executives that make up our community today:Christina Brady 🐙  (SVP Sales, Spekit), Sid Kumar  (SVP RevOps, Hubspot), Jenn Steele  (CEO, Kissmetrics), Adam Jay 📈  (CRO), Gemma Cipriani-Espineira  (Founder, CS Angels), Mary Poppen  (CCO, involve.ai), Paul Rosen  (CRO, ShipBob), Mollie Bodensteiner (Head of Global RevOps, Deel), Mark Kilens  (CMO, Airmeet), Shannon (Sweeny) Curran  (VP Marketing, MadKudu), Scott Sutton  (CBO, ZoomInfo) and many others from Series A high-growth startups to public companies.

This team of Jeff Lawrence, Matt Sawyer, Kyle Fox, Stefan Frank, Dre Babić, Brady Cassidy, Marcin Mizianty and so many others never gave up.Never.We went to Series A together after a tremendously difficult stretch.I'm nostalgic for the experiences we had together - traveling to Edmonton for sometimes weeks at a time.Wearing a suit in 12"" plus of snow my first day (coming from FedEx to pay homage to my past employer).Working out and playing basketball in the local Edmonton Y. Jasper Avenue (amirite).Throwing Hank Moody memes into Slack or hipchat (or whatever messenger we used at the time!) to celebrate wins.When we upgraded from a 500 sq ft office to a big loft.And so much more...Matt Sawyer and I still text and call each other laughing often.

Jared Robin,Male,2024-02-27,"I asked to be a GTM Partners Ambassador a couple months ago.Fortunately (for me), I was accepted. As brands, we want a community of supporters evangelizing our brand.Ideally that are YEARNING to support the movements we are creating.To create a raving fan in B2B I believe you need to go above and beyond in creating value for the people you serve.Be truly collaborative.They’ve provided me with learnings on Go-To-Market that nobody in the industry has by inviting me to their exclusive events (both IRL and digital) and teaching me their frameworks (while answering any questions I have).They’ve also been more than available to me and RevGenius allowing us to have different leaders in their org write articles for our digital magazine, be a podcast guest, and speaker at RevCon.In general, they’ve been beyond the moon kind and supportive of everything RevGenius and I do. And, they’ve also done this to seemingly 100s (if not 1000s) of others. They’ve also provided me introductions to folks that I could potentially do business with. They’ve spoken kindly about me in a way that makes others want to work with me as well.I also get a ton of value in being a part of such an elite group of leaders building the future of GTM.And I hope I’ve given close to that value back to them.To be sure, when I saw them launch their Ambassador program, I reached out to them to ask to be a part of it. I also saw other mutual connections become part of the first cohort of Ambassadors and had major FOMO as well.A potent combination for sure.Still, just because you become an Ambassador doesn’t guarantee you will be active. I wanted to share the ‘Perks’ part of GTM Partner’s Ambassador program to show you how they’re thinking about ‘activating’ program members.‘Perks’ is code for ‘Value’.Here is the value that their Ambassadors receive:- GTM Ambassador badge on LinkedIn - Consideration for speaker slots on digital events- We’ll nominate you for speaking slots at premier industry events- We’ll nominate you for awards - 5 tickets to every roadshow- Invitations to pre-roadshow networking events- Monthly GTM/mastermind session with Sangram and Sarah- You’ll be added to our exclusive customer slack channel. - SWAG- What else? What do you want that we didn’t think of? - their askWhat else?

We are coming into an age of owned media, owned community, owned everything (because let’s be real, the algos on social are dipping) teamed with side hustles and overflowing inboxes and the need for a personal crm has been massive. Folk allows me to keep tabs on my most important relationships, stay on top of engagement, keep notes, set reminders and make quality intros.It also gives me a relationship driven crm for my newsletter (sorry beehiiv, love you but this is a gap).

Jared Robin,Male,2024-04-22,"How does HockeyStack generate more revenue from their content than your brand does?Because of Hockeystack Labs insane only KPI (you’re going to want to read this)…Canberk Beker their head of growth set an internal KPI-We will come to this point where we won't be asking people to share reports, we won't give to influencers to share the reports, but they will do it organically. And after the fourth, maybe fifth report, it started happening. Here’s HockeyStack Labs Growth Loop:1. HockeyStack Labs came out with a data report they thought was interesting and people liked it. 2. They told HockeyStack what else they wanted to hear, because they were getting a lot of value from it (and they weren’t getting it from anywhere else). They needed more to help them make smart business decisions.3. HockeyStack encouraged them to start requesting topics they wanted data on and that they thought they could get even more value from.4. HockeyStack listened to them and created reports based on a combo of most requested + what they thought would be most interesting internally.5. Their audience got even more value and shared it on social media with their followers and gave feedback for the next reports.  The loop just keeps going. Results:They are generating like 50% of our pipeline from this organically.We are actually talking about millions. And the interesting thing is that the pipeline comes from organic traffic. The website traffic has also increased by a lot.Read the full playbook: https://lnkd.in/epkDakYiSo they’re giving people what they actually need and want vs just sharing their POV and making their content one-sided.And the people are loving it.Imagine that.🔁",63,22,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)

Users submitted templates and Notion displayed them to folks looking for them. More importantly, they gave relevant suggestions.This connected members with quick and easy paths to success. They discovered templates that helped them do their main thing better.Folks even made businesses out of template creation!Community x template growth loop = billion dollar valuationTakeaways:- Community drives rapid adoption for PLG to scale.- Align the product with community members' personal goals.- Empower community members to serve your customers.Can't promise community will make you the next unicorn.Can promise it will make it easier.🌊",61,29,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)

Jared Robin,Male,2024-04-06,"Hot take: A large % of 'Strategic Advisors' are just Brand Ambassadors with a more important sounding title. But, why?Sat down with Morgan J Ingram for the Collab's Saturday issue. The Brand Ambassador is the first of 3 tiers in Morgan's B2B Influencer playbook.He's starting to not like the term Strategic Advisor because a lot of people position Strategic Advisors as what we're calling a brand ambassador. He thinks a lot of people label people as strategic advisors to get pushed by the algorithm when you post the announcement. It does that.So he understand why people do that. Fair play. At the same time, that person really probably isn't actually doing any strategic advising. They're just posting. It's really just an ambassador. But no one likes that word [ambassador] in B2B.A lot of creators don't want to be called 'brand ambassadors'. But the thing is, that is effectively what you are at this moment. You are a brand ambassador for this brand. You're an affiliate right now. You have an affiliate link. You may be getting paid, you know, a thousand, $2,000 a month, which is great. But that's the realm you're playing in, is the brand ambassador. So how you monitor that is you typically are probably going to get five to eight brand ambassadors:- And you're just seeing are you getting more uptick in your traffic on your website? - Are you getting more uptick in your LinkedIn followers as people start to talk about you a little bit more.That's how you're going to gauge success. - And then obviously the affiliate is how people are clicking the affiliate link that converts to actual opportunities. So these are things that he thinks about the brand ambassador level.I personally refuse to take advisor roles where equity and/or up front pay is not included, nor tied to requirements for me to post on social.I agree with Morgan and think it 'cheapens' what advising a company means.Still, there's an important place for Ambassadors in driving demand.Read Morgan's full playbook -> https://lnkd.in/evPXrPGKShould we change the name of 'strategic advisors' to 'brand ambassadors' and align more with their goals?What do you think?",60,19,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)

Make sure there’s value for them in spending that time that goes beyond “talking sales strategies” or “getting to know my network”.Nobody really wants to turn down or not respond to a human to human connection. But so few people make an effort to give equal value (or more) back to the person you’re asking for time from.It’s a “taking” ask vs a “giving” one.It’s more than offering help.It’s understanding what they may need help with.Just like when you outbound a prospect.Try it, report back.Here’s to more valuable networking and more responses to cold DMs to meet your network.What’s your fave LinkedIn networking tip?❤️",59,37,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)

What’s a sour take? It’s an insight/tactic that goes against the grain and challenges the way you have been thinking. Ultimately, the insight leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth. You are happy you found out the truth now but disturbed you didn’t find out sooner.Like the show, “Hot Ones”, the candies will progressively get more sour.

Jared Robin,Male,2023-12-27,"Founders are more cautious than ever with the types of roles they are filling.That doesn’t mean they don’t need a sales leader or go-to-market leader, it’s just that they don’t have the luxury of budgeting for one and certainly not the luxury of making the wrong hire.Historically, companies haven’t done well in hiring for these roles. And it’s becoming harder than ever.At the growth at all costs phase when you have a need, you hire for the role.When you make a mistake, you fire them.In growth at the lowest cost when you have a need you hire a fractional (part-time C-level contractor) because the risks to top and bottom-line growth are too high to hire the wrong full-time leader.Here are 3 we featured this week on The Collab:I. ☑️Lisa K.Lisa specializes in helping rapidly growing SaaS companies succeed in achieving scalability, efficiency, and profitability. She’s an absolute all-star in everything revenue and sales operations.

Brands were companies.Michael Jordan changed that.Collaborative Growth is how companies and individuals partner to grow both brands.Michael Jordan was the OG that started this.  The Collab is bringing it to B2B.Here’s your 5-step collaboration strategy:1. Be clear on what you want to achieve (Goals and KPIs clearly set).In Nike’s case, they created a forecast of $3M in 4 years and blew past that hitting $126M year 1.2. Be OK to pay! Money and/or equity are both acceptable. Michael Jordan received both $2.5 million over 5 years and 10% of the sales. It was a mutually beneficial structure that both greatly benefited from.3. Be ready to collaborate.Collaborate = partner for more than 1 or 2 activities. It’s building trust over time.4. Be OK to start imperfectly.This is a marathon, not a sprint. Embrace the roadblocks. Nike designed the first Air Jordans in the distinctive colors of red, black, and white. Despite facing fines of $5,000 for each game Jordan wore the non-compliant shoes, Nike embraced the controversy, covering the fines and allowing the shoes to stand out.5.

Jared Robin,Male,2023-11-27,"Regarding entrepreneurship, I struggle with the idea that many great founders had dads who mistreated them (Musk) or abandoned them altogether (Jobs). My dad isn't like that at all.I have a GREAT dad. And I've known it intuitively since I can remember. When you know, you know.Maybe that gives me a ""disadvantage"" in entrepreneurship or hunger or a need to prove something. The odds are extraordinarily low that I will ever achieve what Musk and Jobs have in business. But as I thought about it this week...I wouldn't trade. I'm so grateful to my dad.Many in my field of startups ask these days, ""What is something you believe that's non-consensus and right?""  Here's my answer: Having an awesome dad...is a feature, not a bug.

Jared Robin,Male,2023-05-27,"It may only be June, but planning for 2024 is already underway.  David Maxey, MBA writes about Next-Level Sales and Pre-Sales Annual Planning: Two ApproachesBottoms-up forecasting, starting with people and ending with a Top line revenue target; or Top-down, starting with a revenue target and fitting people into this target.For pre-sales and sales, the main focus is ensuring you have enough Account Executives to cover the revenue targets and that those Account Executives have enough SDR and/or Solution Engineering support to cover the pipeline needs for the revenue targets.  A secondary focus that tends to get less attention is marketing.  Specifically, is marketing bringing in enough leads to support the sales targets? Usually, your marketing and sales leaders work together to decide what portion of the pipeline will be covered by marketing vs. pure sales outreach.When you look at these two focus areas, it would appear that from a planning standpoint, you only have a little to be able to move around besides the hiring dates of the people needed to execute.

You’re likely having a go-to-market problem.”- “90% of our content does not get tracked on Google. What we need to be is a canary in a coal mine.”- “Research & tailor to individual decision makers. People who are of the same company may not have the same values and needs.”- “People have a natural mental spam filter for sales. Most emails are deleted within 3 seconds.

Jared Robin,Male,2023-11-27,"Start with a challenge or gap that you feel passionate about solving. 📢For RevGenius, we started with a friend group of 4 people in the DMs on LinkedIn during Covid. We wanted to support one another on LinkedIn and in sales. We each added a handful more folks who were looking for similar support. It was effortless.The energy in the group was palpable. The LinkedIn app broke (shut off) daily for all of us.I realized that many didn’t have a space they could go to for support.There were other communities, but they often only allowed leaders in and/or charged for entry.A space that allowed all was critical, in my opinion, for the lifting of the space as a whole. I had discovered the challenge folks had.For your community: listen on social, to customers, to prospects, in communities, and other spaces for challenges or gaps that are big, aligned to your direction, and that you’re passionate about solving.Organizing a small direct message group of your own around that challenge will quickly help you realize if you’re onto something.Look for that palpable energy in the group. This is essential. Build a movement from there.🚀#community #collaborativegrowth",47,9,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)

Jared Robin,Male,2024-01-27,"It’s 2024: you’re leaning in…you’re growing your social brand, community, monitoring your website, and have product usage data and loads of data in your CRM... but are you connecting it all well?Story time.As a leader of a massive community, people are talking ALL THE TIME everywhere.But we didn’t know if they were new members, old members, potential clients, or just noise.As you can imagine, data was everywhere, and it was very difficult to centralize. From questions and feedback shared across digital channels like social, community, and on our website.And then utilize the data to understand:- Who are the most active members (by channel)- Was our onboarding effective (leading to members receiving value)?- How we measure engagement cross-channel- How were our metrics and where were drop-offsAnd also:- How can we ‘listen’ to what’s being said to surface relevant opportunities for sponsors to engage- How can we find new potential sponsors in the communityEnter Common Room.They were a lifesaver for us in understanding how to better understand our growth metrics and how to provide the most value to our sponsors (while spotting new potential ones).So hype: RevGenius & Common Room are throwing some dope AF events, they are being featured again in my newsletter, and I’m excited about how they can help you just like they helped me.I can’t tell you how important they are to the way we do business.

Jared Robin,Male,2024-04-20,"Steal Rebecca Marshburn the Head of Community at Common Room’s Creator GTM Playbook-Here’s the 2 things she looks for in finding the right creators:1. Creators within the persona we are trying to reach-  We're all about intelligent GTM. We're all about building our customer intelligence platform and helping others understand the defining pillars of a customer intelligence platform. And so, from there, there are personas that specifically would get the most value out of a tool like Common Room. And that's going to be that full GTM squad, right? So it's going to be marketing people, sales people, ops people, marketing ops people, revops people, success people, obviously community and DevRel people. And so with all of those personas together, that's where we start.2. Creators that are genuinely excited about Common Room-I want to find creators that want to work with Common Room and dive into the product. They've got to believe in Common Room. They've got to have wanted to spend the time and be like, ""oh, oh, yes"", I see how the people that are interacting with me would get value out of this. That totally changes the relationship not only between us and our creators, but between creators and the product, and then how creators are able to show up when their audience and community members ask real questions—they can be like, ""oh, I actually know this"", or ""this is how I would use it"", or ""this is why I would recommend it in this moment"".Something I love about the creators we work with is how actionable and straightforward their posts are. Like, here's the 1-2-3 of how I craft my first cold outreach.See how Rebecca measures success and their ROI -> https://lnkd.in/eEpike4PWhat are your favorite creator plays?",41,20,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)
Jared Robin,Male,2024-01-27,"You’d be shocked how much we pause our breathing during the day.When we are scared or nervous we stop for seconds at a time. We do it so often we don’t realize it.These pauses are a true reflection of the fears we hold.Deep down. Stuff we may not admit to ourselves even.Pausing take us away from presence.Either to our past that’s already happened or a future that’s yet to unfold.To places that aren’t real right now.The only thing real is what’s happening right here and now.In this moment.Breathing helps center us. Focusing on connecting our breaths helps us feel the emotions we haven’t integrated.The more we do it, the more of a habit it comes.The more aware we become.And the ability we begin to wield to live a conscious life.

Product-driven content: People need to know what HockeyStack is, how it works, how it can help them, and what outcomes it can achieve.2. Narrative-driven content: Aside from people knowing how your product works, they need to know:- Why should they use this product in the first place?- What is it going to help them achieve?- What change or transformation is it helping them accomplish?3. Entertainment-driven content:For people not in the market: regardless of how good the product related content is, people are only going to be interested in that if they're actively looking for such a product right now.Otherwise you’re not going to tune into it because you don’t care about that thing.He used this strategy to launch the Netflix for B2B Marketers.There's way more than this, but high-level 🔥Read the full article here -> https://lnkd.in/dQ9jW6zb",36,15,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)

Jared Robin,Male,2024-03-27,"The 4 most important skills as a startup founder or any early stage company employee:1. Understand intimately what you don't know (but need to). This awareness of your gaps in getting your product or service to the next milestones will allow you to figure out either how to level up yourself or (more importantly) -2. Have a network of people that you have loads of confidence in that can help you directly fill your most important gaps or you trust can introduce you to somebody you can bring in to. For me, this is why I brought in  Jason Hubbard (I had a personal gap with operations and leadership - Mallory Lee, Mollie Bodensteiner and others are also great folks to help). Join communities like RevGenius to help here.3. Build your 'figure it out' ability. This is a combination of grit, curiosity, hustle, and more. Things will go wrong - I can guarantee that. There will come a time when you don't have answers to important questions and quick answers in general aren't easily found. Can you stick with things, test things, iterate, and 'figure it out'. When you run out of runway, are you able to keep the company afloat? Can you put in systems to not get too close to the edge again, etc... which leads me to - 4. Ability to remain even keeled.This doesn't get spoken about enough. The mental side of being a founder (or early stage employee who probably has taken a pay cut) has the ability to trigger every single emotion you have (and new ones you didn't realize were inside you). Can you remain even keeled and non reactive. For me, I go through waves. Sometimes it's harder than others; I'll lean on #3 to figure out my mental state.Right now I'm going through therapy and about to start daily meditation again. In addition to a heightened focus on my physical well being.What are some skills you've developed that have helped you greatly?",24,9,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAEIWl4BLcwZ2LsfQPuZwbC59c4qsXYnBBE&keywords=jared%20robin%20%E2%8F%AD&position=0&searchId=22273820-2f65-493d-b052-8a269b29ddb1&sid=%3BOA&sortBy=%22date_posted%22&update=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7189280176948617216%2CBLENDED_SEARCH_FEED%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse)
