Russell Brunson,Male,2024-04-13,"Here's my best advice for how to talk crap about somebody you hate.​This is a secret I learned from one of my favorite authors of all time, Napoleon Hill.​This is what he said, ""If you must speak ill of another don't speak it. Instead, write it in the sand next to the water's edge.""​So, what Hill is basically saying is that don't do it.​I get it. It's tempting, especially in the age of social media, when you might feel compelled to vent about someone who's been bothering you for a while.​But here's the thing:​1. Words have a lasting impact.​What you say can stick around for a long time, and you wouldn't want to regret it later.​2. A more effective strategy is to write out your feelings privately and then delete it.​Expressing your thoughts on paper can be therapeutic, but sharing them publicly isn't always the best move.​Writing allows you to release those emotions without causing harm.​3. Remember, the words you use reflect on you.​Speaking negatively about others says more about you than them.​Be mindful of the impact your words may have on your own image.​So, if you ever feel the urge to badmouth someone, resist it.​Trust me, your life will be much better if you choose not to engage in negativity.​Choose kindness and positivity in your interactions.",315,78,10,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAACiA3QBETy4jzuf75LR4Fwzo1Rn39CekCE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAACiA3QBETy4jzuf75LR4Fwzo1Rn39CekCE&keywords=russell%20brunson&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=640633c9-9d32-4ccc-862d-50388095940e&sid=u.P&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
