Jason Feifer,Male,2023-07-27,"This WWF ad was genius.That’s because they followed an important rule:🔥 DON’T JUST FOLLOW SOMETHING. ADVANCE IT. 🔥So many brands hop on viral bandwagons or post about news.That usually flops — because it's just trying to be relevant by association. It’s like saying: “If people care about this, then they’ll care about me if I talk about it.”But the attention economy doesn’t work like that!You can’t just join a conversation — you must ADVANCE that conversation!Add something new to it. Take it in a different direction. Engage in unusual, insightful ways.WWF nailed it here — reframing the rise and fall of Twitter as an animal gone extinct. Clever, purposeful, totally unexpected.That’s the bar for us all to reach.Want to improve *your* work?

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-09-27,"What if we all acted more like this?Instead of saying “you’re doing it wrong” — we could say “here’s how to do it better.”This story is from 2018: A 13-year-old, Jaequan Faulkner, was running a hot dog stand, when someone called the cops because he didn’t have a permit.The city then helped the kid go legit — teaching him finance and marketing, and giving him a tent and a hand-washing station.He ended up selling hot dogs for years.Every day, we’re faced with a similar choice: A friend, colleague, or even stranger will stumble — and we can either tell them they’re wrong, or help them do better.When we choose the latter, we’re better too.Here’s another way to be better: My newsletter, One Thing Better, offers one way each week to improve your work — subscribe for free at jasonfeifer.com/newsletter",18561,421,599,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0&keywords=jason%20feifer&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=64051513-d940-48c5-a04e-b1c09814bfc7&sid=8hf&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

And alternate lighting sources were hard to develop.But what if you tackled a more specific problem — the problem of “forgetfulness”?That leads you to think not just about candles, but about *unattended* candles.

When you are better known for the things you do, your value goes up. “Will this get you some haters? Yes, she says — but so what?“People still say I’m self-centered,” she says. “Well, if I’m not self-centered, who am I supposed to be centered on? Who?

It states that work expands to fit the time allowed.If you have lots of time to finish something, it’ll take a lot of time. If it’s a short deadline, you’ll do it faster.Meetings are the same. Put 30 or 60 minutes on the calendar, and we’ll fill that time — even if we don’t need it.Constraints force focus.

Business has become less formal, and it’s happening in less formal places.If you’re anchored to what you think things “should be like” — and not what they ACTUALLY are like — then the world will move on without you.In fact, that’s apparently happening — the New York Post reported that Casa Cipriani is “desperately seeking new members because its current crowd is ... a bunch of [mob types].”You know what might attract today’s freshest entrepreneurs and most interesting crowds?

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-01-27,"This woman filmed herself getting laid off — and captured a DISASTER.Among the problems:❌ The call was with two jargon-speaking HR people she’d never met.❌ She was told she underperformed, but could not be given specifics.❌ She hadn’t been put on a performance review, and her manager only gave her positive feedback.This was at Cloudflare, and CEO Matthew Prince responded: “This video is painful for me to watch."" (Full statement at https://lnkd.in/e8MwGXG2 )He acknowledged the mistakes: Managers should have been involved. No employee should be surprised they’re underperforming.Firing her wasn’t the mistake, he said — an org should know, within 3 months, whether a team member is the right fit.“We think the right thing to do is get people we know are unlikely to succeed off the team as quickly as possible so they can find the right place for them,” he wrote. “The mistake was not being more kind and human as we did.”What a terrible experience, but also an important conversation.Being fired sucks. Firing people sucks. I’ve been on both sides — awful each time!But it’s necessary — to build a healthy company, and to have a healthy career.

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-10-27,"Well THAT'S a hot take!When you announce you’re seeking new work, some recruiters say it “turns off many hiring managers.”It can “make the job candidate seem desperate” — as if you’ll just take anything that comes.Instead, they say, the most valuable job candidates are hard to get.“Recruiting is like dating,” the former Google recruiter (now CEO of a talent marketplace) says. “You have to make the other side feel like you’re exclusive.”Fwiw, here’s my take: As a hiring manager, the “open to work” badge wouldn’t impact my view of a candidate — positively or negatively.Still, I’ve never understood the badge — because isn’t *everyone* technically open to new work?I mean, even very happy leaders can be enticed by the right offer.Still, this is a useful discussion.

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-02-27,"Despite what everyone says, you (and your brand) DO NOT need to be on every social media platform.I didn’t make this image — I just saw it trending on Instagram. But it contains a great truth.People (and brands) feel great pressure to be *everywhere* — tweeting and TikTokking nonstop, making TV-length YouTube videos, and more.Wrong! You’ll just stretch yourself thin and post meaningless stuff for people who don’t care.Instead of trying to be everywhere, try to be MEANINGFUL. To start, ask yourself this:“Where are my people, what are my skills, and where can I naturally join the conversation?”Me, for example: My personal brand is aimed at professionals. I’m a fast writer (and a slow video editor), and I’m better in longform than shortform.That’s why I doubled down on LinkedIn (where I post daily) and newsletter (where I invest a lot of energy). I experiment on other platforms, but only on the margins.If you have the time and money, go ahead and post everywhere! But you don’t NEED TO. Your goal should be to connect with people, not just scroll past their eyeballs — and that means picking your spots and making it count.Want to reach people better?

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-10-27,"NEVER memorize a talk or presentation.Here’s why — a lesson from the WORST talk I’ve ever seen.I once saw a speaker at a conference. She was polished and well-paced, and the first few minutes were good.Then she stumbled on a word, and paused... for a FULL MINUTE.Then she repeated the previous sentence she'd said. Paused. Another silence.This happened repeatedly.I knew her problem.She'd memorized her talk word for word — so when she stumbled, she lost her place.To restart, she was literally re-running the script in her head. This is the danger of memorization. You're trapped inside your script, and one slip-up can derail you.Here’s how to do it better: Rehearse your material until you're comfortable. Fill it with stories and ideas you already know your way around. Memorize the structure, but never anchor yourself to the language.You don't want to read a script inside your head. You want to SPEAK — from your head and heart, to your audience's ears.Want to be more impactful?

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-02-27,"Changes are coming to LinkedIn — and if you want to grow here, you should know about them.I got the inside look from LinkedIn’s editor in chief Daniel Roth and senior director of engineering Tim Jurka.LinkedIn is doubling down on incentivizing people to post “knowledge and advice” and to engage their focused professional communities — and continues to disincentivize broad efforts at virality.Among the ways it’s doing that:📈 A new “suggested post” feature will amplify your best posts for years — which LinkedIn hopes will incentivize people to post more useful, skill-specific content.🔁 Are you worried that, following last year’s algorithm changes, your reach on LinkedIn has shrunk? LinkedIn says that’s the wrong way to think about it. It wants to help you optimize reaching the *right* people.💻 It's adding more data and functionality to its newsletter product, and wants to compete directly against other newsletter platforms.🚀 “Creator mode” is coming for everyone (even as LinkedIn explicitly moves away from the term ""creator""), company pages can now pay to promote other people’s posts, new “custom button” phrases will be rolling out (including one to promote newsletters), and more.And that’s just the start of my report with Entrepreneur Media!You can read it all here: https://lnkd.in/eMCuHz8P",786,237,85,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0&keywords=jason%20feifer&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=64051513-d940-48c5-a04e-b1c09814bfc7&sid=8hf&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-03-27,"Do you worry you ask too much of other people?I do — but Jimmy Fallon helped me think differently.Here’s the story.I once interviewed Jimmy for a cover profile in Entrepreneur. We met in his office at 30 Rock and had a great, insightful conversation.At the end, he invited me to reach out if I had follow-up questions. I said thanks, but that I’d already taken up a lot of his time and I wanted to respect that.And yet, as I started to write the story, I realized that I’d missed something important. I really DID need to follow up!“I really appreciate you squeezing this in,” I said to Jimmy when we reconnected.“No one ever takes me up on it!” Jimmy replied. “So I was like, yeah! He’s thorough, he’s smart. Let’s do it — I can’t wait.”“It’s so funny,” I replied, “because I think, oh, following up is a burden.”“Never,” Jimmy said.Let’s recap: Jimmy has been interviewed many times, and often offers to answer follow-up questions. Nobody takes him up on it, but I did. And to Jimmy, that wasn’t a burden — it was a sign of thoroughness.And he APPRECIATES thoroughness.Sometimes, the thing we think is a burden is actually an asset.But you’ll never know unless you ask.👉 What OTHER strengths are you missing?

Too slow!Today, of course, it’s just funny — because we can’t imagine a time before it.That’s how change happens: First it’s weird, and eventually it’s so normal that we forget things were ever done differently.The next time you’re grappling with change, remember this.Ask yourself: What will it take for this to feel normal?

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-10-27,"You do NOT need to be on all social platforms.This is a perfect example of why — and how to decide what platforms to invest in.Even though NPR had 8.7 million followers on its main account, Twitter drove less than 2% of traffic to its site... so leaving had little impact. (Source: https://lnkd.in/gRMP_FM7)That's consistent with the publications I've worked at — including every day at Entrepreneur. Twitter isn't even in the top 5 of referral traffic.We all have limited resources — so how do you decide where to put your social media energy?My answer: You need to assess three things.1. Where is your community already hanging out?2. How naturally or easily can you create different kinds of content? (Are you good at video? Images? Text?)3. What tangible results do you want from social media?When you answer those, you’ll know which platforms are worth your time.Me, for example: My audience is professionals, I can write faster than I make videos, and my goal is to build my profile, drive awareness to my projects, and build closer ties to my audience...Which is why I put 80% of my effort into LinkedIn. (The other 20% goes to Instagram.)Other answers might drive you to Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Reddit, or wherever else.Point is: You do NOT need to be everywhere. But you SHOULD be wherever you find and deliver the most value.And if a social network doesn’t work for you, just quit. You’ll be fine.Want to maximize your efforts?

Give yourself a way to act — not as a means of hurting someone else, but as a means of refueling yourself. Maybe it means turning an insult into an advertisement, like the example here.

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-02-27,"Why would you share what you know — when others can just profit from it?This comment was left under a post of mine, after I said LinkedIn wants users to share “knowledge and advice.”I think this person is totally wrong. Here are 4 reasons to share what you know, freely and without expectation.1. THEIR SUCCESS IS NOT YOUR FAILURESuccess is not a zero-sum game. When people gain, you do not lose.In fact, when other people gain, YOU GAIN TOO — because they’ll remember who gave them that great insight, and will want to find some way to help you.2. YOUR IDEAS ARE NOT YOUR EXECUTIONYou know how to do something. But only YOU do it in your own unique way, and that’s where your success comes from.For example, I have many friends who want to be public speakers. I happily share what I’ve learned.I’m not protective of this information, because it’s just the foundations. I use that knowledge to give my talks in my style. They’ll use it to give their talks in their style. There’s no competition.3. YOU KNOW MORE THAN THAT!If you want someone to pay for your knowledge, you need to show them that you’re knowledgeable.If all your collective wisdom fits into a few LinkedIn posts, you might not have much worth paying for!4. YOU’RE PART OF A COMMUNITY (UNLESS YOU QUIT)Professionals on LinkedIn have built a beautiful social contract: We give, because we get. And if nobody gave, nobody would get.Yes, sure, you could be on here learning and never sharing. But what fun is that? I’m willing to give out ideas for free, because what I get in return is more valuable.AND I GIVE EVEN MORE right here in my newsletter — every week, one new way to be more successful and satisfied: jasonfeifer.com/newsletter",582,304,18,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0&keywords=jason%20feifer&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=64051513-d940-48c5-a04e-b1c09814bfc7&sid=8hf&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-07-27,"Here’s why Ryan Reynolds loves SMALL BUDGETS...And why you should too.When Ryan was shooting Deadpool, the studio kept shrinking his movie’s budget. At first this was frustrating.Then it forced his team to think more creatively…“Every time the studio took money away,” he told me, “we replaced whatever set piece we lost with character. Eventually that became the hallmark and defining characteristic of that property.”Why? Because people don’t remember big explosions and action sequences.“They remember what he said, or how he reacted to a moment,” Ryan said. “To me, that lesson is worth its weight in gold, because you can penetrate the zeitgeist and make an impression without busting the bank.”When you have endless resources, you spend easily and carelessly.But when you have LIMITED resources, you spend smartly — and make an impact.Want to accomplish more with less?

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-03-27,"Every speaker will face a person like this — and here’s how to handle it: Even though this person has “more of a comment than a question,” you treat them like they’re asking a question. Once you get the point they’re making, interrupt and say: “Thanks, sorry to cut you off, but you raise a great question there…” You’ve just validated something they said! They want to know what you’ll say next. You’ve also regained control and brought your audience back in. Now, reframe some small part of their “comment” as a question that you’re happy to answer. Like: “How can someone do X, given the problems with [whatever they were focused on]?” Then answer this question and move on! I picked this trick up by listening to NPR call-in shows, where the hosts have  mastered this verbal jiu-jitsu. Sometimes callers ramble, and the host always cuts in, reframes what they said as a coherent question, and poses that question to the show’s guest.Then the guest answers the question, and it’s on to the next.In short: Don’t lose control. Don’t push back. Don’t awkwardly try to move on. Just treat them like a questioner whose question was a little unclear, so you’re going to clarify it.Works every time!Want help navigating other tricky situations?

Our best-selling issue? Our most-trafficked story? Jim sent us ideas to promote the issue. Gave a ton of his time. Pushed it hard himself. You'd be surprised — people on the cover rarely do that. Then, when my book came out last year, he was back at it — asking repeatedly how he could help me. In turn, of course, I am always happy to support him. This is the truth: When you dedicate yourself to making OTHERS a success, you benefit greatly too.Want more ways to succeed?

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-06-27,"This person is setting goals all wrong.It’s a mistake I see WAY too often — and here’s why.A *LOT* of people send me stuff like this — telling me their goal is to be in Entrepreneur (especially on the cover).But goals should be things you have control over. Otherwise, your success or failure rests upon OTHER PEOPLE’S decisions — and that’s a recipe for disappointment.Press coverage, for example: Reporters and editors make decisions themselves; the result is arbitrary. Someone gets covered, someone does not.Take it from me: Coverage (or lack of coverage) DOES NOT REFLECT your worth or value — but if your goal is coverage, you just lost control of how you mark success.(When my book came out, for example, I explicitly decided that a best-seller list was NOT a goal. Why? Because I have no control over that. I set other goals instead.)Dreams are great — go wild! Swing big!But goals are how you define success. Keep that control for yourself.

Trust and respect is literally all you have.

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-04-20,"Here’s what LinkedIn “influencers” are earning for brand posts — and why you could, too.I just talked with my friend Brendan Gahan, who launched the world’s first LinkedIn-focused influencer marketing agency.He says LinkedIn is ripe with opportunity: B2B brands are interested in influencer marketing, and they like that LinkedIn “influencers” have potent, targeted audiences of professionals.So what can people charge for a post? Brendan says it varies widely and there's a lot of nuance, but the ballpark is “anywhere from 1 to 10% of your audience size.”This means if you have 10,000 followers, you might reasonably charge anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per post.Brendan says he’s seeing a reverse bell curve: Small creators can charge higher rates for niche audiences, mid-sized creators charge less because their audience is less focused, and the top creators charge more because they’re so in demand.That’s just the start — we dove deep into the influencer space here, and how brands (and maybe you!) can profit from it.

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-03-27,"Journalists keep insulting LinkedIn users and calling the site “cringe” — and as a media guy myself, I have a theory about why. A journalist’s professional experience is different from the average LinkedIn user, in three big ways: 1. Journalism is isolating. You report on other industries, which means you keep a distance from them — unlike the networking motivations of most LinkedIn users. 2. There’s little professional development architecture in journalism, so writers are unaccustomed to the kind of communications they see here. 3. As Business Insider’s Emily Stewart wrote of herself: “I don't want to come off as overly earnest, too self-promotional, or dare I say it, cringe.”That last one is worth unpacking. When I was purely a magazine writer/editor, I felt the same way.Earnestness and self-promotion are rarely encouraged in media. But they’re understood differently in much of the business world. It’s not earnestness; it’s relatability. It’s not self-promotion; it’s providing value to others. This thinking doesn’t come naturally — it’s learned through immersion.Obviously, there’s plenty of garbage on LinkedIn, just like any platform. Earnestness can be performative; self-promotion can be overdone. But like anything, it’s helpful to know where people are coming from... on both sides of any divide. I’d welcome my media peers to actually *participate* here, instead of just observe from afar. It feels very different once you join the conversation.(The Business Insider piece is here, should you be interested: https://lnkd.in/ex-ZCpR6)",379,187,13,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0&keywords=jason%20feifer&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=64051513-d940-48c5-a04e-b1c09814bfc7&sid=8hf&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Here’s the setup —My wife and I walked into New West KnifeWorks’ store in Denver, where they sell knives and outdoor gear.After some browsing, they handed us these hats and coat and said, “Try them on.” Fun!Then they said: “Walk around the block if you want!”So we did — and EVERYONE noticed. So many stares. Laughs. Jokes.When we got back, the guy said he only sells a few of these $5,000 buffalo coats a year — but he puts people in them all the time, because they draw others to the store.Sure enough, a bunch of people followed us back in.Sometimes the greatest currency isn’t money — it’s joy.

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-01-27,"HOT TAKE worth taking seriously — if you use AI images in your marketing, you look low-budget.I’m not endorsing this. But I do think it’s worth paying attention to — and here’s why.People often claim that AI will replace human labor — doing all the writing, illustrating, and photographing that people once did.But technology usage isn’t linear like that. New things don’t wholly replace old things.Instead, new INTEGRATES with old — finding specific uses, which are often shaped by cultural demands.AI art is a perfect example: The tech is incredible, but it’s produced so easily that it can be viewed as disposable.Maybe, as AI images become common, people will assign new value to human work — just like we value products that are “hand-made” or “small-batch.”The point is: Everything happens in context, and people’s attitudes are ever-shifting — so we must always listen, listen, LISTEN.Want to make things people love?

It isn’t expensive this and thats. Here’s what makes you a better writer: WRITING. Do it often. Do it in public. Get critical feedback from people who push you to be sharper, more focused, and less verbose. When I began, I wrote for tiny blogs and newspapers. Editors would tell me to rewrite things. That hurt. But I’d do it. Then I’d publish — which changes everything. Once it’s in the world, it’s no longer yours. Now you see your writing through your readers’ eyes. You see all the flaws. All the ways you could have improved. Then you channel that into the next thing you write. And you repeat. Stop talking about the things you want to write. Actually start writing. It might be bad.

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-01-27,"I got this card when I was 13 — by creating a sneaky way to get athletes’ signatures. First, I’d buy a pack of cards. Then I’d write a hand-written letter to everyone whose card I got — no matter whether they were a star, a scrub, or a coach. The letter said (often falsely) that I was a huge fan of the team, and could they pleeeeease sign this card? Then I mailed the letter, the card, and a self-addressed stamped envelope. I just sent it to the arena where the team played. A shocking number of athletes sent me signatures! As a teenager in the ‘90s, I got David Robinson. Hakeem Olajuwon. Deion Sanders. Back then, this Belichick card meant nothing to me — but of course, as he became a legend, the card became the best one in my collection. (And given his news yesterday, it felt worth sharing.)

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-10-27,"Here’s some weird public speaking advice —If you want to develop a killer keynote, the best tool you have comes RIGHT AFTER your talk.It’s in the feedback after a Q&A.Here's how I use this strategically:First, if an event allows it, make sure to do Q&As after your talk. People’s questions will prompt you to tell new stories or express new ideas.Then, this is critical: When the talk is over, STAY AND TALK TO PEOPLE.They’ll often come up and say, “I especially loved when you said...”Pay attention to the patterns. Are they commenting on stuff you said in your Q&A, instead of your keynote?If so, you may want take some of that Q&A material and put it IN THE KEYNOTE.This is how I regularly update and refresh my talks — by testing my main material against new ideas and fresh stories.As a result, I’m optimizing for the stuff people remember most — and making sure I’m very memorable too!👉 Want more ways to stand out and be memorable?

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-11-27,"The cereal aisle has gotten CRAZY — and it’s because of a very interesting business problem.Cereal sales started declining decades ago, as consumers shifted to yogurts and healthier foods.At first, cereal makers chased the trend with low-carb and low-sugar cereals. But nobody wanted Half-Frosted Flakes from Anthony the Responsible Tiger. 🐯 👎So the industry reversed course. It stopped competing for breakfast and went after snackers — adding more sugar with more crazy flavors.But it’s still not working.

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-01-27,"This line at Trader Joe’s is insane — and normal in Brooklyn! So why don’t they open more stores?As much as I hate standing in this line (and I do it regularly), I respect the TJs approach.I did some research and found…☎️ Trader Joe's SVP of real estate gets hundreds of calls and emails PER DAY from people asking for a new TJ’s somewhere in America.📈 It has a hyper-specific formula for slow growth, and prioritizes efficiency and supply chain. That’s how it keeps costs low — which is why customers keep coming back.🛍️ It won’t expand into online delivery, because a) that requires a costly new warehouse system, and b) it negates the “treasure hunt” effect TJ’s wants to create, where there’s always something new to find at the store.In short: “Growth” isn’t always growth — and “number of stores” doesn’t equal success.Many companies learn that the hard way — which is why fast-expanding companies collapse, but TJ’s has been in demand since 1967.Want *real* growth... for yourself?

When the arms come, they come in uniquely — one arm, many arms, all directions, unpredictably. Which is to say: As the saguaro gets older, it’s just getting started. And the thing that makes it celebrated — the thing people LOVE it for! — is well worth the wait. So, was I right?

Here's my gameplan for now:I'm carrying on like usual — still posting daily, and trying to be useful.My logic is: No matter what work you or I do...Our job IS NOT to reach the maximum number of people.Our job IS to be valuable to the people we can reach.I mean, when I'm hired for a speaking gig, I don't care less in smaller rooms.

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-10-27,"Someone expects the worst of you. But good news — this can be used to your advantage!Here’s how to be surprisingly likeable… Consider it: People have a stereotype of you, based on your work. If you’re the boss, they might think you’re self-important and intimidating. If you’re in sales, they might think you’re fake and pushy. If you’re a creative, they might think you’re impractical.If you know this — and especially if, deep down, maybe there’s some truth to it — then it’s helpful to think: “What’s the positive opposite of this?” If you’re in sales, what’s the positive opposite of being in sales mode? It’s to focus on human connection, not transaction. If you’re the boss, what’s the positive opposite of being intimidating? It’s to become more nurturing and mentoring. Once you know this, you can lead with it — to make the positive opposite the FIRST THING that people experience about you. When you do that, you undercut people’s negative expectations. You make them question their assumptions. Now YOU’RE in control.

It drove 9.7 million impressions (and counting) — and I put a CTA for my newsletter at the end.LinkedIn can be an amazing driver of newsletter subs, but you must be smart about it.THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE:🚨 Write a complete, non-promotional post!!! 🚨Don’t tease anything or make people click for more. A post must be self contained, containing satisfying advice and insight. That’s for three reasons:1. Full posts help readers see your style and value — and if they like it, they’ll want more.2. LinkedIn’s algorithm rewards advice and insight. Promotional posts won’t spread.3. Pitches don’t prompt conversation — and LinkedIn’s algorithm rewards smart, thoughtful comments.Will every post take off? No. But when you're consistent, you increase your chances of connecting.That’s why I always write complete posts, and then, at the very end, add a related CTA like this...Want more ways to connect and grow?

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-11-27,"I once applied for a job at BuzzFeed — and the hiring manager told me, ""We're reaching readers in the wrong way."" It's a lesson I've thought about ever since.Some background:Back when BuzzFeed had a large newsroom, I'd applied to work in what they called their ""Longform"" (ie, long stories) section. But the editor told me they were eliminating the section, and integrating long stories into other sections. Why? Because although *journalists* often thought about content in terms of ""longform,"" users did not. Nobody wakes up and says, ""I want to read a long story."" So BuzzFeed needed to re-organize — speaking in a way that USERS found relevant.You must do the same in our own work. Forget your language, or the way you understand your work.

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-02-27,"Here’s how I turn one keynote talk into infinite customized talks.It all starts with this: I built my talk modularly.For context: I speak to many different audiences, who have many different needs. Making a new talk for everyone is impossible — but I want to serve every client uniquely.A modular structure fixes that. The intro and outro are the same (and I improvise personalization for each audience). Then the meat of the talk is built on modules.Each module is about 7-12 minutes long. I start each with a big idea, then tell a compelling story to illustrate it, then offer a takeaway and exercise.Over time, I add, refine, and retire modules. I have five active ones now, and maybe 10 that I've retired.When I’m hired to speak, I do an intro call with the client to learn about the audience, their needs, and their interests. Based on that, as well as how much time I have on stage (30 minutes? 45? 60?), I assemble the talk.Maybe I’ll use the intro, plus modules 1, 2, 4, and 5, and then the outro — and no Q&A.Maybe I’ll use the intro, plus modules 2, 3, and 4, and then the outro — and 15 min of Q&A.Or whatever. A talk easily snaps into place.In my notes, I also give myself suggestions of how each module connects to a certain audience need. For example: If they’re going through X, then I can relate that to a point I make in Module 2.As a result, I have one talk that can be used and delivered in infinite ways — giving me more opportunities to work with clients, but with a lot less work.Want to be more strategic about YOUR work?

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-03-27,"Want to be a better storyteller? Get to know the “e structure” of stories — and you’ll hook your audience early! How does it work? Well… imagine drawing a lower-case “e”. First, you draw a line forward. Then you curve up and BEHIND where you started, and carry forward. That’s how to tell the story: Start in the middle, back up to the beginning, reach where you started, and get to the end. Magazine features usually follow this format. So do many TV shows and movies. People love stories, but they always want to know: “Where’s this going? Will I care?” That's why the e structure works — by answering your audience's questions at the start! You’re saying: “Here’s where this is going, and yes, you’ll love it.” Now they want to know more! 👉 Want to upgrade your work in small, smart ways?

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-02-27,"This formula is amazing — it shows EXACTLY how much you should pay someone to help you.I learned it from Dan Martell, who calls it the “buy back rate” — the amount of money you should pay to buy back your time.It goes like this:First, calculate how much you make in a year. Divide that by 2,000, which is the average amount of work hours in a year.Now you have your hourly value. Let’s say you make $50 / hr.Now divide that by 4 — because if you pay someone to free up your time, Dan says, you should get at least 4 times ROI on that spend. In this case, that’s $12.50.“If you're making $50 an hour, you wouldn't want to trade it for another $50 an hour,” Dan says. “You want to trade it for $12.50 an hour task so that you could then go do more of the $50-an-hour type activities.”That’s just the start — I had a fascinating conversation with him on my podcast Help Wanted, where we dig deep on when, how, and why to pay for help.

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-12-27,"This video of mine got 1.2 million Instagram views — all because of something I did first on LinkedIn. Before I tell you, here’s what you need to know: Social media isn’t just a way to reach people. It’s a place to test out ideas. Every time you post, you’re testing whether an idea resonates. When you find something that works, ask yourself: “How can I expand upon this?” Maybe a post can expand into a newsletter, article, book chapter, keynote segment... or just other forms of social media. That’s what happened with my latest video. First, I wrote a text-based post on LinkedIn — and when that did well, I filmed a video using my post as a script. I added a new bit at the end, inspired by some  comments on my LinkedIn post. Then, BOOM — 1.2 million views, and 200 new followers. Every idea has a life cycle. Your job is to find its next phase! Want more ways to work smarter?

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-01-27,"Seeing lot of dating app ads recently? Here’s why — their business model is going sour.The top dating apps’ revenue has been slowing for years, a Morgan Stanley report said. The market is oversaturated. Tinder lost paid users last year.Where’s everyone going? Young people are increasingly meeting through social media... and in person.Here’s why this matters for EVERYONE:Years ago, people said that apps changed dating forever. We’d never go back, they said!(Full disclosure: I met my wife on OK Cupid!)But in truth, things ALWAYS change. One generation’s new idea is the next generation’s old idea.This means there’s ALWAYS opportunity to drive change yourself — to have a bold new idea, to create a better way, to do what the big players can’t or won’t.Nothing stays forever.

Jason Feifer,Male,2024-04-13,"Brands often try and fail to follow TikTok trends — but this ad NAILS IT, and here’s why.I see lots of articles out there like: “5 New TikTok Trends That Brands Can Follow”. (That’s an actual headline, btw).But that thinking is disastrous. It leads to chasing trends for no reason — as if brands are screaming, “Look, fellow kids! I know what’s hip!”A smart brand passes on 99% of trends, and only follows the ones they can CONTRIBUTE to — as if they’re continuing a conversation.That’s what the Uruguayan food delivery service PedidosYa did here.It followed a common visual trick on TikTok, where people take an action sequence and cleverly cut it to continue the action themselves.Here, it feels seamless and cool. The racing clip grabs you, the edit is sharp and aligns perfectly with the brand, and the ad itself feels cool and casual.Don’t chase. Contribute! That’s the rule.In my newsletter, I point out the subtle differences between success and failure — it’s called One Thing Better!

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-09-27,"Want to build a huge audience like Lenny?Here’s what I learned by being on Lenny’s Podcast —1. PROCESS ENSURES VALUELenny Rachitsky's podcast, like his newsletter, is relentlessly useful. He wants to deliver fully actionable insights — which is why people trust him so much.That doesn’t happen without planning.To start, I sent him a detailed outline of the information I wanted to share on our episode.In turn, he sent me a detailed flow for our conversation.We didn’t exactly stick to it, but it gave us a guideline for the major points we wanted to hit.2. REPEAT THE LESSONSListen closely to Lenny’s podcast, and you’ll hear him do an interesting thing:Every 10 minutes or so, before he and his guest move on to another topic, he repeats the main points they just covered.He’s very intentionally reinforcing the main insights, so listeners always feel oriented and valued.3. GET EVERYTHING RIGHTAfter the recording, his team let me listen back to the show and catch any errors. Turns out, I’d said the name of a PR company wrong!So I re-recorded myself saying the name correctly, and they edited the correct audio in.That attention to detail is very rare — and helps boost his trustworthiness, both with the guest and his audience.Our episode is about how to get press for your business — you should listen! https://lnkd.in/gHxdhHSm",133,55,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0&keywords=jason%20feifer&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=64051513-d940-48c5-a04e-b1c09814bfc7&sid=8hf&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-12-27,"Should you lie in job interviews?This recruiter says yes — and I think she makes a good case.There are three times to lie, says job recruiter Bonnie Dilber.(This comes from a TikTok she made that’s been watched 3 million times: https://lnkd.in/egjTsHKV)The reasons to lie:1. WHY YOU’RE LEAVING YOUR OLD JOBIf you’re leaving because you hate it, keep that to yourself. No bad-mouthing old bosses or companies.2. WHY YOU WANT THE NEW JOBObviously the money and benefits are attractive. Keep that to yourself. Talk about the company’s mission and your purpose instead.3. YOUR LONG-TERM PLANSMaybe it doesn’t include the job you’re applying for. Maybe you plan to be there six months and then go somewhere else. Don’t say that!This strikes me as reasonable — and not even that deceptive. Every manager knows that old jobs are complex, new jobs are partly/a lot about the money, and long-term plans change.So focus on what CONNECTS you, not what potentially DISCONNECTS you.📈 DO EVEN BETTER: My newsletter, One Thing Better, gives you one way each week to boost your career — subscribe for free at jasonfeifer.com/newsletter",129,75,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAHb-nQB61Z8GW_DNtSf3SktPPQ2SuQ_rA0&keywords=jason%20feifer&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=64051513-d940-48c5-a04e-b1c09814bfc7&sid=8hf&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-11-27,"A salesperson has been texting and calling my friend for a YEAR — because of their crazy company mandate.They understand my friend isn’t buying. But their company has a quota of customers they must get on the phone, and somehow that means continuing to try the same old ones.So the salesperson keeps calling. My friend keeps ignoring. A vicious cycle.And yes, it’s real: We tracked the number back. An actual company. She sent me this screenshot yesterday.It’s perfect example of how policies must be built for REALITY, not for what someone WISHES will happen.Because sure, maybe there was some logic to this company’s mandate — but the outcomes are surely not desired. The sales team is frustrated and potential customers are annoyed.The lesson is simple: When you're making decisions that impact others, bring others into the conversation early.

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-10-27,"Press releases are a scam.Here’s the problem — some publicists charge clients to write a press release, and then distribute it on PR wires.The release then appears on lots of big websites. The publicist declares victory, and shows you the big websites' monthly traffic numbers.But NONE of that traffic goes to your press release. Those sites just auto-post everything, and nobody's looking.Yes, there are some legitimate uses for press releases — like making official statements or boosting SEO.But they are NOT usually a great tool to get coverage. Press releases come off as outdated and impersonal. I delete dozens from my inbox every day!The best press outreach is the opposite of a press release — it’s personal and personalized.

She doesn’t blame anyone. She’s fortunate for the career she’s had. She’s not looking for sympathy.Instead, she’s just being honest.“I have beat myself up over this for so many months,” she says. “I have said, ‘Well, you suck.

Because you’re more focused on YOUR OWN mistakes, not someone else’s. And if you’re not focused on someone else’s mistake, then you don’t remember it. Other people think the same way!

""Sherbert"" came on strong in the 1900s.Today, Merriam-Webster considers both to be correct: sherbet and sherbert.Which just goes to show — there isn't always one right answer to things.So, what else are you doing wrong/right?

Jason Feifer,Male,2023-12-27,"Have you fallen into a “spam trap”?I had no idea this existed — but it can kill your email list!Here’s what it is...A spam trap looks like any ol’ email address — like, let’s say, jasonf596019@gmail.com. But this address was created as a trap.It was placed on blogs and web forums, but NEVER used to subscribe to a newsletter.So what happens if a newsletter or marketer emails it? Now an ISP knows: That email writer uses bad tactics — like scraping the web or buying addresses in bulk — because there’s no other way this address could get on their list.Once the ISP knows that, the newsletter may be treated as spam — because when you fall for a spam trap, you BECOME spam.And that’s not the only way to fall for a spam trap. Sometimes someone just mis-types their email address (writing gmial instead of gmail) and it might get flagged as spam.This is why I partnered with ZeroBounce — a company that helps people make more money from email, by improving their email reach.
