George Rawlings,Male,2023-10-27,"Single? 🍐 6 months ago we started an experiment called pearº to try and remove the need for dating apps. Odd considering I founded one? 🤨We manufactured and produced millions of green rings for singles to wear around the world 🌎The ring signifies you're open to meeting new people in the real world. It worked more than we ever could have imagined and the success stories have been coming in at a phenomenal rate! 💕 🙌 We intentionally created Thursday's biggest competitor in the IRL space. 🛠️Some thought that we were cannibalising our own app. But, what we've actually done is make Thursday incredibly scaleable. 🥷Thursday will be in 115 cities on 4 continents by the end the year...How? Because pearº already is. 😜Link: www.pearring.coSometimes creating your own competition is the only way to get bigger. 💪🖤 + 🍐 = 📈P.s Why the pearº ring?

George Rawlings,Male,2023-04-27,"I'm NOT proud of this article. 🥴Why? Because we had to sell a chunk of the business to get it off the ground in 2020 when we weren't in a tech recession. Worth noting that raising was much easier back then. 💲If Thursday didn't need the cash then we wouldn't have taken the investment. 💰What I've learnt since this round of funding is that too many founders (myself included) need to stop glamourising fund raising. 😎Instead build something solid and focus on revenue early, like any normal business! Less than 1% of VC backed consumer tech companies get hyper growth anyway, where the only metric that matters is the number of users. 📈What my co-founder, Matthew, and I ARE proud of is having the pleasure of working with SeedLegals since the very beginning.
