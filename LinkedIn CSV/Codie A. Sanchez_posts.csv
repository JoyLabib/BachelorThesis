Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-03-27,"7 reframes you NEED as an employee if you want to become an owner:1. You’ll never be a good entrepreneur if you can’t solve problems at your job.2. Anyone can complain about what's wrong - leaders brainstorm how to make it right. When you highlight a problem, ALWAYS have potential solutions ready. Reduce others' work to a simple 'yes' or 'no' exercise.3. Crabs in a bucket pull each other down trying to escape. It's the same at your job... Instead of obsessing about others' success, ask what YOU can do to win. Then help others do the same.4. Re-frame demands to align with others' incentives. Don't just ask for a raise, say, ""If I can make the company 25% more, I'd like an X% cut of it.""5. Almost every business owner has a ledger somewhere with one thing... All the money people never paid them back (and probably never will). Find & solve evergreen problems like this.6. Highlight team wins, even if you drove them. Own failures, even if others caused them. Forgo short-term pleasure for an unassailable long-term reputation.7. Become too valuable to live without. Ask questions. Shadow pros across the company. Take on new responsibilities. Become the person your manager negotiates with vs the other way round.↓ ↓ ↓If this resonated with you, you'd probably get a lot out of my newsletter: https://lnkd.in/g3smakQm",3975,281,122,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-09-27,"I have a friend who is 40 and damn near a billionaire.I asked him what his one key to investing well is...Here's what he told me:We have a habit of late nights, good wine, and tough questions about the world around us. One night I was candid asking how he made his fortune. I was looking for things to replicate...The simplicity of his reply surprised me.“I train my brain to perform one task incredibly well. One task alone... to never conform.”Here's how he explained it:The Funnel to Nonconformity:+Become a funnel for ideas+Let ideas fight based on merit, not emotion+Find courage to act in nonconformity= Opportunities others never see, or are too scared to act upon #1 Don’t Believe In Anger:Anger is a trick of the mind pushing you into a fight or flight. Let me tell you what you can’t do well when you’re fighting or flighting... think. Remove your anger.#2 The Controversy & Conformity Conundrum:There is a spectrum where controversies and conformity sit on opposite ends. Most of the wins in life land on the edge of controversy. Choose your controversy wisely, but choose it.#3 Reading As A Diet:Be careful what you read, it becomes the way you think. Curate what you let into your brain as you do with your body.#4 Ideas Strongly Stated & Loosely Held:Having a strong opinion is the mark of intellect but having the ability to change it is the mark of true intelligence.#5 Share Your MVPs:Every time you produce a product or idea, more come back ten-fold. So don’t make it perfect, make it done. Then let the market decide.#6 Warren Buffet Doesn’t Optimize:Wake up at 5 am, meditate, work out, drink 72 ounces of chloride water and stand upside down. Or... do none of those things and instead focus on thinking clearly, intently, and strategically before you pull any triggers.#7 Boredom As a Superpower:The best ideas need breathing room. They’re a flower stretching for the sun. Clutter them with meetings, and watch them die.#8 Numbers > Narrative:Anytime something is common practice, check if it’s common sense. Return to the very first principle there is: 1+1 = 2. Numbers are often terrible liars.#9 Can You Explain it to Grandma?Can you take the complex and make it simple? If not, you don’t know enough. Strong beliefs paired with little knowledge is a dangerous spot to operate.#10 Every New Learning Is A Little Death:Your skin regenerates itself every 72 days. Your ideas need an equal level of regeneration. Challenge old ideas and let them be reborn into something better.Finally, I'll leave you with this:“A contrarian isn’t one who always objects — that’s a conformist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently, from the ground up, and resists pressure to conform.” - NavalIf you liked this, you should also join my newsletter.Sign up here free → https://lnkd.in/eGmtANrR",3227,306,219,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-08-27,"Amazon is facing an $8B/year problem.  • ~75% of employees leave the company • Only 1/3 of new hires stay for >90 days • 100% employee turnover in warehouses (double the industry average)  But it gets even worse.  Let me explain:   So, how big of a problem is losing $8B/yr? For context, Amazon’s net income: • In 2021, was $33.36B • In 2022, was -$2.72B  But there’s a conundrum bigger than money:  Amazon could RUN OUT of people to hire in its US warehouses by 2024.  At one point, employee turnover was seen as an advantage to Amazon. Bezos saw his warehouse workforce as necessary - but replaceable.  He can't afford to think that way anymore.  What’s causing such low satisfaction?  Sure, there are surface-level factors: • High-pressure environments • Tough working conditions • Poor work-life balance  But lots of hard jobs have happy employees.  There's a bigger underlying problem...  The industrial mindset.  Amazon would rather have employees: • Robotically produce output • Have no say in operations • Receive no benefits • Follow instructions • Get no promotions  Employees have NO skin in the game.  There's a systemic failure bigger than Amazon...  We’ve become a nation of renters, owned by an elite group of owners.  We’ve handed our lives to those who tell us we must be protected – not protectors.  “You will own nothing and be happy about it.”   Centralization at the crux of the issue. Our banks, corporations, stock market, governments...  Everything is centralized.  Centralization breeds bureaucracies. Bureaucracies care little for you.  You become a cog in an endless machine.  Humans were meant to be tribal groups where our activities meant something. Now we: • Work where we can't feel our impact • Buy from companies we know no one at • Hardly know our neighbors  You make poor decisions when you’re not responsible for the outcome.  Amazon’s problem should open our eyes.  Decentralize. Build small. Buy small.  I want you to feel your value as a human – as a builder of a cogless machine.  ↓ ↓ ↓  This concept drives everything I do. I hope it resonates with you, too.

It’s totally normal. And honestly, at the end of the day, your 30s are AWESOME.

You wanna know how?  I do the hard things. Then I do them again.  A muscle grows by breaking. A seed by cracking open. A child by growing pains. Humans need hard...  So how do I build this growing empire and life I love?  I said yes to hard things like:  • A man I knew could break my heart and hold me accountable. • Buying businesses and taking on debt that I had to follow through on. • Early mornings and late nights. • Spending $50k on a venue when I hadn’t sold one ticket yet for our first conference. • Quitting jobs that were easy to bet on the value of the hard. • Building a team who all rely on me to pay them. • Being relentless about working out food and my body. • Never saying no to more info and smarter humans. • Failing publicly with my own name in a world of peanut gallery trolls.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-11-27,"Waking up at 5:45am solves 99.9% of daily issues.  12 other unreasonably simple habits to change your life:  1. Grab your to-do list. Do the thing you want to do least, first.  2. Stop all 60 min meetings, make them 45 minutes. Tighter meetings, more time.  3. No social media, email, or text when you wake up. Write something, read something, or create something before you get sucked in.  4. Do the $1,000/hr Test. Group work in 3 buckets based on return: $10, $100, $1,000. Offload one low ROI task per day.  5. Change one meeting a week to a walking call. Watch how excited the other meeting member becomes.  6. Add a How vs Won't check-in. When you say, ""that WON'T work."" Instead ask, ""How could that work?""  7. Be the dumbest one in your friend group, then move on when you’re not. As they say, if you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.  8. Take a picture of your net worth. What gets measured gets managed. Check finances daily.  9. Always the stairs, never the elevator. Pick the hard option. See how much stronger you are than you think.  10. Never write to-dos in stone. You're 10x more productive if you reprioritize daily.  11. Meditate. 10 minutes a day. For a twofer - do it in the sauna. Sometimes hacking culture gets it right.  12. Get intimidated. Everything you want is on the other side of fear. Do something every day that scares you a little bit.  Life is the small things repeated daily.  Change one daily habit, and beautiful things start to happen...

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-08-27,"I found a business making >$3.5M/year selling wooden sunglasses.  They’ve got only one employee:  The founder’s mom.  Here’s the breakdown:  Meet Cory Stout. He’s a born hustler:  1) Made $1,000s scalping football tickets 2) Pocketed ~$15k selling watches from China 3) Started Woodies Sunglasses at 28 w/ the profits  Cory’s best friend, Mike, studied in China.  One time, while visiting Mike, he realized: products hit markets in Guangzhou before they hit the rest of the world.  He saw that wooden sunglasses hadn’t taken off in the US yet, and got to work.  To kick things off, Cory had: • A team in China handling production • A contact at Groupon who helped launch • A $180k investment between Cory & 2 others  Here’s what he did to scale his biz:  1. Factories in China  Cory’s pro tip for choosing the right factory?  Use their bathroom.  If the bathroom resembles a warzone, stay away.  Factories have millions of dollars in machinery – if they don’t invest in their workers, they’re likely corner-cutters.  2. Kendall Jenner  Yes, Kendall Jenner.  Cory tracked down Jenner’s manager to ask her rate for a photoshoot campaign.  It was a pure shot in the dark.  The result?  He somehow negotiated her down from $150k to just $25k + incentives – a SIXTH of the original price.  3. Amazon  As Woodies started selling on Amazon, Cody became a marketing maestro.  Now, Amazon makes up close to 95% of sales.  Cory's advice: “If you master Amazon, you’re set for life.”  He dropped a mega Reddit post with 30+ tips to rank higher on Amazon. Here are 3 of his “essential” tips: • Don't violate Amazon TOS, no matter what • Don’t stockout (and if you DO, definitely DON'T raise your price right before) • Do everything to avoid 1-star reviews  4. Mom’s the Word  My favorite thing about this business:  Cory hired his mom, Pamela, to manage customer service. And she excelled – her skills drove tons of 5-star reviews to his pages.  As of 2022, Cory has made her CEO.  She still answers every customer email.  5. Simplicity  Cory comes from the 4-Hour Workweek school of thought.  Naturally, he hates complexity and outsources wherever possible. He doesn’t sell on eBay, Etsy, or retail stores. In fact, he doesn’t sell anywhere outside the US as it’s too complicated.  Lastly, Cory’s number 1 piece of advice to budding entrepreneurs?  “Just make sure you love what you’re working on. Life’s too short.”",2085,247,43,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-11-27,"Story from my dad today.  If you’re a business owner, it may hit you as deeply as it hit me...  He said, you know you’ve met another builder or doer when they’ve felt that flinch at the second Friday of the month.  My father has never bounced a check.  But he remembers this…  It was payday, his business was owed money, and they couldn’t bridge the gap between the two in time.  He could just picture the guys’ faces.  Those last two workers, who had done more than anyone else, stayed later than anyone else…  And they were about to be punished for that by not getting paid.  So he called up his banker, told him he needed a line of credit, and pulled out $100,000 give or take to make sure that every single one of their checks cleared.  At the time, my dad had a business partner who was a different type of guy.  He was the sort to make excuses, pay himself first, and not particularly care if everyone else’s checks cleared as long as he got his.  That partner has since had many businesses fail - and many more employees go without a paycheck.  And my dad has never in all these years had a business fail, or lost anyone a dime.  He often attributes his business success to the fact that he would never let his hardest working guys go hungry...  People will always be your biggest struggle and your greatest gift in business. Treat ‘em right.↓ ↓ ↓You’ll always recognize another builder.But if you see yourself in this story a little TOO much, it might be time for cashflow tracking.This one spreadsheet has saved my a** countless times to meet payroll comfortably every month.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-03-27,"We’ve completely forgotten why we're entrepreneurs.  When did we become a group of vitamin-D-deprived, Allbird-wearing, alternative-milk-drinking, extreme PowerPointers?  Many of us got soft.  We don’t climb mountains, we only take risks with other people’s money, we sit behind keyboards bragging about how ChatGPT did all the work.  What a terrible thing to strive for.  How can you make the most money by employing the fewest people and doing the least amount of work? How can you get mailbox money? Or a fast exit so you can tweet about it?  The secret:  Entrepreneurs don’t exist just for a bunch of zero’s and some big exit, but because we are crazy people willing things into very existence.  We are supposed to be the next generation of explorers, risk-takers, adrenaline junkies. Addicts to the masochistic mission of achievement and ownership.  The feeling of being so damn unemployable your only option is owner. The inability to sleep because of visions so big they pull you from bed in the dead of the night. Dreams so futuristic people laugh when you tell them.  Those are the entrepreneurs I admire.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-04-13,"You won't be ""most people.""  How to avoid 7 common regrets:  1. Don't give first-row opinions to those who paid for nosebleed seats.  You'll never look back and wish you made more nameless humans on the internet like you. Choose your f*cks carefully.  2. Don't daydream.  This is why I do what I do. I want you to make that first $100k, buy that business, quit that job.  3. Don’t leave empty “what if”s hanging on your last breath.  Regrets of inaction sting worst. Do the thing you always think about. Do what changes you as a human. Do sh*t that makes people feel something, one way or the other.  4. Don't sacrifice your body for anything.  I’ve abandoned my health for work. For money. For comfort. It's never been worth it.  5. Don't end up a loser who can't take a joke.  We take ourselves too seriously. New measure of successs: “He who has the deepest laugh lines.”  6. Don't think for a second that other people's goals for your life matter.  Negotiate your fulfillment with the world. Your terms, their price.  7. Don't wish you were happier.  Short-term happiness? Who cares. Do hard things instead. But question anything that gets in the way of your long-term joy.

Here's how:People will work on their “business plan” for 18 months before doing any actual work.Part of it is procrastination. Part is an unwillingness to be uncomfortable.But part is lack of knowledge.They think the first step is too confusing.And they’re not wrong. No one teaches us about the steps to form a business...Did your school teach you how to do a business formation? Do social media posts go viral that explain how to get an EIN or stay tax compliant?Honestly though… it’s simpler than you might think. Just 3 steps:1. You pick a business structure.An LLC is a great go-to for a small businesses. It’s a simple structure with less paperwork and restrictions.But if you’ll be fundraising from investors, a C-corp might be a better idea. It can issue stock/ownership to shareholders.But it adds a ton of complexity that most small businesses won’t need. You probably just need an LLC.2. You pick a name & register it.Generally, you file this with the Secretary of State.You'll need a registered agent. This can be:- you- your attorney- your accountant- a registered agent serviceIt just has to be a physical address that can accept legal docs on behalf of your biz.You pay a fee, then you get a certificate saying your business is real. You use that certificate for:- getting an EIN- applying for any licenses you need- opening business bank accountsThen the hard (and fun) part starts....3. You start selling and making $$$↓ ↓ ↓The basics are simple, but of course with bureaucracy comes a lot of nuances you can mess up.Plus, the process gets way more complex if you’re starting a US biz from elsewhere in the world.Which is why I invested in this company...They’re called doola & they simplify all this.They also offer:- CPA consultation- tax compliance & filings- a dedicated account manager- support if you're based outside the USIf you think you could use doola, they hooked me up with something for you...$50 off if you use the code ""Contrarian50""Perks of knowing the investor, right? ;)Check them out here → https://lnkd.in/eynsnf9U",1763,212,83,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-10-27,"There's a ""Stripe for truckers"" worth $800M.  And you've never heard of it...  Here's how they pivoted from ""Uber for Buses"" to build a 9-figure giant:  Trucking is essential to the United States: • $790B industry • Transports 72.2% of US's gross tonnage • Trucks consume ~45B gallons of gas  BUT the industry is also dying: • Shortage of drivers • Intense work schedules  The team to build a solution?  • Vignan Velivela (ex-engineer at self-driving car company Cruise) • Tushar Misra (ex-Uber India) • Harshita Arora (dropped out of school at 14 to build companies)  But they didn't start with trucking. First, they tried to build Uber for Buses.   Covid quickly killed that idea.  But VCs loved the talent of the founding team and continued to support them as they figured out another solution.  They soon realized that trucking was a massive industry that had payment solutions that were stuck in the 1980s.   To understand this new demographic, they traveled to trucking hubs across Cali.  They canvassed ~200+ truck drivers about the worst problems they faced.  They found 2 consistent answers: 1. Fuel Card Reliability 2. Payroll  So, AtoB was born.   The co-founders found that existing fuel cards were built completely outside Visa and Mastercard, leading to: • Poor acceptance • Slow network time • Requiring folks to carry backup cards   To solve this, they built their own fuel card: • Based on Visa • No hidden or annual fees • Cash back partnerships with major brands • Save 43¢ per gallon (controls/optimal gas station selection etc.)   Payroll is another key issue for truck drivers: • Paper checks don't arrive for several days • No digital solution which hurts truckers if they are away from home • Drivers getting payday loans to stay afloat  The co-founders knew they had to solve this.  So, they built their own payroll software: • 24/7 instant & unlimited transfers • Automated 1099 taxes • Easily simplify reimbursements / deductions and an easy UX for drivers to understand.   Their traction took off: • 25k trucking companies adopted their solution • ~$20M rev in 2022, up from $2M in 2021 • Already at roughly 5% market share in 3yrs  Turns out, listening to your customers matters? Who'da thought.   I'm a huge fan of this company: • Building for an industry that's the backbone of the US • Not concerned about automating the entire industry, instead speaks to the customers and understands their needs • Ambitious roadmap for the future (EV charging etc.)I didn't invest in this company, but it's definitely the type our VC fund is interested in:Tech infrastructure for the boring businesses that build America...If you're curious what we ARE investing in, check it out here → https://lnkd.in/ezCJ5TGn",1691,192,36,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-07-27,"I found a company that’s disrupting a $780B/year industry...  • The market: Auto repair • The target: Locally-owned shops • The product: All-in-one AI marketing  Here’s the breakdown:  The US has over 280,000 auto repair shops.  • 50%+ are independently owned. (Compare this to grocery stores, where 11% are locally-owned) • Top 4 biggest auto repair brands make up 10% of all shops. (Compare to ecommerce, where top 4 companies make up 72% market cap)  The industry is currently worth $780B per year, expected to grow to $1.6T by 2031.  Why is it growing so fast?  Kind of a crazy chain of events…  New and used car prices are skyrocketing. ↓ So Gen Z can’t afford to buy cars. ↓ So they’re spending 40% more on repairing their current cars. ↓ Which means cars are being kept longer than ever before. ↓ Resulting in more repairs needed.  Who knew Gen Z would lead the charge for auto repair industry growth?  But those aren’t the only waves Gen Z is making in this space…  • 72% of Gen Z & millennials read online reviews before making a buying decision. • 55% say it’s a primary factor in choosing a business to buy from. • 61% prefer online scheduling or web chat over a phone call. • And 70% of all consumers EXPECT to schedule an appt online.  So? Why is that a problem?  Well, the average age of a repair shop owner is 57 years old.  Mom & Pop owners near retirement age aren’t known for their tech savviness...  I’ve been to mechanics that write your receipt on a notepad they bought in 1982.  On top of everything, 50% of current auto shop owners plan to retire in the next 6 years.  When younger owners take over, how can they adapt to customer expectations?  Worst case, they don’t.  Best case? They manage and pay for 5+ different software vendors for: • CRM • Reviews • Marketing • Scheduling • SMS service reminders  This is where Shopgenie comes in.  Local auto shop owners can do online bookings, customer management, and all-in-one AI marketing.  Plus, Shopgenie integrates with all other major existing software in the space.  Simple. And so very needed.  My personal favorite part? They're offering their online scheduling feature 100% free.  I invested early in this company, and they fully launched pretty recently.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-08-27,"Think you need to start a tech company to become a billionaire? Think again.  I found a couple worth $10B from selling juice, fruit, and nuts. Here’s how they did it:  Stewart & Lynda Resnick achieved early.  At 24, Lynda ran her own ad agency. Meanwhile, Stewart founded a janitorial services business while in law school.  He’d made his first million & sold the company by 36.  But that was just the beginning..  After marrying in 1973, they bought 2 businesses together. (Couple goals?)  In the first biz, Teleflora, Lynda pioneered the ""flowers and a gift"" concept. Today, this company alone employs 3,000 people across 20 countries.  This was, no doubt, a savvy pair.  They started buying land in California in 1978 as an inflation hedge. By 1988, they owned: • 2,500 acres of orange trees • Pistachio, almond, and citrus groves • 100 acres of pomegranate orchards  This is where things get crazy.  Despite intending the land as a passive investment, they started selling their produce to stores & markets.  By 1996, they were doing almond & pistachio sales of $1.5B.  The best part?  We’re still on this couple’s side quests.  Now onto the brands you’ve heard of:  The Resnicks’ family doctor mentioned the presence of pomegranates in folk medicine.  So they ordered some studies, and found that pomegranates had more antioxidants than red wine. But, you'd have to eat 2.5 pomegranates to get this many antioxidants.  They decided to make a juice instead.  Lynda wrote P-Heart-M on a piece of paper, as a sign of the heart-healthy benefits.  And POM Wonderful was born.  Relentless focus on quality has taken them to ~$200M in sales today.  And there’s a reason they’re so quality-driven: Lynda’s taste palette. Blindfolded, she can identify vineyard, vintage, & shipper from just 1 sip of wine.  This was a factor in the couple’s next acquisition: after blind-taste-testing some bottled waters, one in particular stood out to Lynda.  They ended up buying this company… Fiji Water.  My favorite part of this story?  How a marriage formed the PERFECT business partnership. The pair’s strengths make up for each other’s weaknesses: • Lynda’s a marketing, branding & ad genius • Stewart excels at finance, ops & ensuring the businesses run profitably   And, of course... I love how they bought small, boring biz's & transformed them into behemoths.  Their early acquisitions followed 1 rule:  They must be a service business with regular subscribers – something Stewart knew to look out for. Smart guy.  I’ll leave you with a nice quote from Lynda:  “Being a great marketer is synonymous with being a great friend. In other words, you just have to listen.”↓ ↓ ↓You don't have to be a millionaire business owner by 24 to start your own acquisitions journey.I wrote a guide on 7 ways you can buy a business for little to $0 down.Get it here, free → https://lnkd.in/eSe_WJsD",1638,215,50,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-04-23,"This guy traded a $200k/yr job...  ...to buy a $1.6M campground. The story:  Mark Lemoine was working for Michigan’s government. He was burnt out and couldn’t envision himself there another 20 years.  Then his mentor asking him something that changed the course of his life: • If you could do anything, what would it be? • When you're 80, what will you regret not trying?  Mark had the same answer to both Qs:  Owning a campground.  (Pro-tip: If your answer to both of those questions is the same? Take it as a sign.)  So, Mark: • Got his wife on board • Quit his 9-5 • Gave himself 6 months to make it work • Started looking at campsites to buy • Took a franchising class to figure out how to finance it  The site that caught his eye cost $1.6M.  Mark & his wife financed it with: • Bank loan ($1.2M) • 401k ($200k) • Their house: ($180k) • Roth IRA/savings ($20k)  Note: They'd been saving for years. 5 years away from being debt-free.  Still, they went all-in.  Many would have backed out after understanding how much repair & maintenance a campground needs.  Luckily, that was perfect for the Lemoines.  They say they spent ~$1.5M on updates - including their entire earnings for Year 1.  They added: • 20 new cabins • A cafe • A shop  And their reported progress in mid-2023: • Operating costs: $600-700k/year • Current valuation: $6M  The campsite hasn’t made them wealthy - at least not yet. The household earns ~$50k less than when Mark had his old job.  But they’re definitely happier out of the rat race, doing something they love.  Would I have gone all-in on such a pricey biz, giving up my retirement savings?  Maybe not...

Bureaucracy is business poison.  2. Decrease the time between having an idea and getting it done. Everything changes.  3. Never sacrifice reputation in the name of business. You can always start another company. You can never create a new reputation.  4. Long-term games and long-term people compound. Resist shiny objects.  5. Hire smart people, pay them well, set them up for success... Then leave them the hell alone.  6. “There’s nothing worse than being sick, fat, tired and trying to run your business.” - Dana White  7. The highest ROI investment founders & owners can make is in themselves. Health shapes mindset. Mindset shapes action.  8. You're better off learning negotiation than financial modeling. Business is less spreadsheets than words.  9. The best business of all time has only you, a computer, and the send button.  10. Every additional employee increases complexity. Hiring is a last resort.  11. The best advice comes from those just a couple steps ahead of you. These people still vividly remember the problems you're facing today.  12. Sell painkillers, not vitamins. There's more money in needs than wants.  13. No discounts. Compete on value, not price. Any biz with $$$ can enter your market and bleed you out. Differentiate beyond commodity.  14. A happy customer is the most powerful marketing. Prioritize reviews. Humans are social animals.  15. If no one thinks you’re crazy, you’re too late.

Here's the story:  Moiz Ali got the idea for Native after reading the back of an Axe can.  He had no clue what the ingredients were.  At the time, he knew ""natural"" products were on the rise (natural deodorant was the number 1 product on Etsy in 2015).  And so...  He decided to start a natural deodorant company.  Bear in mind - at this point, Moiz knows NOTHING about deodorant.  His reaction is one of the reasons I love this story – it shows how important mindset is in business:  “I know nothing, and in six months, I’m going to become one of the world’s leading experts on deodorant. I’m just going to spend my time learning, and I’m going to figure it out.”  So - how did Moiz make the first bar of Native?  He went on Etsy, found the best makers of natural deodorant & asked to white label their product.  And as is often the case, it took dozens of no's before one person agreed.  At this point, Moiz launched on Product Hunt. With no deodorant in hand, he sold his first 60 units.  That's when he ACTUALLY put in the first order.  This is a theme in business success stories: lowering risk by testing the market before committing. Worst possible case? He's in the hole a couple hundred $.  Another thing Moiz did right?  Hyper-focus on customers.  Despite early traction, he quickly realized the first product wasn't great.  So he spent the first year fine-tuning the product – by sending out free samples & iterating on feedback.  The results?  Native went from a 4-star rating & 25% repeat order rate to a 4.7 rating & 50% repeat order rate.  Moiz scaled the biz from $50k revenue in Jan 2016 to $1M in Nov of the same year.  Other ways they grew so fast:  • Launching subscription plans • Customer video testimonials as ads • Upgrading customer experience (sending fun emails & cards with purchases)  In 2017, Native had hit between $25-35M in revenue – with ONLY 8 fulltime employees.  They were acquired by P&G for $100M.  This was the first purchase P&G had made in 10 years.  Moiz says there were 4 main reasons he went with P&G: • Value alignment during negotiation (no over-the-top diligence requests & respecting Moiz's vision) • The dedication P&G showed in their work • Alignment on brand & creative • Resources for future growth  I'm inspired by this story: • Moiz knowing nothing but picking a simple biz model • His obsession with customers • How insanely fast they grew • The care behind the exit  It makes you think...

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-10-27,"Costco’s 2022 revenue was $227 BILLION.Their business model is genius – but what if you could apply it elsewhere?Well, a company raised $100M by applying Costco’s biz model to makeup.Meet Beauty Pie:First off, why is Costco so successful?It's not as simple as ""wholesale.""It's even simpler: cheap prices.Retail markups average around 30-60%. But Costco caps markups on national brands at 14% & their house brand, Kirkland, at 15%.How can it justify such low prices? That's where membership fees come in.In 2022, their membership fee revenue alone was $4.22B.It's genius: customers shop at Costco to justify the membership cost – which ensures repeat visits.While they make a lower profit per item, high sales volumes offset low margins. Notably, Costco retains ~90% of their customers each year.Companies have tried to replicate the low-markup membership model before...But few have done as well as Beauty Pie.They've taken Costco's business model and applied it to cosmetics.Here's how it works: Markups in beauty are especially crazy – sometimes up to 10x cost because of customer perceptions of luxury:• Huge marketing & advertising costs (think endorsements)• Expensive, fancy packaging• High-end retail storesBeauty Pie have done the exact opposite... For $59 a year, you can choose from ~400 high-end makeup, skincare, and hair products at ""factory prices.""And they can sell at these prices by:• Having plain & uniform packaging• No brick-and-mortar stores• Low marketing spend And it's working:• 40% growth in membership last year• Estimated $50-100M revenue last year• Raised $170M to date (including $100M Series B in 2021) I'm a fan of this company for 2 reasons.1) They're reinventing perceptions of an industry.People see cosmetics as luxury goods - they need to be wooed by glitzy advertising & endorsements.But Beauty Pie is the cosmetic industry's answer to product-led growth. 2) Other companies have tried to emulate the ""Costco model"" – but not all of them worked (ever heard of Brandless?).I love that Beauty Pie found a viable new industry for the low-markup model, but it got me thinking:Where else might this business model work well? It's got to be an industry with:• High markups that can be eliminated (eg retail stores, advertising spend, etc)• A product consumers buy multiple times a year (or a multi-product offering so a membership makes sense)• Low brand loyalty (ie, best value wins)So ...Any brilliant Costco-style biz ideas?

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-11-27,"Ever heard of Chubbies Shorts?• ~$118M revenue• Sold to Solo Brands in 2021The fun part?They’ve grown mostly through memes...Here's their story:Four pals – Kyle, Rainer, Preston, Tom.They loved the retro short shorts of the '80s and '90s but found modern-day men’s shorts too long and drab. They envisioned bringing back the golden era of short shorts & wanted to build a biz that embodied weekends and chilling out.So, they got to brainstorming.Their strength? A LACK of structure and formality.I've never seen such a successful company with so much... chill.They had an awesome time and just winged it - which led to some super quirky & unconventional designs.With their small first batch of shorts, they hit a Fourth of July party at Lake Tahoe. They were greeted with immediate love & sold out of all the product they brought.So, they headed back to the Bay Area, made a few hundred pairs, and launched the Chubbies website in September 2011.How do you create buzz for such an unconventional brand?They started by emailing college fraternity presidents. Another huge hit - they sold out in a matter of days.Word-of-mouth growth was crazy. Their grassroots community, dubbed the ""Chubster Nation,"" started to grow organically.But, they're famous for one main thing:Instagram memes.While most premium clothing brands have aesthetic feeds with models... Chubbies’ essentially looks like a meme page.It's led to a following of nearly 600k on IG.Organic content, word-of-mouth growth, and strong community took sales from:• $2.4 million in 2012• to $44.1 million in 2020And they've done it all with only a $4M venture funding round.The crescendo?In September 2021, Solo Stove acquired Chubbies for $129million.It formed the core of a new outdoor brand portfolio called Solo Brands, which allowed serious economies of scale. It's propelled Chubbies into a new growth phase.I love Chubbies' story for a few reasons:1. They've remained loyal to their niche.Despite it seeming small, it's a testament to how passionate customers can fuel new markets.2. The team's personality has formed the majority of Chubbies' brand equity.Their fun-loving attitude, from their designs to their marketing, is what sets them apart.Passionate founders can take their biz far... even if they'd rather be at the lake than the office.Thanks for the read.

It’s 2018, and Ann McFerran is a UCLA grad turned starving artist painting in a back house. Sometimes selling work for thousands of dollars, sometimes not at all.Tired of feast and famine cycles, she decided to do something else with paint.Enter: makeup.She launched her own 100% handmade magnetic lashes.After months of binge-watching product development/supply chain management videos on YouTube, Ann claimed the GLAMNETIC handle on IG. She made her first order: 100 units of 5 different styles at $4 a pop.Two months after launch, she’d sold $1M of inventory. One year later, she hit $50M ARR.Impressive for any industry – but especially e-comm where 90% of stores fail within 120 days.Here's how she did it:1. Curiosity + chips create moatsAnn moved from abject poverty in Thailand to the US.When you’re the Asian kid in an all-white school, you get awkward stares. You feel the need to blend in... so Ann did with makeup. She learned crazy styles and become obsessed.The chip on her shoulder + curiosity helped her create styles no one else in the industry had.Next time you’re tempted to run from life’s struggles?Remember: your struggles are your competitive advantage. Your uniqueness.2. Do the Unscalable Thing FirstDays after final product testing, Ann messaged all THIRTY THOUSAND of her Instagram followers to score some sales.No bots. No VAs… All Ann.If you don’t have money? Use time. Then add automation.3. Mind > Money40% of people don’t start a business because of lack of money.Ann used all her $5k of savings for inventory - nothing left for product photos/marketing.Instead of panicking, she became the model, photographer, and DIY packager.Glamnetic is still 100% bootstrapped.4. Success Favors SpeedAnn releases a new collection based on social media trends, every single month. That’s 12 a year. Most brands release 5-6.Her constant refresh keeps people engaged.Bonus 5: She gets ridiculous collabs.She's has a Harry Potter set, a Hello Kitty set, and has partnered with a slew of influencers. She sold out of Harry Potter nails in 1 week.But maybe my favorite thing about Ann McFerran? She's an unapologetically feminine and a sexy woman.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-04-20,"Ever heard of Jesse Itzler?  His business story is kind of crazy. Here it is – and some lessons to take away:  Jesse: • Co-founded ZICO Coconut Water • Wrote NYT bestseller Living with a Seal   • Had a Billboard 100 song in 1992  He started as a rapper in the early 90s, with the hit “Shake It (Like a White Girl).""  But he realized business, not music, was his calling. He co-founded a record label and sold it for millions 2 years later.  Then came his biggest success yet:  Marquis Jet.  Despite knowing next to nothing about aviation, Jesse helped the private jet giant reach billions in revenue, eventually selling to Berkshire Hathaway in 2010.  Here are the key lessons from his journey:  1. Small swings lead to big wins  One of Jesse's first biz ideas was collaborating with the NY Knicks on an arena anthem song.   He didn’t make much – but the experience taught him about negotiation and marketing to sports fans.  2. Who is higher leverage than how  Jesse wasn’t afraid to ask for help from his network. Which paid off.  Case in point: he got the president of NetJets to give Marquis a shot.  He'd apparently done the guy a favor years before by getting his daughter Christina Aguilera tickets.  3. The best learning comes by doing  Marquis Jet took off despite Jesse having zero aviation experience to start.   He spent weeks taking meetings and soaking up industry knowledge from NetJets in preparation for the launch.  Start first, then learn.  4. Expand your comfort zone  Bored in his late 30s, Jesse had the idea to ask David Goggins to live with him.  He wrote about the intense month in his book “Living with a Seal.”  Wild experience where he learned to approach life with an “all-in” mindset.  5. You'll fail, so fail fast  Jesse's first music release kinda failed.  His debut album peaked at #74 on the charts, and only because of the 1 hit.  Rather than dwelling, he immediately shifted to writing pop songs for other artists. When in doubt, pivot.  6. Partners can make or break a biz  Lucky for Jesse, his partners were great.  A huge part of his success was in co-founding the sports licensing label & Marquis Jets.  Find complementary partners.  7. Know what to market, then be relentless  Jesse marketed himself just as aggressively as his products. He:  • Got his music on movie soundtracks • Pursued high-profile appearances • Self-promoted his book globally  Find what makes you unique and hammer away at exposing it.  It's always interesting to me when people can pivot from celebrity into business.  In Jesse's case..  While his 15mins of fame helped, I'd argue most of his success came down to self-education and grit.  Hope this gives you a bit of inspiration today.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-07-27,"The best time management advice I’ve ever followed: Be easy to find, hard to reach...  Each day the average person gets: • 41 texts • 100 emails • 5 calls  If responding to each takes an average of 3 minutes... That's 7 hours a day.  The harsh truth: There's not time to respond.  It's overwhelming, unless you own it.  3 steps to become Easy to Find, Hard to Reach:  1) If you get asked a question more than 3 times & it has more than 3 steps...  • write a blog post on it • a twitter thread • create a product • hell, make a book  My best work is not me answering emails & setting meetings. It’s the courses I spend months creating & update constantly.  2) When someone wants your time, tell them, ""Oh ya, here's something I wrote on that! Check it out and lmk what q's you have after that?""  Only 1 in 10 people will follow up.  They want you to do the work for them.  3) When people DO follow up, use those moments to create deeper, bigger content on the subject.

Someone asked me recently, “Why do you think so many people never reach financial freedom?”  And I believe it’s because humans defer to the paths they have seen before them.  So often, we tend to follow in our parents’ footsteps.   But the internet has changed that. You can follow in the footsteps of others who you’ve never even met before.

Here’s how it  all happened:Stevin John, once a behind-the-scenes video whiz, saw his nephew engaged by subpar YouTube content.He thought he could do better. Much better.Enter Blippi, a brightly colored character going against the grain...Blippi's debut: A humble farm tractor video.The production? Mediocre.  The outcome? A viral sensation capturing children's imaginations worldwide.Before Blippi, Stevin had produced 150+ commercials and worked with stars – Betty White, Hugh Hefner, Dick Van Dyke.He was always off-screen, behind the camera.But it was these skills from the sidelines that set the stage for Blippi's spotlight.He leveraged his production experience to build a magnetic brand. From the suspenders to the spelling of the name, everything had one aim: To appeal to kids. Millions of them.  Stevin had the marketing chops to make Blippi a household name.And he wasn't just another YouTuber; he was a calculated creation:• 800 names whittled down to one• SEO strategies to skyrocket visibility• Content crafted for clicks & youth engagementThis was algorithmic artistry. Blippi's charm is in the details.The colors, the cap, the catchy name - all meticulously mapped out.His catchy sign-off, ""B-L-I-P-P-I,"" wasn't just cute – it was crafted to make it easier for toddlers to pronounce.His genius: seeing the audience through their eyes.Blippi became not just a YouTube giant but a leading brand through:• Merchandising agreements• Endorsement & sponsorship deals• Commercial partnerships w/ Netflix, Hulu, & AmazonAn empire even BEFORE the acquisition..Then, in 2020, Blippi was acquired by Moonbug Entertainment for $120 million.Stevin had been investing in real estate to offset taxes on the windfall. And during the sale, he moved to Vegas to save tons in state income tax. Play after play - always 2 steps ahead.So, for all the entrepreneurs out there:1. Solve a problem.2. Make the solution so catchy that you master your market.And maybe, just maybe, you'll be the next unsung hero transforming a simple idea into an empire.↓ ↓ ↓If you found this story interesting, feel free to repost & and follow Codie A.

I’m a reformed journalist, turned reformed Wall Streeter to now I run a few small businesses, invest in a bunch more, and teach people how to buy the rest.  I built a media company (called Contrarian Thinking, if it's not already plastered everywhere on my profile😉). We have a holding company, VC fund, business-buying community, and a combined social following of something crazy like 5million.  Before finance, I used to be a conflict journalist covering human trafficking and drug smuggling...  That experience taught me a lot. Two lessons altered my path the most: 1. Money = power. 2. Like it or not, money is how the world gets changed.  I didn't know ANYTHING about finance, but I learned. Climbed the rings.  I worked at Vanguard, Goldman, State Street...  Then I built an investment biz in Latin America at First Trust. Got a shot because no one else could or wanted to go to Col, Chile, Brazil, MX. I was beyond nervous to fail. My Spanish was meh, BUT it’s amazing what you can do when you have no other options. Later, I was a partner at a $200M cannabis fund.  Eventually, I realized....  Wait a second, M&A for Wall Street and PE is really damn transferable to Main Street.  So I started acquiring small, sweaty, profitable, boring businesses (until those made me more $ than my finance gigs 🤯), and I started building Contrarian Thinking to teach others how to do it too.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-08-27,"In the 1980s, this one mistake cost AT&T $12.6B... And you've probably done it too.  Here's what it was (& how you can avoid it):   It's called ""assumed constraints.""  Ever seen elephants in a safari/zoo? Have you noticed how they're restrained?  It's often nothing more than a metal chain bound to a peg in the ground.  Nothing for a 12,000-pound beast who wants to break loose, right?  But here's the thing:  When that elephant was a baby, the same chain & peg was used to hold it in place.  Back then, that was sufficient to restrain it. When the baby elephant would try and break away, the metal would cut into its skin, wounding it...   As it grows, it never forgets the pain of the chain (elephants never forget, right?).  So it thinks it's impossible to break away.  These are ""assumed constraints"" – irrational, limiting beliefs.  But you're not an elephant. So what does this matter?  Let's look at some biz examples...   1. McKinsey-AT&T  In the 80s, McKinsey estimated less than 900k people would use cellphones by 2000. They thought it'd be a ""niche market.""  They suggested AT&T not pursue cellular.  But by 2000, there were ~100 MILLION users. And AT&T had to acquire McCaw Cellular for $12.6B to rectify the mistake.   2. Uber  In 2014, valuation expert A. Damodaran said Uber was worth $5.9B. Maximum.  Its actual worth today? $95billion-ish.  He assumed Uber's primary market was the global taxi market. Don't know about you, but... I use Uber way more than I used taxis.  Pricing a disruptor based on an existing market = assumed constraint.  3. Computers  Thomas Watson, president of IBM, said in 1943: ""I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.""  A few decades later, Bill Gates said, ""640Kb of memory should be enough for everyone.""  The computer you're reading this on has at LEAST 7,000x that power.  Technology is where most of the world's assumed constraints manifest.  ↓ ↓ ↓  SO, how do you avoid using assumed constraints?  When approaching any problem, list ALL of your initial assumptions.  Go through each and ask:  • Who's imposing this on me? • How can I verify if this is true? • What would change if this weren't true?  You'll think 10x bigger immediately.  Question everything.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-06-27,"10,000 boomers retire a day 8-10% own a small business  Here's why that problem becomes a massive opportunity for you:  There are 2.4million businesses for sale.  They're not flashy startups, they're not hot new restaurants, they're not downtown boutiques.  They are old, stable, cashflowing businesses.  And most of them are incredibly boring.  • HVAC • Plumbing • Carwashes • Landscaping • Cleaning services  These owners' Gen Z & Millennial kids have different priorities than previous generations. Aka, they don't want to take over dad's crusty old plumbing company... even if it makes $1M+.  So what's the answer?  You.  Here's one framework you could use to make one of these boring biz's work for you:  1. Buy a small business, using outside money or seller financing. 2. Add a website, social media, reviews (a simple add most old businesses haven't made yet). 3. Raise prices, which probably hasn't been done since 2008. 4. Add a subscription option. 5. Offer more services to the same clients. 6. Buy a competitor, and repeat.  Is this over-simplified? A bit.  After all, where do you find these businesses? How much should you pay? How do you structure seller financing? What should the transition period look like?

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-11-27,"I just heard about this biz... • Today: worth over $42billion • To start: a $75,000 JUNKYARD  It became the titan it is today through big bets, unique incentives, and acquisitions.  Here’s the story of Copart:  Willis Johnson had a background as an auto dismantler.  At 34, after ten years in the auto salvage business, Johnson bought his first junkyard for $75,000.  At the time, salvage vehicles were mainly auctioned to licensed dealers. Johnson did something different...  He wanted to create a platform that would allow ANYONE to bid on & purchase these vehicles.  So, Copart was born.  The company started small, with just 1 location and a handful of employees. But word of mouth about their unique business model spread...  Previously, salvagers got a fixed fee from sellers to sell a car. Copart took a percentage (~15%) per vehicle instead.  This meant they had a vested interest in maximizing resale value – they'd even clean & repair vehicles to get better prices.  In the following 11 years, they: • Opened 11 additional locations • Eventually launching nationwide  This fueled an astonishing average annual growth of 100%+ in the 90s.  But the real turning point came in 1995: As the internet crept into relevance, Copart made a big bet... They launched an online auction platform.  Now anyone could bid on cars remotely. Their reach skyrocketed.  This, combined with acquisitions (their biggest growth lever), propelled the biz. Sales jumped from: • $6M in 1992 • To $126M by 1997  They began international expansion, in the UK first & now ~200 locations globally.  They've become a mammoth of a biz: • Worth ~$40B • Revenue of ~$1B • Sell 265k+ vehicles per year  I love this biz for several reasons:  1. The 'rollup' model  This is the process of Copart slowly buying more and more locations to become a formidable force.  This can't be replicated in all industries (predominantly brick-and-mortar).  But when it works, it compounds FAST.  2. Innovative biz model  Can you think of any current industry where a small incentives tweak would result in better outcomes for all parties involved?  Copart's % fee change was genius because it meant when Copart succeeded, so did buyers & sellers.  3. Big bets  Embracing early tech can be risky.  The companies that get it right go on to rule the world.↓ ↓ ↓Thanks for reading. If you like business breakdowns like this, my newsletter has even deeper dives.

People started seeing business ownership as a more stable financial option than employment.2. The KidsBy 2021: 28% of women with school-age kids said they started their business in response to increased childcare responsibilities. Stay-at-home mom + badass business owner at the same time.3.

Here's what I love about her model:   • She built her competency first. She started a consultancy helping brands with anything from design to digital strategy.   • She picked a niche she had a personal resonance with. She had long been struggling with ADHD and found Notion to be the perfect solution for organizing her entire life.   • She built partnerships with the brand. She collaborates on live events with Notion, which made her the most legitimate creator in the space.   • She created a product that is B2B-sellable.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-10-27,"You probably know of Dollar Shave Club.What you might not know?Unilever bought them for $1B. And the acquisition was deemed a failure.Here's the lowdown:Michael Dubin, a stand-up comedian & digital marketer who'd just lost his job, met Mark Levine at a party.It came out that Mark had a unique problem: a surplus of 250,000 razors.He desperately needed help selling them.This inspired an idea in Michael's mind...What if he started a service that cut the expense & hassle of razor blades?What if they just showed up at your door each month – for $1 each?Given his passion for improv & marketing experience, Michael decided to create a launch video to differentiate their brand.What resulted was one of the greatest video ads of all time: https://lnkd.in/eFzVVVSHThat video went CRAZY viral.It generated 12k $1/mo subscriptions within 48hrs & racked up 4.75M views in 3 months.But why did it work so well?Great storytelling:• Michael is the hero & protagonist• Us vs them narrative, where Big Razor is the enemy• And of course, a level of humor Gillette could never hope to reach. By 2016, DSC was doing $153M with 3.2M members. They had an estimated 10% of the US razor market.Happy ending. ...Right?Meanwhile, P&G-owned Gillette slowed. Of the men's razor market, they owned:• 70% in 2010• 54% in 2016In response, they launched a knockoff subscription (""Gillette On-Demand"").P&G's rival, Unilever, took notice...In 2016, Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1B – one of the largest e-commerce transactions at the time.So... was it a success?It's D2C standard to balance customer acquisition costs with how much customers spend in a year. But Dollar Shave Club was using a 5 year timeline.Aka, spending 5 TIMES AS MUCH on customer acquisition as they should have.This made profitability elusive.To counter this, they expanded their product line since the acquistion.Including $50 cologne, $10 hair cream, $13 sunscreen... But wait, what was DSC's original hook?$1 razors...DSC's legacy customers don't spend on higher-end (high-margin) products. Meaning: Unilever didn't study their customer enough.Also, DSC was paid for entirely in cash.Michael's upfront payout was ~$90M.He contractually had to stay on as CEO for a period, but this payment structure gave him little incentive to continue growing the business (vs equity, for example).For these reasons, Unilever themselves said last year:""Dollar Shave Club has not delivered the results they were expecting.""But, it's still a functioning business. DSC hasn't totally failed, and Unilever could still turn things around...If you found this story interesting, feel free to repost & follow me Codie A.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-02-27,"This company is valued at $1.2B.And spends $2M/mo on podcasts.Here's their story:Founder Chris Ashenden had an interest in sports & nutrition from Bruce Lee films.He started a sports supplement biz after college. Which failed.The failure pushed him to work odd jobs from selling cars to policing. But nothing really stuck. Until...Self-help books pulled him back into entrepreneurship. But in '08, real estate losses put him $5M in debt.Chris was stressed, depressed, drinking heavily, and constantly sick.Tests showed he couldn't absorb nutrients, and he was prescribed a $100/day, 50-pill/day regimen...He thought, ""No way THIS is the best solution.""So he won funding to develop an all-in-one, easy-to-consume nutritional supplement.The result? 8 different multivitamins & probiotics combined into a single powder.Here's the biz's first major green flag:Chris was his own first customer.  He URGENTLY needed a solution to his failing health - so he built one himself.This implicitly validated demand.Plus, being your own customer means you've got a never-ending source of feedback: yourself.But health products need a LOT of credibility.So, to attract initial customers, Chris got endorsements from health influencers. Their sway convinced early adopter audiences.This worked well enough. Until the business's major inflection point:In 2010, Tim Ferriss co-signed Athletic Greens in The 4-Hour Body.Sales EXPLODED as biohackers signed on.This vein of success guided their marketing. If you're a regular listener of Tim Ferris or Huberman Lab, you'll know... They've invested HEAVILY in podcast ads.A stat to blow your mind: Athletic Greens spent $2,227,000 in June advertising on 592 separate podcasts.Another defining detail for AG?They launched with a single SKU.And have iterated ONLY that single SKU over the years (today, it's known as AG1).It's super rare for a company to get this big with just one product. But it's allowed for an unparalleled level of focus.Today, AG1 is used by huge names like Cindy Crawford, Joe Rogan, and Steve Aoki. (And Codie Sanchez 😉)• They've hit $160M+ in revenue• Raised $125M in funding• Valued at $1.2B.Is the hype deserved?

Less of: - Respect seeking: I tried to get people to respect me who I honestly don't respect (or even care about). I got upset when someone belittled an accomplishment. Silly. - Partnerships: I did 2 bad partnerships. That cost me 7 figures and time. Less of me being a workhorse for someone else's reward. No new friends😉 - Chosen struggle: I got off on hard things being the way. This year, I'm going to see what it's like to paddle with/not against the current.   More of:  - Being feminine: This year I was so intense and masculine trying to get it all done. Next year I'm going to play more, and wear whatever the f I want.  - Big swings: I was a workhorse this year, on the daily grind. 2024 I am going to try a few more BIG swings and sprints, then rests.

They're not flashy startups, they're not hot new restaurants, they're not downtown boutiques.   They are old, stable, cashflowing businesses.   And most of them are incredibly boring.   • HVAC  • Plumbing  • Carwashes  • Landscaping  • Cleaning services   These owners' Gen Z & Millennial kids have different priorities than previous generations.

Here's one framework you could use to make one of these boring biz's work for you:   1. Buy a small business, using outside money or seller financing.  2. Add a website, social media, reviews (a simple add most old businesses haven't made yet).  3. Raise prices, which probably hasn't been done since 2008.  4. Add a subscription option.  5. Offer more services to the same clients.  6. Buy a competitor, and repeat.   Is this over-simplified? A bit.   After all, where do you find these businesses? How much should you pay? How do you structure seller financing? What should the transition period look like?

It’s called ""Sheets and Giggles.""  Here’s the breakdown:  The company Colin McIntosh worked at had just failed.  He wanted to start a new biz & listed out important criteria like:  • A large, competitive market (with proven demand) to differentiate in • A market with no brand loyalty/affinity • A product with simple supply chains  He finally found the idea while watching a movie where someone sells bed sheets.  He was a big sustainability person & eucalyptus lyocell came out on top as the most sustainable fabric for his bedsheets.  He secured a domain & validated demand using textbook techniques:  • Built a scrappy landing page • Spent a little $ on FB ads for traffic • Crowdfunded to gather an email list for when he launched  So: now that demand's been validated, how does he build the product... given he has no textiles experience?  Outside consultants.  They launched to 500 customers on day 1 & exceeded crowdfunding goals by $20k.  Then stepped it up with:  • SEO • Actually funny emails • Great customer service (online & by phone)  As well as their own Black Friday campaign, ""Purple Friday,"" which bagged $22k in sales in 1 day.  Today, they've:  • Shipped nearly 200,000 products • Raised a total of $1.86M over 5 rounds of funding • Ranked #309 on the Inc. 5000 fastest-growing private companies in the US  They also put their money where their mouth is...  McIntosh wanted to build a biz that let his kids ""inherit a livable world,"" so they've:  • Donated $100k+ to charity • Planted 2 trees for every 1 harvested • Donated a percent of proceeds to their local community per Pledge 1% Colorado  Respect for this.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-09-27,"This guy took a 1-year leave from work...  And ended up building a $125k/mo business.  Here’s how:  Chris Gimmer began in finance. But a trip to Southeast Asia gave him an epiphany:  He didn’t enjoy his 9-5... and really didn't want to go back.  Wanting to live a life on his terms, his entrepreneurial flame had been ignited. And that's not easy to snuff out...   So, he & his co-founder Marc (who Chris met at work), tried a couple biz's: • A student dating site that got to 1,000+ signups, but failed • A bootstrap marketplace that got to $10k/mo, and got acquired  And in the process of building, found a problem that’d make them rich: How big of a pain it was to create images for blog posts.  At the time, graphic design tools were either too complicated – or way too basic.  So, they started validating demand for something new...  On another website they’d started for stock images, they: • Placed a banner ad • Directed traffic to a landing page • Collected email addresses • Sent out surveys to the addresses • Did 15-20 customer calls  By the end, it seemed this was something people would pay for.  Once they knew this was something people would want, they launched a beta.  Betas are smart because: • You gather usage data • You collect real user feedback • You find & fix things that don’t work  Before you launch for real.  These guys made another genius move:  While in beta, they CONTINUED collecting email addresses.  When they officially launched, they had 15,000 people to email.  They hit $2k MRR within their first week (using a freemium pricing model).  So, how did they scale?  After toying around with content marketing, they honed in on bottom-of-funnel SEO.  Aka, content that covers specific use cases for their product – not generic content for everyone.  Specifically: • Look at all of the use cases for the product • Put those keywords into Ahref's keyword explorer • Use the search traffic to guide what content to make  Then, if someone’s looking up something your product would be useful for, you’ll come up.  It took them 1 failed business & 1 decent exit to stumble across the eventual big idea.  Copy their homework:  • Start w/ an idea that solves YOUR problem • Validate your idea in the market • Beta test the product • Target bottom-of-funnel  Trust the process & rewards will come. Players of the long game tend to win.↓ ↓ ↓PS: If you liked this, you could try my newsletter here → https://lnkd.in/eGmtANrR",935,136,20,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-12-27,"A data-backed cheat code you’ll wish you knew 10 years ago:  It’s called the Spillover Effect.  Kellogg Insight did a study across 58,000 hours in 11 companies about high performers and low performers.  This is what they found:  1. Positive Spillover  If you sit within 25ft of a high performer, your performance increases by 15%.  Translated financially, if you make $100k a year, you start making 115k.  You are no smarter, you work no harder... and you're 15% better.  Plus, the highest performers are not negatively impacted if their neighbors are performing lower. The strong always lift up the weak.  2. Negative Spillover  But if you sit near a bad performer… Things get bad fast.  But how they define “low performer” in the study is important... They call them ""toxic workers,"" which is someone who ends up being fired for their behavior/performance.  On average: • A toxic worker costs a company $12,800. • 2% of all workers are toxic. • They infect FAST.  The poison of a toxic worker spans way beyond 25ft:  Researchers said, “You can see their negative imprint and negative effect across an entire floor.”  2 takeaways here for you:  1.

I feel deep crippling sorrow for those who never know what it is to love every moment of the work you choose to spend your life lost in.  Someone asked me why I write.  I write for me.  I write because it takes the lunacy out of my head and it traps it on paper. Some people get massages, I write.  If you are a writer. You understand this. Your blood isn't red, it's black. It's ink.  For the rest of you, if you haven't found the thing that you get so lost in you pray to every God to never be found... keep searching.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-07-27,"How much does it ACTUALLY cost to start & scale a $20k/month business?  A Reddit user broke down how he did it with ""inventrepreneurship.""  Here’s how it went down:  1. Ideation: $0  Our inventor is Chris. Here’s how he started:  • Had a household appliance issue • Saw YouTube videos on the issue with 100k+ views • But solutions required DIY/buying parts • No easy solution on Amazon either  Like that, he had his idea + market validation.  2. Design: $363.33  Chris found a local 3D printing business.  They turned his verbal descriptions into 3D computer-aided design prototypes.  Transforming mental images into legit designs (e.g. to give factories) cost ~$400. Not bad.  3. Admin & Paperwork: $130 (+$2,500 optional)  $130 to set up a business: • EIN → free (via the IRS site) • Name filing fee → $45 • LLC filing fee → $50 + $35 for expedited service  The optional $2,500? Patent protection.  Chris waited until his sales could fund this bit.  4. Mass production: $4,600  Chris found Alibaba suppliers that worked with the materials he needed.  He chose one that had quality and experience – not just a low price.  They pointed out issues with the design other companies missed. He felt they knew what they were doing.   The $4,600 breaks down into: • $4,350 for 1,000 units • $50 to ship one initial, test prototype from China to the US • $200 to ship the full batch of units  After this, Chris was ready to start selling.   5. Sales: $392 (+ variable fees)  • Wix for 1 year: $102 (with 50% coupon) • Amazon seller account: $40 • 10 UPCs: $250 via GS1 (the official barcode establishment required by Amazon)  Variable costs: • Amazon fees + packaging: ~$6 per sale   The results?  The guy’s chosen to keep himself, and his biz, anonymous – so, unfortunately, there’s no super recent data.  But, after one year:  • Selling in 8 countries • $40 price per unit • ~$7 cost per unit • ~$5,000 in profit/week  All from a little over $5,500 in startup costs.  Pricier to start than dropshipping? A bit. More work? Sure.  But between: • The patent • His anonymity • Custom manufacturing • Not sharing the parts' design details  No one's gonna be copycatting Chris's idea.",879,139,27,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-01-27,"It was 2008 during the financial crisis.  I was sitting at Goldman Sachs watching people pack up everything they owned into cardboard boxes as 20% of the workforce was fired.  People were crying, protestors outside were chanting “F*ck the 1%” as they left. It was awful.  But as I sat outside one of the glass offices where they fired people, I got to overhear something...  They were firing one of the managing directors, head guys... and he wasn’t crying.  In fact, he was pretty stoic and they were going back and forth over a piece of paper.  On it, I’d find out later, was his equity % that he’d get in the firm. They were explaining to him what his exit package would be. He was getting paid to leave and not work. That pay included him owning part of the company after he left.   His name was Jim, and he was paid millions over the next few years.  I heard someone say once that they made more than the CEO of a bunch of companies, including Ford, in 1 year. Hmmmm. That would be a lot of money. That would surprise me… So I went to look up the numbers. Because, well, math always wins.   So Ford’s CEO’s salary was $1.7 million. Ok, I make more than that too.   But wait a second… his TOTAL compensation was $20.9M. I do not make more than that a year.   Goldman Sachs’s CEO’s salary is $2M a year. Wow, I make more than that. But wait… all in he makes $25-35Million. I don’t take home that… yet.  Here’s the problem most people do not understand:  Wealth will never come from a salary. It only comes through ownership.  There are only 4 ways to get ownership:  1. Start your own company 2. Become such a valuable employee to a company you’re irreplaceable (and get equity for it) 3. Invest in a company 4. Buy a company like you buy a house  You can work hard for a paycheck, or you can work hard for ownership.  It’s all hard, but I know my choice.↓ ↓ ↓Read this newsletter for biz-buying insights from our private community of owners → https://lnkd.in/gZgZ3XMk""",873,127,29,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Here’s a quick guide:  There are loads of online marketplaces for buying businesses:  • Flippa • BizQuest • Bizbuysell • Acquire .com • BusinessForSale  Just to name a few.  I love this method, I’ve used it. Online marketplaces are approachable. There’s something enticing about browsing a site and striking gold…  But honestly, my most profitable businesses have been found off-market.  Which brings us to my second most-asked question:  ""Where do you find OFF-MARKET businesses to buy?""  Off-market deals come down to some combination of: • Knowing the owner • Getting a warm intro • Doing so many cold calls you get frostbite  There are plenty of old tricks to get off-market leads: • Spend time where SMB owners (think retirees) might be - meet them • Utilize SMB resources - libraries, chamber of commerce, SBA offices • Visit local biz's - find on google • Scrape data - from yelp, google, etc  At my level, I have analysts who do the bulk of my deal scouting. It is NOT a fast process.  Getting data for decent leads is time-consuming (& at times soul-crushing)  SO…  I bought a business that solves the problem.  It’s called Bizscout → bizscout.io  • You tell them your zip code and the type of business you want to buy • They give you a list of solid leads to reach out to with all available data  Annual subscription = unlimited requests for 1,500+ types of biz's.  It's a no-brainer. Just 1 successful deal sourced from Bizscout = 10,000%+ return.  Scared of a cold off-market search?  You’d be surprised how many owners haven't thought to sell... Until someone asks them.  Off-market deals are everywhere.  ↓ ↓ ↓  Not sure where to even start?  Grab the list of my 130+ favorite businesses to invest in.

Learn before you earn. 6. Trade ego for curiosity. 7. Negotiate. Always. Your salary is your greatest driver toward wealth at first. 8. Staying isn't worth it. Get a raise or find a higher-paying job. 9. Take bets with your money. Once you have it, start with small, calculated swings. 10. Always ROI for time.  Don’t ever let anyone tell you to wait.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-01-27,"I heard a story about an entrepreneur making $20k/month... Selling framed tweets.  Here’s the breakdown:  • $49 a pop • 75% of sales were made as gifts • 0 employees (aside from himself)  Zach Katz, a film graduate from Boston, really didn’t want to get a normal job.  A conversation with a man selling $5 Sudoku puzzles on the street changed his life.   He realized: “If some guy selling Sudoku puzzles on the street could eke out a living, anything’s possible.”  The idea came to him while literally scrolling Twitter: What if you could frame a tweet?  He thrifted some frames, printed out tweets, and started selling on the streets of Portland.  Here's how it went...  Phase 1: Shift to online  Zach started off selling in person. Unsuccessfully. So he invested in building a Shopify store.  His first online launch netted ~$5,000 in sales – and features on sites like Product Hunt.  Phase 2: Scalable Marketing  Eventually, traffic from the press died down.  So, Zach began running Instagram ads & hired a marketing agency.  From that, Framed Tweets generated: • $20k in Year 1 • $110k in Year 2 • $20k+/mo in the first few months of Year 3  During the scaling phase, Katz met business partners in super interesting ways. He found: • A marketing agency from a Reddit post • Help with an influencer campaign from a Tinder date • A fulfillment center via referral from an unhappy customer  Phase 3: Things go downhill...  Zach spent $10k flying to the Grammys for a marketing stunt. His plan: • Gift his product to celebrities • They post about it on their socials • Take photos to use as promo material  Problem: the ROI was pretty much $0.  It drained Katz’s savings.  Phase 4: Acquisition  Other bad financial decisions (including paying influencers that didn’t sell any product) left Katz without capital.  The business was grossing $5-6k/mo.  Eventually, Katz sold the company.  This may not be a success story, but I love:  • The pure hustle. Choosing hard.  • The source of inspiration (sudoku guy on the street). Money is everywhere.  • Ending with an exit, not shutting down. A business is never worth $0. (Even a weird tweet-framing business.)↓ ↓ ↓If you like stories like this, you’d enjoy my newsletter → https://lnkd.in/eGmtANrR",785,192,26,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-09-27,"SMB acquisition is the most underrated form of wealth generation in the US.  Opportunity is here. If you'll take it:  • Existing business success rate: 95% • Owners retiring within ten years: 3M+  Here's the 10-step process I’ve used to buy 20+ cash flowing businesses in the last decade:  1. Foundation 2. Deal clarity 3. Origination 4. Selling you 5. Negotiation 6. Valuation/DD 7. Financing 8. Structuring 9. Closing 10. 1st 90 days  Let’s dive in to the first few:  1. Foundation  Know your why, and know your opportunity.  • Retirement-age boomers own $5.1 TRILLION worth of small businesses. • 2.5M businesses for sale right now. • And only 1 in 11 will sell.  The market NEEDS more owners.  2. Deal Clarity  With 2.5M businesses on the market, you have to narrow it down.  One framework I recommend for finding cashflowing biz's is SOWS:  Stale - minimal innovation Old - a longstanding business Weak - poor competition Simple - needed, not complicated  3. Origination  Aka: Where do I find a deal?  1. Marketplaces (BizBuySell, etc) 2. Off-market (Bizscout.io, cold calls) 3. Brokers (google ones near you) 4. Network (local groups, CoC, etc) 5. P&L review (buy places you pay now)  4. Selling You  Ever met a small business owner?  That biz is their baby.  Sell yourself before they’ll sell to you:  • Show your other successes • Ask good questions • Prove you have $ • Be enthusiastic • Build rapport  5. Negotiation  My best advice for negotiating deals:  • Always present 2-3 options. • It HAS to be a win for everyone. • Know your needs vs wants going in. • Control either the price or the terms. But you don’t need both.Want to learn more about the biz-buying process...?Get my biz-buying newsletter, Boring Business Brief.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-04-27,"Anyone who says real estate is passive income has never owned real estate.  In fact, anyone who says 100% passive income is possible is trying to sell you something...  What we think of as PASSIVE income, I prefer to think of as INVESTMENT income. Your money's working for you... But that doesn't mean you aren't working for it.  Here are 7 unique, profit-proven investment income ideas (for those willing to do the work):  1. Write a Guide  Gumroad is free monthly + a 10% transaction fee... And so idiot-proof I did it myself earlier in my online career. I made ~$8,900 on a product.  People want to learn the weird, niche thing you know how to do.  2. Consult for Others  GLG connects 1M experts to clients.  I did this too for a while early on, but given how busy I am, I got annoyed having to “apply” for every job.  If you have the time, apply away. (But pro-tip: don't do this work for free.)   3. Get Paid to Travel  • TrustedHousesitters USA • House Sitters America • MindMyHouse • HouseCarers • Nomador  These are all sites where you can housesit & stay for free.  Some days I fantasize about living on a European organic farm... Then I snap out of it. But maybe you should snap into it.  4. Become a Sales Rep  Obsessed with a brand that's small enough to respond to you?  Reach out & ask to be an affiliate.  Someone in our community recently did this with a biz he loved, and he put it best:  “It was something I was already doing so it feels great to get paid for it.”   5. Airbnb Add-ons  I recommend local SMBs to my guests & get commission.  • Renter gets a discount w/ my code • Biz makes a new sale • I get a cut  (No Airbnb? Reach out to local hosts & offer to set this up for them)  6. Fractionalized Investing  Sites like Fundrise let you invest in real estate without the hassle (or $).  I like Here.co best (so much, I invested in the company itself). You can invest in vacation rentals starting at $250.   7. Upsell the Places You Frequent  Could you improve your fav business?  I fantasize about designing an email campaign for my gym: Linking new members to products they'll need, a 30-day workout plan, nutrition guide, etc. I could get paid a lump sum or rev share for $ I bring in.  --  These are just 7 ideas to start making creative investment income.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-03-27,"This artist has one of the most fascinating money-making stories I’ve ever heard.  • Worth $150M • Sold more records than One Direction • Has reportedly only left her house TWICE in the last decade  Enya.  Either you know her from the classics that struck your heart through the 80s and 90s... or you know her from her from TikTok.  Because Enya got a bit of “the Kate Bush treatment.” Ie, her 80s songs got re-introduced to Gen Z via viral TikTok sounds.  Where she differs from Kate Bush?  Enya has almost 4x more money.  And the oddest part...  Throughout her whole career, she's NEVER toured. Which is the top revenue stream for the vast majority of musical artists.  She claims it would be nearly impossible to recreate her complicated sound live.  Which may be true.  But the more likely answer?  She’s a total recluse: • She doesn’t enjoy live performances or interviews • She’s had some TERRIBLE stalker issues throughout her career  So, she lives in a castle in Ireland with her cats and a handful of staff, doesn't see anyone else, and works on her art.  But this begs the question:  If she doesn't tour, doesn't leave the house, and hasn't had a hit song since the early 2000s...  How did she make $150M?  She’s sold over 75 million albums worldwide, but that’s not the whole story.  The bulk of her wealth has come from one song: ""Only Time.""  But more importantly, it comes from who used it…  Times “Only Time” was used commercially: • A 2002 episode of Friends • A 2013 Volvo commercial • Deadpool 2 in 2018 • The 2022 Thor movie • A mac & cheese commercial 4yrs ago • Plus sports games, memes, & more  She gets royalty money from these.  But the real legacy behind this song:  CNN and other US news outlets used ""Only Time"" for 9/11 footage in 2001.  Enya’s response? To release it as a charity single.  She donated the $461k made to NY's firefighter charities.  She’s no doubt a weird lady, but I respect her: She built her success with obsession.  Once when asked about her romantic life, she said:  “I had partners. But I’m too much devoted to my music. Some people think it sounds sad but believe me, I’m happy. I am my music.”  The lesson I take?  Obsession comes with sacrifices. Few will understand. Is it worth it for you?  If it is, obsessing = success  I’ll leave you with this contrarian quote from Enya:  “My private lifestyle bothers a lot of people. I don’t like anybody else’s opinion. It’s not a hanging offence not wanting to go to nightclubs. What happened to choice?”↓ ↓ ↓If you enjoy the stories behind wealth, you’d enjoy our newsletter → https://lnkd.in/e-ZR_W_8",705,189,17,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-06-27,"I just learned about some creators who built a $150 MILLION streaming service in 4yrs.  How were they able to succeed where every past streaming company failed?  By avoiding all mistakes of their predecessors.  Here's the founding story of Nebula:  Lesson #1: No Venture Funding  Taking venture funding means you need to grow at all costs.  There's a graveyard of companies in this space for this reason: • Quibi ($1.75B in funding) • Vessel ($132.5M in funding) • Fullscreen (~$500M in reported funding)   By not taking venture funding, Nebula was able to: • Grow on their own terms • Align with creators by sharing funds • Not rely on paid ads to generate initial customers  Lesson #2: Putting Creators First  Nebula developed a system where: • 50% of Nebula profits went to creators • 50% of Nebula would be distributed to creators if the platform was sold  For the first time, creators would have ownership in a platform's success.  This system helped Nebula at 3 levels: • Short-term: Gained creator trust • Mid-term: Allocated profits to creators • Long-term: Made it a win-win scenario whenever the platform exited   Lesson #3: Launched with a Strategy  Nebula didn't want a massive launch. They wanted a small alpha group to answer key questions:  • What content did viewers care about? • What marketing messages resonated? • How did the users find the product/experience?  On May 23, 2019, they launched via an ad read from one of their creators: Isaac Arthur.  The launch brought in 4500 signups. More than enough to serve as a beta group.  But still no money for marketing.  They needed a growth strategy...  Lesson #4: Strategically Hacked Growth  The biggest problem for Nebula in the early days: Cashflow.  As a bootstrapped business, they had nothing to spend on ads.  The unlock: A bundle partnership with Curiosity Stream.  Curiosity Stream was already advertising with many of their creators.  They approached them with a deal:  Every customer that signs up for Curiosity Stream would get access to Nebula.  The bundle: • Increased value for customers • Raised conversion for both platforms  The partnership was a success. So much so, Curiosity Stream acquired a stake in Nebula at a valuation of ~$50M.  This enabled Curiosity Stream to: • Build their own streaming tech • Spend more on their originals • Grow out their team   Lesson #5: Stayed Flexible  Eventually, they knew they could pivot to direct marketing. They'd proven the product was valuable... And they needed cashflow.  They went from $0 adspend to $500k per month, while maintaining positive cashflow.   I'm a massive fan of this story: • Building based on past failures • Growth hacky sh*t for early traction • Aligning incentives to create long-term growth  A playbook on entering a supposedly ""unbeatable"" space.",663,121,18,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

If that's you, here's the goal-setting system I use that might get you on track:  I call this the Freedom Method.  Why?  A few years ago, I realized all my New Year's resolutions had 1 thing in common..  They were to give myself more freedom.  You start by asking yourself 6 questions:  1. What do I REALLY want?  • Visualize your dream life. • Describe it in minute detail. • What does the day-to-day look like?  2. Why do I want it?  Describe why this matters so much.  3. Do I feel comfortable telling someone else about the goals above? If not, why?  If you’re afraid to say it out loud, you’re afraid of being held accountable.   Do you think you can't do it? Do you think you're undeserving? Dig deep here.  4. What DON'T I want?  What would make me angry, sad, etc if I had more of it in my life? Describe it in as much detail as possible.  5. What would happen if I didn’t end up achieving these goals?  What would my life look like? Am I happy with that? How would I feel about myself in this scenario?  6. What's getting in my way of achieving this?  • What needs to give? • Why do I think I’ll fail? • Why have I failed in the past?  ↓ ↓ ↓  To really make these stick, there are 2 more final steps...  First, answer the above 6 questions for all areas of your life:  • Body • Money • Impact • Mindset • Mastery • Spirituality • Relationships  Second, you now have a list of 10+ goals.  Narrow it down to 3 only.  Start at the bottom & cross them off until you're left with the 3 that matter most.  Focus = execution  That's your foundation. Now what's left?  To actually do the damn thing.  So we built out a tracker for you to: • Set your goals • Set your anti-goals • Track your daily actions • Template for a daily check-in  All in one place.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-04-27,"I just read a Reddit post on someone's $25k/year wedding side hustle.  Here's how they did it:  • The gig: Renting wedding arches • Average revenue per job: $521 • Time commitment: ~1 hour per job  The Reddit post was made by u/jimmy2tents.  We'll just call him Jimmy.  Jimmy noticed that less than 22% of all weddings take place indoors anymore. This means there's a hot market for mobile marriage supplies...  So he started looking into the numbers: • ~$2200 to purchase the tents • Gigs were ~$500 - could be paid back after 4 installations • The tents would last roughly 5 (fabric) to 10 (wooden frame) years  He launched and quickly found the beauty of the business: • ~15 mins to 1 hour to set up • Upsells (flowers, decor) were easy (people will pay $$$$ to make their wedding look picturesque) • Building relationships with local event planners + wedding venues reduced ad spend  Here's the financial breakdown of last year's operation: • 46 jobs • $24k total revenue • $521 average revenue per job   But it's not all smooth sailing: • Engaged couples have high expectations, you need to stand firm on what your offers are and not offer insane customizability • You can't just operate 1 generic offer. Jimmy has around 25 tents (sourced from Etsy) with different looks.  I see a ton of opportunity here. A few ideas:  • Leverage Google Local Search Ads to dominate more remote suburbs  • Identify common offers (ie. Jewish weddings, Indian weddings)  • Verticalize upsells (ie. tent setup, flower delivery, etc.)  ↓ ↓ ↓  Like stories like this? You’ll love Contrarian Thinking.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-02-27,"The best business model in the world:  Unlocking free $$$.  This startup raised $26M to help hotels & resorts generate free revenue – without them doing any extra work.  It's a hack Uber, Airbnb, & Postmates have all unlocked.  How does it work? Let's break it down.  What do all these companies have in common?  They connect underutilized resources with people who need them - without owning those resources themselves.  ie, Airbnb connects a traveler to a person with an empty home. But Airbnb doesn't own the home.  This business model is genius because it means companies (like Airbnb) ""borrow"" resources for free to provide a certain customer experience.  They're great for the economy too because they unlock $$$ from resources that weren't previously being used by anyone.  So how did this $26M startup find a space within this ""marketplace"" biz model?  They looked at hotels & resorts.  To begin with: • Most hotel gyms, pools, and spas are heavily underutilized by guests • But lots of people would love to use a hotel's amenities without shelling out for an overnight stay  Enter: ResortPass.  It's a platform for hotels & resorts to sell day passes for their facilities.  They work with the hotel to determine an appropriate price – then take a cut of each booking.  With these day passes, users can access amenities like pools, spas & fitness centers for 1 day.  So, say you live in Miami in a building with no pool access and have friends in town. You can grab a day pool pass at a premium hotel for $30/each, or even rent out your own cabana.  Meanwhile, the hotel's getting basically free $$$ for minimal extra work.  Clever, right?  It's a recession-friendly biz model too: • Hotels get extra $ in slow seasons • Users get a budget-friendly, local luxury experience  But ResortPass isn't just a marketplace - it's also building the very software for hotels to manage day guests...  Which reveals a brilliant biz model:  They earn revenue both by taking a fee from each visitor AND from the hotels that subscribe to its booking software.  Some quick stats & facts: • They've got 900+ hotels & resorts on the platform (including Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, and Hyatt) • 1.6M+ users have booked day passes • They raised $26M late last year from investors including Jessica Alba & Gwyneth Paltrow  I love win-win businesses like this: • Users get access to new things • Companies get an extra revenue stream • The platform makes money from connecting the two (without investing in the facilities themselves)  Makes me wonder what other opportunities like these we've been overlooking...↓ ↓ ↓PS: If you like stories like this, you'll love my newsletter → https://lnkd.in/g3smakQm",627,159,15,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-04-27,"""You’ll own nothing, and you’ll like it.""  An odd battle cry from a group of humans who in fact own much.  A bit Buddha, a bit Marx, a lot offbeat.  Perhaps they guessed the mood wrong. In an age of minimalism, they thought they’d hit their mark. But we humans have long needed a small nest of “our own.” A place to tend to, a garden to grow, a home.  Unlike herds on the plains of Africa, we are not great stewards for land unowned. There is a word for this truth, created all the way back in 1933:   The tragedy of the commons.  An economic phrase that means when all have access and none have ownership, things tend to get depleted and fall apart.  You need look no further than our oceans in international waters, housing projects, or public bathrooms for a real visual.  So if you believe one thing in all the many things I tell you I hope it's this…   Ownership is in fact the most important thing you can have.  It need not be in companies or land but it needs to be in something. Something that works even when you are not, something that gives even when you don’t.  Remember, SOMEONE must own. I trust you more than them.  ↓ ↓ ↓  Are you ready to take a step toward ownership?

Here's what they're about:  They're called Riverside, and I have been using this tech constantly.  Whether you’re recording: • Podcast episodes • Business meetings • Talking head videos • Panel discussions • Webinars • Or more...  Riverside makes it stupidly easy to produce high-quality content that’s ready to be marketed with no editing skills needed.  It also uses AI to cut your full recordings into clips you can post quickly to socials. Which still blows my mind.  No editing required, saves hours of work. It even analyzes your best moments to find what is most likely to go viral.  And if you DO want control over editing, they make it super easy by recording everything into separate audio and video tracks.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-09-27,"The ""LinkedIn for doctors"" is a beast of a company:  • $181m EBITDA • $6.47bn market cap • 4/5 US physicians use it  Also, it’s INSANELY profitable.  Here’s the breakdown:  CEO Jeff Tangney started Doximity in 2010 with Dr. Nate Gross and Shari Buck.  Tangney was already a seasoned health-tech founder: he’d founded Epocrates, a Palm Pilot (throwback) app for checking drug doses and interactions. He built it from his Stanford dorm in the 90s.  Despite IPOing in 2011, Epocrates ended in an anticlimactic <$300M acquisition.  From this, Tangney learned: • Don’t raise too much • Don’t burn too much • Fix a real problem  In the process, he did find a real problem:  How physicians find other doctors to refer patients to.   So, Doximity was born.  Today, the platform’s expanded to: • Telehealth software • A medical newsfeed • Medical productivity tech • Professional networking & hiring tools • and more  The term ""LinkedIn for doctors"" is becoming increasingly appropriate.   And let me tell you, this company PRINTS $$.  Reported $450M ARR, and 93% of it was subscription revenue from:  1. Marketing solutions for pharma companies 2. Hiring solutions for medical recruiters  They make $400k rev per employee – way higher than $250k, the SaaS average.  Some other impressive stats: • 43% profit margins (crazy at this scale) • 290 $100k+ customers (i.e. $29m+ rev) • Founder/CEO still owned 27.8% at IPO (typical is 10-20%)   I’m a fan of 2 specific parts of Doximity’s approach:  1. Relentless iteration 2. Obsessive user focus  The team adds features based on feedback gathered at annual meetings with dozens of doctors.  Their philosophy:  Customer ideas > Doximity team's ideas  This company does a ton right: • Fixing a first-hand problem • Deeply experienced founders • User-focused company philosophy • Not raising excessively • High ACV customers  Likely a sign of smart leadership.",624,134,13,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-03-27,"An unfortunate trend: Adult loneliness.  • 1 in 3 Americans report feeling lonely often • 12% say they don't have close friends • Adults under 30 feel the most lonely  Here's the story of a biz that turned this sad trend into a $2.4M/yr opportunity:  The best trends to use for business are problems with no good solution yet.  What's a solution to young adult loneliness?  Co-living.  Here's how it's changing the nature of real estate & how people live:  Co-living: • You get matched with people like you • Often in the same stage of life (think young professionals) • That you share communal spaces (and presumably become friends) with.  Not to mention, it's affordable & flexible...  There are 20% more co-living rooms in the US now than in 2020.  And the global market is expected to grow 16% per year, hitting $9B by 2025.  It's most popular in big cities w/ high rent.  I found a super interesting co-living biz making $2.4M/year Singapore:  Two guys, Eugenio and Ahmed, wished they could live with similar people whilst working in the corporate world.  Eugenio came across co-living in Italy and thought it'd make sense in Singapore.  They raised money from friends/family & started developing a property...  And Casa Mia Coliving was born.  All rooms were booked immediately (mainly through word of mouth) by young professionals looking for housing with a sense of belonging.  Their big selling point: community. They prioritize events & activities.  4 years in, and they seem to be killing it: • 90%+ average occupancy rates • $7M in annualized revenue • 100% yearly growth  And people love the concept.. on average, people stay with Casa Mia for 14 months.  I expect to see biz's like this becoming mainstream in coming years.  When you're young, one of the most underrated determining factors of your success is where you live.  And especially with adult loneliness on the rise, co-living's one to keep an eye on.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-05-27,"SMB acquisition is the most underrated form of wealth generation in the US.  Opportunity is here. If you'll take it:  • Existing business success rate: 95% • Owners retiring within ten years: 3M+  Here's the 10-step process I’ve used to buy 20+ cash flowing businesses in the last decade:  1. Foundation 2. Deal clarity 3. Origination 4. Selling you 5. Negotiation 6. Valuation/DD 7. Financing 8. Structuring 9. Closing 10. 1st 90 days  Let’s dive in to the first few:  1. Foundation  Know your why, and know your opportunity.  • Retirement-age boomers own $5.1 TRILLION worth of small businesses. • 2.5M businesses for sale right now. • And only 1 in 11 will sell.  The market NEEDS more owners.  2. Deal Clarity  With 2.5M businesses on the market, you have to narrow it down.  One framework I recommend for finding cashflowing biz's is SOWS:  Stale - minimal innovation Old - a longstanding business Weak - poor competition Simple - needed, not complicated  3. Origination  Aka: Where do I find a deal?  1. Marketplaces (BizBuySell, etc) 2. Off-market (Bizscout.io, cold calls) 3. Brokers (google ones near you) 4. Network (local groups, CoC, etc) 5. P&L review (buy places you pay now)  4. Selling You  Ever met a small business owner?  That biz is their baby.  Sell yourself before they’ll sell to you:  • Show your other successes • Ask good questions • Prove you have $ • Be enthusiastic • Build rapport  5. Negotiation  My best advice for negotiating deals:  • Always present 2-3 options. • It HAS to be a win for everyone. • Know your needs vs wants going in. • Control either the price or the terms. But you don’t need both.  I’ll stop here for now.  If you want all 10 steps, you'll have to catch one of our monthly webinars...

Men want women who are sexy, strong, make their own $$, well-dressed, actually like to listen about golf scores but also, who cook them apple pie like their mommies. Extra points if you do it in aprons.  The TRUTH...  You gotta choose; do you want the mommy, do you want the docile tame non-threatening man, or do you want the edges?  Turns out only edges allow you to sharpen one another.  So I’ll choose edges, adventures, questions, and creation any day.  We’ve never been given anything the easy way… but man is it more satisfying on the other side of two humans who do the work.",586,100,5,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-04-20,"Divorce is awful.   Here’s true lessons from going through it...  1. Marrying well is the biggest life hack of all.  2. Marrying poorly is a costly path to misery. Choose wisely.  3. When someone gets divorced I often say, “I’m sorry and congratulations.” Usually there is pain and freedom.  4. Money makes people a shell of themselves during divorce, do not fall to that level. You can make more money later.  5. There is always an exit tax on freedom, expect it.  6. Careful of shadow influences, people who whisper in the ear of your former spouse fear and pain that can take an amicable divorce and turn it into a nightmare.  7. Find someone who has walked the path before you, taboo subjects will leave you feeling lonely and alone.  8. It is going to be ok. If you learn from this, you will be better. And likely so will your spouse.  9. Mediation, arbitration, trial. Avoid trial at all costs, try for mediation. Cheaper, faster, less contentious.  10. Find an attorney who lists on their website they help do divorce amicably, if one spouse has a wartime attorney, it will turn into war. Try to avoid that.  11. Grab your loved ones close. A place to stay, a friend to wake up to, a person to watch movies into the night.  12. Don’t allow anyone to shame you. Of course you wanted it to work, hopefully you tried hard. Those who secretly want divorces are often the loudest to yell at you for your choice.  13. Tears. You will shed a lot of them. It’s ok.  14. Find something to look forward to, a trip, a project. You can get lost looking at the past, look forward.  15. You can find incredible love and commitment after this, I did. It will take work but it will be worth it.  16. Write daily and often. Pain will be repeated until you learn from it.  17. If no one else says this to you, and you have given it your all, and your marriage is truly not right... you are making a very brave move. Hold your head up.  18. You will lose friends. They will choose sides, they won’t all choose yours. BUT the real gems for you will.  19. People will talk about you. Who cares.↓ ↓ ↓The clip is from BigDeal.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-12-27,"This company grew to $1B+ by helping small pizza shops take on the big guys.   • Revenue: $100M (as of Feb 2022)  • Traction: 19,000 pizzerias in 50 states   Here's the story of Slice:  1. Founder-Market Fit   Ilir Sela founded Slice in 2010, but it was always in his destiny:  • His grandpa, uncle, & dad operated pizzerias  • He had 10+ friends who owned/worked in small pizzerias   After selling his tech services firm for $500k in 2008, he knew Pizza was next.  2. A Counter-Positioning Masterclass   Ilir noticed that small pizzerias struggled against players like Pizza Hut / Domino's:  • No ability to offer online ordering  • Inefficient marketing/distribution  • Lack of tech solutions in general  This reflects in the numbers: • From 2006 to 2016, independent pizzerias lost 21% of market share to large chains • Independent pizzerias make an average of $451k per store vs. the $783k of average chain stores  Ilir's solution?  Build a product for his extended family + friends that helped independents:  • Design simple + effective websites  • Create in-house online ordering systems  • Increase AOVs w/ loyalty programs + upsells  3. Building Your Moat   The company bootstrapped quickly, processing $40M in pizza orders by 2015.  But they knew they needed to continue building to prevent being eaten up by big platforms like Doordash / Ubereats.  They raised venture funding + launched a bunch of products that make them the end-to-end solution for independent pizzerias:  • Bundled supplies (order in bulk + deliver to independent stores) • Point of Sale system • Consumer App (#5 in food on App Store)  4. Future Growth  The market for Pizza is massive in the US: • ~$45B in sales  • ~40k independent stores • Average revenue of $450k per store   If Slice can continue to help small pizza shops compete, they'll only continue to grow.  There are also products they've yet to build:  • Pizza shop payroll • Inventory + expense management  • B2B marketplace of suppliers and wholesalers  I'm a huge fan of this story. It's got: • Pizza  • A founder building in a space he loves • Helping the little guys compete / survive • Bootstrapping until the vision gets too big • Never straying from his initial mission of helping independent pizza stores↓ ↓ ↓I absolutely love hearing about new startups that bring small, independent businesses into the 21st century..

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-01-27,"1. Say you're going to do the thing.  2. Then actually do the thing.  Willpower is a lesson in mini failures.  Chris (my husband) said to me, “When you say you want to do something, never use the word try. Just go do it.”  Such a simple statement so rarely done.  I pause thinking how the day got away, how it slid like a slippery eel through my fingers. It wriggled away and into the arms of lost time.  Our actions accumulate. It’s not the end goal achieved, that happens in seconds, it’s the steps you take minute by minute to get there.  We humans were not actually wired for singular focus.  We were wired to survive, not thrive.  So maybe it’s a mix of grace and persistence, of allowance and process.  We have to carve out of our very skin the distractions. Rip out that which doesn’t serve us. Violently vomit out what weighs us down.  Every single action matters. They all accumulate.  Don’t let another be the determinant of your day. Grab the eel.  *A lesson to me, and maybe to you.↓ ↓ ↓If this resonates, you'd probably enjoy my newsletter → https://lnkd.in/eGmtANrR",567,169,52,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-06-27,"This solo founder just sold his company for $50M+. The craziest part?  It was completely bootstrapped and in a totally unconventional niche.  Here's the breakdown:  Let me introduce you to Jean-Nicolas Mastin, the 1-man show behind Wargraphs.  • Started coding at age 11 • Built his first website around World of Warcraft in 2009 • Became obsessed with League of Legends and waited for their API to come out so he could build with it  Do you realize how MASSIVE League of Legends actually is? (I didn't...)  • ~180M players global, 28M in the US • Generated $1.75B in rev for the developer • They even produced a viral Netflix show last year, Arcane, which made Netflix ~$900M  But Jean-Nicolas was building apps in 2013 before the game had hit the mainstream.  His first experiment: League of Graphs • 16.9 million visits • In-depth character stats • Infographics on the game's monthly updates  What did Jean-Nicolas's day look like?  ""I wake up each morning and ask myself: What do my users want or need right now? As soon as I have an answer, I chase it down quickly.""  This paid off in 2017, where he continued to build and obsess over his core audience.  What happened?  He launched Porofessor. A free application that overlays with the game, enabling players to look at:  • Live in-depth scouting on their opponents • Post-game analytics on their performance • Guides on how to use certain characters  The app was an instant hit: • 800k daily active users • $13.46M revenue in 2022 (mainly via ads)  The company that acquired them, MOBA Network, is also a fascinating business... Their focus is on acquiring and growing the world's largest gaming communities: • Valuation: $515M • Distribution: 170M page views + 20B video views per year • Assets: 1,000+ content creators and 23 online communities  A fascinating community-first model.  Some lessons from this story: • Build for avid fans • Always obsess over your customers • Build from a place of personal obsession (find what feels like play to you, but feels like work to others)  I don't know the first thing about League of Legends...  But a story of a passionate builder?

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-02-27,"Crumbl Cookies has crossed $1B in sales.  Crazy for a biz that started in 2017.  Here's their secret sauce:  1. Obsess over the customer  Jason McGowan and Sawyer Hensley spent weeks building out an understanding of their customer before launching.  They spent days in gas stations and grocery stores asking different people to taste two cookies to see which they preferred.  They asked local bakers to teach them the principles of baking a great cookie and the factors that could be tweaked to change textures.  2. Nailed Virality  Crumbl has a weekly ""unboxing show.""  Hundreds of thousands stop by and tune in.  They have a rotating menu of five specialty flavors that will be available.  This might seem stupid: what if someone only loves 1 flavor and it's not available this week?  But the truth: it keeps fans engaged as they build a habit of watching the unveiling and view it almost like a Supreme drop.  This has trickled down to their massive investment in social media.  TikTok: 6.6M followers (short-form highlight reels)  Twitter: 869K followers (in-depth recipe drops)  Instagram: 3.6M followers (crazy-looking cookies and packaging)  YouTube: 1.31M subscribers (invested in long-form, highly produced shows)  3. Cut out the Middlemen  Crumbl quickly expanded to retail locations (now at over 600)  Nowadays, a big part of retail food sales are based on delivery.  But Jason and Sawyer weren't fans of existing delivery apps (Ubereats, Postmates, etc).  At any moment they could:  - Charge higher fees / rates - Change Crumbl's rankings/listings - Restrict what SKUs Crumbl could sell  So they decided to build their own app:  - Allows for different types of orders (catering, gift cards, pickup etc.) - Built-in reward program (points based on social media engagement)  It's always impressive when a food/service business sees huge financial success. $1B in ~5 years for cookies is particularly insane.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-11-27,"Mistakes most potential business owners make:  1. They build it from scratch instead of buy. 2. They take months or years to cashflow. 2. They go for biz's doomed for failure...  I've developed a framework that avoids these mistakes.  I call it SOWS.  SOWS tells you the *types* of businesses you should buy.   You use it to find biz's with:  • Lower risk  • Profitability  • A reasonable price  • Potential for growth  • Simple (not easy) execution   SOWS stands for Stale, Old, Weak, & Simple.   It's a straightforward way to screen your first deals and build upon them. Let’s dive in:   1. Stale   Half the businesses in your hometown fit. The place runs okay, but:  • No testimonials  • Website from 2005  • Limited social media  • Still use a fax machine   This leaves a lot of room for easy innovation when you buy... AND you don't price that into the purchase.   2. Old   These are businesses that have existed for 5+ years. If you want cashflow... Give me a 25-year-old car wash over a startup run by 25-year-olds any day.   The Lindy Effect says if it's existed for some time it will likely continue to exist. Old biz’s can be hidden gems.   3. Weak   Buy a biz with poor competition. When was the last time you got a plumber:  • On time  • With automated billing  • Who sent follow-up texts?   There are 3 easy fixes right there to make you better than competitors.   4. Simple   Simple business model. Simple operations.   If you can easily explain your first few deals to an 8-year-old, you’re on the right track.   Don’t get distracted by shiny things when working toward your first business.   Run with what already works.   Just make it better.↓ ↓ ↓Business-buying is NOT the easy way out. It's complex and a lot of work... and so, so worth it.Take a small step today.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-03-27,"SMB acquisition is the most underrated form of wealth generation in the US.  Opportunity is here. If you'll take it:  • Existing business success rate: 95% • Owners retiring within ten years: 3M+  Here's the 10-step process I’ve used to buy 20+ cash flowing businesses in the last decade:  1. Foundation 2. Deal clarity 3. Origination 4. Selling you 5. Negotiation 6. Valuation/DD 7. Financing 8. Structuring 9. Closing 10. 1st 90 days  Let’s dive in to the first few:  1. Foundation  Know your why, and know your opportunity.  • Retirement-age boomers own $5.1 TRILLION worth of small businesses. • 2.5M businesses for sale right now. • And only 1 in 11 will sell.  The market NEEDS more owners.  2. Deal Clarity  With 2.5M businesses on the market, you have to narrow it down.  One framework I recommend for finding cashflowing biz's is SOWS:  Stale - minimal innovation Old - a longstanding business Weak - poor competition Simple - needed, not complicated  3. Origination  Aka: Where do I find a deal?  • Marketplaces (BizBuySell, etc) • Off-market (Bizscout, cold calls) • Brokers (google local ones, or get referrals) • Network (local groups, CoC, etc) • P&L review (buy places you pay now)  4. Selling You  Ever met a small business owner?  That biz is their baby.  Sell yourself before they’ll sell to you:  • Show your other successes • Ask good questions • Prove you have $ • Be enthusiastic • Build rapport  5. Negotiation  My best advice for negotiating deals:  • Always present 2-3 options. • It HAS to be a win for everyone. • Know your needs vs wants going in. • Control either the price or the terms. Preferably terms. But you don’t need both.↓ ↓ ↓If you want the last 5 steps... you'll have to stay tuned for one of my monthly Masterclasses.For now, you can start reading our Boring Business Brief newsletter for insights from buyers → https://lnkd.in/gZgZ3XMk",515,203,18,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-08-27,"These guys created & sold a MONSTER $125M revenue business… Because they were sick of taking off their wedding rings.  LeBron even used their product while signing his Lakers contract. Here’s the story:   Friends KC & Ted, both aspiring actors, were working as waiters. They'd each gotten married the prior year.  In passing conversation, they realized:  Working in restaurants, going to the gym, etc meant they were always taking their rings off – or not wearing them.  An idea struck…  They wanted to show commitment to their wives – but in a practical way.  So, QALO (Quality Athletics Love Outdoors) was born: an everyday, durable ring.  Neither KC nor Ted had any experience in jewelry, manufacturing, or eCommerce…  Which didn’t stop them in the slightest.  They got to work designing & prototyping: • Choosing the right materials • Getting intros to manufacturers • Iterating for months before mass production  (Still newlyweds at this point. I wonder how emptying their savings for that first batch of rings went down..)  Now, let’s note: Their initial designs were quite bad.  But their main aim was to validate the market & see if others faced their problem. It didn't actually matter how they LOOKED (yet).  The lesson here: Don't bother optimizing what doesn’t need to be optimized.  Once they had inventory, they started emailing people who’d get the most use out of a silicon wedding ring: • NFL players • Firefighters • Military  ..Including KC’s college-friend-turned-NFL-quarterback, Andy Dalton.  Sending the product to Dalton sparked a wild chain of event:  First, players in Dalton’s locker room took notice & bought rings for themselves.  Second, the Cincinnati Bengals (Dalton’s team) featured on HBO’s Hard Knocks.  They did a whole segment on Dalton wearing a QALO ring.  This blew them up.   So they picked up their marketing: • Paying ambassadors (only people who actually used the product though) • Sending influencers the product for free • Hiring an agency for Facebook ads • Creating video content  In their 1st year, QALO made $60k.  In their 2nd, $3.2M.  Wild.  They went on to sell rings through: • REI • Target • Dick’s Sporting Goods  And had customers that included: • LeBron • Bryce Harper • Stephen Curry  It’s safe to say: they created an entire new industry.  Eventually, in 2019, they sold the biz. They’d generated $125M+ in total revenue by that point.  One piece of advice from the founders stuck with me:  ""Stay true to your ‘why.’""  Remember your core vision for the world.  And don’t chase shiny objects if they don’t align with why you started.",495,86,6,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Find the total amount that needs to be cut to hit the goal.  • If you have managers, let them do the first cuts since they’re closest to ops • If it’s just you, break down each biz unit  3. Dues & Subscriptions  Subscriptions & reoccurring costs are the first things to bloat. We cut 3 ways:  • The number of seats • The number of tools • Renegotiate rates  Found revenue: $5-20k  4. Find the living dead  Google does an annual spring cleaning where they shut down underperforming projects. They've killed 293 to date.  We killed dozens of zombie projects across my businesses in this process: • A newsletter • A community • A consulting offer • A physical product line  5. Contractors  Next area to negotiate, cut, or change.  We took in-house ads for one biz that saved us $4k+ of ad spend.  We rolled off a “nice to have” consultant.  We cut a few underperforming contractors & gave 50% to current team members to take on more work.  6. Employees  I pride myself on never *at least not yet* having layoffs in any of my portfolio companies based on the market. We grow, but not too aggressively, exactly for that reason.  BUT underperformers do get cut.  I use the ""Splinter Effect"" here:  Ask managers: who do you routinely find yourself having to “fix” things for? If the same name comes up more than 1x a month, you have your answer.  7. Cut, Automate, Delegate, Outsource  We had someone who made $80k/yr manually posting on socials. Outsource a VA at $12-20k, automate where possible.  “We’ve always done it this way"" is not an excuse.  8. Turn it into a game  We gave a $1k bonus to anyone who came up with an idea (we actually implement) to use AI to cut a task we currently did manually.  9. Fall Cleaning:  Only thing I would do differently is to schedule this annually & processize.  So now it's on our Q4 agenda yearly.  10. Cutting isn’t ALWAYS smart  What businesses did we not do this with?  We are actively incubating 3 companies & they need more resources.  A benefit of positive cashflow is we can give more love to our growing biz's.  ↓↓↓  Downturns are awful.  BUT they're also a chance to take a step back.

Investing, usually stocks or real estate.  But there’s a fourth path that’s long been overlooked… And it’s about to explode:  Business acquisitions.  • Acquisitions have a higher success rate than startups. • The right acquisitions can have a higher cash-on-cash return rate than real estate. • And acquisitions are still a form of self-employment, which correlates to higher satisfaction, greater income security, and more freedom of time.

It started with a founder's pure love for EDM:In six years, they became one of Inc 5000's fastest growing companies in America.But they started with Dan Watkins working a 9-5.He hated that his hard work translated into someone else’s success. (Relatable.) So he started a side hustle that quickly made up 80% of his income...Selling basic glow products to local clubs from his garage.His basic products were selling fast, but his inflection point came when he started building more complex products.But if the basic stuff was selling fine, why deviate?Because customer retention = answering, ""what's next?"" every time they come backSo Dan took a chance on GloFX...They started with product development:• Figuring out concepts and ideas• Hiring a law firm to do patent research• Prototyping, sourcing, & manufacturingThen, they moved on to setting up online.They were pretty methodical:• Analyzing marketing data• Researching SEO• Creating prices• Styling, themes, colors, and logos• Making website pages for all the products accessibleThey tried pretty much every tactic from social media ads to guerilla marketing.Now, GloFX’s marketing is multi-tiered:• Buyer-intent keywords for SEO• Remarketing to high-value customers• Using a 300+ approved reseller networkToday? GloFX has expanded into markets you might not have expected:• Arts and science museums• Educational institutions• EDM subculture fashionThey’ve also moved up the supply chain and launched their own line of batteries.Their biggest learnings?1. Hire slow, fire fast• Is this employee the right fit for the co?• Are they skilled at what you need?• Are they a self-starter?Take it slow – employee turnover is expensive & frustrating.2. Keep learning• Observe competitors• Watch peer influencers• Attend conferences and seminarsDan's advice?

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-08-27,"What does this graph have to do with you?  Here's what I see:  1) The bottom 50% earn their wealth through real estate.  2) The top 50% (and the top 1% ESPECIALLY) earn their wealth through ownership in businesses.  Real estate investing – once a rich man's game – got a makeover in recent decades. It's now considered the average Joe's path to wealth.  And yes, many a millionaire has been made through real estate.  BUT, there's another glaring opportunity staring us right in the face:  True wealth comes from owning companies.  ""Sure, maybe for the top 1%. But someone like me could never buy a business.""  I hear this a lot. My response?  Tell that to the shop owner down the street who is desperate to retire in the next 3 years but has no clue what will happen to their business.  This situation is happening at scale in our nation:  • 10,000 boomers retire a day. • Boomers & older own 56% of US small businesses. • Their kids don't want to take over the family biz. • 80% of small businesses close, not sell.  Meanwhile, real estate is at risk of becoming over-saturated. Cash flow can dwindle to nothing due to rising interest rates and increasingly harsh landlord regulations.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-03-27,"How to buy a biz & have the seller pay:  (kind of)  There's a method called Seller Financing.  It's where you as the buyer use future profits from the business to pay the seller.  Sounds great for you, right?  But why would a seller want to agree to something that makes it sound like THEY have to pay?  Negotiation is key.  Here are 3 things you can say to a seller to sway them:  1. You’ll raise the overall price.  If you were financed through a loan, you'd be paying likely around 8% in interest. To the bank.  With seller financing, the interest rate would likely be closer to 5%. And it would go straight to the seller.  So the interest rate is LOWER, allowing you more wiggle room for a higher overall price.  AND the seller gets that interest money straight to their pocket.  2. Their taxes will be spread out.  Let's say a seller owes $70k in taxes from the sale.  In a traditional deal, they owe it all at once.  With seller financing, you can write in terms to spread it out over, say, 10 years. So they'd pay ~$7k once a year.  3. It can be really f*cking fast.  SBA loans regularly take up to 90 days to clear. It's mostly out of your hands.  Seller financing? Can happen within 1 week if everyone's motivated to make it happen.  ↓ ↓ ↓  Not EVERY deal will work out this way.  But, the first step to get ANY deal to work this way is to learn the ins and outs of seller financing.This is one of the number 1 questions I get asked, so we finally created a course on it.It should answer any question you have about seller financing / self-liquidating acquisitions.We have a waiting list if you want to be the first to get access.Get it here → https://lnkd.in/exyKBftq",438,114,14,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-03-27,"I found a company that’s disrupting a $780B/year industry.  • The market: Auto repair • The target: Locally-owned shops • The product: All-in-one AI marketing  Here’s the breakdown:  The US has over 280,000 auto repair shops.  50%+ are independently owned. (Compare this to grocery stores, where 11% are locally-owned)  Top 4 biggest auto repair brands make up 10% of all shops. (Compare to ecommerce, where top 4 companies make up 72% market cap)  The industry is expected to grow to $1.6T by 2031.  Why is it growing so fast?  Kind of a crazy chain of events...  New and used car prices are skyrocketing ↓ Gen Z can’t afford to buy cars ↓ So they’re spending 40% more on repairing their current cars ↓ Which means cars are being kept longer than ever before ↓ Resulting in more repairs needed  Who knew Gen Z would lead the charge for auto repair industry growth?  But those aren’t the only waves Gen Z is making in this space…  • 72% of Gen Z & millennials read online reviews before making a buying decision • 61% prefer online scheduling or web chat over a phone call  So? Why is that a problem?  Well, the average age of a repair shop owner is 57 years old.  Mom & Pop owners near retirement age aren’t known for their tech savviness.  I’ve been to mechanics that write your receipt on a notepad they bought in 1982.  On top of everything, 50% of current auto shop owners plan to retire in the next 6yrs.  When younger owners take over, how can they adapt to customer expectations?  Worst case, they don’t.  Best case? They manage and pay for 5+ different software vendors for: • CRM • Reviews • Marketing • Scheduling • SMS service reminders  This is where Shopgenie comes in.  Local auto shop owners can do online bookings, customer management, and all-in-one AI marketing on 1 platform.  Plus, Shopgenie integrates with all other major existing software in the space.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-02-27,"Ever heard of The Silver Tsunami?  It will impact over 2M US small businesses..  No, it’s not some Hawaiian seniors’ surf competition (as much as we’d all love that).  It’s a term for an aging population's impact on society, the economy, and for us, 1 very important industry...   On the horizon: • Up to 30M homes could flood the market • Medicare spending (currently ~$700B) is projected to double • Mass retirement, with 1/4 of the labor force age 55+ by 2030  And one other HUGE thing…  Boomers alone own an estimated 2.34 million small businesses in the US. They employ more than 25 million people.  This COULD be a huge problem… Look at Japan, for example:  According to The Guardian, more than 1.2M Japanese small businesses have owners aged 70 with no successor.  But it’s happening here, too…  Live Oak Bank found that 70% of American SMB owners have no real succession plan.  It’s no longer as ""simple"" as handing off a farm to your kids for them to manage. Aging boomers need other options...  The Silver Tsunami is coming.  5 things to keep in mind so you can ride this wave:  1. Profitability > Philanthropy  Biz-buying isn’t a charity.  Millions of businesses will go up for sale in coming years, but they won't all be GOOD businesses.  Learn what a good deal looks like. Then, don’t take a bad one.  2. Business ownership isn’t for everyone  • Hiring good talent • Firing people to their face • Managing terrible customers • Meeting payroll…  Most people are NOT built for that.  3. Know what you’re getting into  A Harvard MBA out there thinks he can roll up 3 HVAC biz's in Bismark, North Dakota, mix in some digital marketing, & call it a day.  Maybe he can.  But maybe he doesn’t even know what HVAC stands for yet, let alone how to use a screwdriver.  4. Don’t assume ALL boomers want to sell  Some owners may hold on to their biz as long as possible for the cashflow.  But there’s still a ""sweat equity"" opportunity..  You partner with an aging owner, and your compensation & ownership stake grows over time.  5. Call in the military  Every few years in the US, 100s of thousands shift from active military service to civilian life.  Veterans are 45% more likely to be self-employed than non-veterans.  As owners across the nation seek compelling buyers, vets could benefit big time.  ↓ ↓ ↓  Whether this is the first time you’ve heard the term “SMB,” or you’re knee-deep in the industry, there’s only 1 clear next step for you to take…  Get this newsletter → Boring Business Brief  We share insights from our private business-buying group, and all the experts in it.

Sanchez,Female,2023-04-27,"This founder is a wild card:  Not only is she an investment strategist at JP Morgan and a PhD candidate at Yale, but she also founded a $200k/year... plantain business.  Here's her story:   In 2014, Rachel Laryea was a broke, vegan undergrad student at NYU.  To make living in New York more affordable, she:  • Interned at Goldman Sachs • Worked many jobs, one as a live-in nanny • Started saving money by cooking dishes with plantains, which were hyper-affordable  Over time, she began to develop plantain-based recipes:  • Fudge plantain brownies • Smooth plantain ice-cream • Plantain chocolate chip cookies • Even a ""chichinga burger,"" made of plantains and black beans  She started sharing them with her friends, who told her to start selling them to the public.  So she gave it a shot.  She started vending at festivals and pop-ups, then launched an e-commerce site to ship cookies and brownies nationwide.  In 2018, Rachel launched the brand in full: Kelewele was announced at a plantain party that doubled as a fundraiser.  From the ""few thousand dollars"" raised in 2018, Kelewele:  • Hit $200k in gross revenue in 2021 • Tested a new physical location in Brooklyn's DeKalb Market for 6 months • Signed partnerships to sell her goods at 2 NYC cafes  Here's why I love this biz:  • She built it during stints at JPM and Yale University - a true side hustle • Constant experimentation - she's tested catered events, merch, recipe books, and more • Clear niche - no high-level competition on her recipes  Turns out plantains ain't so plain.↓ ↓ ↓PS: I also have a newsletter that covers stories like this.It’s called Contrarian Thinking.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-06-27,"The most valuable skill in life:  Learning how to make money work for you...  ↓ ↓ ↓  • I've bought 25+ boring businesses • Managed $100M+ funds • Invested in 50+ startups  Here's the framework that drives it all:  I call it LEIDDR.  Learn Earn Invest Diversify Divest Repeat  Step 1: Learn  People overcomplicate financial basics.  Learn: • How to utilize debt • How to leverage taxes (esp. as a SMB) • How to read income + cashfow statements   Then, establish the correct money principles: • Don't conform blindly to the norm  • Never discount. Compete on value, not price. • Your price isn't too high. Your perceived value is too low.  Step 2: Earn  Negotiating your salary will be your greatest driver toward wealth at first.  Here's how my path to $100k looked: • Vanguard Offer: $35k Starting: $37.5k Ending: $60k  • Goldman Offer: $60k Starting: $75k Ending: $150k   Understand the main skills that will 3x your income: • Negotiation • Delegation and operations • Decision-making on deals   Step 3: Invest  There's no better teacher than being in the arena.  I remember I was burnt on a few early deals. For each mistake I made, I've never made it again.  Early scars are valuable.   My biggest early investing lessons: • Apply the Pareto principle to deal searching • Understand good v. bad debt • Focus on high ownership on 1-2 deals v. low ownership on 8-10.   Step 4: Diversify  The people buying biz's are the same ones: • Earning with a W2 • Doing side projects • Keeping some $ in stocks • Owning & renting real estate  Continue to search for different opportunities to create leverage.   I practice diversification in everything: • My LP contributions to managers • My SMBs across a variety of industries • My content on different platforms   Step 5: Divest  You can't perpetually add to your plate.  So you have one job as CEO: Fire yourself from as many roles as you can.   The ultimate goal: Grow your investments, then exit at a higher multiple.  Step 6: Repeat  The most important part.  The best investors leverage feedback loops. They can clearly map what inputs lead to what outputs.  After every investment: • Track key metrics • Schedule 1:1s with operators + founders  Be tapped into what makes every decision click.  Another way I do this is by keeping all my holdco companies in a master spreadsheet.  • Balance sheet • P&L • Projections  For all businesses, at a glance.  Want the one I use?

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-07-27,"A partnership can be really, really powerful.  But it's REALLY hard.  Now I use this due diligence before we do a deal with an operator/owner: ✔️ Background check ✔️ Call and email 10 references ✔️ Review their business's reviews & BBB files ✔️ Attorneys review all contracts prior to doing the deal ✔️ If they’ve ever raised capital, talk to their previous investors  Some other things to remember:  → Partnerships are easy to get into and hard to get out of. Do you want to work side-by-side with this person in the same office for 10yrs? If not, don’t do the deal.  → How does this person talk about & treat people they leave or disagree with? Start with the end in mind. Have a conversation about expectations for both sides, then document them. If it’s not signed, it never happened.  → People change, expect it. Expect people to turn into the worst versions of themselves when money's involved. For many, money creates monsters.  → Incentives drive actions. If they earn their money regardless of their performance, expect them to do less.  → Most people won’t want it as bad as you. They won’t be willing to put in what it takes.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-04-27,"Here's a billionaire you've never heard about:  Nick Mowbray and his brother were university dropouts who went straight from their farm in New Zealand to the industrial heartland of China.  Here's their story:  1. They won the national New Zealand science fair as 14 and 17-year-olds for their model hot air balloon kit. They wanted to make it a business so turned their family farm into a small-scale production line and sold the kit door-to-door.  2. They fell in love with building products + trying to sell them and wanted to test themselves at the next level. They moved to China, the epicenter of manufacturing.  3. All they had was a $1,300 loan from their parents. So they rented a tiny factory that would double as their home and lived off $1 McDonald's meal deals.  4. In the toy industry, if you have a top-selling product, it can remain relevant for years to come. The Mowbray brothers hit on 2 top-sellers (a robotic fish bowl and packs of water balloons) that helped them build brand recognition and legitimacy to win other deals.  5. By 2020, their business had grown to 8,500 people, with 26 offices around the world, doing over $1.1 billion in total sales.  6. Now, they're expanding from toys to consumer products (diapers, hair care, collagen) and are already on track to make $200m in sales this year.  One of my favorite stories from these guys:  They pulled off a genius move to advertise their new diaper brand, Rascal and Friends.  They partnered with CoComelon, the most popular show in the world for babies, to use their branding. They snuck in to get this deal because the 2 incumbent brands, Huggies and P&G, already had exclusive deals with Disney and Warner Brothers.  Today, Rascal and Friends is the Mowbray Brothers' strongest consumer brand. They are projected to reach $150 million in revenue in 2022, up 50% from last year.",367,74,5,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-04-27,"There's a $10B company that controls half of the internet's advice.  Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but they do around ~800 MILLION page views every single month.  That's wild.  Here's a list of websites you've probably visited before:  → The Points Guy for credit card reviews → Healthline.com to see if you're dying from any small health inconvenience → Lonely Planet for where to travel and what to do → MyMove.com to measure the hell that is moving houses  They all share one commonality. They are part of Red Ventures:  • Started in 2000 by two Harvard Business School grads  • The first iteration of Red Ventures, a platform to drive online shoppers to retail stores, failed as part of the dot-com crash  • The big unlock for them?

And so are others – 64% of shutdowns are LLCs or S Corps, and 21% are C Corps.This is 100s of thousands of businesses going bankrupt or otherwise dissolving.Why?Some factors at play for startups:• Lack of demand for niche tech• Cashburning rather than cashflowing• Inflated valuations catching up to realityVenture-backed is a dangerous game…90% of startups fail.BUT of those that “make it,” an estimated 16% go on to get acquired.Since high interest rates are making capital so expensive, many investors think 2024 will be the year of M&A... Which means meaningful exits for startups on the move.So:1. Startups are shutting down2. Many acquisitions result in a wind down of the original entity...What exactly is the market here?Well, it turns out dissolving a business is a very expensive, very LONG, very “makes you wish you never started the damn thing to begin with” process.Winding down involves:• Withdrawing your corporate registration from each state• Tax compliance (nothing to mess with)• Decisions about old records, etc• Capital redistributions• Vendor termination• Liquidations• Legal plansand moreThere aren’t many tools that simplify this..Enter: @sunsetdotcoSunset handles the legal, accounting, & operational aspects of winding down.They've built a product to help take the entire process off founders' & investors' hands – allowing everyone to move on to what's next.Sunset helps both with shutdowns and post-acquisition.They see a near future where their product makes life easier for SMB owners too.I think there’s an incredible amount of opportunity here.So…We’ve invested in them.I’m thrilled to have Sunset in Contrarian Thinking Capital's portfolio.Check them out here:",319,113,6,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

How do you capture attention in such a saturated market? Personalize the experience.  So Spoiled Child used AI to deliver.   They captured over 250,000 data points from focus groups & customer data from their sister brand IL Makiage. They created a two-minute questionnaire from this data.  It asked users about their preferences, age, problems... Then be matched with a hyper-personalized serum solution.   That’s cool, but how did they drive traffic in the first place?   By applying new branding that legacy brands in the anti-aging space just haven’t matched:  • Typically, anti-aging brands focus on treatment and maintenance (wrinkle-fixing cream, etc) • But Spoiled Child went for 25-55 year old customers focused on prevention (collagen pills, etc).

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2023-08-27,"What do you think of when you think M&A?  Probably suits. Goldman Sachs. Billion-dollar companies.  But most people don't know regular folks are in the acquisitions game too..  This is my mission: Main Street > Wall Street  And this is how we’re accomplishing it: building a community where people willing to do the work can get mentorship by experts through the biz-buying process.  The people in this group? They’re brilliant. But they’re no more special than you or I.  Here are a few of their stories:  1. Miguel  He worked corporate jobs in insurance for 15 years.  Stable? Yeah. Lucrative? Sure. Soul-sucking? Absolutely.  So, how do you find engaging, meaningful work while freeing your time from the corporate grind?  One option: acquisitions.  Miguel’s reasoning for joining our group came down to one thing:  Self-imposed sunk cost fallacy. If I spend money on mentorship, I won’t want that money to go to waste. So I’ll actually do the thing.  So, he did the thing: • Filled the gaps in his acquisition knowledge • Brought due diligence to deal review calls • Picked up tips from other members on biz operations post-close  2. James & Katie  Total power couple, these two.  Katie owned her own consulting biz (getting a taste of the freedom of ownership). But James had a career in law enforcement (sacrificing family time for a demanding job).  Real estate investing was their gateway drug to financial freedom… then they started asking questions about acquisitions.  They walk through life with two valuable mindsets:  • Invest in yourself One of those “you get out of it what you put into it” kind of things. It’s true of education & business both.  • The One Nugget principle All it takes is one nugget to change everything. Especially when it comes to dealmaking – a single piece of info can be the missing piece that results in outsized returns.  3. Tristin  Years ago, his old employer unexpectedly sold him the company. He said, this is cool - maybe I'll buy a couple more over the next few years.  Then he said, this is a lot. Ownership can be a lonely place to be, and the struggles get heavy.  So before his next wave of acquisitions, he joined our group. His perks: • Connecting with like-minded people • Helping newbies & getting help from experts • The mental relief of discussing ownership with people who get it  ↓ ↓ ↓  I believe acquisitions aren't for the elite. Anyone can do it, given the right knowledge & guidance.  Still, acquisitions aren’t the right path for everyone.  Like most endeavors, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Believe it won’t “work” for you? Then it won’t.  But... what if it did? I’m glad I took the bet on myself and found out.

Codie A. Sanchez,Female,2024-03-27,"What do you need to buy a business?  Here’s what our biz-buyers said:  1. Access to a community of business buyers and acquisition experts.  Are they biased? Maybe...  Are they right? I think so.  There’s a reason why I started our Contrarian Community.  Business ownership is a lonely road better traveled with guidance from those who’ve walked it before. Business acquisitions even more so.  2. Access to education about acquisition financing.  No one would ever buy a business if they always had to pay cash, right?  Yet we’re not taught well about debt — and certainly not about creative financing.  Buyers want to learn it.  3. Access to specific tools and to assist with acquisition efforts.  There’s a whole world of tools and guidance for real estate investors, stock market investors, etc… Biz-buyers are craving that same infrastructure.  4. Access to education about operational matters.  49% of the people in our community do not currently own a business.  They need help with the basics — how do you manage time on acquisition efforts? How do you negotiate your deal? How do taxes work?  5. Access to education about legal and regulatory matters.  The legal system isn’t built for laypeople. New buyers want help navigating this side of the business world.  6. Access to education about post-acquisition integration and growth.  What do you need to do the first 90 days and beyond?  Biz buying doesn’t end at closing.  7. Access to education about specific industries.

Industry tech pundits have said that the pandemic has brought “two years of digital transformation in two months.”  Many tried to crystal ball the future while we knew nothing about COVID, but that’s about as useful as Fauci’s coronavirus models were. Jokes aside, catastrophe is a catalyst for change.Here’s how I am on the ground seeing COVID-19 change the world around us, in our 65 portfolio companies at Entourage Effect Capital, across the small startups I invest in, and in the acquisitions we are making. #contrarianthinking #sidehustle",24,8,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAFjfnEBSh1kInu5jSZoCy8avYuDODM38-A&keywords=codie%20a.%20sanchez&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e0390694-f7ed-4546-9689-ffb066733808&sid=NTo&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

While Others Focus On Money Lost, Here's How You Win:I've been thinking a lot lately about our green currency. So as I thought about Benjamins, I got myself all worked up over the nomenclature people use these days to talk about money. Too often we diminish the importance of it, we make people feel dirty for the want of it and guilty for the ""privilege"" of having it. All that really does is keep the separation growing, instead we should be teaching others how to accumulate it. Money is not a constrained resource, at least not if we continue in a capitalistic society. The unfair advantage comes from knowing how to earn. So I thought I'd share a few tools.These are nuggets, seeds to be planted... but you know what happens to seeds? They grow into forests.So while the world is focused on the money we've lost, and the haves vs the have nots, let's plant seeds. They'll come out of this with nothing but vitriol and we, we will have green trees.The truth: money is just a tool or dare I say, a weapon.The question becomes do you want to hold the weapon...

Sanchez,Female,2020-04-27,"The MOST underappreciated fact on how to sell in down markets, is knowing this one truth:--> Consumers are either moving towards pleasure or away from pain. <--Always.So you could imagine, in a 10 year plus bull market – safe to say they were moving towards pleasure.
