Lisa Hurley,Female,2023-12-27,"Since we’re talking about sister Taraji, can we also discuss how Mo’Nique said the exact same thing and got dragged to thy kingdom come?Can we talk about the literal shades of misogynoir?Can we talk about how Taraji’s message was better received because of colorism?Can we talk about how the reputational and financial losses that Mo’Nique suffered were closely related to her being being darker in hue and bigger in size?Can we talk about the fact that Taraji is taking home “regular money”? After everything is taken out and everyone is paid, there are probably quite a few folks right here on LinkedIn who take home multiples more than she does.Can we talk about the power of tears? Now do not read what I did not write. Taraji was and is clearly in deep pain and her tears sprung to her eyes spontaneously and authentically. I completely feel for and support my sis. That said, Monique, also in deep pain, delivered her message with a more stoic affect, and was perceived as being bitter; as being an “angry Black woman.”Can we talk about why we require Black women to be in literal tatters before we pay attention to their cries for help? Can we talk about how this is about the entertainment industry, but it’s not about the entertainment industry? Taraji, Mo’Nique, et al are us and we are them regardless of industry. I might go back through my posts at some point and show you how many times I’ve posted about pay inequity; about Black women needing to be supported, protected, and believed; about Black women and the Superwoman Syndrome; about the Angry Black Woman stereotype; about how no matter how we show up, we are harshly judged? Remember Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and how she was verbally flayed for hours? Remember how Meghan Markle was treated? Remember how Auntie Angela (Bassett) was criticized for showing a little disappointment? These are women in the public eye, but trust and believe me that those of us “regular folk” are going through the same thing. The reason why so many Black women on this app are posting the Taraji video is because we know the struggle. Her tears are our tears. Every day…every single day…the struggle bus scoops us up and we go on a ride. And we have to show up in corporate spaces and smile, and be gracious, and be grateful for crumbs, and not rock the boat, and do wayyyy more while being paid wayyyy less. And say thank you for being overworked and underpaid.Just…no.Taraji also talked about building her own tables and diversifying her sources of income because she literally has no other choice.Look around you at the number of Black women who (like myself) are founders and solopreneurs. Yes, we have ideas that we want to bring to fruition, but also: we have to. The corporate machine chews us up and spits us out, and we choose to create better paths for ourselves. For every body who has ever asked me, with offense in their tone, why I center Black women, and why I created The Great Exhale™: this is why.",1452,430,133,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAALAQ-4BbTBIZ2Xm2mreLTNxwBiRG9nz-Bs%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAALAQ-4BbTBIZ2Xm2mreLTNxwBiRG9nz-Bs&keywords=lisa%20hurley&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=35c961ca-9b86-4252-b8c5-ae5951921120&sid=YMH&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Lisa Hurley,Female,2023-12-27,"Maybe y’all will listen to Taraji…😢 I’m so sorry that she is going through this. 💔 Having to prove herself over and over again. Having to fight for equity that is never attained. Having to struggle to be paid crumbs. (Please don’t jump in my comments talking foolishness. Everything is relative.) Monique said the same thing. So did Viola Davis. The industry wants to call Viola the Black Meryl Streep but doesn’t want to pay her Meryl Streep money. 🤷🏾‍♀️ The industry wants to call Taraji “A List” but doesn’t want to pay her A List money. The math is definitely not mathing, and the audacity is extreme. We (activists here on LinkedIn) keep trying to explain to y’all the constant struggle that so many Black women go through, regardless of social class, industry, or type of job. This is why we are tired.Taraji is literally doing her dream job and it’s *still* a struggle. It’s still too much. The burdens are too great. The paycheck is too puny. She is fighting for survival daily. She is us and we are her. My heart breaks for Taraji and for us all. 💔 Black women deserve better.🎥: The Shade Room on TikTok",1240,222,121,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAALAQ-4BbTBIZ2Xm2mreLTNxwBiRG9nz-Bs%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAALAQ-4BbTBIZ2Xm2mreLTNxwBiRG9nz-Bs&keywords=lisa%20hurley&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=35c961ca-9b86-4252-b8c5-ae5951921120&sid=YMH&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-01-27,"I was born in Jamaica, and grew up in Trinidad and Barbados. 🇯🇲🇹🇹🇧🇧 Based on my Ancestry results I'm Blackity Black Black Black. (Mostly. Because slavery.)✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏻A lifetime ago, I was a trained dancer.A lifetime ago, I was semi-fluent in French.A lifetime ago, I found myself living in France, teaching ESL. I missed dancing, so one evening I went out to shake a leg with a girl who had befriended me. We were cutting a rug in the bar, and then some Bob Marley came on. (They LOVE some Brotha Bob!!) Additional context:Phenotypically, she and her forbears hailed from the territories in Zhun of Caucay. It appeared that they had been existing, unseasoned, for centuries.Ok so…Bob Marley comes on, and my Jamaican, Barbadian, Trinidadian, rigorously trained dancer’s body starts moving to the music I have known my entire life. This pale person, who had taken one “Caribbean Dance” class, proceeds to tell me that I am “not doing the dance right.” She then took my hands in hers to guide me in the right way to dance to reggae. Because, you know…she had taken a class. 😐Jump cut to present day:This is how a lot of y’all – you know who you are – look and sound leading initiatives that are not yours to lead. This is how you look and sound on your monochromatic panels, regurgitating knowledge you stole from us, cosplaying thought leadership, getting paid for colonized content. This is how you look and sound calling yourself an ally, but engaging in harmful (not to mention condescending) behaviors.Your weekend course does not make you more qualified than those of us with lived, embodied experience. We are qualified by LIFE. Don’t make yourselves look ridiculous by trying to teach back to us what we already know. Don’t make yourselves look opportunistic by siphoning our experiences second-hand, and trying to profit from them.On this second day of Black History Month (and, tbh, in general), we implore you to:Shift back.Step aside.Cede the floor.This is our time.P.S. Agreed: “Not all,” but way too many. If it don’t apply, then scroll on by.P.P.S. You should already have booked (and PAID) your BHM speakers. You did pay them, right? Hopefully the word “exposure” didn’t factor into your discussions with them.P.P.P.S Running this one back from last year, cause it still applies. Which is kind of sad.Also: Black speakers don’t only “do” DEI. We are experts in a variety of fields and topics.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-01-27,"*TW: Mention of suicide*Pausing to mourn and honor Dr. Bonnie Bailey. May she rest in eternal peace.🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾According to HBCU Buzz: ""Dr. Antoinette “Bonnie” Candia-Bailey sadly passed away this week on January 8th. Family sources have officially confirmed Dr. Bailey died by suicide due to distress from “bullying and severe mistreatment” in her role as VP of Student Affairs at Lincoln University Missouri."" Black women are under siege. Feels like we have always been.In terms of bullying and mistreatment; in terms of emotional, physical, intellectual, and financial attacks--none of this is new. Go as far back as the Black women who were operated on without anesthesia by the so-called ""father of gynecology."" Come as far forward as Dr. Claudine Gay, Justice Ketanji Brown-Jackson, Michelle Obama, Taraji P. Henson, Mo'Nique...the list goes on and on. Look around you at the Black women on this platform, in your office, in your circle...so many of us are suffering. So many of us hide that suffering behind our smiles. The details might differ, but the theme is the same. We all deal with the suffering differently, but mistreatment is the same. Many of us get to the point where we can no longer deal--or we get very close to it. We deserve to live. We deserve to enjoy life. We deserve so much better.Deepest condolences to Dr. Bailey's family and all who mourn her. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾P.S. Employers, colleagues, allies: lend me your ears: be sensitive to the Black people in your circle. Many of us, especially Black women, are not feeling ok. Give space and show grace. 🙏🏾P.P.S.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-01-27,"Happy Black History Month. As you (you know who you are) get ready to put on your annual BHM Broadway-worthy performance, this is your reminder to absolutely acknowledge, honor, and celebrate Black History, AND support those who are currently making, or attempting to make Black History. Do not wait for people to become successful to support them, support them into success. Especially Black people who are pushing against a 400-year setback.So non-Black allies - individual and corporate - this is a call to you to do the work. And the work looks like hiring, promoting, and equitably remunerating Black people. (It also looks like making sure your culture is safe for them, but that's another post for another time.) It looks like recommending and referring Black people. It looks like supporting Black people in myriad ways, including financially. If there are Black people in your circle who have a company, side hustle, product, Patreon, book, course, subscription offering, consultancy, Etsy store, etc. then send some business their way. Make a purchase. Make a donation. Send them a little Zelle, PayPal, Venmo, or Cashapp love.Tag people...but also contribute. Make your support material and concrete.🟤 Share your resources. 🟤 Speak their names to powerbrokers.🟤 Get uncomfortable and give something up, e.g. : 🟤 Refuse to speak for BHM events - refer someone Black instead.🟤 Provide services and support as your contribution to their work.Put some skin in the game. Supply these mythical bootstraps we hear of. Ally is a verb.To my Black folks: Please share in the comments how people can support you. Drop your links. Share your info. Let your need and CTA be known. I've done this a few times in the past and people have benefited, so I'm hoping that it will work this time around as well. #BlackHistoryMonth#BlackHistory P.S. ♻️ Please share this widely and get the word out.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-02-27,"""Why don't you talk about censorship and content suppression?"" Someone asked me this recently, and I replied ""I have. I've talked about it a lot. Just because you, new follower, don't see it happening doesn't mean that it hasn't happened in the past or isn't taking place now.”As the modern sage RaeShanda Lias-Lockhart says: ""Let's check the board.""I've been in the activism space consistently since 2020. Since that time I have written about some of the ""big topics"": racism, colorism, texturism, pay inequity, blackfishing (Google it), pet-to-threat syndrome, boundaries, microaggressions, greens, beans, potatoes, tomatoes, you name it. (#iykyk 😂) And I've had my content suppressed, and even sometimes deleted, more times than I can remember. I used to fight it. Occasionally I still do, but tbh I’m tired. Showing up and doing the work day in day out wears on one. Having to not only write, but also fight to be seen and heard adds another layer of static that I am simply not in the space to deal with. Sometimes self care looks like choosing the path of least resistance. 🙏🏾So though the algorithmic redlining still grinds my gears sometimes, I focus on putting my content out there, believing that whoever is meant to see it will see it. I do everything I can to give my posts the possibility of performing well, then I zen out and let it go. But make no mistake, just because I no longer actively spend hours of my life fighting censorship and shadowbanning doesn’t mean that I have given up. Like so many of my activist friends, I have decided that I will never remain silent, nor will I give any platform the power to silence me. ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾 I will continue to speak out–on my terms. Look around at the Black creators in your circle, look around at the writers, activists, educators you follow, and you will realize that most if not all of us have built our own table. Actually, make that plural. Tables. We have multiple channels where folks can reach us and connect with us if we are deplatformed. We have websites, patreons, courses, blogs, newsletters, subscriptions, communities, myriad social media accounts. Tune in to our channels. My channels include:✔️ My blog on happyhappyphoenix dot com✔️ The TGE blog on itsthegreatexhale dot com✔️ The TGE newsletter ✔️ And, of course, my private membership community The Great Exhale.Part of the reason why I built TGE was to provide Black women with a space where they can post to their heart's content with no fear of being suppressed, no need to code switch, and no problematic Uncle Algo to contend with. Everything I do is part of the work.P.S. For those of you who are interested in how to fight back against being suppressed or censored, I wrote a blog post about it a few years back that’s still relevant today, so I’ll drop the link in the comments. P.P.S.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-02-27,"Self-Care During Black History Month? Absolutely.Prioritizing self-care is revolutionary. Self-care is an act of resistance. ✊🏾🧘🏾‍♀️🤎Our ancestors did not literally slave and struggle only to see us continue to slave and struggle. So I invite you to celebrate Black History (aka History), AND take time to enjoy the present in a way that would make our ancestors happy. Many of them were forced to work. We can honor them by resting. We can honor them by doing less. We can honor them by treating ourselves with care and tenderness.As Audre Lorde said: ""Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.”  Inside The Great Exhale this is our main focus: self care as a revolt against all the isms; against the capitalist machine. Don't be fooled or distracted by the #SoftLifeVibes and what that means. When I launched TGE a few people became very upset with me because they read it as me being ""too soft"" and not being serious about the work. But this too is part of the work. Activism takes many, many forms.I'm super excited because today at noon eastern time we're having our monthly Collective Breath community check in. We're going to share. We're going to laugh. And we're definitely going to exhale. Can't wait. 😊🙏🏾💚🙏🏾😊 P.S. Bet you didn't know that the self-care as resistance movement started with the Black Panthers. Ask yourself why that part of history is rarely shared, and why the organization is presented in a pejorative way. P.P.S. Happy Presidents' Day to my forever President, Barack Obama.P.P.P.S. Want to exhale with us today? Join the community at the link in the comments.[Alt text:] Self-Care is an act of resistance.💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨😎🤎 Hi, I’m Lisa, and I provide Black women with a soft, safe space where they can finally take their cape off, take a breath—and rest.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-04-06,"RESPECT PEOPLE’S BOUNDARIES In fact, let’s start with: Respect people. Yup…let’s start there.Over on the clock app people are losing their minds and getting upset with Jackie Aina because (checks notes):1. She asked not to be called “Auntie.”2. They went ahead and called her ""Auntie.""3. She blocked them.I mean…what did they expect?This is how consequences work.This is how boundaries work.This is how #FAFO works.Earlier this year I disconnected from someone who seggsually harassed me right here on this platform. And they are upset with me because:1. I called them out on their tawdry keyboardism2. I disconnected from themAgain: what did they expect?I have also blocked/disconnected from quite a few ww who exhibited rude, extractive, and gaslighting behaviors. One of them actually made posts about how sorry she was and “she didn’t mean it,” etc. etc. asking people to intercede with me on her behalf and reinstate the connection. (Yes I have screenshots and receipts.) Um…no She meant it right up until I enforced my boundary.I confess that I do not always get it right. Definitely have a tendency to give people the benefit of the doubt. But once my eyes are fully opened, them boundaries go all the way up.At the end of last year - aka the year that almost ended me - I made a promise to myself that I would advocate even more strongly for myself in the spirit of self-protection. It’s been…interesting to see the response thus far. I also decided that I ain’t dealing with nunna dis, nunna dat, and nunna dem. #iykyk I think it’s working because a friend of mine told me (with love) “Your ‘no’ is legendary.” 😂😂😂 I’m kind of proud of that.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-03-27,"Y’all know what time it is! 😁😁 It’s #FootwerkFriday and we’re dancing into the weekend! 😁🎊 🕺🏾💃🏾🎊Recently someone asked me about the “why” behind my posting these dance videos. I know a lot of people *don’t* approve of them cause they’re not “serious enough.” But more importantly - to me, at least - a lot of people appreciate them precisely because they offer a respite; a break from the unrelenting too-muchness of work, of adulting, of the world.There is time for the serious stuff. In fact, most of us spend the majority of our time on the serious stuff: educating, advocating, showing up…often for free. 👀So on Fridays we take a break, elevate the energy, and dance. 🎊🕺🏾 It’s called #Balance. You will never convince me that after a long week of work people aren’t happy it’s over, no matter how much they love their job.Have a happy Fri-yay and a great weekend, y’all!!

Lisa Hurley,Female,2023-11-27,"I really want to post a happy ""it's the first of December"" post, but TBH that's not where I am mentally today. So I am doing what these companies advise us to do and showing up as my authentic self. And my authentic self is feeling sad.This year has been hard.It’s been one loss after another.It's been one betrayal after another.It's been one abandonment after another.People giving, but with shady intentions.People ""helping,"" also with shady intentions.People attempting to erase me in various ways. People offering, then backtracking over and over again.People siphoning and even outright stealing, material items and in other ways. Bonus points cause they smile in my face and think I don’t know.There must have been a sale on sheep’s clothing, cause the wolves have dressed up and shown up in force.I would love to trust people, but time and again they show their underskirts and it’s not a pretty sight. I truly would get it if all these experiences were as a result of interactions with strangers. But no. It’s been from people close to me. The boogeyman is not a rando. The boogeyman is someone you know.So why am I sharing this here? I'm sharing because this is reality not just for me, but for many. The details might differ, but the experience is the same. I’ve spoken to a few of my actual friends as well as some acquaintances, and everyone is going through it. Don’t let anybody’s social media presence make you imagine that their life is more sparkly than yours. Somebody once told me that they want my life, and I was like…are you sure? Cause all the wonderful stuff (and there is lots of wonderful stuff) comes with all this difficult stuff. You get the rainbows, but also the shards of glass. There is no escaping that.So companies: when an employee shows up and they’re not grinning maniacally, remember that they have a whole life that does not involve you and that that their life might be life-ing. Once their work is getting done, leave them alone. And if they are having difficulty getting their work done, don’t assume laziness. They might be struggling and in need of help. Choose to help.I’m sharing this because people have asked me several times to be a part of their (insert activity), and gotten upset with me when I have said no. But I say no because in about 97% of cases that I say yes, some foolishness ensues. I have no time or emotional bandwidth to deal with anything more. I just can’t.No Footwerk Friday post will be forthcoming today. I’m going to immerse myself inside The Great Exhale, which is truly a haven for me as well as my wonderful community members. I know that will help me feel better. If you have any words of encouragement for me, I would really appreciate them. Thanks. 🙏🏾",208,150,6,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAALAQ-4BbTBIZ2Xm2mreLTNxwBiRG9nz-Bs%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAALAQ-4BbTBIZ2Xm2mreLTNxwBiRG9nz-Bs&keywords=lisa%20hurley&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=35c961ca-9b86-4252-b8c5-ae5951921120&sid=YMH&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-01-27,"Monday truth: introversion and anxiety have me in an absolute chokehold. They're hiding under my headwrap, lol. 😂 But seriously, though. I push through for the good of The Great Exhale, but WHEW!! 😩 Business is kind of set up for extroverted personalities. The dudebros and others say ""lean into discomfort"" and I am in a full OG Michael Jackson Smooth Criminal lean. 😂😂Anyhoo, y'all know I like to share all sides of this social media life, so this is me sharing that sometimes it's hard. And that's ok; everything can't be easy. It can be hard to ""be loud"" and get out there when you're naturally quiet. The good part of doing hard things, however, is that you will grow. And grow I have. Since starting on this entrepreneurship journey more than a year ago, it's been growth on growth on growth. In the business, of course, but also in me personally. And evolution, though it might hurt at the time, is beautiful in the end when it is accomplished.A friend and mentor of mine advised me to actually go outside (😂) and attend some events, so introversion or not, that's what I'll be doing. So stay tuned. But pray for me. 😂This is also me sharing that in spite of finding some things hard you can still show up and be great. Be encouraged. Stay the course. You. Can. Do. It. 💚 Happy Introverted Monday! Drip: FeNoel X Target💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨😎🤎 Hi, I’m Lisa, and I provide Black women with a soft, safe space where they can finally take their cape off, take a breath—and rest.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2023-12-27,"In Barbados🇧🇧 we call New Year’s Eve Old Year’s Night, a cultural nuance I have always loved. 💙🖤💛💙 So I spent a part of this morning preparing to say goodbye to the Old Year. Baptizing myself in nature. Washing away the unwanted and clearing energetic space to welcome wished-for blessings. Anointing myself in gratitude; processing and releasing grief.🙏🏾🙏🏾Given how hard this year has been, and what is happening in the world right now, I cannot fully enter into the spirit of celebration.  Just being honest.And yet…I have hope.I choose to persevere.I know Whose I am.I will carry on.Calling jen-know-cyde what it is is not complicated. But life in general is.Holding space and offering light to others who are struggling with the nuances of life. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 It’s ok to feel joy for your blessings; it’s ok to celebrate your accomplishments AND to find that joy tempered by existential grief for your fellow man. I have no New Year’s resolutions other than to keep going. The plan is to keep showing up. The plan is to “walk good.” The plan is to give myself permission to fully live, thrive, and exhale.That’s it.I’ll probably do a standard Happy New Year post at some point, but for now I’m wishing that everyone is able to make peace with their Old Year. I’m wishing everyone acceptance. I’m wishing everyone grace. I’m wishing everyone safety. I’m wishing everyone support. I’m wishing everyone love. I’m wishing everyone joy.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-03-27,"Happy International Women's Day! As we take time to celebrate all women today - as we should - I want you to take a close look at this image. Do you see what I see? Even in this standard illustrated collage, the woman with the darkest skin is right at the back. Also, it looks like the same outline was used for all of the women, so there are no ethnic differences in facial features. One does not want caricatures, but neither does one want erasive homogeneity.As my sister Sharon Hurley Hall (she/her) said earlier today: ""#IWD could do with being a bit more intersectional and inclusive, don’t you think?""The theme for this year's IWD celebration is inclusion, but putting Black women at the back ain't it. If this is art imitating life, then life needs to change. Black women are tired of being pushed to the back.People have challenged me multiple times about - in their opinion - The Great Exhale being the opposite of inclusive. Not so. (I mean...who is doing the defining in this case? The people whose ancestors have spent generations excluding Black people and who continue to do so?) In The Great Exhale Black women are brought to the front. Black women are prioritized. Black women are celebrated. Our members know that they aren't there to check a box. They feel fully welcome, centered, and most importantly: included. I have been the Black woman in this image more than once. Pushed to the back so the powers that be can perform DEI and pat themselves on the back. I assure you that I did not feel included.My challenge to you is that if you are serious about ""the work"" then show up. Truly show up. Do your part to help the Black women in your circle and in your organization feel supported and prioritized. One way is to make it possible for them to enjoy a space like TGE where they are genuinely, not performatively, included. This month is IWD and next month is Black Women's History Month, so I'm inviting you to get involved in my #SupportABlackWoman challenge. Gift a TGE membership to a Black woman you know: in your company, in your family, in your circle. #OneGiftADay over the next 60 days would be awesome. There is no prize, lol. The prize is knowing you did the right thing.Support this Black woman-owned business, and support the Black women you know.

It’s the beginning of the year, and I guess I’m feeling introspective, lol. (*Long post alert*)I was scrolling through some photos from back in the day and they brought a smile to my face. This one stood out cause it triggered so many great memories. 😊 I was in Antigua representing Barbados in a Caribbean beauty pageant. (Don't recall the name, but it was organized by the Jaycees. It was like 5,000 years ago. 🤣) I was proud to do so, but very nervous. I was happy because my chaperone was my Mom. She has always been my P.I.C., so I was excited that we would get to share this experience. I remember trying not to smile in this pic cause someone had teased me about how huge my smile was. 😂 So this was me trying to look dignified. I remember feeling proud and happy because my Mom had made most of my outfits. She was Project Runway before it existed. (She won the battle of ""how high will the split be” btw. 😂). I remember doing my dance routine and feeling happy cause I had nailed it. 💅🏾 I also remember completely glitching out in the interview segment 🤣. That night anxiety and introversion won. But overall I remember feeling zen and contented. I did not win the crown, but I had truly done my best. So I was good. There were other contests that I had won (and that I would go on to win), but this time was not my time. And that was ok.So I look back at younger me with love and joy and grace.  🥰💗In terms of advice, I would tell her:💚 BE YOU. That’s your superpower. Don’t listen to dem people. Smile, dance, write, dress, BE however you want to be–unapologetically.💚 Embrace nuance and use greater discernment. Sometimes the vibe is “He who hesitates is lost” and at other times the vibe is “Doubt means don’t.” Pay attention to the signs.💚 In terms of people: trust, but verify. And verify. And verify. And verify. (Did I mention verify? 🤣)💚 Do it now. The time will pass anyway. If you decide, then execute.💚 Embrace your creativity. Your brain is a beautiful place.💚 Go where you are wholeheartedly celebrated.💚 Give, but keep some for yourself.💚 Take advice, but trust your gut.💚 Use what you already have.💚 Focus on your strengths.💚 Hold on to your magic.💚 Guard your heart.💚 Trademark that.💚 Let it go.💚 Say No.💚 Relax.💚 Ask.What advice would you give your younger self?

Now all of the people I have in mind have asked me not to name them publicly (which I actually applaud them for), so that is why there will be no #ThirstyTagging in this post. (Well...except for Jahmaal Marshall, who coined the term 😂)That said: sometimes you post on here and it feels like you're speaking into the void. It's very echoey. Hello-o-o-o? But it appears that people are reading and listening and paying attention. And I am immensely grateful. 🙏🏾Folks have shown up and offered practical help which I, as a solopreneur, am in need of. 💚 To the person who is helping with sales strategy: thank you.💚 To the person who helps in myriad ways behind the scenes: thank you.💚 To the people who have offered actionable advice--and a means to implement it: thank you.💚 To the people who have supported financially by blessing my PayPal: thank you.💚 To the people who have supported financially by purchasing TGE memberships for others: thank you.

Well I don't. Lolol. 🤣 I have some areas of expertise, to be sure. But the rest of it? Nah. Don't let my social media or anybody else's make you think otherwise. We are ALL in need of help and support in different ways.So my call to action this Black History Month is the same one I made last week: support Black people into success. Support those of us who are on a path towards building Black futures and hopefully one day making Black history. Don't wait until we blow up and then say ""I knew them when...""✅ Share, like, and comment--and also bless us with a check.✅ If you can't bless us with a check, then amplify us to those who can.✅ Offer your support, expertise, and services in kind.✅ Recommend us for equitably paid opportunities.✅ Mention our names to decision-makers (with budgets.)✅ Subscribe to our newsletters, Patreons, and other platforms.For me specifically, refer Black women in your life, circle or organization to The Great Exhale. Or buy them a gift membership. Closed mouths don't get fed, so that's my ask. P.S.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-04-06,"Finally getting around to posting my CanvasRebel interview that went live during Black History Month. Since every Month is Black History Month, I figure I'm not late, lol. ✊🏾 Thanks to Kristi Shah and the CR team for the opportunity, and to my good sis LaTonya Davis for the intro! 😊 Here's an excerpt. Please let me know what you think![CR:] What do you think helped you build your reputation within your market?[LH] As the Founder and face of [The Great Exhale], what has helped me most is being consistent and authentic. That means showing up regularly – not necessarily daily – but frequently enough that you remain top of mind. But that is just about being visible.Beyond visibility is purpose and contribution. You must be driven by a purpose deeper than “likes” and think about what you are contributing to your audience. I have shown up on LinkedIn almost daily for several years, and built my reputation brick by brick, post by post, one day at a time. And I have shown up authentically, sharing wins of course, but also sharing losses, reversals, struggles. People have to know that they are interacting with a real human being.Being focused and sticking to my lane has also served me well. I am known for writing and advocating around self care, pay equity, introversion, and a few other topics—and I stick to those. This helps to build trust and meet expectations. When I decided to found The Great Exhale it was not a surprise to anyone who had been following me for a while. It made sense for someone who is a Reiki Master, activist, affirmations expert, writer, and career creative to build a space and brand focused on healing and community care.Probably the biggest factor in building my reputation is doing what I agreed to do. One must be trustworthy and reliable. If you commit, then deliver.Link to the full interview is in the comments.#TheGreatExhale💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨😎🤎 Hi, I’m Lisa, and I provide Black women with a safe virtual space where they can finally take their cape off, take a breath—and rest.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2023-12-27,"For those of you who are really out here victim blaming Taraji, here are some actual facts and data from Luvvie Ajayi Jones. Please educate yourselves.And please ask yourselves why so are so committed to Taraji (and Black women in general) being wrong.Why?We keep sharing our lived experiences and backing it up with data, and you keep trying to ignore the statistics. Google Black  Women’s Equal Pay Day and then get back to me.Taraji has shone a light on a serious, systemic issue. Systemic, not individual. She is not suffering financially because she bought one red carpet outfit. She cannot (we cannot) “buy less Starbucks” our way out of this. 😑😑😑Pay equity is the answer. Or at least it is one of the answers. The reason why I so often say #FreeIsCancelled is because people love to profit from our magic, from our intellect, from our talent, from our labor, and leave us scrounging in the dust looking for pennies.No. Just…no.We deserve to be equitably compensated.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2023-12-27,"GIVE IT YOUR “SOME”. Cause tbh, who has the energy to give it their all? 🤷🏾‍♀️🤣Black women especially: I encourage you to give it your some. Do the least. #DivestAndRest. Exhale. The first few days of the year have already felt like a month. It’s been a lot. We are grieving for Dr. Claudine Gay. We are grieving for Taraji. We are grieving for ourselves. We are grieving for our careers. Not all of us, but many of us. We might look in the mirror and see Dr. Gay’s face instead of ours. We might also actually be celebrating Dr. Gay’s decision to recuse herself from the tomfoolery; from the professional l￥nch!ng to which she was subjected. But even in the midst of feeling happy that she is now “free,” there might be a wistfulness as we face the truth around why she was forced to liberate herself. Many others more learned than I (John Graham and Kimberly Bryant come to mind) have posted about the fracas between Dr. Gay, Harvard, and the prevailing “anti-woke” school of thought. If you have the bandwidth, take a look at their recent posts. It’s an education. I decided to not post. At least not for now. That is my version of giving it my “some.” It’s January 5, and I’m already exhausted. So in this moment, self-care for me looks like not jumping into the fray. And that’s ok.So this Friday, and whenever you need it, I encourage you to conserve your energy for yourself. Not for a company. Not for strangers on the internet. For you. Give yourself permission to do less. Give yourself permission to rest. Give yourself permission to give it your “some.”Give yourself permission to:🙏🏾 Relax.🙏🏾 Vibe out.🙏🏾 Meditate.🙏🏾 Have fun. 🙏🏾 Take a nap🙏🏾 Practice self-care.🙏🏾 Decline those meetings.🙏🏾 Say yes to yourself. Say it with love.🙏🏾 Say no to others. Say it with your chest.Happy Friday, y’all! 😊💃🏾#TheGreatExhale[Alt text/Image description: Light brown and light green letters on a dark brown background.

My goal is to provide inspiration tempered with the occasional reality check. I do try to focus more on the highs than the lows, but it’s very easy to get stuck in the mire. One of the ways I try to switch my brain onto a positive track is by writing down my wins, no matter how small. It reminds me that no matter how I might be feeling at the moment, I am talented, I am appreciated, I am a winner.Sometimes you have to remind yourself who you are. 💅🏾 Try it.Stop right now and write down 3 recent wins.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-01-27,"Hey y’all, checking in on you. As we would say in the culture: How’s your mental? How are you feeling? If you’re feeling good, AWESOME! 😁If you’re feeling not so good, hoping that this helps: YOU ARE LOVED! 😍💕🤗A friend of mine once asked why I focus so much on joy, on making people smile, on lifting people’s spirits. It’s because I am very familiar with what I call “The Pit of Despair.” And I know that when I’m there a kind word (or a funny meme - whatever it takes) can help me feel better, even if only temporarily. The goal is to make it to and through the next moment, the next hour, the next day, and so on and so on. The goal is to make it to the point where you feel able to find the help you need or receive the help you’ve been offered. One of the people I follow on TikTok to keep me in a sunshine state of mind is Mychal. He’s a beautiful human being who has mental health struggles of his own, but still makes time to encourage, uplift, and support others. I love it. So if your mindspace needs a cleanse, watch this video, and check out his account on the clock app. I promise you’ll feel better.As always, this post is for everyone, but especially for Black women, who are under attack now more than ever.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-02-27,"Plagiarism vs. Inspiration. Context matters. Nuance matters. So here goes:This pic dates back to the middle of the panorama. The whole point (like Halloween) was to dress up as your favorite Met Gala star with whatever you had in your closet at home. In other words, the publicly stated brief was to imitate someone you were inspired by. It's no surprise to anyone who knows me that I chose RiRi. 🇧🇧👑 So this falls under the inspiration category IMHO.Similarly, we all have the same Internet. We're all ingesting the same news, jokes, TikToks etc., so: nobody robbed you of your gif, beloved. Nobody took your meme. Nobody stole ""your"" article from Google. (Remember when everybody was posting about Chairmageddon? Or how everybody is now posting about the Grammys? Exactly.) That said, it is always a good idea, if you have it, to include the source of the content you share. Naturally there will be times when you genuinely don't know the source, but once you know it, state it. What does not fall into either of these categories is a post I came across earlier today - ""written"" by a ghostwriter no less - that was a 95% copy & paste from someone else's post. This person is actually being paid for writing that they did not do. What does not fall into either of these categories is copying somebody else's words verbatim. It's a definite no-no. I allow grace for humanness. Nobody is perfect. Sometimes one is in a rush, or one forgets, or the platform glitches. But it takes work and multiple decisions to copy/paste, change ""and"" to ""plus"", and then not tag/cite the original writer. One of my connections here had that happen to her recently - literally thousands of people stole her content, and went viral based on her labor and intellect. They had a lot of energy and precision with the copy-pasting, but couldn't keep that same energy when it came to citing the source. They deliberately presented her thought leadership as their own. Whew. As an editor, people have tried to pass off plagiarized content to me before, and I don't need an app to tell me that that ain't their work. Ma’am. Sir. I am not new to this, so I know. One day you can barely string a sentence together and the next you're sounding like a Lit. professor? C'mon now. 😂 I mean…nice try, but I ain’t fooled. But even if I did not have years of experience and an eagle eye, some of y'all need to know that there are plagiarism checkers out there and we use them. We the editors. We the writers. We the professors. We check your work.In terms of AI, there is nothing wrong with using it, but again: we can tell. If you don't make any effort to spice it up with your own flavor, all we're thinking is ""Wow, AI did a pretty good job."" 🤣 Please add seasoning. Salt and pepper alone won't do. Lawrys. Old Bay. Pesto. Hot Sauce. Something. Unseasoned AI copy is flavorless and obvious.P.S. A.I. = Act with IntegrityP.P.S.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2023-12-27,"Have you ever just responded ""ok"" to someone's diatribe? I have. Strangers on the internet have tried to embroil me in arguments, and I simply refused. I declined to engage. There are times where one should engage/defend oneself, but in so many cases it's not necessary. Pointless arguments are not worth your time and energy. People are gonna think what they want to think anyway. 🤷🏾‍♀️ I came across this post below on Stacey Patton, PhD's FB, and it spoke to me:""In 2024 I am going to chronically deploy the following phrase that I just read on one of my threads: ""You may now have the last word.""I absolutely LOVE this.It is an acknowledgment of Futility.  An understanding that the argument has likely reached an impasse.  Further debate is  unproductive and there is no genuine commitment to a resolution.It says, ""I am granting closure."" You are offering the other person the ""last word"" as a graceful gesture and you are resigning from the argument and you prefer the harmonious echoes of peace. It also says that you recognize that the compulsion for having the last say is a silent plea for dominance -- a choreogoraphy of control rather than harmony.Say it with me: ""You may now have the last word.""""Via Stacey Patton and Blair NashHere's to peace.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-03-27,"Black women are under attack, and have been for a long time. Stateside, across the pond, everywhere. It is devastating and traumatizing both individually and collectively. This is a longstanding humanitarian crisis. Like so many others of us, I will keep repeating this: we need safe spaces. This is why I created one. As it says in the groundbreaking Glitch Misogynoir Report: ""Without safety for Black women, there is no safety for all."" And if you don't understand that, you're part of the problem.Here's an excerpt: ""Black women have been shouting from the rooftops about this issue for not just years but decades. The writing has been on the wall for some time, but some have turned a blind eye to it. The truth is, online abuse has only become an issue since it began to affect the Global North. Specifically white middle-class women, and some men. But tech, governments, philanthropists, the media, the police and civil society all need to listen to and start centring Black women’s experiences online when shaping policies and legislation."" --Seyi Akiwowo, Founder of Glitch, whose mission is to end online violence and online hate speech against women and girls, and unapologetically centering Black women.The Glitch Misogynoir Report is a must-read. It includes an exposition of the current state of affairs, as well recommendations across industries and sectors for how to create policies, legislation, and corporate cultures that support online and real-world safety for Black women.Hat tip to Nova Reid for bringing this to my attention.

As I said to someone during the pre-launch phase: “It’s called The Great Exhale, not The Great Adrenaline.” 😂 🤷🏾‍♀️ I remained true to myself, trusting that the people who needed and aligned with the quiet community would find and appreciate it. And that has happened. 🙏🏾💚😊One of the TGE community members once said that she loves that there is no pressure to be constantly doing things.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-03-27,"Maybe if someone else says it y'all will listen: ""A lot of people offer someone unpaid work with zero return and that's raggedy."" -- Luvvie Ajayi JonesThe reason why I preach the gospel of #FreeIsCancelled (shoutout to Mita Mallick and Dee C. Marshall) is not because I have never done anything for free. It's because I have, and have been taken advantage of. And that, alas, is the norm. I have paid my dues and that era is over.One time I was summarily ""dismissed"" from a job that I essentially volunteered at for several months. I spent countless hours (often 4+ per day in addition to my 9-5) building on behalf of someone else because I believed in the vision. The MINUTE I asked for help because the workload became too intense, my email account was shut down and I never heard from them again.  The minute I said ""Why am I the only person on the team who is not being compensated?"" I was dispensed with.Alas, this was not the only time. There are situations (few, though) where uncompensated labor is ok. But it must be, as my sis Alexis M. would say, bi-directional and mutually beneficial.

Lisa Hurley,Female,2024-04-26,"True sisterhood looks like showing up, supporting each other, and giving each other room to shine. And that's exactly how Tuesday's LinkedIn audio room with my good sis Yinka Ewuola went. 💚💚 It was a mutual admiration society moment, and we talked in depth about the meaning of sisterhood, as well as how it intersects with money and mindset. Gems were dropped! 💎💎💎If you missed the live, take in Yinka's recap below, and make sure to catch her next audio event!#WhatYinkaSaid#TheGreatExhale",11,1,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAALAQ-4BbTBIZ2Xm2mreLTNxwBiRG9nz-Bs%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAALAQ-4BbTBIZ2Xm2mreLTNxwBiRG9nz-Bs&keywords=lisa%20hurley&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=35c961ca-9b86-4252-b8c5-ae5951921120&sid=YMH&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
