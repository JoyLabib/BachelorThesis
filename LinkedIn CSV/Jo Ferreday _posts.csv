Jo Ferreday ,Female,2021-04-27,"2020 saw people deprived of events of all kinds. Whether it was for business or leisure, we had to say goodbye.With the COVID-19 vaccines now being rolled out, it could see the return of physical events at some point in the near future. However, it would be unrealistic to think that events will be back in exactly the same way as they were prior to the pandemic. At least, not straight away. So, what can we expect from events and the challenges we‚Äôll face in 2021?#business #eventsmanagement #covid",110,70,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAABbHcIB3SyCQb7VIAo2lBjMtXlOwdNRlT8%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAABbHcIB3SyCQb7VIAo2lBjMtXlOwdNRlT8&keywords=jo%20ferreday&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=d964b2d3-ceaf-497a-8d9a-93e5bcaa15ce&sid=Ay1&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

They  believe that doing good is good for business, where commerce can be a driver for change.They've launched another mad world-first project to fund school meals in coffee growing regions around the world. Every bag of Lunch Box coffee they sell provides a meal for a child who needs it most.Paddy & Scotts Muchomba Project - KenyaThis award winning, ground breaking project was set up as a commercial joint venture with Paddy & Scott‚Äôs and a Kenyan smallholding coffee farm headed by George and Issac Muchomba back in 2017. Since 2017 the project has expanded to produce enough coffee to fill over 1m cups per year.The proceeds of the sale of this coffee has helped build a school, provide fresh running water, washing and sanitation facilities. They have also helped build a commercially viable supply chain that ensures Issac Muchomba‚Äôs children can carry on making a living from growing coffee for many years to come.  Currently, their farm project produces approx. 10% of the coffee they need to supply their customers, they are working on making that 100%.Sustainability wise there's some great efforts being made;Since 2004 all their coffee packaging has been made from aluminium free PET recyclable material. Their paper cups are compostable, their lids are made from corn starch and their coffee bags are made from compostable potato starch. Even our business cards are made from recycled crew t-shirts. All Paddy & Scott's deliveries from orders from their website are now Carbon Neutral. They do this by working with Shopify to calculate how much Carbon each delivery will emit and then funding several world leading schemes which take Carbon out of the atmosphere, to make sure the same amount of Carbon is captured. They fund this themselves and do not pass the costs on to their customers, as they believe this is the right thing to do and because they want their coffee to be a force for good in the world, not something that harms it!Their coffee tastes better because it changes lives. Literally.Why share all this info about another business instead of info about my own business?Why not? Didn't you read the first line of the post, do good things.

Everyone is on their own journey, it is so important to focus on the improvements of you and your team and do not compare to others, they have their own goals, aspirations.- Celebrate the wins! We always remember the negatives but its so important to celebrate the good things, it shows how far you've come.- Focus and a clear plan, life can get distracting - as much as I love this platform I've had to monitor the frequency and duration of time I spend on here of late.

I've also sought to understand what didn't go so well, made a plan for what could be improved and started a fresh the next day.  Years ago, a bad day would have turned into a bad week, month etc. Now its just a blip and something to learn from.Tackling situations independently - Rather than trying to take on multiple goals together, I've broken them down, tackling them independently then moving on to the next.Taking extra care of my health, fitness and wellbeing - After minor surgery earlier this year, I was forced to reconsider how I do/don't take care of myself. Found a diet that has worked wonders, am back to running every other day and am 3lb off shedding 2 stone that I've carried around for the last 8 years.Self Accountability - I've been clearer on WHEN I intend to achieve the goals I set for myself and the business has been a game changer. I've been holding myself more accountable and it is clear to see the positive change this has made.I haven't completed my full reflection of the year as yet, there's still just under 2 weeks left of our working month so we are still all hands on deck supporting our clients to achieve and plan exceptional events.What #goalsetting do you put in place for yourself and your business?#business #businesswomen #goals #businessplanning",26,6,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAABbHcIB3SyCQb7VIAo2lBjMtXlOwdNRlT8%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAABbHcIB3SyCQb7VIAo2lBjMtXlOwdNRlT8&keywords=jo%20ferreday&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=d964b2d3-ceaf-497a-8d9a-93e5bcaa15ce&sid=Ay1&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Not everything happens as I expect it to, however, this year, I made it a plan to focus on the importance of my health and fitness.  A goal I'm delighted to say I've embraced and for the first time in over 8 years have seen a positive change in every aspect, this I will be carrying forward to 2024.Time to be present: I have made this a priority daily, have removed looking at my devices past 9pm in the evening, instead opting to read.

Jo Ferreday ,Female,2023-09-27,"On this #worldmentalhealthdayWhat are you planning to do to make a positive difference?For yourself, for others?You see, each and every day (and not just this day).I have daily rituals I try to uphold.Since the lockdowns, these rituals have become my coping mechanisms with unknowns, challenges, grief and feeling uneasy about something.I try to listen to my body, recognise triggers.Reach out to support others.And retreat when I need to.I guess being an earth sign, I feel its important to feel grounded.I look at my goals daily, what are the challenges, what are the aspirations for the day/week ahead.I go for a run every other day around the park where I live, listening to audible (usually a business related book - currently working my way through Steven Bartlett Diary of a CEO 33 laws - highly recommend!).Me and my husband walk every lunch time, keen to get away from our screens albeit for 20-30 minutes.Time with each other, discussing hopes, dreams and goals really helps to refocus both our attention.Weekly, I take solace in my garden it is undoubtedly one of my happiest places and where I feel closest to those who are no longer here.Why am I sharing this here today?Because, in a busy hectic world where everyone has their own agenda.It's important to have coping mechanisms, its also important to be Intune with our own mental health and those we care about.It's so easy to neglect this way of thinkingYou may feel you're invincible but I genuinely believe its one of the most important things that you can do.So what are your rituals?

Sadly mom died aged 67, no age really.This is why I believe in trying to live my best life as much as I can because you never know what is around the corner.For any pointers on the best way to get diagnosis take a look here: https://lnkd.in/eS-_Q3zq#dementiaactionweek #dementiaawareness #missyoumom #dementia",14,9,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAABbHcIB3SyCQb7VIAo2lBjMtXlOwdNRlT8%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAABbHcIB3SyCQb7VIAo2lBjMtXlOwdNRlT8&keywords=jo%20ferreday&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=d964b2d3-ceaf-497a-8d9a-93e5bcaa15ce&sid=Ay1&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Jo Ferreday ,Female,2023-04-27,"#happymonday one and all!How often do you wake up on a Monday morning excited about what the new week has to offer you?It took me 35 years to get to that point.I never really knew what I wanted to do.I worked as a Junior secretary at a recruitment firm straight from college at 18.Then decided I wanted to become a recruitment consultant and spent another couple of years trying to persuade my existing employer that was the path I wanted to go down and they should train me to retain me!In the end an independent agency took me under their wing. The Sales Director at the time told me, if I did all their sales admin, she would train me up. She kept her word and I went on to be a successful recruitment consultant winning Young Business person of the year award age 21.All moments to be proud of, but I still couldn't settle, moved to a national agency and in the end decided after 6 years recruitment wasn't for me.Then I got bitten with the hospitality and events bug, my first ever role Junior sales exec for Birmingham City FC I'll never forget my first ever football match, the electric atmosphere and the wonderful clients who I'm still in touch with to this day.You guessed it, as much as I thrived in this environment I wanted to climb the ladder...my story goes on further.My point is every single role I've ever worked in, has lead to a stepping stone of where I am now. Years of experience serving amazing clients venue side.Has given me the experience and knowledge to serve Sheer Edge clients further.Not only that, some of the members of our team are from the hospitality and events industry, we have a group of #eventprofs who are as passionate about service levels as we are.I'm 7 years into my forever role, there's much to do, it's not been easy but it's exactly what I'm meant to be doing.To me it's way more than just a job. It's creating memorable experiences, exceptional events that last a lifetime.I've found my purpose and will continue to fulfil it until I'm not needed anymore and I'm hoping the legacy will continue without me.How do you feel about what you do?
