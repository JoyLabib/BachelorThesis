Jason Mayden,Male,2023-08-27,"I’m happy to announce my appointment at the esteemed USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy. As a Distinguished visiting lecturer in Product Innovation, I will be leading the creation and execution of academic and developmental experiences that unpack the intersection of cultural disruption and human potential. I seek to expand the definition of what is considered “possible” for people who have contributed to and shaped the past, present and future expressions of nuanced perspectives aka culture. I started as a kid from the Southside of Chicago, who wanted to design Jordans. Like Nas said, “I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up.” I lived my childhood dream and I have evolved into a person that wants to academically dissect and protect the progenitors of hip hop, sneaker and pop culture. Too often I see outsiders speaking about earth tone creators as if we are another species. Analyzing and deconstructing our existence. This has caused a chasm between those who create the vibes and those who appropriate the vibes. If you’ve been in the industry for a while it’s easy to spot the people who’ve made a career out of “cosplaying” earth tone people and our culture. Our sensibility, creative prowess and unique colloquial dialect is not a trend or a phase. It’s a zeitgeist that should be studied, revered and protected, vehemently. I plan on doing just that. With that said, all praise due to The Most High for the opportunity to serve, enlighten and inspire the leaders of the near future. Even more grateful to do this alongside my son Khalil C. Mayden who is a second year student at USC IYA. USC, you ready? We are about to get active. 💪🏾#FightOn ✌🏾#WeAreTrillicon",489,162,11,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAABCoUgB_cK37rbmBx2qjF-Y9bhwwbXfD4w%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAABCoUgB_cK37rbmBx2qjF-Y9bhwwbXfD4w&keywords=jason%20mayden&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=cb6d576e-b6f1-4598-925b-1ca0b3d88ce3&sid=mta&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Jason Mayden,Male,2023-05-27,"My first exhibition in 21 years, #BoysBreakToo was a massive success. We had over 300 people visit the gallery over the course of 3 days.

To book a viewing, visit https://lnkd.in/g_PHEYzg Thank you to everyone who prayed for me, helped set up, visited the gallery, shared a post, gave a hug, showed love, made space for others and opened themselves up to hearing honest discussions around mental health. I’ve overcome PTSD, depression and anxiety. I know how it feels to wake up everyday wondering if there will ever be a silver lining. I created this work during a period of uncertainty and unease. I’m still in a unique season in my life but I trust and believe in the power of my God given gifts and abilities. My heart and my ideas are in service of the “least of these”. I know God is making a way. So as you watch my journey, just know I’m living my testimony, right now, in front of the world. And when my bounty comes in, and the blessings flow freely, it’s God and God alone who gets the glory.

This one-of-a-kind showcase presents seven original multi-layered prints, digital collectibles, and commemorative merchandise, diving deep into the intersections of race, gender, and mental health through Mayden's personal experiences as a Black man navigating these complex issues.The exhibition aims to ignite conversations surrounding intergenerational trauma and the emotional suppression often faced by Black and Brown men, both young and old, as a means of survival. By showcasing Mayden's thought-provoking works, we seek to encourage constructive dialogue that fosters collective care, celebrates creativity as a form of healing, and raises awareness of valuable resources provided by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Cross-Cultural Innovation and Engagement Hub and the Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design.Supporting the Iron Sharpens Iron Initiative, a portion of the exhibition's sales will be dedicated to providing mental healthcare services for Black and Brown men in need. This groundbreaking program offers participants access to expert mental performance coaching and cutting-edge design courses, cultivating an environment of continuous growth, innovation, and skill development.We are proud to partner with SoLA Contemporary, a nomadic BIPOC, women-led arts nonprofit that serve as a cornerstone for cultural and artistic innovation. Whose goal is to advocate for change by empowering people from diverse backgrounds to take risks in their creative endeavors and explore the intersection of art, wellness, identity, and social change. Additionally, our digital collectible will be made available by Lockerverse, a community platform that integrates core creator tools to enable fans to access communities, merchandise, content, collectibles, and experiences from the creators and brands that define the culture. Our collaboration also includes JUICE, a black-owned startup offering an augmented reality e-commerce platform for unparalleled shopping experiences. Jason Mayden will be the first artist to benefit from this fully immersive customer experience.Join us in celebrating the extraordinary talent of Jason Mayden and engaging in critical conversations on the importance of healing and the transformative power of art.

Jason Mayden,Male,2023-06-27,"Fear is a powerful emotion that can either paralyze us or propel us forward. It's a common feeling when we're faced with the unknown or stepping out of our comfort zone. But what if we could harness fear to fuel our growth? In my journey, I've learned that fear can be a powerful motivator, pushing us to achieve our goals and defy the odds. It's not about eliminating fear, but about harnessing it to fuel our growth. So, what fears have you overcome in your career, and how have they shaped your journey? For me, overcoming fear has been about acknowledging it, understanding its roots, and then using it as a catalyst for action. It's about turning fear into a stepping stone rather than a stumbling block. So, the next time you feel fear, acknowledge it, understand it, and then use it as a catalyst for action. #CareerGrowth #OvercomingFear #DefyingOdds""",73,11,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAABCoUgB_cK37rbmBx2qjF-Y9bhwwbXfD4w%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAABCoUgB_cK37rbmBx2qjF-Y9bhwwbXfD4w&keywords=jason%20mayden&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=cb6d576e-b6f1-4598-925b-1ca0b3d88ce3&sid=mta&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Jason Mayden,Male,2023-10-27,"We have villianized curiosity in the modern world. If you are not “grinding” you can never be “great”. This obsession with performance has been the Achilles heel of the modern work force. We are literally “dying to make a living” as my brilliant grad school professor Jeffrey Pfeffer so eloquently documented in his book Dying For a Paycheck. When we allow our natural curiosity to lead us we find satisfaction and meaning, not only in our work but in our lives. I’ve outworked my peers for years and it’s cost me my mental health, physical health and emotional stability. It wasn’t until I ended up in the ER for the umpteenth time in 2019, that I decided to finally remove myself from the fallacy of grind culture. As a result, I have been happier, healthier and more successful.

Jason Mayden,Male,2023-06-27,"As creative #leaders, we all know the struggle of finding job security and satisfaction in a tough economy. In times like these, it's more important than ever to have a strong understanding of what we truly value in our careers. This is where Edgar Schein's concept of Career Anchors comes in.Career Anchors are the values and skills we hold most dear and are unwilling to compromise on in our work. By identifying our Career Anchor(s), we can make more intentional career decisions that align with our deeper passions and goals.Let's dive into the eight different Career Anchors, each with its unique values and skills. Perhaps your anchor lies in Technical/Functional Competence, where you pride yourself on your expertise and mastery of skills. Or maybe your anchor is in Creativity, where your artistic expression and innovation drive your work. No matter what your anchor may be, it's important to understand and embrace it fully.And why does identifying your Career Anchor matter? It's simple: job satisfaction. By understanding what truly drives you in your work, you can make intentional career moves that align with your passions and values. You'll find yourself much happier and more fulfilled in your professional life when you're working within your anchors.In these uncertain times, finding our anchor can provide us with the stability and clarity we need to feel grounded and confident in our careers. So take the first step towards finding your own anchor today.

Jason Mayden,Male,2023-08-27,"Just had a wonderful conversation with a friend, fellow believer, proud father, husband, and creative Jeremy Utley. Jeremy and I met at the Stanford d.School years ago and we immediately bonded over our shared faith and desire to want to be the leaders that we so often hear don't exist in the world. Kind, compassionate, and fiercely loyal to the greater good. Today's convo comes at a point in my life where I have very real choices to make both personally and professionally. Several unexpected opportunities have been presented to me as the reality of my day-to-day responsibilities looms in the background of my mind. I'm sure many of you can relate. I do not have the answer to which path I will take but I trust that my discernment and more importantly faith will reveal the path forward. If you are reading this, and you feel stuck, overlooked, undervalued, or struggling to make ends meet, I overstand where you are. As an entrepreneur, you have to accept the highs and the lows. The wins and the losses. Truth is, oftentimes, you are losing more than you win. 🤷🏾‍♂️ But no matter the current circumstance you face, just remember, that consistency is key and victory is inevitable. Keep climbing beloved.
