Leila Hurstel,Female,2023-12-27,"🇧🇭 As I power through the Ironman challenge in #Bahrain, I’m surrounded by a nation surging towards a digital zenith. The contrast is stark: while I tread past age-old souks, Bahrain is racing ahead with 80% of its GDP now coming from non-oil sectors, a striking 50% leap over the past decade. 🏊‍♂️🚴‍♀️🏃‍♂️ The country’s economy is pulsating with a 4.9% rise in GDP, and an even more impressive 6.2% increase in non-oil sectors. By March 2023, Bahrain had magnetized US$130 million in IT investments, laying the groundwork for 900+ new jobs within a year. With internet penetration set to soar by 99.5% by 2026, and a 35% growth forecast in the national IT employment sector by 2027, Bahrain’s transformation mirrors the endurance and resilience of the Ironman spirit. Interestingly, despite its name, around 20% of Ironman competitors are women, illustrating increasing inclusivity in sports. This mirrors Bahrain’s and the GCC’s progress in empowering women in the workforce and leadership roles. To all the incredible women out there, remember: your strength is limitless, your potential boundless. Just like in the Ironman race, you have the power to overcome any challenge and be a driving force in shaping a better future. 🏃‍♀️🚀#technology #innovation #future #digitaltransformation #gulf #gcc #travel #tourism #economy #sports #challenge #linkedin #leadership #triathlon #diversity #inclusion #womenempowerment #womenintech #leaders #entrepreners #middleeast",255,29,6,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA&keywords=leila%20hurstel&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e370354c-e9f6-4660-9d10-5d4eedb54bf8&sid=o~B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-03-27,"💡Jensen Huang unveils new Nvidia super-chip before robots come onstage - GTC keynote in San Jose ‘Everything that moves in the future will be robotic’A new processor design called Blackwell is multiple times faster at handling the models that underpin AI, the company said at its GTC conference in San Jose, California. That includes the process of developing the technology — a stage known as training – and the running of it, which is called inference.For all its success, Nvidia’s revenue has become highly dependent on a handful of cloud computing giants: Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta Platforms Inc. Those companies are pouring cash into data centers, aiming to outdo their rivals with new AI-related services. The challenge for Nvidia is broadening its technology to more customers. Huang aims to accomplish this by making it easier for corporations and governments to implement AI systems with their own software, hardware and services.Here are some of the highlights from the presentation:* Nvidia’s Omniverse software and services, which allow users to create digital twins of real-world items, is coming to Apple’s Vision Pro headset. Nvidia data centers will send images and video to the device, providing users with a more lifelike experience.* Siemens AG has integrated Omniverse into its Xcelerator industrial design software. Shipbuilder HD Hyundai will use the technology to save time and money during construction by building complete vessels in the virtual world first.* Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD Co. is switching to Nvidia chips, software and services throughout its operations. This includes using Nvidia for the electronic brains of cars, vehicle design and the robots in its factories. Omniverse also will be used to help car buyers to configure their vehicles.* Project Groot, consisting of a new computer based on Blackwell, is being made available for makers of humanoid robots. It will allow the robots to understand natural language and copy human movements by observing them. Developing such skills is “one of the most exciting problems to solve in AI today,” Huang said.* Johnson & Johnson is using Nvidia technology to speed up the development of AI-related software that will use advanced analytics in surgery.Huang concluded the event by having two Disney robots join him on stage, saying they were trained with Nvidia’s simulation tools.Check out the recap in link below 👇 #technology #innovation #future #digitaltransfomation #artificialintelliegence #robotics #semiconductors #bigtech #automation #spatialcomputing #digitaltwins",228,17,33,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA&keywords=leila%20hurstel&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e370354c-e9f6-4660-9d10-5d4eedb54bf8&sid=o~B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

This initiative marks a critical move to reclaim a leading position in the global semiconductor market. Additionally, the strategic partnership between Voyager Space, Airbus, and Mitsubishi Corporation to develop the Starlab Space commercial space station exemplifies Japan’s commitment to leading in the burgeoning space industry. The country’s tech startup scene is gaining momentum, fueled by government support and significant investments from firms like SoftBank in AI and robotics (Pepper robot, which can interpret human emotions )Japan’s embrace of industrial robots counteracts its labor shortages. I believe Japan’s deeply ingrained values of discipline and punctuality, evident in the national sport of Sumo wrestling, are vital cultural strengths that equip it well to overcome current obstacles and maintain its competitive edge globally.The highlight of the trip was attending the Suzuka Grand Prix 🏎️💥 with the Bybit Team, where speed and strategy converged.

It’s a striking metaphor for the rising influence of women in the crypto world.💡 Did You Know?Global Ownership and Leadership Positions: A study by Forex Suggest analyzed global cryptocurrency ownership and women’s roles in leadership positions within crypto companies. It highlighted that while there is a significant presence of female crypto owners in some countries, the overall leadership roles in the industry are predominantly male-dominated. The gender ratio among crypto owners is relatively balanced (53% men and 47% women). However, in leadership positions, 94% of CEOs in the crypto and blockchain space are male, leaving only 6% for women  . Furthermore, in the blockchain industry, only 5% of the workforce is composed of women, highlighting a significant gender disparity.📊 The Bigger PictureWhile there’s still a gap, with women holding fewer crypto jobs compared to traditional banking, the tide is turning. The Crypto Fight Night was a reminder that inclusivity isn’t just right; it’s smart.

Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-04-06,"🇦🇪✈️ 🇰🇷From the desert’s pulse in #Dubai  to the rhythmic heartbeats of #Seoul, I ventured, uncovering a tale of two cities redefining the future through digital innovation. 🌆 Dubai: The Luxurious Crypto CapitalThe #UAE’s economy is extremely diversified, with a focus on commerce, tourism, and finance . Dubai has become a hub for HNWI and crypto millionaires due to its favorable regulatory environment, attractive tax policies and golden visa policies , economic stability, high-quality lifestyle, commitment to #innovation and #technology, vibrant community for networking, and high levels of safety and security.🏯 South Korea’s younger generation find hope in crypto Home to tech giants like Samsung and LG, #SouthKorea’s capital is known as a Wi-Fi-enabled, tech-savvy city filled with futuristic skyscrapers and advanced technology from #renewableenergy to biotechnology, and semiconductor manufacturing. But take a closer look and you’ll find the Buddhist temples of old Seoul peeking through the concrete jungle like tiny buds. These peaceful pockets are havens of tranquility amid the frenzied city.Amid the advanced infrastructure and technological prowess of South Korea lies a youth-driven movement towards cryptocurrency and #Web3 technologies. Faced with a challenging job market and high living costs, the younger generation views these digital avenues as paths to independence and self-reliance backed by strict yet supportive government policies and a cultural warming to digital currencies.🤝 The Power of Partnership: UAE & Korea’s Shared Visions:South Korea has developed strong bilateral ties with the UAE since the 1980s, resulting in significant cooperation in various sectors. The partnership has notably impacted the construction and infrastructure sectors, with Korean companies playing key roles in major projects like the Burj Khalifa. A landmark of this collaboration is Korea’s construction of the first nuclear power plant in the UAE’s, aligning with the UAE’s Energy Strategy 2050 , symbolizing a united front in the face of global challenges.🍜korean Cuisine as a Cultural BridgeAmid this tale of innovation and partnership, the rich panorama of Korean cuisine weaves its own narrative. It’s a testament to the harmonious blend of tradition and modernity, mirroring Seoul cultural heritage and adaptive, forward-looking spirit.

Macroeconomic uncertainty and changes to monetary policy have challenged unprofitable private start-ups in recent years. Global VC funding, exits and tech company valuations have all plummeted from the highs reached in 2021, after major central banks brought an end to more than a decade of near-zero interest rates.While the top 20 high-growth start-up hubs have seen lower VC activity than more mature ecosystems, PitchBook analysts argue there is a possibility they could be the source of highly valued and successful tech companies in the future.“They’re in the stage of potentially creating that next wave of ‘unicorns’,” says Nalin Patel, a PitchBook analyst .He adds that these rankings provide a basis for start-ups or investors to consider less obvious locations when assessing where to expand into, target or launch a new fund. The growth of Dubai’s VC ecosystem has been helped by its development as a financial centre, tourism hub and popular place for businesses to domicile themselves in the Middle East region. More than 90% of all funds raised in the UAE since 2017 have been directed to start-ups based in Dubai, according to Dubai’s Chamber of Commerce. The anticipation of rate cuts following the elevated interest rates of 2023 has the potential to stimulate both global and regional venture investments. Furthermore, the prospect of a resurgence in M&A and IPO activity is on the horizon, propelled by stabilized interest rates and the availability of dry powder. 🧐Why Dubai Could Be Your Next #Crypto #Web3 #Metaverse Business Destination 🇦🇪: To date, Dubai hosts over 1,000 of the world’s leading crypto businesses.

(over 3 billion gamers! ) This allows players to buy Walmart physical goods directly within games. #Commerce Integration in #Gaming: This integration enables creators to sell physical items in 3D experiences across more than 20 gaming and interactive platforms. It represents a new monetization channel for developers and connects customers’ virtual and physical lifestyles.Developers can access Walmart’s Unity SDK to facilitate immersive commerce integration in their projects. This SDK makes it easier for developers to add Walmart’s commerce application programming interfaces (APIs) to their games.💡Over the next year, they will test a variety of experiences in virtual worlds that connect to commerce at stores and vice versa. In fact, they have already begun. Example :Earlier this year, they teamed up with game developer FUN-GI on House Flip, a mobile game available on iOS or Android, that allows players to renovate and sell virtual homes.

Leila Hurstel,Female,2023-11-27,"🏦💡I’m honored to have had the opportunity to speak at the BIT2023 event hosted by Khaleej Times in #Dubai. 🇦🇪In my panel, we discussed “Banking’s Bold Leap into the Digital Frontier: Merging Tradition with Innovation,” focusing on the integration of cutting-edge digital solutions into traditional banking frameworks.The digital banking transformation is accelerating driven by the advent of technologies at various maturity levels. The Gartner Hype Cycle for Digital Banking Transformation offers a structured glimpse into this evolution.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) sits at the Peak of Inflated Expectations, celebrated for its potential to disrupt traditional finance with blockchain-based systems that eliminate intermediaries. Customer insight analytics, low-code/no-code platforms, and Banking as a Service (BaaS) are also at the peak, heralded for democratizing the creation and deployment of banking applications and services. Traditional nstitutions are integrating blockchain for secure, transparent transactions; cryptocurrencies are establishing themselves as new investment vehicles; tokenization is revolutionizing asset management; NFTs are expanding into identity verification; and CBDCs are setting the stage for the next evolution of currency. Conversational interfaces and Roboadvisor 2.0 are advancing towards the Slope of Enlightenment, indicating a growing understanding of their practical applications in finance.Open banking strategies and real-time payments are further along this slope, demonstrating proven benefits and starting to realize their potential. Chatbots , the public cloud for banking and social messaging payment apps are also gaining clarity and acceptance for their ability to streamline operations and enhance customer engagement.Check below for more details 👇 As we embrace this transformation, the insights from Gartner’s Hype Cycle remind us of the importance of pacing innovation with practicality, ensuring that as we leap into the digital future, we do so with a strategy grounded in real-world value and customer-centricity.Events like BIT2023 provide a platform for these critical discussions, enabling us to collectively navigate the complexities of digital transformation in banking.

Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-03-27,"On this International Women’s Day, I want to spotlight the legacy of my 🌟Grand Aunt Sabah 🌟the “Shahroura” (singing bird). As a pioneering Lebanese singer and actress, Sabah was a symbol of empowerment and innovation in a male-dominated Arab music scene. Her vibrant persona and career, spanning six decades, challenged societal norms and inspired women across the Arab world with her powerful voice, charismatic presence, and fearless individuality.Sabah’s journey was emblematic of the golden era of Arabic music and cinema from the 1940s to the 1960s, a period rich in artistic achievement and cultural renaissance, particularly in Egypt. Her collaboration with leading composers and filmmakers, combined with her unique style and spirit, contributed significantly to this era’s legacy as a time of creative flourish.Drawing inspiration from Elbert Hubbard’s philosophy, “Don’t take life too seriously. You’ll never get out of it alive,” Sabah embraced joy and levity, reminding us of the importance of finding happiness in the moment and in the small actions that enrich the lives around us.On this International Women’s Day, as I honor the memory of Sabah, and reflect on the teachings of Elbert Hubbard, l find myself at the intersection of history and the future. Hubbard, closely associated with the late 19th and early 20th centuries’ Arts and Crafts movement, championed quality craftsmanship, the beauty of natural materials, and the importance of creating meaningful, beautiful objects for everyday life. This movement was a response to industrialization’s mass production, emphasizing the value of the artisan and the impact of good design on ordinary people’s lives.Sabah’s joyous spirit and Hubbard’s advocacy for craftsmanship remind us to embrace happiness and foster positive impacts in our daily actions. As we navigate the complexities of the AI era, these lessons are more relevant than ever. They encourage us to stay optimistic and innovate responsibly, ensuring that our advancements in technology, including AI and AGI, serve to enhance human lives and address pressing global challenges without losing sight of the individual human experience.Sabah’s resilience and Hubbard’s principles guide us to stop chasing happiness and instead choose it , inspiring us to make small yet impactful actions that improve the lives around us. Let’s start with small gestures, managing our moods and emotions, and being kind towards others, as we work towards a future that respects our shared humanity and the planet.Happy International Women’Day 🤍#technology #innovation #future #genderequality #leadership #lebanon #womeninbusiness #womenintech #diversity #inclusion #business #workculture #womenempowerment #entrepreneurship #entrepreners #socialimpact #art #culture #middleeast #egypt #mena #uae #dubai #philosophy #wellbeing #sustainability #linkedin #Industrialrevolution #artificialintelligence",116,15,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA&keywords=leila%20hurstel&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e370354c-e9f6-4660-9d10-5d4eedb54bf8&sid=o~B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-03-27,"🍏 From 1984 Mac💻 to 2007 iPhone📱 to 2024 Vision Pro🕶️: Navigating 40 Years of Transformative Tech Innovations!The Macintosh, introduced by Steve Jobs in 1984, marked a pivotal moment in computing with its user-friendly interface, challenging the status quo and setting a new standard. Its success, selling 50,000 units in three months, showcased the power of innovation. (was priced at $2,495, which is equivalent to $7,500 today)Fast forward to today, the Vision Pro emerges as Apple’s latest innovation. Priced at $3,500, it’s equipped to run both iPad and native apps, featuring a new operating system, visionOS, and enhanced screen-sharing capabilities. This positions the Vision Pro as not just a new product, but a potential catalyst for the next computing revolution, much like the Macintosh before it.Drawing inspiration from the Mac’s journey, we have every reason to be hopeful about the Vision Pro’s future. Its introduction is a testament to Apple’s ongoing commitment to innovation, suggesting a bright future for personal computing.As digital technology evolves, so does the concept of the Metaverse, initially imagined in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel “Snow Crash.” Today, it’s broadly interpreted across three main sectors: Meta’s immersive internet vision, the crypto-driven concept of virtual land and assets, and expansive multiplayer gaming worlds. Each interpretation highlights the Metaverse’s diverse potential but also its lack of a unified definition.Apple, known for simplifying complex ideas, proposes “Spatial Computing” to encompass AR, VR, and related technologies, steering clear of the Metaverse’s ambiguous connotations. This approach aims to unify the industry’s language, focusing on the technology behind immersive digital experiences.As we navigate these innovations, it’s clear that the principles of user-friendly design and immersive experiences that marked the original Macintosh continue to shape our digital future, highlighting the blend of tradition and innovation in tech evolution.💡🧐Confused about the metaverse and spatial computing? The guide below demystifies these concepts, explaining key technologies like AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), MR (Mixed Reality), and XR (Extended Reality), all of which fall under the umbrella of Spatial Computing.

Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-02-27,"🇦🇪 Investopia 2024: Charting the New Course of Global Investments! 🌍💼The global economic landscape in 2023 demonstrated remarkable resilience, with a growth rate of 3.1%, defying the odds against a backdrop of significant adversities including the swiftest monetary policy tightening in four decades, banking sector instabilities, and geopolitical unrest. The decline in global inflation, which outpaced expectations thanks to the easing of supply bottlenecks, a reduction in labor shortages, declining energy prices, and tempering demand growth, played a crucial role in this unexpected performance.However, despite the economic outperformance, consumer and business sentiment remained subdued, impacted by persistent cost pressures, a looming recession narrative, and the magnification of pessimistic views through social media platforms.Looking ahead to 2024, the global economic prognosis suggests a shift towards a “new normal,” with GDP growth projected to moderate to approximately 2.8%. This anticipated moderation reflects a year of subdued growth but steers clear of predicting a global recession. Various regions are expected to experience differing growth trajectories, with the U.S. projected at 1.8%, Europe at a modest 0.8%, and emerging markets at a more robust 3.8%, although China may fall short of its 5% growth target despite policy stimulations.

Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-01-27,"✅Bitcoin Spot ETF gets SEC Green light ! But price is not pumping yet !ARK’s Cathy Wood doesn’t expect sucess to happen overnight . she highlights that institutional investments will not be immediate due to extensive due diligence processes. Focusing on the long term, Kathy believes that even a small allocation (0.1 or 0.5%) of portfolios to Bitcoin by institutions could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price. This effect is amplified by the limited supply of Bitcoin, with only 21 million available, and many(15 million ) already held by long-term investors.Crypto Community’s Skepticism: Cathy acknowledges the skepticism within the hardcore crypto community regarding “paper Bitcoin.” She understands their concerns about centralization, which goes against Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. Encouraging Decentralization and Maturity of the Movement: Despite the initial centralized approach of the ETF, Cathy believes in and encourages a move towards more decentralization as the crypto movement matures. She expects that over time, investors, including institutions, will become more comfortable and possibly transition to holding their own wallets, aligning more with the core principles of Bitcoin.As she explains this is a new technology it's a new asset class there's so much to learn so this is a stepping stone in terms of access, bringing more people into the space . if you believe in the long-term prospect that Bitcoin is going to change the way we do Finance globally you need a couple billion people using it this is a way to do that . #technology #innovation #future #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #finance #investing #investors #traders #linkedin",57,10,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA&keywords=leila%20hurstel&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e370354c-e9f6-4660-9d10-5d4eedb54bf8&sid=o~B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-01-27,"💡 Sam Altman seeks to raise billions for network of AI chip factories - Abu Dhabi-based G42 and Japan's SoftBank Group are among the firms that have held discussions with the OpenAI. The 20th-century geopolitics were centered around oil; the 21st century’s geopolitical dominance is determined by technological supremacy. Like in the previous century, the U.S. is defending its turf against another superpower, this time, not the Soviet Union but China; “the new oil” is the chips necessary for the development of AI technology.Overview SemiConductor global supply chain in 2023In the recent past, the Covid-19 pandemic and global trade tensions highlighted the vulnerabilities of the semiconductor supply chain, causing chip shortages and disrupting production across various industries. As the demand for semiconductors continues to rise, governments and industry players are exploring ways to strengthen the resilience and security of the global supply chain. This includes diversifying production locations, investing in domestic chip-manufacturing capabilities and enhancing collaboration among stakeholders.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) remains the undisputed leader, holding a staggering 13% of the total market share in 2023. This dominance is particularly pronounced if we consider that TSMC provides foundry services only, with the company’s market share in the foundry business exceeding 58% in 2023. GPU developer Nvidia has boldly ascended to the second position in the global semiconductor market, with a remarkable 11% market share in 2023 and reaching a market capitalization of US$1.4 trillion.In the dynamic realm of semiconductors, China is making significant strides toward developing a robust local ecosystem. According to the SEMI World Fab Forecast report, China is expected to construct a staggering 18 new fabs in 2024.

Porsche’s innovative use of MR technology brought a new level of interactivity and engagement, allowing users to explore and interact with virtual 3D models in a real-world setting. Despite being early adopters of this technology within the automotive sector, Porsche is not alone in understanding its potential. According to P&S Intelligence, by 2030, the metaverse is estimated to reach a global market value of $1.5 trillion, with $16.5 billion of that coming from the automotive industry alone. Younger market groups currently make up the vast majority of metaverse users; when surveyed, 56 per cent of Gen Z respondents said that they would more likely purchase a car if they had the opportunity to experience it virtually first. However, as the digital affinity of all age groups increases, so too will their perceived relevance of metaverse experiences.Now that this application of MR technology has been proven, Porsche will continue to harness its potential to further enhance presentation experiences in a number of ways: hosting events with guests joining from separate locations (telepresence); increasing the sense of immersion with more complex models and animations; facilitating more physical interaction with virtual assets; and so much more.

Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-03-27,"💡Your metaverse identity, with its digital ID, biometric data capture, and behavior profiling, will be central to your every day life. 🧐What is The Metaverse Identity and why it matters ?!The metaverse aims to be the future of the internet – a spatial, social internet experience that uses existing and emerging technologies to seamlessly blend physical and digital worlds transforming how people interact with information, others and their surroundings. One of the central elementsin this advancement is “identity”.A recent report by the World Economic Forum and Accenture  by David Treat  and Daniel Dobrygowski  highlights the pivotal role of “identity” in this digital evolution. In the metaverse, our digital personas, encompassing representation, data, and identification, become central to our daily lives. This identity extends beyond mere avatars to include a comprehensive profile of our behaviors, preferences, and biometric data.Key components of metaverse identity include:	•	Representation: How we express ourselves digitally, from avatars to digital entities acting on our behalf, emphasizing the need for inclusive design.	•	Data: The complex analysis of user interactions by AI to create detailed profiles, which raises important questions about privacy and surveillance.	•	Identification (ID): Methods to verify digital personas, incorporating both traditional and new digital and biometric markers.The metaverse will also include digital entities like chatbots and virtual agents, enriching its social fabric. To build a safe, equitable metaverse, it’s crucial to learn from the internet’s past challenges, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure privacy and interoperability. Achieving this vision requires a collective effort from diverse stakeholders.⚠️ Yuval Harari raises alarms about the potential misuse of technology, especially regarding the collection of biometric data. At World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos in 2020, Harari warned that humans were no longer mysterious souls, but rather hackable animals that could be monitored and controlled by public and private entities in horrendous ways. He envisions a future where continuous monitoring of physiological responses could provide deep insights into people’s emotions and thoughts, leading to extreme surveillance and control. Harari warns that in the hands of authoritarian regimes, these technologies could suppress dissent and control populations more effectively than ever, presenting a stark caution against the dangers of such advancements.

Organizations need to foster a culture of inclusivity that goes beyond formal diversity programs. More mentorship, equitable treatment, and leadership roles for women.“While it is surely difficult to change a gender-biased problem that is not being quantified, companies globally are realizing the value that gender diversity can offer in AI.There’s still work to do, but a shift is on the horizon.

How can we ensure safety?!In 2024, hardware advancements are refining the AR and VR experience. From lighter and more comfortable headsets to improved haptic feedback devices, the technology is becoming more accessible and user-friendly. These advancements contribute to a more seamless integration of AR and VR into our daily routinesThe increasing integration of VR into our lives, particularly among children, is a double-edged sword. While it opens doors to innovative educational and recreational opportunities, it simultaneously exposes young users to unprecedented risks and challenges. The recent alarming incident in the UK, where a girl’s avatar was sexually assaulted in the metaverse, underscores the urgent need for robust safety measures.The incident has sparked a global conversation about the nature of crime and consent in virtual spaces. Unlike traditional video games where players expect certain scripted actions, the metaverse is a dynamic and unscripted environment, blurring the lines between virtual and real-world experiences, especially for younger users. The emotional and psychological impacts of such virtual experiences can be profound and long-lasting.Meta’s history of struggling to protect young users on platforms like Instagram highlights a systemic issue in digital spaces’ governance. The Online Safety Bill, aimed at safeguarding users in digital environments, is now under scrutiny for its effectiveness in addressing such new-age challenges.As we stand on the brink of this new era, where the next generation is poised to spend a significant portion of their lives in VR, it is imperative to redefine and enforce safety standards in these virtual worlds. Companies like Meta need to take proactive steps to ensure their platforms are not just technologically advanced but also safe and nurturing environments for all users, especially children. This includes implementing stringent safety protocols, continuous monitoring, and educating users about digital safety.🚨Watch below to understand how Interpol is diving into the #Metaverse to revolutionize policing!

This initiative represents a collaborative effort, bringing together the intellectual prowess of top Chinese universities and the technological expertise of industry giants like Huawei, Ant Group, Tencent, Baidu, NetEase, and Sense Time. Their goal is clear: to establish a robust and cohesive framework for China’s national metaverse platform.This initiative is part of a larger Three-Year Action Plan for the Innovative Development of the Metaverse Industry, which was unveiled in September last year. The plan, spanning from 2023 to 2025, is aimed at fostering the growth of the metaverse industry in China. It includes encouraging cultural sites like museums and art galleries to offer immersive digital experiences and prompting the TV and entertainment industries to create digital anchors for their audiences.A significant aspect of this initiative is the focus on establishing industrial standardization for the metaverse market. The MIIT has emphasized the need to formulate basic standards, such as metaverse terminology and reference architecture.These standards are viewed as crucial for building consensus among stakeholders, reducing redundant investment, and fostering collaborative efforts for industrial development.Last month, the MIIT also released a document outlining plans to clarify the development path of Web3, indicating China’s commitment to other aspects of the emerging economy, including the encouragement of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized applications.

During the COVID-19 pandemic Primo Entertainment had to adapt to continue providing entertainment in a changing environment. The company helped develop the Van Gogh Immersive Experience which was a huge success in Miami and over twenty other U.S. cities. Primo learned quickly from the success of the Van Gogh exhibition and realized there was an opportunity to exploit the concept by allowing soccer fans to walk in the footsteps of the most famous current player.The 75-minute experience begins in Miami in April, but Primo, Moment Factory and the Messi brand hope to bring it to over 150 countries, and all seven continents in the next five-to-ten years.

Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-02-27,"🧐Still  confused about the difference between Metaverse , Spatial Computing and Mixed Reality?💡 Decoding the Future:Dive into the heart of immersive technology with insights from Louis Rosenberg (article below 👇)Virtual Reality (VR)	•	Definition: VR creates a fully immersive digital environment that replaces the user’s real-world surroundings. It requires users to wear headsets to experience a computer-generated world where all they see and interact with is entirely virtual.Augmented Reality (AR)	•	Definition: AR overlays digital content onto the real world, enhancing the user’s environment with information or virtual objects visible through devices like smartphones or AR glasses. However, this digital content doesn’t necessarily interact with the real world in a physically realistic manner.Mixed Reality (MR)	•	Definition: MR combines elements of both AR and VR to create an environment where physical and digital objects coexist and interact in real time. MR allows for deeper interaction between the user and the digital content, integrating it more seamlessly into the user’s perception of the real world.Metaverse ( not mentioned in his article) 	•	Definition: The Metaverse is often described as a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality (including AR and VR), the internet, and digital economies. It represents a vast, interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds where users can interact with each other and digital objects in complex, immersive environments. Your digital parallel universe! Spatial Computing	•	Definition: Spatial Computing is a broader term that encompasses VR, AR, and MR. It refers to computing technology that enables humans to interact with digital content that is integrated into the three-dimensional space around them. Spatial Computing technologies understand and interact with the physical world, allowing for natural user interfaces that include gesture, voice, and spatial interaction.Rosenberg’s MessageRosenberg emphasizes the importance of understanding these distinctions to reduce confusion and foster clearer communication within the field of immersive technologies. He advocates for:	•	Clarity in Terminology: Accurately using the terms VR, AR, MR, and Spatial Computing based on their technical definitions and historical context.	•	Consistency in Language: The need for consistent and precise language when discussing these technologies, to ensure that the potential and capabilities of VR, AR, MR, and Spatial Computing are fully understood and appreciated.#technology #innovation #future #digitaltransformation #linkedin #metaverse #spatialcomputing #mr #vr #ar #digitaltransformation",37,5,7,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA&keywords=leila%20hurstel&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e370354c-e9f6-4660-9d10-5d4eedb54bf8&sid=o~B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Leila Hurstel,Female,2023-12-27,"🤔Should You Worry About Robotic Co-workers?🤖🦾Tesla robot ATTACK on engineer sent anxiety up A recent incident at a Tesla factory, where a robot inadvertently caused injury to an engineer, has sparked renewed discussions about the safety of robotic co-workers in industrial settings. This event highlights the challenges as robotics, driven by AI advancements, become increasingly prevalent in various sectors.The Expanding World of Industrial RoboticsAccording to EY, over 3.5 million industrial robots were operational worldwide as of 2021, a trend that’s only growing. Factors like labor shortages and inflation, exacerbated by the pandemic, are accelerating the adoption of robotics in industries from manufacturing to health sciences. The declining cost of robotics and the evolution of AI are making these technologies more viable and valuable for a wide range of businesses.Safety in the Age of RoboticsDespite their benefits, incidents like the one at Tesla and increased injuries in Amazon’s robot-integrated warehouses (has more than 750,000 robots deployed) highlight the need for stringent safety measures. The rapidity and strength of robots, coupled with potential programming misunderstandings, necessitate robust safety protocols, including proper programming, supervision, training, and workplace adaptation to accommodate these new robotic co-workers.AI and the Future of WorkAccording to the 2023 AI Employment Impact Report, it snatched up over five jobs in 2023: copywriter, voice actor, translator, police officer and customer service worker. The report projects AI will seize seven more jobs from humans in 2024: coder, paralegal, therapist, designer, telemarketer, retail assistant and news reporter. AI demonstrated great potential for replacing humans in 2023, and it shows no signs of slowing its rapid progress. A Goldman Sachs report says 300 million roles could be at least partially automated by AI — a whopping 8.8% of the world’s jobs.💡 technological advancements, while displacing some jobs, historically lead to the creation of new roles .Economist David Autor’s study, mentioned in the report, indicates that 60% of current jobs are in fields that didn’t exist in 1940, suggesting over 85% of employment growth in the last 80 years has been due to new positions created by technology.While AI is seriously shaking up the job market, it does bring with it some exciting progress,Goldman Sachs research indicates AI could boost the global GDP by 7% in the next decade.Share your thoughts 💬 what are the steps you can take to ensure automation won’t make you redundant at work ?! #technology #innovation #future #artificialintelligence #robotics #workplace #economy #Industrialrevolution #linkedin",35,5,4,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA&keywords=leila%20hurstel&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e370354c-e9f6-4660-9d10-5d4eedb54bf8&sid=o~B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-02-27,"🧐Do you think AI glasses 👓 is the future of the iPhone 📱?The Apple Vision Pro has been the talk of the town in the past few days, as regular customers have started using the spatial computer. Apple is preparing for the post-iPhone era, a world where AR glasses will initially supplement the iPhone to then replace it. We’re also witnessing the dawn of AI, with companies already envisioning non-phone AI-first devices. Like the Humane Ai Pin, the Rabbit r1, and the brand new Brilliant Labs Frame glasses. 💡Brilliant Labs Frame The Frame smart glasses developed by Brilliant Labs are a significant advancement in wearable technology, integrating a multimodal AI assistant named Noa. These glasses are designed to be lightweight and stylish, resembling the classic spectacles worn by iconic figures like Steve Jobs, but with the added functionality of smart technology. They weigh just 39 grams and are engineered to provide all-day battery life for their AI features.Noa, the AI assistant powering Frame, combines various AI models to deliver a range of functionalities. It can translate foreign languages in real-time, provide explanations about various sights throughout the day, and even generate images for the user’s view. The AI capabilities include visual recognition for describing objects, real-time text translation, displaying nutritional details for food, conducting live web searches, and generating images in real-world conditions through the AR lens. These functions leverage AI models from OpenAI and Perplexity AI for live web search, offering a new level of interaction between the user and their environment.The glasses come with a micro OLED panel that offers a 20-degree diagonal field of view and can support prescription lenses. They need to be connected to a smartphone to function, as the Noa app acts as the brain of the Frame, handling all AI tasks since the glasses lack an onboard processor. This design choice contributes to the glasses’ remarkably light build.Frame is available in Cool Gray, H2O, and Smokey Black color options and is priced at $349. Initially, access to AI features will be free with a daily cap, but a paid subscription will be introduced for extended use. The package also includes an accessory called Mister Power, a power bank for extended battery life, emphasizing the device’s practicality for daily use.The open-source nature of the software encourages customization and exploration by AI enthusiasts and developers, aiming to personalize the user experience further. The Frame, available for preorder for a tenth of the Vision Pro cost, brings an AR experience of personal AI, which is what we can expect from the iPhone down the road, once Apple’s GPTs and the actual AR glasses are ready. Until then, startups like Brilliant Labs should be on your radar.#technology #innovation #future #spacialcomputing #augmentedreality #artificialintelligence #digitaltransformation #linkedin #startups #futureofwork",32,9,5,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA&keywords=leila%20hurstel&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e370354c-e9f6-4660-9d10-5d4eedb54bf8&sid=o~B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

""My current thinking is I will probably do some passive investing, being a minority token/shareholder in startups in areas of blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI and biotech.""From steering Binance to exploring new frontiers! CZ swaps the CEO hat for a venture cap, diving into the DeFi deep end. Rest assured, under his watch, funds stayed SAFU , He pointed out that in their resolutions with the U.S. agencies they:- do not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, and- do not allege that Binance engaged in any market manipulation.As CZ steps back from Binance to explore passive investing, particularly in DeFi, the crypto world braces for another significant evolution. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs signifies a pivotal moment, similar to how gold ETFs reshaped the commodities market. This isn’t just another ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ scenario.

Just as these pillars lean on each other, maintaining balance and stability, the artists - Afra Al Dhaheri, Shaikha Al Mazrou, Mohamed Ahmed Ibrahim, Asma Belhamar, and Khalid Al Banna - combined their diverse talents to create a unified artistic vision.

Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-01-27,"👀Eye On AI: Valuations Are Not Slowing Down. 🤖 AI’s Exceptional Growth in 2023:	•	While overall venture investment slowed, AI was in a league of its own.	•	Generative AI and related startups raised a colossal $50 billion, per Crunchbase.	•	Giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection AI alone attracted billions.⭐️Dubbed the “Year of OpenAI,” 2023 witnessed a significant investor shift towards AI.Before looking ahead, it may be important to take a step back. Although 2023 may be looked at as the “Year of OpenAI,” investors started to warm to the industry in late 2022, when London-based AI-driven visual art startup Stability AI, San Francisco-based AI video and audio editing tool Descript, and Austin, Texas-based AI content platform Jasper all raised big funding.Then early last year, the round that shook the venture world — Microsoft’s reported $10 billion into AI titan OpenAI — set everything off and running. More than 70 rounds of $100 million or more went to startups creating models, providing infrastructure or applying the technology to a specific application in 2023.That also included rounds outside the U.S., as Paris-based Mistral AI and Germany-based Aleph Alpha — both OpenAI competitors — raised rounds at or near $500 million.💥 The heat in the market caused valuations to spike.	•	Last May, Anthropic raised a $450 million Series C led by Spark Capital at a reported pre-investment valuation above $4 billion. Then in October, Anthropic reportedly raised up to $2 billion from previous investor Google.	•	in early spring OpenAI picked up about $300 million from the likes of Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz at a valuation of around $29 billion.✨ 2024: The AI Investment Saga Continues:	•	Predictions of a slowdown in AI investments haven’t materialized yet.	•	ElevenLabs achieved a “unicorn valuation” with an $80 million Series B. (10x jump from a Series A)	•	Anthropic discussing a whopping $750 million raise at a valuation of up to $18.4 billion. (a 4.5x valuation jump in just about nine months. )	•	Toronto-based Cohere is in discussions to raise between $500 million and $1 billion at a “significantly higher” valuation than the $2.2 billion it hit just last June when it raised a $270 million Series C led by Inovia Capital.💡 AI Funding Dynamics:	•	2024’s AI funding hasn’t matched 2023’s frenzy but shows strong investor interest.	•	The rapid valuation jumps (4x, 6x, 10x) in under a year might ring alarm bells, recalling past venture capital missteps.🎲 AI’s Potential Path Ahead:	•	AI might navigate a different trajectory compared to sectors like crypto and Web3.	•	The industry’s future raises a critical question: 🧐 How many AI ventures can truly emerge as winners?#artificialintelligence #technology #innovation #future #venturecapital #investing #investors #startups #entrepreneurs #linkedin #futureofwork #workplace #digitaltransformation #automation #entreprise",27,4,7,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA&keywords=leila%20hurstel&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e370354c-e9f6-4660-9d10-5d4eedb54bf8&sid=o~B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Here’s what’s on the horizon:•	Reclaiming Data Sovereignty: The era of tech giants monopolizing your data could be coming to an end. Berners-Lee is championing data pods, a bold initiative to hand back control of personal data to individuals. This means your information could soon be yours to command across any platform, without compromise.Future of the Web :Web 3.0 vs Web 3 : The conversation touched upon the concept of Web 3.0, a vision of the internet where protocols like Solid enable a decentralized and user-empowered web. This contrasts with blockchain-based interpretations of Web 3 focusing instead on data portability and control.	•	Everyone will have a personal AI assistant which you can trust! Imagine having a personal AI assistant that knows you inside out, acting as your doctor, lawyer, and confidant, all rolled into one. Berners-Lee sees a future where AI seamlessly integrates into our daily lives, making every interaction on the web more personalized and efficient. He envisions a future where AI operates on user-controlled data, enhancing personalization and efficiency while safeguarding privacy. This represents a significant shift from current models where AI often relies on vast, corporation-controlled data silos. 	•	A Seamless, Immersive Web: The web is set to become more immersive and interconnected, blending virtual and mixed realities with our physical world. This vision promises a fluid digital experience that moves with you, adapting to your needs across devices and realities.	•	Impact on Big Tech and Future Predictions: Far from predicting the demise of current tech giants, Berners-Lee suggests that these companies can, and likely will, adapt to the changing landscape. The shift towards data sovereignty and ethical AI presents an opportunity for reinvention and realignment with public interest.🎙️ listen to CNBC  interview below to know more about the future of the web and Inrupt behind Solid protocol, from John Bruce, CEO of intupt , and Tim Berners-Lee.

With people working in-person, remotely, or hybrid, Zoom is helping users facilitate connection, productivity, and collaboration with their colleagues and customers. Zoom’s app on Apple Vision Pro provides users with a native experience for meetings, giving them exceptional audio and video quality, as well as the ability to easily start, join, collaborate, and schedule meetings.Apple Vision Pro users can look forward to a number of new features with Zoom on visionOS:* 		Personas: Users are represented by an authentic spatial representation of themselves in Apple Vision Pro, allowing other meeting participants to see their facial and hand movements.* 		Spatial Zoom experience: Zoom on Apple Vision Pro creates an immersive experience that can be scaled to the perfect size, which is ideal for users wanting to feel like they are in the same room as their colleagues and customers, without the need for additional physical equipment or setup. Additional capabilities for Zoom on Apple Vision Pro, expected to be available later this spring,  include:* 		3D object sharing: For some industries, like media and design, sharing 3D files is an important part of the workflow. While it’s possible to share these files on traditional screens, the experience will come to life when seeing objects in the context of an environment. For instance, an animator or game designer could collaborate and share the latest character model via Zoom’s 3D object sharing capabilities. * 		Zoom Team Chat: Team Chat is tightly integrated with Zoom Meetings and makes it easy to share information and connect with teammates. Apple Vision Pro users will be able to collaborate with colleagues and streamline communications using Team Chat in the Zoom app.* 		Real-world pinning: Users will be able to pin up to five Zoom Meeting participants anywhere in their physical space, with the option to remove the background of pinned participants, helping Apple Vision Pro users feel more connected to the people in the meeting.The features offered by Zoom on Apple Vision Pro could indeed make remote work not just a viable alternative to in-person work but, in some respects, a superior one.

Is this a betrayal of AI for humanity or a strategic evolution? 📈💡 Dive into the debate: Founding mission vs. Future vision. What’s your take? It’s possible to argue that commercial success does not inherently contradict ethical aims. With sufficient oversight and ethical frameworks, profit-driven models can fund research and development that might be too costly for a nonprofit structure, accelerating progress towards safe and beneficial AGI.Musk's lawyers said the tech billionaire was approached in 2015 by Altman and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and agreed to form a nonprofit lab that would develop artificial general intelligence for the ""benefit of humanity."" Musk Stepped away from OpenAI in 2018 . it’s easy to leave and then claim a departure from ideals, but the journey of innovation often requires navigating uncharted and uncomfortable territories. The real question may not be about betrayal or strategic evolution but about how we can establish a framework that accommodates growth while steadfastly adhering to ethical principles. The importance of open-source practices in AI development cannot be overstated. By fostering transparency and collaboration, open-source approaches enable a broader community to partake in, contribute to, and ethically steer the course of AI technology. This model resonates with the foundational aim of leveraging AI for the widespread benefit of society, in contrast to its potential confinement and control by a select few.This situation highlights the intricate balance required between securing the resources necessary for groundbreaking AI research and maintaining a commitment to the democratization of technology. The unfolding saga of Musk versus OpenAI is emblematic of broader discussions on the future trajectory of AI, raising pivotal questions about how best to balance innovation with ethical integrity and public benefit.#technology #innovation #future #automation #artificalintelligence #regulations #law #socialimpact #leadership #linkedin #leaders #buisness",24,5,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA&keywords=leila%20hurstel&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e370354c-e9f6-4660-9d10-5d4eedb54bf8&sid=o~B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

In a future where AI works and we all get universal high income, finding life’s meaning will be our new ‘job’.Labeling AI “the most disruptive force in history,” Musk said during AI Safety Summit in London a few months ago that the technology would have huge impacts on society—including the way we work.“We will have, for the first time, something that is smarter than the smartest human. There will come a point where no job is needed. You could have a job if you wanted to have a job, for personal satisfaction, but the AI will be able to do everything.”Musk isn’t the only high-profile figure predicting a future where we’ll all work less thanks to AI. Both JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon and billionaire investor Ray Dalio have argued the working week will be reduced massively once superintelligent machines start filling job vacancies.We won’t have universal basic income, we’ll have universal high income,” he argued. “So, in some sense it will be some sort of level up, or an equalizer, because everyone will have access to this [technology].”🤔How will we find meaning in life?! With AI taking over more tasks, we will finally have the time and resources to focus on being healthy, cooking at home, spending quality time with family, friends, and communities, and pursuing arts and various passions.

Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-03-27,"Investment Alert 🚨: Inflection AI's upheaval is a wake-up call for a crowded chatbot marketIn the fast-evolving AI landscape, the recent pivot of Inflection AI towards an enterprise business model, akin to industry giants like OpenAI and Anthropic, underscores a pivotal shift. As Microsoft opts for strategic hiring and licensing from Inflection, bypassing a full acquisition to mitigate antitrust risks, the message is clear: AI startups and their investors must navigate a new terrain. This scenario, where deep pockets and strategic moves of hyperscalers dominate, highlights the urgent need for startups to innovate beyond traditional funding and exit strategies. With antitrust scrutiny intensifying, especially from entities like the FTC, the era of easy exits via big tech acquisitions seems to be waning. This development calls for a reevaluation of how AI ventures and their backers approach growth and sustainability.⚠️💡 M&A remains the most common exit path for venture-backed startups. Most AI startups are unlikely to the public market, and would instead look to a merger or acquisition as the most likely exit path for investors to get the big returns they’re clearly counting on when dishing out cash at the current sky-high valuations.That path, though, has been relatively slow for VC-backed AI startups, Crunchbase data shows. Last year — despite all the hoopla and headlines concerning AI — actually saw M&A dealmaking in the sector decline 31% from 2022, with only 190 deals consummated compared to 276.Buyers in any market are turned off by peak valuations, and that still seems to be what the market is experiencing.Perhaps more worrisome to investors is the concern among some that the big winners in certain areas of AI infrastructure and applications likely will be well-established tech players like Google and Microsoft. That could leave startups — and their investors — scrambling for an exit in a market where there is no legitimate chance to compete.

Leila Hurstel,Female,2024-02-27,"🧐Is crypto on the rebound? Bitcoin has surged past $52,000, driven by strong ETF inflows and positive expectations for Coinbase’s Q4 performance. This marks a notable increase in market confidence and value, with some traders eyeing the $64,000 level in the coming weeks due to the growing demand from spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund products .Gold ETFs, in contrast, have experienced significant outflows of $2.4 billion so far in 2024, indicating a shift in investor preference towards cryptocurrencies. The spot price of gold has declined, further highlighting the increasing appeal of Bitcoin ETFs which have hit record volumes.After a tough year of scandals & collapses, optimism shines! Q4 2023 saw deal value soar to $1.9B over 326 deals, a first since Q1 2022.•	Limited Exits but Rising Optimism: The crypto market mirrors the broader startup exit drought, with only 12 exits in Q4 2023, marking the lowest number since Q4 2020. However, venture capital investment in crypto startups rose by 2.5% in Q4 2023 compared to the previous quarter, indicating a resilient optimism among investors.	•	Factors Driving Investment: Rising crypto prices, regulatory clarity, and other positive developments ( technological advancement and broader institutional acceptance-the entrance of heavyweight financial institutions like BlackRock launching a blockchain-focused ETF or Fidelity offering Bitcoin as an option in its retirement accounts signals strong institutional backing for cryptocurrencies), have contributed to a more optimistic investment climate, despite the low exit volume.	•	Shift to Tokenomics: The traditional VC exit model is evolving in the crypto space, with a significant shift towards token-driven liquidity events. This reflects a broader trend towards decentralization, community adoption, and building in public, which are increasingly considered vital for successful returns.	•	Long-term Orientation: Investors are adapting to the current market conditions by focusing on long-term opportunities rather than immediate exits.

Despite this, the sentiment among traders and market observers remains largely optimistic.Market analysts and commentators view the price retracement as a normal occurrence within the context of a bull market. Corrections of over 30% are typical, and a 10% drop, especially after a strong move to all-time highs with the majority of the supply in unrealized profit, is considered very normal.Cointelegraph article below reports a spike in liquidations as leveraged long positions were unwound, with nearly $300 million in BTC liquidations over 24 hours. Despite the sell-off, there was little indication of panic shorting; instead, the movement was mostly attributed to hedges taking profit.🎥Watch below Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy executive chairman bullish outlook on Bitcoin as he discusses MicroStrategy’s aggressive investment strategy, leveraging the company’s resources to gain substantial exposure to Bitcoin while navigating the risks associated with such leverage and the cryptocurrency’s volatility.Saylor firmly believes in Bitcoin’s superiority over traditional investment assets like gold, equity, bonds, and real estate, due to its digital nature, 24/7 tradability, global recognition, and ethical attributes.

Leila Hurstel,Female,2023-12-27,"💡Bitcoin’s 2024 Surge: More Than ETF Buzz! 💵 Fed Flips the Script:Change is in the air with the Federal Reserve’s policy shifts. By 2024, expect softer monetary tunes, making Bitcoin the sizzling hot ticket for investors hunting lucrative risks.🏦 Institutional Adoption: There’s been a notable increase in institutional interest in crypto since late 2022, particularly following major market events like the collapse of FTX. Regulatory actions against bad actors in the crypto space have actually boosted institutional confidence.Increased regulatory clarity is expected to transform the cryptocurrency industry from being predominantly retail-focused to one that is more integrated and appealing to institutional investors. Once  major institutional flows begin, the scale of investment in crypto will shift dramatically from billions to trillions of dollars, marking an exciting phase for everyone involved in the space.⭐️Halving Event Effect: The upcoming Bitcoin halving is key, historically triggering major price jumps. Tokenization of Assets: The trend towards tokenizing real-world assets is expected to contribute significantly to the growth of the crypto market. According to a report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and ADDX, the market for asset tokenization could reach around $16 trillion by 2030, which would represent about 10% of global GDP. This includes a wide range of assets such as equities, bonds, funds, art, real estate, commodities, and patents, and the current market size for security tokens stands at about $310 billion.📈 ETF Approval Effects:Imagine a Bitcoin ETF getting the green light. Boom! A floodgate of new users, and an express lane for investors into crypto. An SEC nod would be like a royal seal of approval, skyrocketing confidence among all investor types.⚠️ What If the ETF Bids Fail?Denied ETFs could spell temporary trouble with a price dip. But remember, true Bitcoin believers aren’t just fair-weather friends. They’re in it for the long haul!Multi-Chain Future: A future where multiple blockchain platforms coexist, similar to how various programming languages are used today. Each blockchain might serve different use cases and preferences.Like the internet’s gradual rise to ubiquity, the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies may take longer than initially anticipated but will eventually become commonplace. Additionally, the importance of developing user-friendly interfaces and systems is crucial in this transition, as it will significantly facilitate and accelerate the integration of cryptocurrencies into everyday use.👀 Crypto 2024 Forecast👇#technology #innovation #future #economy #finance #blockchain #crypto #defi #bitcoin #investing #traders #trading #linkedin #digitaltransformation",13,Comment,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADW-fQEBxoZ7Kp8oWOLrbMifwiIApjfDMrA&keywords=leila%20hurstel&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e370354c-e9f6-4660-9d10-5d4eedb54bf8&sid=o~B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
