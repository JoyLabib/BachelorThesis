Manny Medina ,Male,2024-01-27,"Lately, I have been shocked by the number of rookie mistakes I see in sales cycles.Mistakes like sending a pricing proposal over email without scheduling a meeting to review it first and get feedback, being single-threaded, needing to understand the paper process, and being selected vendor of choice without an agreement to make a decision.That’s just last week!One effect of the last 10 years and ZIRP is that “tenured” AEs, ie AEs with 5+ years of experience haven’t sold in complex selling environments. So even though these AEs are “experienced,” they don’t possess the mindset and skillset to sell in today’s environment.They sold at a time when- Everyone wanted to buy innovation- We didn’t need to advocate change, build consensus, and show value- Cool technology was enough- Being threaded was ok b/c pretty much anyone in the org could sign a $90K contract- If we didn’t work our pipeline, inbound leads would make up the restWe are now in a complex environment in which very few AEs are ready- Decision-making needs to be more clear- Shiny products alone don’t win the deal- Organizations may be making decisions out of fear, not opportunity. The old “no one gets fired for buying …” is back!And this is happening while the budgets for enablement and training are getting cut. So the burden of taking an AE who is experienced but new to this game falls on the manager.What is a Front-Line Manager to do?First, we all need to take work off their plate. Preparing decks for the forecast call or prep meetings needs to go. Forecasting should be automated, done by the AI, and only edited by the manager. If you are asking FLMs to enter forecast numbers manually, they are humoring you and not coaching their team.Second, stop asking the managers to aggregate reports from the 10 tools their reps need to use to do their work. Get a single platform where the reps can do the work and the manager can get the details of the activity, pipeline, and forecast.Third, use your CI tool as your day-to-day enablement tool. Whether you use the latest AI technology with real-time CI that enables the rep to be in the moment with live content cards (yes, like Kaia), or you use the more classic CI recordings, make time to ensure your reps are either listening to the recordings or learning from the live experience. No one has time to take reps off the field for long enablement sessions.Most organizations have a good playbook already. Review your playbook regularly with the team and share stories on how it helped in deals.These will empower the manager to spend more time with their reps teaching them the ropes and setting them up for success.What other tips do you have for FLMs to make more time for coaching their reps?“I done seen people f*#k up the whole team 'cause they couldn't play their position” - Big Sean",425,55,4,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-11-27,"By now, most of you have heard the news that Google and Yahoo are implementing new email requirements early next year. Of course, this brings up a lot of concerns and worries - is my organization compliant, will I still be able to send emails, what happens if my emails get blocked, how can I connect with buyers if I can’t email them? I’m here to tell you not to panic. And here’s why. - This is a good thing for our industry! Stale content doesn’t resonate. These changes will lead to more creative and personalized communications. At Outreach, we assist AEs and SDRs with personalizing content through a strong accounts-based view with context on open opportunities, notes, recent meetings, and more.- Outreach started as a sales engagement product. We have nearly ten years of experience helping reps build qualified pipeline that converts to revenue. This is our bread and butter and we know how to get the right message to the right prospect at the right time. We have the expertise to advise our customers and help them navigate any challenges they might face, and to guide them on other prospecting best practices too. Bring on the cold calls and in-person meetings! - It’s not the tool, it’s how you use it. Despite what some in the industry may be saying, there are no tools (AI or otherwise) that will ‘get around’ these send limits - just ones that help with personalization. In an economy where inbound leads are slow, sellers must be extremely targeted on an account level. By marrying intent signals into a singular account view on our platform, sellers are able to select the right targets and save that specific account view to focus on and for cross team collaboration. I take pride in Outreach being a customer-first organization. To our customers around the world, we are here to help you, we’re listening to you, and together we’ll have an amazing 2024.

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-04-27,"As CEO of Outreach, I see first-hand how AI unlocks the productivity of our customers' sales teams. But, we haven’t seen a definitive study measuring the impact of AI on sales teams.... until now. The Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California recently published a report called ”When and How Artificial Intelligence Augments Employee Creativity” in which they conducted a field experiment at a telemarketing company, and quantified the impact AI has on their success. To summarize the key findings (full link to full paper in comments):- On average, sales agents with AI assistance were 2.33 times as successful in answering questions they were not previously trained for and thus had to generate answers as their counterparts that did not have AI assistance. - The magnitude of this increase was even more pronounced for top sales agents—2.81 times that of bottom agents. This increased success in answering untrained questions is critical for AI-assisted agents to achieve higher customer purchase rates than those obtained independently.- The report also found that AI saves sales agents time and energy, enabling highly skilled agents to generate new answers to untrained questions and/or improve existing answers to trained questions, thus demonstrating greater creativity at work. Highly skilled agents also reported feeling “elated” because this changed work mode significantly helps and improves their work.- The report also found that this change in work mode results in a better mood, increased morale, and greater passion for highly skilled agents, all of which are conducive to workplace creativity. The implications of this report are significant for the future of sales. AI can be a powerful tool for driving productivity and innovation when implemented thoughtfully and strategically.At Outreach, Live AI is embedded at the core of our Sales Execution Platform, helping salespeople create and close more pipeline - in the moment!

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-07-27,"Talking to a dear friend this week - for those who know me, it was his couch in San Francisco I crashed on whenever I was solo-slinging Outreach door-to-door in the SOMA - and he asked me this question:Are you concerned about so many other players copying your Engage product? The answer is No. And here is why1- When anyone copies our product they are operating inside our execution loop. They are making decisions based on our insights - not theirs. So they don’t know the trade-offs or what’s under the hood.Matter of fact, many of the players selling Outreach competitors, use Outreach! And that’s ok, they are reverse-engineering our old thinking. 2- Using Outreach Engage as the starting point of a competing product, will only create derivative work. And it shows. First, no self-respecting engineer wants to work on derivative work. That attracts other mediocre engineers, designers, and product people. And on it goes.Second, derivative work will come up with incremental ideas that we have already thought about. When anyone copies, their bias is for better. Not for different.  So yeah, our Account workflows in Engage are the best in the market but I personally don't think they are the greatest. Does anyone really think we are not going to do anything about it? Seriously?!?  We got a whole LLM-driven Account-based workflow that is flying-cars stuff, coming up in December 💥  What I worry about is someone coming up with a completely novel approach at Go To Market. Something we haven’t seen before. That’s why we rolled up Engage into a single AI Sales Platform, because if I were to start Outreach from scratch today, that’s what we would build. “I'ma worry about me, give a F*@# about you” - Drake",272,30,8,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-10-27,"About once per month I sit down with our SDRs for lunchA question that comes up often is: how do you overcome the objection: “I am too busy to talk to you”Or I don’t have time for you. Or Not right now. I don’t have a silver bullet. Only lead ones :) If you are in sales, you are going to get hung up on.  If you are not getting hung up on, you are not in sales, you are order taking and your job will be replaced. Getting a lot of No’s is part of the job.The question stand’s. How do you deal with it?One of the concepts I rely on is pattern interrupting.  See, when someone answers a cold call they go into a practiced behaviour of turning the caller down and expecting pushback. It’s compulsory b/c most cold calls are bad. It’s automatic. Most people don’t even think about it. The brain is trained to recognize a situation and go into a pattern.  Patterns or behaviour are more efficient than thinking - it consumes less energy.So to win in this game you need to interrupt that pattern. So what do I do? I agree with the person I am calling! “Of course you are too busy, that’s why I called” This is an unexpected answer.  Most cold callers will try to argue that what they have to say is important and they should stay on the phone. To break the pattern. Agree that they are too busy - and then say - “that’s why I would love to book time this Thursday at 3 pm when you are less busy and have time for a quick 15 min conversation about trends in your industry”That will elicit either a “that works” or a “how about 4 pm”Either way you win.

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-07-27,"I get asked why we built a live AI assistant for meetings, Kaia?  Like everything else at Outreach, it all started with our own pain. By the time we wrote the first line of code for Kaia, we had tried all other Conversational Intelligence solutions, from the loud ones you hear about all the time to the ones that are not as popular. We found all of them lacking. These were my issues - my team had others - these are mine:First, adoption. All vendors asked us to go wall-to-wall to facilitate “sharing”. But then adoption was not great. When it was all said and done, only about 20% to 30% of the AEs and managers were using it.  Second, effectiveness. For CI to be effective, a sales manager had to listen to the most of the calls to pick up the nuggets of brilliance or the coaching opportunities. “You know what I need? I need one more thing to do” said no sales manager ever. Matter of fact, most of them are overwhelmed, under-resourced, jumping from deal to deal, and trying to stay on top of their 1-1s. So very few of them actually used recording to coach or listen to calls to begin with. Third, automation. For being built in the last decade, CI lacked real AI, or the I in CI. If you want to track important moments in the call, you have to manually enter them. To score a call, you have to enter the keywords you are looking for and then - wait for it - go back to the call and manually score it. Ain’t nobody got time for that.All these issues really bothered me. A great sales solution, solves problems, not creates more work. There had to be a better way. Out of nowhere came Abhi Abhishek into my life. He had a vision for a real time meeting and conversational AI that would be like having an assistant - always present, smart, and ready to help. To get this AI assistant to work and be helpful during the meeting - not just after, we had to invent a new technology:  Custom AIs. Kaia generates an AI assistant that is fine tuned based on your context, so that it’s accurate in its recommendations and specific to your buyer.And now with LLMs, this Custom AI extends to all areas of Outreach and your sales cycle. It shows up in your Mutual Action plan, in your forecast, in your deal health, and in your pipeline health, and soon in your sequences, templates, and emails. Why? Because sales is a unified cycle, not a patchwork of activities!  The investment in AI paid off. Kaia has 70% adoption and managers can at-a-glance see a summary of what’s happening in a deal and intervene only when needed.

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-10-27,"Ahead of this week’s earnings releases, I talked to a friend of mine, a founder and CEO of a public company about the tone at board meetings during FY24 planning.We compared notesAll conversations at the board are a version of this: “What’s the catalyst for us to get back to growth?” which is euphemism for “When is this sh*t going to be over?”The real answer is, “We don’t know”. We are CEOs, not fortune-tellers.  The answer isn’t “we are never going back” or “mid-next year.” We just don’t know. No one does. It would be disingenuous to say otherwise. The bottom hasn’t fallen out of tech yet. And now other sectors are being cautious, which creates extra friction in the sales cycle.This CEO and I talked about what we can control in the meantime. We can all agree that despite the turbulence and the unevenness in performance, we have a business inside our business that is a gem. A business that solves a problem for someone.  A strong market fit, even if the market it serves is under pressure or contracting. It may be a smaller business, but it’s a great business. A business that is delivering substantial value for customers and is worth a lot.  It has a strong team behind it, a remarkable product, and more predictable cash flow. This business is not obvious in the overall numbers for several reasons: we sold to the wrong early customers, churn and contraction, stalled deals, delayed collections, etc. it could be many things.But the truth is, that inside your business, there is a great business.  The question is, how do we pay more attention to this part of the business? Track it, focus on it, invest in it. And maybe deprioritize the rest. This is hard as it means saying no to good ideas, but the only way forward is through ruthless prioritization.Now is not the time to have 5 different strategies and see which one pays off. You need one strong strategy that has a great fit in the market that you can grow even in these times - even if slowly. Save those strategies for another time. They aren’t going anywhere, and the faster you prioritize your core business, the sooner you can get back to more experimental strategies.That’s what this CEO and I concluded was the best path forward. “When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal; you do not change your decision to get there.” Zig Ziglar",226,21,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Manny Medina ,Male,2024-01-27,"On his first day, I met Stephen Oommen, Outreach's new VP of Sales for the Enterprise and Strategic segments, and he dropped some of the best hiring advice. Here it is#1 Hire people who have a burning desire to succeed Like most things, this advice is simple and hard to do. And more importantly, it's really hard to copy.There are a lot of people who want to succeed - but don't want it badly enough, i.e., they don’t have a plan, don’t set goals, and are not up to making the sacrifices that it takes to succeed as an AE.It’s really hard to motivate people. You can help people find their greatness, but at the end of the day, people will need to want to be excellent and motivate themselves. It's far easier to find someone with a burning passion and desire to succeed and elevate their game.As Jim Rohn said. “Don't take ducks to eagle school.”#2 Hire SlowStephen reminded me of Price’s law and taught me how it applies to sales. Price’s law says that 50% of the work is done by the square root of the total number of people who participate in the work.Think about that.  Even if you have all the intentions of building a high-performing sales organization, you already have a law working against you!How do you beat Price’s law? To beat this law, you have to be incredibly judicious and deliberate in your hiring. You don't “scale” teams. This is hard. There is a lot of talent out there, and we need that production!  But take your time hiring, especially in a role as important as Ent or Strat AE. Enterprise reps are incredibly impactful. A deal brought in by an enterprise rep can change the company's direction.  But they can also sit on payroll and consume lots of cash. So a mistake here is costly.Doctor Jordan Peterson said, “As your company grows, incompetence grows exponentially, and competence grows linearly.” So take your time assembling a high-performing group of players.

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-11-27,"If you are in tech, customer retention is your top priority. You are either lucky if you get multiyear agreements right now – or you are the ONLY solution in your space. Here is what I learned from a Chief Customer Officer that is playing a strong retention game in the field right now. He starts asking for renewals 1 quarter after signing!  What!?!  Who does that? Well, this champion does it and wins. Here is why. If the customer says, “I like the service, I will renew” – then you are done! If the customer says, “No because I have problems with the service” – well now you have ample time to fix it and get the customer back to health and loving you before the renewal If the customer says, “No, it’s too soon” – then you have an opportunity to find out what their process for renewal is. So engage with your champion who bought you to determine the precise steps and timing to get a renewal executed before the contract ends. And now you have a roadmap. Voila!There’s a lot of noise on LinkedIn arguing otherwise, but I don’t know that any of them are out in the field playing right now.  Stay in the game friends. “A new cat sit back worth top dollarIn fact, touch minesAnd I’ll react like a rottweiler” - Nas",209,21,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Manny Medina ,Male,2023-10-27,"I’ve been comparing notes with investors about the meaning of the Clearbit acquisition by HubSpot and where we are. In times like this, it is good to pause to figure out what is permanent and what will change.The permanent thing is whenever you see a bunch of point solutions in a particular function, you will see consolidation.  Why?  The cost of the swivel chair tax of going from application to application to do a job will eventually overwhelm the slight benefits you will get from having point solutions.  As any function matures and the job becomes more understood, platforms start taking over point solutions.  This is what we are seeing in marketing automation.  Marketing automation has been around for a long time.  The assets you need to drive great marketing automation have also been around for a long time, so now you are seeing what I think is the beginning of a strong consolidation move around not only the platform that does the marketing automation but also the signals that come into the platform.  We will see the same things in sales, in that there are too many applications to do too few jobs, anywhere between 5 applications for 3 jobs or 10 applications for 3 jobs.  This must be rationalized into a single application to allow the entire Go-To-Market to do a single job.There will be disruptions - especially in #RevOps.  While consolidation in the short term is painful, the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term pain.This is exciting, especially for those that have a platform that is ready to go.  Once you go down the path of the platform, you can accelerate faster across all functions, making it easier for the end user to do their job, the organization to consume, and for RevOps and Enablement to drive change.",206,22,6,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Manny Medina ,Male,2023-10-27,"Was comparing notes with another CEO on retention plays.He was running a pretty tight ship. He had moved the engagement with renewing accounts from 1Q before renewal, to 2Q before renewal and was now engaging them at 3Q before renewal. Engaging 3Q before renewal, especially in 1 year deals, is the same as keeping the sales cycle going. It’s engaging the customer about renewals or expansion when they are still excited about your product. That’s exceptional! The question is then, what’s the offer to have a customer renew early? He tried everything Free months - gives them time to drive adoptionFree seats - expands the addressable personasFree service - belt and suspenders adoption Free months of new product - drives awareness of the full product suiteWhat are you trying?And we are all on the same boat.

Manny Medina ,Male,2024-01-27,"Executive presence is helpful to get promoted. But in sales, executive presence is essential.Not sure why we don’t talk about it.People buy from people.  You never get a second chance to make a first impression.Our first job as a seller is to instill confidence in our customers and prospects.Don't ask why this is. That is counterproductive.Accept it as a human trait and figure out how to use it to your advantage.In the latest survey published by HBR (link in the comments), they break down Executive Presence by Gravitas, Communication, and Appearance traits.When it comes to Gravitas, confidence and decisiveness are the two strongest traits you can exhibit to show up like an executive. The third one is inclusiveness! This one is refreshingly surprising because it is all about respecting others, listening to learn, and authenticity. In communication, superior speaking skills and command of the room are clear winners. What’s new is command of the “zoom”. Not sure how you command a zoom but I better learn quick :) And finally appearance is all about a polished look. Whatever this means to you, because the second trait is authenticity. So you want to be polished but also be yourself. I am still seeing baseball caps on sales calls on zoom and that is detrimental to the ability of the seller to be taken seriously. Don’t hide under the comfort of a cap. Demonstrate your confidence and professionalism. Show that you came to play. Command the space.

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-11-27,"How are you different than [insert your competitor]?Most sellers don’t deal well with competition. Here is my take.Talking badly about your competition is the fastest way to lose trust with your customerHere is a better way to answer the question“They are a great company. I know people who work there. They offer a good product.  But here is how we are different.” Notice how I said ""different"", not “better.” You don’t want to play that game. If your prospect is considering them, they must be doing something right otherwise they wouldn’t be in the market. Saying you are “better” loses credibility. To establish how you are different, follow these 3 steps Start with your WhyYour company has a mission that’s most likely different from the competition. So say it.  Ours is to Empower every sales professional to unlock their full potential.  And we do that through workflows and actionable insights.Next, give some concrete examples of how that Why shows up in your solutionWe would follow with “That’s why, for instance, we invented real time enablement for our Conversational Intelligence solution - Kaia vs just call recording analytics. Because we believe that the best way to unlock the fullest potential of the sales rep is in the moments that matter. And no moment matters more than meeting with a prospect or a customer.”Next, talk about the kinds of customers who use your solution “Kaia is used heavily by companies with multiple products to ensure all their reps get the right answers to the customers' questions right when it matters on the call. Instead of relying on memory or taking the reps off the field for training and enablement.The kinds of companies that are our customers believe in empowering their reps and giving time back to the FLMs by equipping both of them to be more successful and not just relying on listening to calls to coach.”Last, close with your difference“The kind of companies that don’t use Outreach have a different philosophy than we do. They expect the sales managers to do the heavy lifting. We believe managers are already overwhelmed to have to do one more thing.”And that’s it. As a seller, it’s your job as a trusted adviser to your customers.  And as a trusted adviser, you need to know all products in your marketThat’s how you provide adviceYou don’t want to “win” over the competition.

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-04-27,"People often talk about the challenge of Technical Debt. But what doesn’t get enough airtime is Organizational Debt. When you’re early and you’re growing fast, it’s natural to add programs and people to help you grow. But you never get a chance to step back and say “If we were to build our company from scratch today, what would we build? As a product? As an organization?”Company leaders need to build the muscle of asking themselves this question regularly.   Every time you go through a planning cycle, you need to assign 20% of your resources to looking at what got you where you are today, and determine what’s not going to serve you as you go forward. Another useful tool to rethink your organization is zero-based budgeting. But budgeting is just the outcome. What’s useful here is to rethink your people, organization, and processes. What’s required is for leaders to regularly rethink their entire organization - so that you can execute on strategy moving forward! And this is the most important thing - the organization needs to serve the forward strategy, not what worked in the past!Unfortunately, this can’t be a bottom-up approach, because people will naturally choose incremental changes. To drive real change, you first need top-down direction and then to work from the ground up on implementing that. At Outreach, we’re 100% focused on our platform strategy.

PGT is sacred and you should reserve your best hours of the days and best days of the week for that activity.And because PGTs are sacred, you need to come prepared.

The winning opening are those with an insight about your prospect’s industry that your prospect was not expecting and will benefit from it.You can only do that if you understand the market, use their terminology, and trends.If you are prospecting into public companies you have a treasure trove of data and earnings reports (stick to 10Ks) that tell you exactly what the company cares about. For private companies look at their press releases to see the narrative they are putting out into the world. Spend time on their blog. Do more than just reading the homepage.  Go deep.  If they are in tech use layoffs.fyi to get a sense of how they are doing.Use this information to create a point of view on your prospect’s industry.  Come up with a few hypotheses of what’s important. Write them down. And then test them in cold calls. The ones that get you a meeting are the winners.Here is the step no one does.Record yourself opening up a cold call and delivering that advice.  Most of us have never listened to ourselves talk, so we don’t know what we sound like.  Most of us do not use the right pauses and tone in our voice to ask a question.The first time you do it you will not like what you hear. And that’s the point.Your job after doing all this research is to sound confident and calm in a cold call or a first meeting. If you don't, all this work is a waste.So practice!Practice your intonation. Your pauses. Practice your responses to challenges. Practice sounding confident and calm.People can tell when you are confident and know what you are talking about from your tone of voice. So make sure you have this covered.Next up, prospect research“Getting paid is her forteEach and every day, true player way” - Blackstreet",163,17,5,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Manny Medina ,Male,2023-10-27,"Over 10 hours per week!That’s how much time each member in our Revenue Operations team has saved after we deployed the single Outreach platform to our entire Go To Market organization.You already heard we cut out 8 hours of meetings for all reps and managers and gave that time back to selling and working with customers. For RevOps it was over 10 hours! How? Let’s break it downFirst We run our ""run the business meetings"" for sales processes - that is forecast, pipeline, deal management - out of Outreach which has reduced the manual chasing of information on a weekly basis and eliminated a number of meetings that the sole purpose was to roll up information - 6 hours per week per RevOps team memberSecondAbout 2x per month RevOps  gets an escalation from Sr leadership about the state of our business (ie a large deal fell through where is our forecast) and we are able to deep dive on our own. For example, looking at forecasts and diving into individual deals. Use deal health score to identify pull forwards, Kaia to understand risk in a deal, scenario planner to understand risk to the forecast. Outreach is the same system of action as it is for inspection, the RevOps team saves a day's worth of escalation and work for the team - 8 hours 2x per month = 4 hours per weekOutreach also saves sales manager time because we can run this inspection on our own - I'd say about 2-3 hours per occurrence, 4-6 hours per month for a sales manager.That’s 10 hours per week! We don’t have accurate time study data on these additional benefits, so I am just going to leave them here and not count them- Self service data inspection vs needing to go to BI.Reduces time for enablement of the organization and prepping for process changes - Data - single system of action means single system of data. Not having to stitch together, or work with BI, to stitch together data from multiple sources.- Rolling out sales plays - instead of building an end to end playbook - we can build sequences, Kaia cards, and inspect the teams usage of those - like Unleash follow upThis is our gift to RevOps - the real heroes in GTM.Question for my RevOps brothers and sisters - what will you do with over 10 hours back? Work out? Pick up knitting? Become an influencer?

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-05-27,"True customer delight comes from surprising customers with something unexpected that changes their life for the better. Successful entrepreneurs must envision “what must be true in the future” – and then take risks in the present to make that future a reality. That belief (and a lot of hard work) will help you invent the future.  The further out into the future you envision, the higher the customer delight. And the higher your differentiation and competitive advantage.When we founded Outreach, we said to ourselves, “there’s no future in which all of the workflows for salespeople won’t be automated” – and then we brought that into the present by inventing workflow automation for sales engagement. It was years ahead of its time, and to this day continues to delight and deliver immense value to our customers. We’ve been on a similar journey with AI. It was about 10 years ago, when we said to ourselves “in the future, there’s no world where every B2B salesperson doesn’t have an AI assistant to help them close more deals.” Once we believed in that future, we began to bring that work on solving that problem in the present. Our early AI work focused on two axes:- Natural Language Processing - we want to help our reps understand everything about the language of sales; - Data mining and optimization - understanding all of the patterns and variables in rep workflows in order to optimize their day, close more deals and make them more successful. Today, the entire Outreach Sales Execution Platform is powered by AI. We bring in all of the transactions and conversations between reps and customers – that’s 33M interactions per week from across our 6,000+ customers over 83 identified workflows. We then harness this data to inform and train all of our models – NLP, gen AI, pattern detection models – which are more valuable over time because of the sheer amount of data training them. What’s more: we’ve delivered Outreach KAIA (which stands for the Outreach Knowledge AI Assistant). KAIA uniquely understands sales conversations between buyers and sellers and makes suggestions to the rep in real-time during the meeting – not after the call. It also automates all of the post-call actions to close the deal.KAIA is an AI-powered virtual assistant, making sure every rep is always on point, and performing at their best. With KAIA, new reps ramp faster, sellers run more productive meetings, and managers gain unprecedented visibility and insights into their deal pipeline. Our vision of an AI assistant for sales reps is now a reality today – faster than even we imagined. And, we’re just getting started on our AI journey. We can’t wait to show you the future of sales.",144,2,6,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Manny Medina ,Male,2024-02-27,"Sales has a #rigor problem. And we’re going to have to tackle it together. A few weeks ago, I met with a group of CROs to discuss the biggest challenges their revenue organizations are up against in 2024. And this was THE major theme.Think about it. For decades, Operations, IT, Finance, Supply Chain Management, and HR teams have been expected to execute their jobs in a disciplined, consistent, and process-driven manner. But revenue-generating teams have not been held to the same standard because the process didn’t matter as long as enough people hit #quota.2024 is a different animal. Sales cycles are more complex, there’s more scrutiny on every purchase, and there’s a renewed focus on profitability. The teams that lack discipline around revenue generation are being exposed and are underperforming.In the past there have been a few options to help us out of this situation:- Raise quotas- Hire rockstar sales leadersBut companies can’t raise quotas right now because reps will leave and though it may have worked in the past, you can’t hire your way out of this. So what’s the solution? We need to execute a better PROCESS that allows us to measure execution and see where we need improvements. That’s what we’re solving at Outreach.We give teams the tools and the insights to design, measure, and execute their #workflows.Stay tuned for more - this is the first of a series of posts I’ll be sharing over the next couple of weeks on the power of workflows.#WorkflowEvolution",136,12,5,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Between feeding them, cleaning up, getting them out the door, and preparing for work, we try to find time to connect as a family and discuss current events. This morning, we were discussing how quickly generative AI is advancing. I was reading a paper explaining how ChatGPT has solved the Theory of Mind problem – which is the ability to understand other people's thoughts and feelings – and something that was uniquely human.Pretty incredible… Except, as we looked at each other over our dirty breakfast plates, my wife said: “Yeah, but can it help us do dishes? Can it fold laundry?” We laughed. Of course, I’m a big believer in AI. But this was a funny reminder that even as fast as technology is advancing in some areas, we still haven’t solved so many problems or jobs-to-be-done for millions of people.

Manny Medina ,Male,2024-03-27,"#WorkflowEvolutionThe #NoDecisionEpidemic is contagious, and it’s already made itself comfortable in your workflows. This was a major topic of discussion at Outreach’s GTM KO. One of the causes of both new logo CAC and expansion costs going up is what I call the “No Decision” Epidemic. It makes the new logo problem even more infuriating, when you see the number of deals going to “No Decision” climbingI have two ideas on why this is happening. One you can control and one you can’t.Let’s start with the one you can’t control:The market for mid and small size tech companies hasn't quite turned around yet. Most large companies are buying from the large software players because they’re playing it safe! So, smaller companies (us included) are having a harder time getting customers to a decision. That’s why you are seeing #Nasdaq going up, but only the #FAANG - or the newer #MATANA companies are the only ones gaining.Great excuse, we can’t do anything about that. However, the other one you can control: Closing has gotten significantly harder. There are more stakeholders, more people that can say no and fewer that can say yes. In addition to that, if you’ve read books like the Jolt Effect, you know that even if you are the selected vendor of choice, there is still inherent risk of indecision when it comes to moving forward.In this environment, you need to move a deal forward in micro-commitments and build on each other and build momentum towards a close. Anthony Iannarino’s 10 Commitments do a great job outlining what all deals go through.Not all paths are linear - some may set you back, but each commitment has to be gained before you can reduce the risk of “No Decision” enough to commit a deal to the forecast. This is why consistent, reliable workflows are a necessary part of your sales strategy. Workflows will get you through these 10 Commitments with a closed deal at the end.",119,5,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-12-27,"Let’s talk about prospecting. You are prepared. You made your list of contacts. You know the company you're prospecting. You know a lot about each prospect you are about to call. You already sent them a few articles about their industry with some trends and predictions. They already know who you are.You practiced your opening line. Your first five seconds. And because you shared relevant information with your prospect, which you are about to share on this call, your confidence level is up.  You did your research, and you are ready to go! The goal: get your prospects to give you 30 minutes to share what you have learned from talking to other executives in your prospects industry. Easy? No. Terrifying? Yes.One of our biggest fears - after public speaking - is the fear of rejection.   And you will get rejected.Rejections will not roll off your back. Irrespective of what everyone else says. When you are cold calling, you are not in control, and rejection will attack our basic human need to feel accepted. In short, it will hurt.No easy way to recover. Some people will be outright rude and make you mad. Some will lower your self-esteem and will make you second-guess yourself.  Here are a few tips on how to get over the first few knocks. Don't take it personally. Imagine your prospect having a bad day. After getting rejected, take a  break and spend a minute feeling empathy for your prospect. Then, move on to your next call. Work with a buddy. Nothing like having someone else go through the same experience to validate what you are going through. It’s far easier to process rejection by talking through it out loud with someone else. Get into a state of gratitude. It’s hard to be thankful and upset at the same time. Try it. After getting rejected, spend a few minutes being thankful for what you have and get yourself to a state of gratitude that will help you prepare for the next call.Or un-training.  Funny story: I participated in a dial power hour with my team in London, reaching out to European prospects in Europe. The names of the people I was calling didn't come easy to me, and out of politeness, I kept starting my calls, repeating the prospects’ full names. It took me a few hang-ups to realize that no one opens a conversation like that. I felt stupid. My SDR colleagues looked at me with a smile; we all laughed a little and got back to calling. In your journal, document the rejections, objections, brush-offs, and any other reflective negative responses. In your quiet time, come up with great answers for each. There is only a finite number of ways people can tell you “No.”  After a few weeks, you will see that these rejections will start sounding the same. This means that you can start planning your answers in advance.Start winning more often, regain your confidence, get your confidence back, and start booking meetings. “You just remain asCalm as possible,Make the deal go through” - BiggieOutreach #prospecting #sales",99,7,4,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Manny Medina ,Male,2024-03-27,"#WorkflowEvolutionI had a great time today with Peter Kazanjy at The Mega SKO - The League of Extraordinary Sellers MSP Summit discussing how workflows are becoming the backbone of successful revenue organizations. If you missed it, follow the link in the comments.2024 is different from 2023, which was different from 2022. And this is why we’ve been feeling like we’re trying to hit a moving target. We can’t go by our old playbooks anymore. For the past two years, we've been getting pressure and questions on Customer Acquisition Costs. That's because the market was paying more for profitability and growth. That changed. Growth at any cost was fun, until it wasn’t – and this data from Morgan Stanley shows that. The market is paying the cost of growth. Even if you are slightly unprofitable or or moderately profitable, you're getting paid more for that growth unit than you were in the past. And if you're highly profitable and you're not growing, you're actually getting paid LESS. Profitability and growth are non-negotiables. Just ask your board. So how do we manage this tension? We have to generate #pipeline. Two years ago, the expectation on AE’s generating pipeline was 25-30%. Now, it’s 50%. We’re seeing more and more sales leaders focus on processes that ensure they are getting the most out of their pipeline generation programs. And because we are moving away from measuring pipeline in the form of meetings (or even opportunities), we’re moving toward measuring pipeline from opportunity to closed/won. The best way to do that is with measurable #workflows.""More money, more problems, gotta move carefully"" – 50 Cent",97,8,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Manny Medina ,Male,2024-03-27,"#WorkflowEvolutionEvery time I engage with a revenue organization to try to troubleshoot what's going on, the best place to start is mapping out the entire sales workflow.Everybody has a sales playbook or a sales process, but a sales workflow allows me and the rev gen organization to get on the same page on what activities need to happen between creating pipeline, managing those deals, closing pipeline, and then forecasting that pipeline.When you map out a workflow, you map all the activities in a visual context. THAT’S where it becomes clear exactly when the activity stops, and the team doesn't have a good way of reengaging with a customer or moving forward.I’ve included a standard New Logo sales workflow, along with the most common inefficiencies. You can see that the workflow for pipeline generation for an AE, it stops at an objection, a no-show, or a gatekeeper – even though they may have a playbook.In this particular case, our customer was able to look at the gaps around objection handling and create a playbook for it so that the workflow doesn't have to stop there, but you can re-engage or utilize an objection handling playbook or you can put him back into marketing automation.But I haven’t mentioned Outreach yet.We're here to help organizations make sure that they are achieving their maximum revenue potential. That is our goal. We’re on a mission to unlock their full potential – and they can do that with or without Outreach... it’s just a lot harder without :) But we wanna make sure that that vision gets executed out there.Outreach is committed to creating and providing technology that closes the gaps and ensures that the workflows continue to flow from opportunity to creation, to management, to forecast and closing because that's what we're here to do.But our goal is to ensure that everyone gets a chance to be successful whether they use Outreach or not.

Low adoption has a real cost. Below is a chart w the simple math for a tool that promises at 25% improvement in sales. 👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾Let’s say that improvement shows up in Attainment - it could show up in many places along the funnel, but for simple math let’s just say Attainment.

Not log-ins. Actions! Each quarter, for a team of 100 sales reps, with average quota, the average team burns $25K for each point of adoption, or $100k per year!Low adoption has many causes:- Sales leadership is not committed to the change and doesn’t help drive it- Poor onboarding - Lack of a Center of Excellence to help drive results from the application and adopt best practices- Bad user experiences- RevOps teams aren't resourced to implement new tech or provide continuous trainingSome of these issues belong to your vendor partner, some of them belong in our teams, most of them belong to both of us.

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-04-27,"Last night’s BUILDFest Pitch Challenge was truly inspirational and gave me hope for our future.I spent the evening judging business proposals from teams of 14 and 15 year old students across Bay Area public schools.   It was so heartening to see all these budding entrepreneurs from different backgrounds – Black, Latino, Asian – all working together to come up with some pretty incredible business ideas. And, let me tell you, their pitches were awesome. They brought their A-game, and left it all on the field. Their faces beamed with pride as they explained their ideas to the judges. You could feel their passion. They truly cared about the problems they were solving. And they cared about each other.  This gives me so much hope for the future of America. We live in a land of opportunity for all. We just need to step up, and take a risk. One of the reasons we founded Outreach, was that we fundamentally believe that Sales is empowering and can be transformational to people’s lives.Entrepreneurship is another form of sales. It's another way of taking an idea, from nothing into something, and selling it to someone else. By solving somebody else's problem. By caring for somebody else. By working as a team and bringing forth a solution as a team.So, I hope everyone reading this finds your entrepreneurship spirit. Go out there and sell something. Change somebody's else's life.

Manny Medina ,Male,2024-01-27,"One of the biggest mistakes you can make as a first-time first line manager is to confuse empowerment with abdication, trust with neglect. This is how I see it happen. A high-performing seller gets promoted to a leadership role. Not wishing to offend his former peer AEs, especially the very good ones, new first-line managers hesitate to ask about prospecting activities and meetings set.Because we shouldn’t have to micromanage. We don’t care how they get the outcomes as long as they get them. Right? Wrong! So what are we as leaders to do? Get curious about peopleAsk the rep, what are your goals? What are you here to do?Sales is all about achieving our goals, in your professional life and in your personal life.Spend more time getting to know the whole person, not just the rep. That’s the first step to get that athlete to perform at new levels she was not expecting to perform at.Fix the short-term with process and workflowsWhen you break something complex into easy steps, the hard and difficult starts feeling more achievable.So instead of asking for more pipeline, get agreement to spend an hour at the same time every day making dials. And then check in at the end of the day to ensure the activity happens and talk about the results. Is that micromanaging? Sure! And it’s also what a coach would do to improve performance. If you follow that with discipline and consistency, results will follow. Guaranteed! Focus on the long-term The number this quarter is important. But as a manager, turning a good individual into an exceptional performer… that’s the reward. And you will not find that reward in your forecast application. You will find it in caring about the rep.The good news is that on Outreach you can check on your team's progress, individual progression, calls and meetings, sentiment, likelihood to close in one place. So you can dial down micromanaging and dial up your coaching!

Manny Medina ,Male,2024-04-13,"#WorkflowEvolutionAt Digital Now, I got to discuss workflow evolution and what it means in the face of AI. There is a lot of AI Noise in the market, and Outreach happens to be part of it. Every company is promoting AI tech but their value isn’t automatic for revenue teams. In the past, AI had mostly meant pattern recognition and had been used to predict outcomes. Predictive AI has been successfully incorporated into most applications and has become table stakes for modern sales tools, but its insights are not particularly actionable.Generative AI like GPT exploded onto the market with high expectations. This technology can do amazing feats like generate emails and summarize meetings - and that saves a ton of time!.But it doesn’t elevate sellers or highlight a clear path of action for REVENUE teams after that email has been created or that call summarized. It's a great general administrative AI tool, but it doesn’t indicate where you are in the customer’s journey.To incorporate the right AI into your processes, you need a thorough understanding of your workflows. THAT’S where AI will elevate and unlock your team’s full human potential and the power of your workflows.In the future, sales-specific AI will do a number of pieces in the sales process to free the seller and manager to do quintessentially human things like coaching, working the deal, having meaningful conversations, progressing the deal, and deepening commitment. Automation will free up the administrative headache so sales people can do what they do best: sell.How AI can improve sales workflows: - Predictive AI understands what could happen next and provides the next best actions to reduce the probability of a bad outcome (like an objection or a no show) and improve the probability of a good one, like next steps. - Generative AI allows us to enhance the human to human communications and to do the mundane and manual work for the seller - like giving live guidance during calls and meetings, summarizing calls and auto generating post call coaching, and following-up with prospects or customers.The more complex the situation, the more AI can help sellers to drive workflows. Now, sellers are free to focus on the core job of selling, of being change agents, and really being trusted advisors and buyers’ agents to their customers. Free or generic AI solutions in a GPT wrapper will likely not be the answer, you’ll need an AI partner that is specific to your processes. Obviously, I recommend Outreach, but as you explore your workflows and the AI landscape, the RIGHT AI solution is what will make the difference.Workflow isn’t just another fancy buzzword you should adopt because it is trendy, they are the path forward for revenue organizations to be profitable. Workflows are the baseline for your 1-year, 3-year, 5-year sales strategies and the earlier you establish them the better. Outreach is here to be your tool AND trusted advisor throughout your revenue journey.",83,7,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAI6asBj7bk7_dFZi9f_KiLF8r8TMn9KsY&keywords=manny%20medina&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e77daa49-2e5e-4047-bb55-e4865756eb34&sid=ZU(&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Manny Medina ,Male,2023-12-27,"Last time we talked about account research as the way to become a trusted advisor and develop  your account strategy. Next is prospect research. But first, a PSA. Prospect research is NOT prospecting and doesn’t build pipeline. Prospecting is the only way to build pipeline. Prospect research prepares you for a great prospecting session.Selling is the art of leading change. Most change is against the status quo. As a matter of fact, in every sales organization I have researched, over 50% of their close-losts are to No Decision. Prospect research is about figuring out your plan of attack to drive change. The goal is a change from the status quo to your solution. Most people in sales have been taught to find a decision-maker and reach out to them. That’s wrong. There is no such thing as a decision maker but a group of people who surround the decision maker who can’t agree with what the problem is, a desired end state, or who the right partner is to solve the problem.  The first step to drive change is to build a coalition of believers inside the account.So this is what we need to get done to identify everyone involved: - Understand who are the decision makers and decision shapers- Understand their motivations- What do they know? What do they believe is true?- How do you change that perception?There are lots of public sources to get you well down the journey. Referencing their LinkedIn profile is a start, but the pros go deeper. They re-read posts to see what the prospect takes the time to post or comment on. They see if the prospect posts on X (unlikely by now). Look at their company job postings - those are the company bets. Look what their CEOs are saying publicly. For extra points, call people formerly in the function at the company you are selling to and have moved on to a different company. They will give you time - people love to talk, and no one does this! As Zig Ziglar said, there are no traffic jams on the extra mile.  This is where most sellers go wrong. Prospecting research and prospecting is continuous throughout the deal cycle. It doesn’t end when you open an opportunity. And as you get closer to a decision, decision shapers will come out of the woodwork. The more important your deal the more people will attach themselves to that decision. Be ready. Don’t ignore them. Most companies just need one No for your deal to stall or die. Understand who they are, their motivations, and how to get them to believe in you and your solution.In this new world of sales where AEs are expected to generate 50% of their own pipeline, prospect research becomes your superpower. The better and faster you are at this the higher your efficiency at generating income from cold accounts.
