Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2023-10-27,"Someone recently asked me if ""Happy Veterans Day"" is the right term. I am obviously not the judge here, but I see why people ask – there's something odd about putting ""happy"" next to military service. I had a phenomenal experience serving in the U.S. Army – I was able to pay for college, I went through incredible training, I learned leadership from the best, I worked with dedicated, loyal, and diverse service members, and I also happened to meet my husband, who I happen to like quite a lot.But military service is also connected to global conflict, to physical and emotional trauma for those who serve and also, the countries where conflicts rage.I'm going to punt the question of what's the right saying because I don't know and I think it misses the larger opportunity, which is to get to know someone who served and learn more about their experience.If you're looking for ways to open a conversation, here are a few:1. What brought you to military service?2. I'd love to learn about the people you served with – what were they like?3. What kind of job did you do in uniform?Nothing revolutionary, just an opportunity to have a conversation and learn more about this part of someone's experience.#veterans #veteransday",654,53,18,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58&keywords=roxanne%20bras%20petraeus&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=cb1ce05d-7067-4f4a-a12f-efc7f1b03930&sid=MxB&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2024-01-27,"When I first got pregnant, I was worried about two things. The first happened – I met the motherhood penalty. It happened in ways both subtle and comically obvious, like when a prominent venture capitalist asked me, apropos of nothing, if I was planning on getting pregnant. But in addition to worrying about how I'd be perceived, I also worried, more privately, about whether this penalty was rooted in some reality. Would I become less driven, less focused, less ambitious, less ""me.""My son is now a few years old, and I'm super pregnant with my second. My company, Ethena, just had its strongest quarter ever. We've recruited more incredible team members and brought on our largest customers yet.And I'm still waddling into the gym at 6AM because it turns out that motherhood didn't fundamentally change who I am.So anyway, I don't know who needs to hear this (except that venture capitalist –he definitely needs the memo), but counting mothers out of the game is dumb.",527,66,13,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58&keywords=roxanne%20bras%20petraeus&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=cb1ce05d-7067-4f4a-a12f-efc7f1b03930&sid=MxB&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2024-01-27,"A CEO is generating heat right now for a parental leave fail. I so strongly believe that you don't always have to have a take. It's okay to sit a scandal out. But I *do* have a take because I'm also a mom, a CEO, I'm heading out on mat leave any day now, and I have a lot of team members taking/returning from parental leave. So here are my thoughts with fair warning that this isn't just a ""look how awful this company is"" screed:1. I don't think the focus on the individual CEO is helpful. This is a broader issue about parental leave in America. And man, do we love to take down a women CEO because any shortcomings she has toward women or parents look especially hypocritical.Have you ever used the phrase ""working father?"" No, you say he's a lawyer or a CEO or a pilot and then of course he's got kids. But women CEOs are called ""working moms"" and get all the baggage that comes with having to represent both women and parents in the workplace.2. Parents go through so much and I wish there was more flexibility for all of the heart wrenching situations parents find themselves in, whether it's caring for a sick baby, enduring the devastation of a miscarriage, or going through a fertility journey.It's all so darn hard and while nothing makes it easy, more flexibility and higher salaries help.3. But as a country, we're relying on businesses to provide those resources and (here's the part where I sound like a heartless capitalist) businesses are incentivized to make profits. If we don't have government systems to support parents, we're asking every business to make individual decisions (within the very limited legal protections parents do have) that have really hard tradeoffs.So where I'm at is, yeah, this whole system is pretty nutty. I wish it were better and I wish I knew how to make a bigger difference. But I don't think piling on to an individual's mistake gets us there.",244,24,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58&keywords=roxanne%20bras%20petraeus&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=cb1ce05d-7067-4f4a-a12f-efc7f1b03930&sid=MxB&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2023-07-27,"You might be at a great company but if you have a meh manager, you're really at a meh company. Managers have a massive impact on the productivity and retention of their teams. We know this; studies show this; and yet, it's super easy to forget to train managers on how to be great at the craft.This is particular true in tech where most managers are new managers. New managers aren't bad, but they don't know what they don't know.They may default to things that feel perfect reasonable, like telling an employee who is struggling with a personal issue to, ""Take all the time you need."" 🚩But when managers aren't aware of the basic hygiene of being a manger, problems pop up and People/Legal teams are left doing damage control.Being proactive is better than being reactive. So I'm proud of the newest Ethena course, which stars our very own People leader Melanie Naranjo, to help companies be proactive.It includes topics like Performance Management, Performance Reviews, Reasonable Accommodation & Disabilities, Terminations, Leaves of Absence, and California-specific topics. It's the ""managers really should know this"" course. And companies can add their own policies so the training is specific. Check out a sample of this course and let me know what you think!And question – what other topics should we add to the library? We continue making microlearnings for all of our courses so they say relevant.

Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2023-07-27,"I find most Return to Office takes, well, dumb. They feel like variations on, ""[Insert my preference for working] is the only way to work. We should all do that.""This lacks the flexibility to cover various life stages, preferences, and candidly, even gendered components of work.A few weeks back, I saw a wild chart that showed that the only heterosexual couples where men do the majority of the ""housework"" are couples where women are the SOLE (not just primary) earners. Side note – this is in no way a passive aggressive move against my husband, who is a flawless co-parent 😂Yesterday, the benefits of Ethena's flexible work-where-you-work arrangement were in my face, as I picked my kid up from day care and chased him around the track, happy I was getting fresh air and he was more likely to go to sleep on time.

Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2023-05-27,"Wow. I'll say it. This article *and* the study are bananas. Come with me on this tour of red flags:1.

Why stop there. How about ""smoking hot?"" I'm giving this 🚩🚩We shouldn't use casually objectifying language in a professional context. Our VP of marketing is effective. Our VP of marketing is not, ""rocking a great bod."" 2. The article goes on to opine that, ""The study does not touch on whether companies founded by attractive women are better investments, however. Maybe it’s a good strategy?""Wait, we're endorsing this as a strategy?! Here's where I get to 🚩🚩🚩Determining capital allocation based on women's attractiveness is not a strategy, unless I guess your fund invests in bets on beauty pageants. 3. But  🚩🚩🚩🚩 for the ending. ""So maybe the solution is for VC companies is to hire fewer jerks?""No! While I see a lot of jerk behavior in this article, the solution isn't to call people jerks or to hire fewer of them. The solution is to acknowledge there are many biases at play in the workplace and then come up with tactics to ensure decisions aren't made based on those biases.For example, investors can have a standard set of questions they ask all founders, regardless of gender (or hotness?) to fight the tendency that men get asked more about potential than performance. Finally, this article gives the impression that ""hot women"" easily raise funds: Less than 3% of VC funding goes to all women founding teams.And articles like this don't help us move the needle.",154,46,12,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58&keywords=roxanne%20bras%20petraeus&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=cb1ce05d-7067-4f4a-a12f-efc7f1b03930&sid=MxB&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2023-09-27,"""You have to earn a seat at the table"" is a controversial piece of advice frequently given to women in male dominated fields and, interestingly, to HR/People Ops.I was thinking about this while on a panel with great People leaders a few weeks back, where we talked about the shift from HR to People Ops.As panelists we thought, whether fair or not, that People Ops often does need to earn a seat at the table because many leaders have worked at companies where HR was just admin.Here's my CEO perspective: leaders often don't know what they're missing out on because they haven't seen great.If you're curious how to show your value, here's an A+ example I've seen Melanie Naranjo do at Ethena:I come to her with a more traditional ""HR"" ask, like, ""Hey, help me hire this role."" Melanie could just say, ""I'll figure out the comp band and run the logistics on our ATS.""Instead, she says things like, ""I remember last time we hired for a similar role, we made XYZ mistake because we hadn't thought things through. So I talked with a few people at the company and I learned ABC thing that makes me think we are making the same mistake.""And then the key: ""My recommendation is we do this next...""She's gotten into the drivers seat versus asking me if she can steer.

In case, like me, you haven't seen these much in your career, stay interviews are interviews you do with your direct reports, especially high performers, to learn what would make them stay or leave.There's a human tendency to fight fires, meaning deal with something when it becomes a mess; but not be proactive.Stay interviews help you proactively manage your talent, versus just scrambling when a A team player shares that they're leaving.As a very recent convert, I now want to evangelize these as a tool for leaders!Much like in a Sales call, the value comes from asking hard/scary questions and then...shutting up! This isn't a ""pitch"" where you tell your team why they should stay. That would probably be ineffective.It's a listening tour.Unsurprisingly, Melanie, Ethena's people leader, gave me a great template that you are welcome to steal/modify as needed:Just a simple, 4 question interview can help you better lead:1. What do you love most about working at Ethena? 2. What's the most challenging thing about working at Ethena? 3. As a company, we are at our best when we.... We are at our worst when we... If you were to leave, it would be because... 4. Overall, how would you rate your experience at Ethena today?

Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2023-07-27,"The most fun thing about running a startup is being wrong. Literally every time we build a new product, I talk with my Ethena team about our hypotheses for how customers will use the product, and every time, we're a little bit wrong.Example: about a month ago, we launched an Anonymous Reporting tool after a deluge of customer requests (thanks to everyone who asked/demanded 😂). We thought what our customers wanted was the ability for employees to share concerns and meet regulations like SOC 2, SOX, the EU Whistleblower Directive, etc.But we realized that while companies do need to meet those requirements, the massive pain point, especially in tech is CASE MANAGEMENT. Internally tracking issues, investigations, and resolutions is a problem companies want to fix today.This data often lives in individual emails/brains/scattered docs. And HRBPs have relatively high turnover, so key information leaves with them, and it's hard to spot patterns. 💡💡💡Being wrong is fine, IMO. It's the cost of moving quickly. But once we figure out where we are wrong, we need to synthesize customer feedback and keep building in the right direction.Last week, we built an easy flow for HR and Legal to add cases directly in their portal. This fixes the challenge they have with other platforms – that it's so painful to add cases that people just won't. So whether you're building a company or taking on a new initiative, embrace being wrong and then be open to the feedback that'll tell you how to make it more right.",119,13,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58&keywords=roxanne%20bras%20petraeus&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=cb1ce05d-7067-4f4a-a12f-efc7f1b03930&sid=MxB&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

That's what the Army taught me.My ""ah ha"" moment went like this:Most of the Army's training was phenomenal, like training to deploy to Afghanistan. But there was a shocking amount of check the box training that I never understood.Why waste time on bad training for, say, sexual harassment, especially given how important the topic is?When I got out of the Army, I worked as a consultant and to my surprise, found myself clicking through similar check-the-box training. 🤯 Fed up and sensing an opportunity, I walked into a partner's office, someone who knew a lot about the training and legal space, and asked, ""Has no one fixed this?""""Not really,"" he answered, ""but I'll write you an angel check if you do.""

Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2024-01-27,"These days, my days start with coffee and a read of the latest ""DEI is dead"" article. Given my general exhaustion with the inevitable trend & backlash cycle, I was thrilled to see Frances Frei, Anne Morriss, and Caroline Elkins's NYT op-ed on DEI. A few points hit home for me:1. If DEI is actually just about the outcome of hiring a person of X background, you both piss everyone off and miss all the gains that come from what is meant to be a process. Not to be all, ""it's about the journey, not the destination,"" but that does seem to be what the research says.For example, the authors cite a study of decision making in drug development where diverse teams performed better *only* when there was psychological safety. This really hit home. I was often the only woman in a military unit and I'd share my perspective at work only when I felt like I wouldn't be mocked for it. Otherwise, I was all, ""Yes sir, what a brilliant idea,"" because what's the point of dissenting when you know it won't matter.2. Diverse is relative to the group that exists. I once heard a joke at a consulting firm that its military consultants were its least diverse ""diverse"" group. It was both funny and got at an underlying truth – you don't often think of a group of mostly white, straight, Christian, conservative men as diverse.But depending on the environment, this can be diversity. The authors cite an example of Harvard Business School's efforts to recruit military students and then a realization that they hadn't set up the internal processes to help these capable students succeed. This is an example of inclusion work even if it doesn't ""look"" like DEI.

He asked if I wanted some advice. Now, TBH, this is never totally an ask because it's awkward to say, ""no,"" but it's still a nice opener.2. He did some genuine empathy building. He told me, ""I've been in your shoes. Being a CEO is really hard, and you're doing an excellent job at these specific things...""He even said that the thing he was giving me advice on was a problem he himself hadn't totally figured out. What an A+ way to bring down my defenses, versus saying, ""Hey, I crushed this thing that you suck at.""3. He offered to help. After giving the advice, he shared that he was happy to help make some intros that could help me with the issue. I felt like I wasn't stranded alone with my problem.

Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2023-08-27,"I think the whole ""Is Return to Office a war on working moms"" debate would be much less of a debate if it was framed, ""Is RTO harder for caregivers?""When framed this way, the answer is obvious: Flexibility is key when you're juggling work and caregiving. So yes, mandating where people work is, all things being equal, harder for caregivers than non-caregivers.The pickle is that in the US:1) Women are disproportionately caregivers.

Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2023-10-27,"A lawyer recently asked me, ""How does Ethena compare to the competition when it comes to harassment prevention training?"" The short answer is that our DNA is in the gray area. We focus on situations that actually happen, which means we're constantly updating our training to reflect how the workplace changes over time. We used to joke that we're not your mother's sexual harassment prevention training. Honestly, we aren't even the harassment prevention training I took in the Army, which covered mostly absurd, super black and white scenarios. The stuff that made you say, ""duh.""The issue wasn't just how obvious these scenarios were; it's that traditional training leaves out all the ""small stuff"" that really compounds.I was just reading our General Counsel, Brandis Anderson's most recent wrap up of important legal developments and came across the EEOC's proposed updates to workplace harassment guidance.It's really encouraging to see that the most recent guidance is in line with Ethena's ethos of, ""Let's do more than the bare minimum."" The guidance includes a few key takeaways:1. Broad protections for LGBTQ+ colleagues2. The importance of covering pregnancy related decisions3.

Women who used in in salary negotiations got more money!Here's the nuance I found most interesting:""New evidence reveals that it’s not ambition per se that women are being penalized for...The problem arises if people perceive them to be forceful, controlling, commanding and outspoken.

Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2023-10-27,"Startups are a wild mix of conviction and humility. When Anne and I first launched Ethena's compliance training, we had high conviction that the market was broken – we introduced micro-learnings, funny content, Slack delivery, employee ratings and a bunch of features that weren't common in compliance training.We built largely based on our conviction.But now that we're a few years in, with our 3rd product, an employee hotline and case management system, we've built with more humility precisely because we have so many customers who give us input.Example – when we launched the product, only current employees could access the hotline. But we have many customers impacted by regulations like the EU Whistleblower Directive who need a way for a broader audience (maybe customers, former employees, whomever) to also submit a report.So, with a bunch of other features, we just shipped this little guy in the right hand corner. Our customers can now create a custom link that allows non-employees to report issues (they can also turn this off and change the link at any time).We didn't realize this was a key feature, but humility, combined with so much feedback from People/Legal leaders, helped us build the right follow-on features.🙏 to everyone who keeps making the Ethena compliance suite even better!",44,2,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58&keywords=roxanne%20bras%20petraeus&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=cb1ce05d-7067-4f4a-a12f-efc7f1b03930&sid=MxB&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ethena is a Neo company, Anne is a Neo Scholar, and I'm a big fan of Ali Partovi and the whole enterprise. The other is slightly less selfish. Venture Capital as an industry needs work. I read an article awhile ago by the incredible Serena Williams where she talked about first hearing that only about 2% of venture funds go to all women founding teams. She thought she heard wrong! In the year of our lord 2023, how is it possible there's such a massive gender gap?! And if it's broken at the earliest stages of company formation, we'll never see progress at the later stages because women won't be significant capital owners of the next generation of great companies.And y'all, I've seen it first hand. I've been asked by a VC if I were planning on getting pregnant and I've seen VCs question my co-founder's technical skills (at their own peril).But it doesn't have to be this way! In Connie Loizos's article, Ali points out that 45% of Neo’s capital deployed to date has been committed to startups led by women and underrepresented CEOs. And wait for it...

For example, there’s a thin, fuzzy, and context-dependent line between taking about sex at work, and issues like harassment and gender based discrimination (something Ethena training does a great job addressing). My advice for navigating TMI conversations at work includes: Try to redirect the conversation — I used a lot of jokes in the ArmyRemember power dynamics— if you’re senior, be especially thoughtful about what you sayAssume positive intent — most people aren’t intentionally trying to make you uncomfy.

I found a standing spot but then thought I saw a seated women gesture to sit as she moved her shopping bag onto her lap. Grateful, I plopped down only to have this woman tap me on the shoulder. I removed my headphones assuming she was going to ask when I was due. Instead she said, ""I want to know why you choose this seat. There's another seat,"" and gestured far down the car.Speechless, I slowly put my headphones back on as she said aloud, ""That's what I thought! No answer!"" and then proceeeded to get off at the next stop.The only saving grace of this interaction was the very New York guy who heckled her on the way out – sir, you have my eternal gratitude.I have tried to find a rational explanation for her actions (maybe she didn't notice I was pregnant?!) but have come up short.

Roxanne Bras Petraeus,Female,2023-06-27,"Okay I love this characteristically thoughtful post from Melanie Naranjo on the questions a HR/People leader should ask leadership.Given I sat on the other end of Melanie's questions when Anne and I interviewed her for Ethena, I thought I'd share what I look for in a candidate's questions.Hopefully this is helpful for those interviewing.I always leave a few minutes at the end of an interview for a candidate to ask me questions. Here are my 🚩:1. No questions – at a startup, curiosity is key because it helps you grow. If a candidate doesn't have any questions for me, I view it as an indication (fairly or not) of their curiosity.2. Generic questions – if you ask me a generic question like, ""What's Ethena's culture,"" I feel like there wasn't a lot of thought behind that question. It sort of goes to the curiosity point. Buuuuuut here's what Melanie did that knocked my socks off:She asked a few thoughtful questions including one that showed me she was thinking about exactly the sorts of problems we wanted our People leader to think of.""How do you balance a high performance culture with inclusive practices,"" Melanie asked. I stumbled through an answer because it's a really hard problem! I think I even asked her what she thought. But I walked out of our interview thinking that if these are the sorts of questions Melanie has for me, then she's the kind of leader I want building our culture.Tl;dr – don't let, ""So, do you have any questions for me?"" be a missed opportunity in an interview! #interviewtips #hr #people #founders #startups",15,1,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABtGWkEBl1VzMq5jspDI1rTUjFEYKyYry58&keywords=roxanne%20bras%20petraeus&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=cb1ce05d-7067-4f4a-a12f-efc7f1b03930&sid=MxB&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
