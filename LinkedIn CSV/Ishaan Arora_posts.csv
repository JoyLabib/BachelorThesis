Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-11-27,"With 1500 rupees, at the age of 19 I started my company FinLadder ✨Completely bootstrapped, without dropping out and raising it to a profitable business with an 8-fig revenue. ⭐Here are my top 3 lessons for young entrepreneurs -1. Idea is overrated -I do get a bit of heat for saying it at times but this is the truth. Execution is the key. No great idea can work without it but the most common ones can also make a fortune just by working on execution. 💯2. Easier than you think -We are raised in a manner where cracking exams like CA/CFA, scoring 99 percentile in CAT, cracking a 20LPA etc is considered to be easy/possible and the common road but not starting up as it is considered to be very difficult and impossible. It is not true! Many startups do great, trust yourself. ❤️3. Dropping Out/Funding is not necessary -Pls don't drop out of your graduation. Some might have and made a fortune but trust me no one is showing their failures. Complete your basic education and manage things alongside - very much possible. ☀️Plus funding may or may not be needed depending upon the business model but in many cases you can do without it if you're still in college and starting up. 👌Thoughts? 💡",2826,116,5,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-11-27,"5 Ways that helped me get an internship in college -Quick Backstory - I was in my 2nd year of graduation pursuing Bcom Hons from University of Delhi when I cracked my first office internship in the finance domain at Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. ⭐️1. College Fairs -Highly underrated but most effective! People talk about various internship platforms but we all know how well they work. College fairs are organised by the college itself where companies are called to hire interns. If your college doesn’t have one then you can attend it in other colleges as it’s mostly open for all. 💯2. Networking -I started using LinkedIn actively when I was 18. Didn’t post a lot but once in 10 days was still doable. I used to connect with HRs and corporates frequently and used to interact with them. Never openly texted anyone for an internship just focused on my connection with them. By the end of college I had a great network of corporates. 🧠3. Live Projects -Spoken about them a lot on YouTube. These are the closest to an internship. Shows not only that you did a course but also understood every practical aspect of it. So whenever you complete any skill building course, try to make a project out of it using real-life examples. 💡4. Attending Events & Conferences -I attended various events during my college time including Harvard US-India Initiative. It helped me grow but also added great experiences in my resume which hardly 1% students had. A must! 👌🏻5. Not Neglecting Marks -Have spoken about this plenty of times. If you’re especially from commerce, planning to either study abroad or do a job - your marks matter a lot! Saying that they don’t matter is like living under a rock. The first section in our resumes is education. A good number first up creates a good impression always. 🙌🏻Made a video on how students can make money in college, check out here -https://lnkd.in/gWHRe33xThoughts? 💡#career #internships #college #interns",2001,71,5,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-08-27,"“Do I need an MBA if I’ve done X/Y/Z course?” ❓This is one of the most common questions I am asked.To explain this, let’s pick a real-life example.Let’s say you want to make a career in finance/accounts. We have so many professional courses in these fields like- FRM,CFA ,CMA ,CPA ,ACCA,CFP,CAAnd many more! Until and unless you’re not explicitly doing CA, I believe you should certainly do an MBA if you’re looking for the best opportunities. 💯The point is not just the curriculum! All three levels of CFA combined will teach you more about finance than nearly any MBA in the world (MBA course has other subjects too)Your next question will be -” If I need to make a career in finance and I’m doing CFA, then why is an MBA necessary?” 🤔Because they are not substitutes but rather complementary courses. There will be things that you’ll only learn in an MBA and things only covered in professional courses. 💯TRY THIS AND GET THE RIGHT ANSWER-Search for the best MBA colleges in India on LinkedIn and go to the ‘people’ section. You’ll see that nearly 80-90% of the students pursuing their masters from the top colleges in India either have done or are doing professional courses. This gives excellent clarity on the importance of both.PRO TIP- Send them a customized message and connect with them! Why leave any chance to network with people who have the same interests? ⭐️ Nothing beats the combination of the two, but it is essential to know that the timeline can be different for different people, and you may or may not do both simultaneously. My advice is to make room for both to have the best career possible in your field.Thoughts? 💡#career #jobs #opportunities",1028,87,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-05-27,"I travelled to 5 European countries and here are 11 interesting points 💫 -1. If you’re looking for cost-friendly places avoid countries like Switzerland and France and use metros over taxis.2. In every part of Europe, tap water is drinkable.3. Go to the toilet twice before leaving your space as majority of the toilets cost 💶1(Roughly 90 INR) to use. 4. Uber is either banned or not used in majority of the countries hence you need to rely on taxis.5. Language is a barrier especially at the local places, keep your Google translator handy.6. Egg is considered vegetarian at a lot of places. Even regular salads have either pork or beef in it. Be very specific with what you eat - my friends ate pork meatballs because someone told them it’s soya lol.7. The best exchange rate is mostly available at the ATMs.8. Majority of the destinations have public Wifi which makes life easy. You can avoid taking international packs until very necessary.9. Carry your own water, a single 1 litre water bottle can cost upto 350 INR!10. Adapters are a must! The charging portals are different than here and your regular chargers or machine wires won’t work without the adapter.11. You get free bread and Parmesan cheese at almost every restaurant. I will also be making a different post on how to travel across Europe in the most cost effective manner. ✅P.S - Picture was taken at Rome, Italy. ❤️LinkedIn for Creators #travel #networking #costofliving",996,70,7,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-06-27,"A tool that is a game changer! 🤯These days it doesn’t matter if we are salaried employees, a freelancer or a business owner, majority of us have multiple sources of income streams and are indulged in various types of investments. 👀Well, this journey is great but leads to a very hectic task of filing taxes. :(Understanding complex Indian Tax laws and staying up-to-date with the latest regulations can be overwhelming, especially for a non-tax professional. Calculating taxable income, deductions, exemptions, and tax liabilities can be extremely complex and even after that, filing taxes without a CA requires extra caution to ensure compliance with tax laws. Audits can also be a concern, and understanding the red flags that may trigger an audit is crucial. 💫But seeing the growth of technology conquering these problems to this extent is wondrous! While many platforms are available for tax filing I personally use Clear  and trust me I was amazed, the result was - 100% accurate filing with bank-grade security! 🙌🏻💡The existence of two tax regimes makes it difficult to figure out the most suitable one but Cleartax Auto selects the most suitable regime to maximize your tax savings.💡The intuitive and user-friendly interface makes the entire process of filing an ITR smooth and hassle-free. The platform guided me through every step, ensuring I got all the crucial details.💡The platform has the ability to import relevant data from various sources automatically. This feature saved me a significant amount of time, as I didn't have to manually enter all my financial information. Cleartax effortlessly fetched my Form 16, bank statements, and other necessary documents, eliminating the risk of errors or omissions. Just one click can import details from 30+ investment brokers.💡The platform’s intelligent algorithm analyzed my financial data and provided insightful tax-saving recommendations. It identified deductions and exemptions I could claim, maximizing my tax benefits and optimizing my overall tax liability. This personalized approach actually gave me confidence in the accuracy and completeness of my return.I highly recommend Cleartax to anyone seeking a simplified and streamlined process for filing their Income Tax Return. Cleartax is an excellent choice for non-tax professionals like me.  💯Tap on the link mentioned in my comment and use my code to get flat 60% off on ITR filing plans. 💫#partnership #RelaxKaroClearTaxKaro",974,68,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Growth - I feel growth is determined not by a job or business, but by the individuals themselves. You can grow equally in the two however jobs may have a saturation point.This post highlights two things -A) Decision making - Take the decisions you own.B) Acceptance - That both the paths are good, need efforts and can give you a great life.So it’s your choice to walk on any of the roads, but be ready to give in your 100% at every end ❤️Thoughts? 💫#growth #startups #jobs",870,76,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-11-27,"Planning to make a career in finance? ⭐️A lot of students aspire to be an investment banker, financial analyst, risk manager etc in top tier firms, but what are the courses that one needs to pursue to make a top-notch career in finance? 💡Here is the list -(Not considering MBA/CA here)1. CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) -I’ve said this time and again that CFA is without a doubt the best course in finance and can give you a massive edge in the field. It has 3 levels, usually take around 2-3 years to complete and costs around 3-3.5 lacs.2. FRM (Financial Risk Management) -Probably the second best but the most important one when it comes to the risk management field. It has 2 levels, takes around 1-1.5 years and costs around 2 lacs. It dwells into every aspect of risk management and is a must if you’re planning this side of finance.3. Financial Modeling & Valuations -What makes this course special is the practical aspect in it. When I did FRM, I got plenty of books at my home to study. Same with CFA or pretty much every course. With FMVA, it’s all done on excel and hence this makes it different from the others. A must-learn skill in the field of finance.Other mentions - In Big 4 firms if you are not planning to do CA then CPA and ACCA adds great value especially as a fresher. 👌🏻In finance - CFP, CWM, CAIA etc are also good courses but I personally rank CFA and FRM higher.

Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-07-27,"College life can be stressful! 👀Many TV shows certainly depict a cooler side of it but in reality it is poles apart. Students struggle for a lot of things including -• Struggle of finding internships • Selecting the right courses• Choosing the right specialisationAnd a lot more! 🤯I can totally relate but here are 5 tips that really helped me -1. Live Projects -While finding internships can be daunting, doing a skill based course and then making a project around it is a lot easier. Ex - Let’s say you do a digital marketing or financial modeling course. Both are practical courses where even if you don’t get good internships you can always make your own financial model(s) or articles/pages for ads etc 🙌🏻2. Extra Curricular ActivitiesEverything that is not a part of your curriculum and extra courses is ECA.Societies, sports team, conferences, events, projects, research papers etc all can be done side by side to enhance your profile. 💯3. Doing Additional Courses -In this age and time it is a must. We can’t just rely on our college degrees anymore. Doing extra courses is the biggest advantage in a resume.Start with short-term courses and slowly get to the job oriented courses. ⭐️4. Marks Matter -Don’t let anyone influence you, marks actually matter.As a recruiter you’ll always prefer to see 90% over 70% (keeping other things constant).If you’re looking to pursue your masters or planning to go for a job - work on your numbers. 💫5. Mindset TweakThe thing that works like magic! Change how you think. Everyone around me was always planning to get ahead of the other person and do things for a better job. 🙌🏻I’d recommend you to focus on the process. Work on things that help you grow in all aspects of your life and especially improve your skills. At the end of the day nothing else matters. Don’t do things just for a better resume or jobs, get to the bottom of things and work on your knowledge - other things follow.Thoughts? ✅#career #college #jobs",714,25,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

College Fairs -We often talk about everything else but not this. Not many colleges have fairs but the ones that have keep it open for everyone else too. I got my internship from a college fair itself. Try them out they are a game changer.2. Internship Platforms -Yes many of them are consisting of mostly BD roles but if that’s the case then you’re not looking at every place. There are many lesser-known platforms - Google them once and you’ll find great ones.3. LinkedIn and Cold-Networking -This won’t happen with random messages to random people asking them for roles and vacancies, it will never happen like this.Then? 💡Have a great resume and a top-notch LinkedIn profile that’s the number one priority for a decent role. Once that’s done start to engage and post which makes you more established and credible.Then form conversations with professionals rather than asking for a job. Once you form a good connection then ask them if there are any vacancies. 💫I hope this list really solves the large-scale problem of college students. 💯Thoughts? 💡#linkedinforcreators #growth #opportunities",710,31,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

But, a failed business model ≠ personal failure.Being an entrepreneur/content creator has taught me these valuable lessons (the hard way):✅Love failures from day 1.✅Curiosity can keep you 100x ahead.✅Flexibility is the key.

Exploring is key -Pls don't make this common mistake of 'full research, nil work.' Many students over complicate theory and undermine practicality. ✨Confused with what you want to do? Jump into the field and explore. Simple mode is doing a course if you're not able to get experience. Searching on Google will take you no where. 🤯2. Choose your company wisely -Believe it or not but at times you are supposed to leave the people you are close to because of differences in the way of thinking. 🔥A lot of things in my life turned North because of the people I associated myself with. And I'm sure the opposite existed too with a few! 👏3. Self-Belief - King of all!Your parents believe in you? Great!Your friends and professors do too?

Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-05-27,"Burnout - 3 Signs and Tips to Overcome ⭐️In today’s time every one is stressed for one thing or the other. It doesn’t matter whether you are doing a job, having a startup, creating content, freelancing or anything else - you’ll be facing tough times. Many of us are good at fighting our own battles but sometimes it’s just too much! Been there myself, so here are 3 signs with which if you relate then you’re possibly burnt out - 1. Feeling Alone -You feel you have no one in this world to whom you can turn to. All the time you’re fighting your battles alone and you think even your parents or close friends don’t understand your feelings.2. Feeling low or helpless 24*7Many times we relate this to laziness but it’s not! It rather revolves around the fact that you have your 100% for way too long and now you need a break because things and even our body is not the same all the time.3. Self-Doubt and Lack of Motivation You start to question your actions even though they may not be wrong. You blame yourself for every thing and seldom find motivation for the important tasks.But how do we overcome this?1. Acceptance-Accept that you’re exhausted mentally and physically. There’s nothing wrong with it. Once you accept then only you can work on it.2. Take a break -Obviously! Invest time in activities that you love. Ex - I love to play cricket and watch shows. It can be something else for you. 3. Worship your Mind & Body -For at least 25 days, have a fixed sleep schedule, eat healthy, manage your stress and prioritise yourself over other people and things.To conclude, burnout is a phase that almost everyone faces but the catch is to identify, accept and get over it to continue the great work you have been doing. 💫LinkedIn for Creators #motivation #inspiration #work",547,28,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-08-27,"In the last 6 months I have met 100+ founders and 500+ creators and sharing my thoughts here now. 💡Sandesh, Riya and I are sharing our thoughts on three different topics - networking, research and growth on LinkedIn so make sure you check out all 💯Everyone wants to network isn’t it? But wait, how do we network with people we don’t even know? Why would they reply? ❓Here are 5 supremely important points when it comes to networking -1. Provide, Don’t Ask! -This is so so crucial and yet many people don’t understand this. Networking doesn’t mean you go to someone directly for help. Rather provide consistent value to the other person, this will lead to a stronger network over anything else. And of course when you are in need of anything go and pitch. 👌🏻2. Pick your Events -Pls don’t go on every other event there is but choose which ones to go at based on the audience, niche, institute/company, other speakers etcThis leads to a solid brand image in the future too. ⭐️3. Create a Chain -In my life, so many times I’ve connected with another person not because of DMs or random emails but via reference from someone else. So always expand your own side of connections so that when the times comes even you can connect people with others. ✅4. Keep Selfish Motives Aside -Don’t drop a DM only asking for help. If someone doesn’t even know 1% about you then the chances of them even replying is close to 0. We all have faced this in our lives at some point isn’t it? Keep the goal as learning and connecting with like minded people, rest follows. 💡5. Continue to Improve YourselfIf you’re doing a job, try to get to higher levels.If you’re running a business, increase it’s social media presence and revenue.If you’re a creator, increase your numbers and substance.The point is that people will network with you more freely if you’re doing well yourself and that’s the truth! 🧠According to you what is the relevance of networking?

Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-12-27,"5 Ways that helped me get an internship in college -Quick Backstory - I was in my 2nd year of graduation pursuing Bcom Hons from University of Delhi when I cracked my first office internship in the finance domain at Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. ⭐️1. College Fairs -Highly underrated but most effective! People talk about various internship platforms but we all know how well they work. College fairs are organised by the college itself where companies are called to hire interns. If your college doesn’t have one then you can attend it in other colleges as it’s mostly open for all. 💯2. Networking -I started using LinkedIn actively when I was 18. Didn’t post a lot but once in 10 days was still doable. I used to connect with HRs and corporates frequently and used to interact with them. Never openly texted anyone for an internship just focused on my connection with them. By the end of college I had a great network of corporates. 🧠3. Live Projects -Spoken about them a lot on YouTube. These are the closest to an internship. Shows not only that you did a course but also understood every practical aspect of it. So whenever you complete any skill building course, try to make a project out of it using real-life examples. 💡4. Attending Events & Conferences -I attended various events during my college time including Harvard US-India Initiative. It helped me grow but also added great experiences in my resume which hardly 1% students had. A must! 👌🏻5. Not Neglecting Marks -Have spoken about this plenty of times. If you’re especially from commerce, planning to either study abroad or do a job - your marks matter a lot! Saying that they don’t matter is like living under a rock. The first section in our resumes is education. A good number first up creates a good impression always. 🙌🏻Thoughts? 💡#career #internships #college #internships",490,30,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Exploring is key -Pls don't make this common mistake of 'full research, nil work.' Many students over complicate theory and undermine practicality. ✨Confused with what you want to do? Jump into the field and explore. Simple mode is doing a course if you're not able to get experience. Searching on Google will take you no where. 🤯2.

Positivity - Whenever you meet them, you get positive vibes and how they talk helps you understand that very well.2.

Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-10-27,"Do you remember the time when your dream felt out of reach?That's exactly how a very close friend of mine felt when he aspired to study in US. Despite being an absolute rockstar with a strong academic background, he found himself facing the same challenge that many students do - securing the right financing to pursue his dreams. 💰🙅‍♂️ Rejections from banks and lenders became a common theme, leaving him disheartened and uncertain about his future. But as they say, every cloud has a silver lining! 🌤️The dream of pursuing an international education seemed almost within the grasp, but the financial hurdles appeared unconquerable. Loan rejections, complex procedures, and skyrocketing interest rates - it's a narrative that countless aspiring students can relate to! 🤝 This is when he found GyanDhan  and the transformation was nothing short of extraordinary. GyanDhan's support and services not only empowered him but also illuminated the path for countless other aspiring students.So, what sets GyanDhan apart? Upon carefully listening to him I realised their unique USPs are a game-changer in the field of education financing:🌐 It is a marketplace with all major lenders in one place, and multiple loan applications can run parallelly without having to coordinate with multiple lenders but just Gyandhan.🌐 They provide end-to-end loan counseling, walking students through the loan process at no cost.🌐 They do not charge anything, they were very ethical and integral in what they claimed. 🌐They have streamlined the application process with a customized document checklist. The whole application process is easy and smooth to pursue. They have assisted more than 15,000 students including my friend!His journey is a testament to the possibilities that await when deserving students are provided with the right support and resources. If you or someone you know is pursuing higher education dreams, GyanDhan is worth giving a shot.

It is so heart-warming to see so many youngsters these days investing and planning for their future. However some are still making common mistakes. 👀So if you've started your journey or are planning to start, get these done -1. Go Global 🌍 - Go beyond Indian equities as well. Global equities are correlated but not fully. US and China economies are good to and can be looked at from long-term perspective.2. Diversify ⭐ -Diversify not only across asset classes (debt, gold, stocks etc) but also within them.Ex - You want to invest 20K every month in equities. Here rather than choosing a single fund you can go like -A) 34% - Index FundsB) 33% - Small/Mid CapsC) 33% - Bluechip Funds3. Growth vs Dividend 📊 - Prefer growth funds especially if you're young. Basic dividend reinvesting can lead to a massive difference between long-term returns of the two. Plus other tax benefits.4. Mindset 🧠 -Something which is seldom talked about.I'll not write 10s of lines talking about expense ratio, exit load etc. Any individual can compare those before investing. I'll give you a pro-tip which only genuine traders and investors understand initially. 🤯Making wealth from the market is not about skills. It's about -• Patience• Psychology• Discipline• Money Management• Risk ManagementAnd in the initial months/years you'll feel very normal because the corpus is less.

Discomfort = growth.✅Learn from criticismTake feedback as opportunities to get better, rather than attacks on your self-worth. Ask for specific ways you can improve.✅Compare yourself to your past selfLook at how far you've come, rather than making unrealistic comparisons with others.

Ishaan Arora,Male,2023-10-27,“But how do I know where my interests are or what do I want to do in my life?” This is such a common question that nearly every 16-25 year old has! The major issue with this question is -- Overthinking - Lack of ActionMany people do not practically understand how things work or do not try to start with anything at all but just keep on researching! (Reason why many people also end up changing their fields) 2 years back I never would have thought that I’d consistently make content on multiple platforms! But I started doing it without much overthinking and over a period of time loved doing it and hence continued. 💯So what can we do to fight this issue?1. Action - All the planning and research is useless if we don’t take any action towards it.2. Learn to fail - Many people are afraid of failure and hence don’t start. Learn to embrace them especially at a young age.3. Cut Outside Noise - Many times we look for the answers that we have within us. If you can different people the same question you’ll always receive different answers so this will only confuse you more.

It’s an open network. More like the UPI for e-commerce. 💡Is it government owned? No! It’s a private non-profit section 8 company established by the DPIIT of Govt of India to develop open e-commerce.But the question is, which problems gave birth to ONDC?💡 The Monopoly & duopoly of giant tech companies.💡 The Game of data - The e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart have the access to tons of data. Analyzing the data, they know which products sell the most, at what price range, with what specs, colors, and which geographical location has the highest amount for that one category of product. Using all this data, they acquire a small manufacturing company and manufactures the exact same product with the in demand features and lists the same in less price. That’s not all! These products will be listed top in the list. This strategy does make millions of dollars for the company, but the sale tends to drop for other brands, and small brands become negligible. 💡Deep Discounting - Products listed on these platforms goes under huge discounts of up to 60-80% during the sale season, especially during festivals. Offline stores who fail to match the offers face downfall in business. The huge losses faced by the offline market was a point of concern for the government.💡Commission on Zomato & Swiggy are around 18-24% How will ONDC fill the gap?💡Discoverability - Every seller is discoverable now. You can access the products from all e-commerce platforms, even without downloading them. 💡 All the market players are listed - Aggregators, sellers, delivery companies to take care of the customer. Zomato & Swiggy had a manipulation over delivery fee & surcharge incase that location has less or no delivery partners, but here that won’t be the case because, even the delivery companies like dunzo are listed here.💡 Price Comparison tool to find the best deal without having to browse various platforms💡Commissions on this platform will remain0-3%, which will be affordable for sellers.

It’s the feeling you get when you are walking on the street and someone stops you to appreciate your work and tell you how your content helped them. 🙌🏻It’s also about the amazing friends you make in the industry. 💯After 2 years into content I’m proud to achieve this feat and I thank Global Startup Summit for facilitating me with this award ⭐️I’d also like to thank my buddies for being the facilitator in this - Chirag Jain and Anushree Jain ❤️We continue to positively impact lives :’)#contentcreation #networking #marketing #linkedinforcreators,272,28,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Ishaan Arora,Male,2024-02-27,"Let me tell you something which is absolutely mind-boggling 👀The growth of UPI 🙌🏻✅India boasts of over 300 million UPI users. 📈And of course there are plenty of players in this industry now so as a business how do you differentiate yourself? 👇1. Trust is key: More for fintechs but generally for any company, the trust of its stakeholders comes first. You break it once and you regret it forever. With stiff competition it’s necessary to make sure your product holds trust. ️💯2. Invest in the UI/UX of your app: Because why not? We have so many great companies to pick from! It’s necessary to provide a platform that is easy for everyone to use. 🙌🏻3. Follow all Regulatory Requirements: Running any business involves regulations, but more so when you are a digital payment platform and  for smooth functioning. 🚀Here’s one brand that I trust and which certainly ticks all the above mentioned points MobiKwik  and it shows in their numbers 📉📈✅They already have a user base of nearly 150 million people with billions of dollars in annual transactions. ✅They have launched Pocket UPI to further grow their user base. With Pocket UPI you can manage all your digital spends such as daily needs, food, travel, utility,  bills etc, including UPI payments without having to link your bank account for any of them. You can budget your finances better by creating a limit for your UPI spends. Just top-up and spend!✅As a bonus for being thoughtful about your money, your bank statements become less cluttered, since all your frequent UPI transactions are being made from your wallet. Of course now they will also work on increasing their presence and salesforce. 💯What else do you think is important for growth and survival? 💡🧠#startup #startups #growth #entrepreneurship",249,38,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACbGptEB7TxzyI4WWbRkoCV4Xaws0J_HxCY&keywords=ishaan%20arora&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=7c05fdf8-8281-48c6-995d-76ac05387574&sid=VOM&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
