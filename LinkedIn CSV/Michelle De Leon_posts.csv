Michelle De Leon,Female,2023-04-27,"What's in a name?How did you choose your brand name? What about Nike, Amazon and Google? I recently watched the documentary Air, about Michael Jordon and Nike creating Air Jordon. I recommend it from a business and branding perspective. It was fascinating to watch the story of how Nike was the underdog and how one product changed their fortunes and the Jordon family.The name World Afro Day¬Æ does what it says on the tin and I was googling images this morning and found this one. Definitely one of the best images used to celebrate the day. I would actually say searching World Afro Day images is good for your soul! So many happy images of Black people enjoying their God-given hair. I think illustrator Vashti Harrison also captures this spirit in her work. I found this on a website from Cameroon, plus I saw an article on an Indian website too. World Afro Day is acknowledged in six continents!Have you trademarked your brand? Before I launched World Afro Day in 2017 I registered it as a trademark. I believed it would be celebrated all over the world. Now, I have to think carefully about new things I create and whether to register the name because I have been legally challenged before.Have you spoken to trademark lawyers? Defending your trademark is not as straightforward as you might think. You have to decide when your trademark is infringed and what you want to spend your time and money on protecting. Thanks to Akima Paul Lambert and Hogan Lovells, who provide World Afro Day with pro bono support. World Afro Day is not like Black History Month, you can't do whatever you want with our name! So I will have to write to a few picture agencies today to get them to stop selling images using our name! But what a privilege to create a brand that makes people smile and celebrate all over the world. Also it unites people from different backgrounds so this is the part I want to harness as a business. I hope this image makes you smile today. Did you know there is a professor of branding? Prof. Jonathan A.J. Wilson PhD DLitt have you seen Air?

Michelle De Leon,Female,2024-04-26,"‚ÄúA woman who cuts her hair is about to change her life.‚Äù Coco ChanelThis time April 2021 I did the big chop. For many women the idea of cutting off their hair is a complete no no and I was one of them but somehow coming out of lockdown I was ready to face the world differently. African heritage women experience more scrutiny than any other group, when it comes to their hair. Long or short we are asked too many questions about our hair and the worst is when we are touched without our permission. However, the only way to change this is through conversation and education. World Afro Day¬Æ has been on this mission for seven years, sometimes changing hearts and minds one person, one school or one organisation at a time.Stepping out of my comfort zone with my hair, maybe helped me to be more bold in other ways. Some women do regular big chops and I do think that they can be bolder than other women. They do not need to be as conventional. Yet African heritage women can look stunning with short hair. It doesn‚Äôt have to be the big chop but stepping out of your comfort zone with hair can challenge you on many levels. Lockdown allowed many people to go natural, grow longer hair, bigger fros and become less conformist.Some hairstyles challenge your own beliefs, confidence and identity as well as dealing with other people‚Äôs perceptions. Maybe my hair reflects my attitudes to risk‚Ä¶I am courageous and in business and life that is good. What made you do a big hair change?

Michelle De Leon,Female,2023-08-27,"What do these three women have in common? They showcase the versatility and beauty of natural Afro hair. Their skills talents and abilities are not in their hair so why would companies choose the straight hairstyle as a standard of professionalism? It‚Äôs illogical and discriminatory but this has been business as usual since the early 1900s, when we started to straighten our hair with hot combs. Hair discrimination originates as an employment issue because African diaspora people straightened their hair for better job prospects.If you believe all three women should be able to be employed on merit not on hairstyle. If you believe that Africans looking African is our heritage and that this should be respected at work, then join the movement World Afro Day - Workplace, 15 September.It‚Äôs time for change, it‚Äôs time for employers to get trained, it‚Äôs time to be ourselves.

Michelle De Leon,Female,2024-03-27,"Who knew that the law could be so exciting...Today I joined a member of the French Parliament Olivier SERVA (bottom left in photo) to give evidence towards a new law against hair discrimination in France. I got this opportunity because of Guylaine Conquet who has been doing great work campaigning to change the law in France. This work is gaining momentum and if they pass the law it might be the first country  in the world to have a national law! The CROWN Act is only at the state level so all eyes are on France now... Even African and Caribbean nations have been slow to legislate against hair discrimination, although it is needed just as much in these nations as anywhere else. The minister for education and social development Dee-ann Kentish-Rogers also pioneered this work in Anguilla by introducing a new hair code in 2022. From my experience leading World Afro Day¬Æ, people of African descent really want these laws to rectify an issue that has been hidden for far too long.Let's be honest, workplaces will not change fast enough until the law changes. However, the research clearly shows that people with Afro hair have been denied economic opportunity for hundreds of years because they are deemed to have the 'wrong type' of hair. Why didn't you get the job? I wouldn't straighten my hair to look more European...does this make any sense, when you're an African? Companies need to understand that being ourselves, brings the best results!Anyone else looking forward to a new law to end Afro hair discrimination? Tashara Parker, MA D.

It‚Äôs been a really tough year but I was invited to a Black History Month event at UK Parliament and got to enlarge my network.‚úÖKnowledge is still power.

My personality is to win so I find this one hard. ‚úÖHealth & Wellbeing is a life and business priority. We need to speak more about what we are doing in this area on LinkedIn. I did way too much work in 2023 and I need to take care of myself and loved ones better in 2024.‚úÖSharing more personal information on LinkedIn that shapes my leadership and why I am committed to my vision of Afro hair acceptance in the workplace. I am a private person but life has real challenges that when we overcome them, it can help others.‚úÖForgiveness is perhaps the hardest thing we can ever do. Has someone disappointed you this year?

Michelle De Leon,Female,2024-04-23,"Afro gymnasts: how often do you see this?It‚Äôs important that Afro hair is associated with excellent standards! Gymnastics like many professions have promoted grooming standards based on straight European hair and this has mean‚Äôt hiding Afro hair or risking their health with hair relaxers.Some might see an untamed Afro hairstyle. I see a young man operating with feeedom, boldness and achieving high standards based on his skills and not his hair. I love how Gen Z are not going by the old playbook. My daughter is part of this generation but we have a responsibility to make the path easier for them. Like the Olympics we carry the torch to pass on so let‚Äôs change our professions and industries to accept that Afro coily curly hair is the standard for the majority of Africans. When a gymnast reaches the highest level they create an original move which is named after them. You can bring your own style, flare and ingenuity to your workplace. My signature move is World Afro Day¬Æ but you can add your move too! Business is often about creating something new or improving on the existing way, which is similar to gymnastics‚Ä¶I have something coming for 2024.The Paris Olympics are round the corner and as a former athlete I love the sports but as a textured hair advocate I love to watch the hair too. üòâ One of the most famous female athletes on the planet Sha‚ÄôCarri Richardson has been sporting her Afro too along with many other athletes.
