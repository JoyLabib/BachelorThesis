Sallie Krawcheck,Male,2023-11-27,"Here are five things women accomplished this year that I’m grateful for:1. The By-Women-For-Women Economy. Points if your name is Beyoncé, Taylor, or Barbie. Extra points if you showed up and caused the economic earthquake by spending money on something so uniquely fun and feminist.2. The Girl Math Kinda Adding Up. We morphed another patronizing money message (ugh) into a viral campaign against zero-fun budgets and financial shame holding us back. And we showed them: Pumpkin spice lattes were sipped with pride. 3. The Confidence and Power of Women Investors. 86% of women told Ellevest that investing makes them feel “powerful.” Particularly, “in control over their futures.” Shout out to you if, during a year of extreme volatility and “shiny new things,” you started investing or stayed the course and felt the power of your financial flex. 4. The Mainstream-ification of Divorce Money Advice. If you’re reading this, your favorite celebrity couple probably broke up this year. But the “summer of divorce” shined a light on money and marriage issues considered too taboo to discuss. Not anymore — and women are better off for it.5. The Ambition of Women in the Workplace. Women IPO-ed. Women’s sports is the moment. Women led major news outlets. Women CEOs (finally) outnumbered those named John. We perform better with a bestie by our side and go further when we play together.TL;DR: Nothing bad happens when women have more money and more power. And there’s a lot to be thankful for in that.Read my full op ed in this week's Ellevest newsletter here:  https://lnkd.in/ehzNZvkF.",1364,62,77,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAApgNwUBrPiN3Ni6Kx0QrLJbAceu1hjwzfc%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAApgNwUBrPiN3Ni6Kx0QrLJbAceu1hjwzfc&keywords=sallie%20krawcheck&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=892383d4-ac4d-4f1d-89ae-84463b5a06d9&sid=j1B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Sallie Krawcheck,Male,2024-04-25,"It’s pretty tough to believe that there are still some people who believe that the reason women earn less than men is because — lol — women *choose* to work fewer hours, *choose* to take more career breaks, *choose* to do more housework, and *choose* to pursue occupations that pay less. For example, I have a hunch that #1 WNBA draft pick Caitlin Clark didn’t *choose* to make 1% as much as her NBA draft-pick peers. But thanks to an Op-Ed published in the Wall Street Journal back around #EqualPayDay, I’m here to debunk these sexist tropes. Women are underpaid for so many systemic reasons.

Sallie Krawcheck,Male,2023-07-27,"When I decided to start Ellevest, it wasn’t because I woke up one morning and thought, “Today, I’m going to start a business.”  It was because I was passionate about a problem that no one else was solving: creating the financial services company that women deserve — one built by women, for women. And, I genuinely believed I had what it took to solve it — or could get access to the resources — including my experience in the financial industry. I also had the ability to fully commit myself to getting Ellevest off the ground.Devotion, drive, determination; all women entrepreneurs (and aspiring business owners) have ‘em. But actually figuring out how to start your own business can be tricky. Do you just quit your job because you’re obsessed with your idea? Is this your new life now?

Sallie Krawcheck,Male,2024-01-27,"The Great Wealth Transfer is a colossal shift in who owns money in the United States. Right now, half of all wealth is held by Boomers. Over the next 20 years, it will be inherited. And women will control more money than they ever have. This gender shift is happening in two ways. Women tend to live longer than men, so more women Boomers will manage their wealth independently. Meanwhile, money will be handed down. Gen X will receive some, but the much larger millennial generation — with its record numbers of single women — will end up with most of it. Some sources have this amount of money at $84 trillion. Others say it’s closer to $129 trillion, thanks to government policy during the pandemic. And we don’t need to wait a generation, either: This is going on right now. In fact, by 2030, American women will manage at least $30 trillion, more than the national GDP.

(This is definitely one of my favorite things about the work that I do, btw.) Listening to what’s on your minds; soaking in the stories; hearing about your money goals and visions. At these gatherings, there tend to be recurring themes:  Everyone is falling somewhere on the concerned-to-anxious spectrum about the direction of our country, politics, the world, the climate. Almost everyone is feeling that they want to take some sort of action to shift the direction — but they aren’t sure how. Many are recognizing that their money is a form of power: That the wealth they've built can be used as a means to “vote” for a world that they want to live in. By how they donate it, certainly, but also by how they spend and how they invest it. There is a real desire to invest in other women, and a recognition of the collective positive impact that this can have on a broad range of levels: societal, economic, financial. 🤔 So what do we do? To date, the options have been pretty limited. At one end of the spectrum, one has been able to invest in the equities of public companies with better gender track records through a mutual fund or an ETF. At the other end of the spectrum has been angel investing in start-ups run by women and other underrepresented groups. 💪 Ellevest Private Wealth is bridging the gap between these two options. Here’s how. Our team of experts finds alternative investment opportunities through a second-to-none network of women investors and operators — and as a fiduciary, we take a rigorous approach to assessing the financial and social returns of each opportunity.  Our impact-focused investments break down some of the barriers that exist by offering clients more opportunities to find their own sweet spot between angel investing and traditional investments. 💸 ICYMI: Here’s what happens when you invest in women.  The research tells us that investing in women and the issues that disproportionately affect women can drive higher financial returns and positive impact. The bottom line: a better world.

Sallie Krawcheck,Male,2023-04-27,"Just checking in on how you’re holding up.You’ve probably seen some less-than-ideal headlines about the markets in your news lately. They can make any investor feel a little … unsettled.For those who need to hear it, I wanted to weigh in with a few gentle, every-so-often reminders.First reminder: As I’ve said before: If you don’t control your own money, you don’t control your own life.Second reminder: In a time when women’s progress has been limited (looking at you, persistent gender pay gap) or been reversed (glaring at you, reversal of women’s health care rights), building wealth is an obvious means for growing women’s power. Not to mention that reducing the gender wealth gap has been shown to improve just about everything it touches (communities, marriages, families, society). We know, without a doubt, that financial equality is essential to achieving real, sustainable gender equality.Which brings me to my third reminder: There have only ever been a very limited number of ways for people-who-don’t-find-a-unicorn to build wealth. You’ve gotta get your money to earn money on your money, through the power of compounding. Which you can do by buying a home or investing. And of the two, investing is (much) more approachable, because investing doesn’t require a big down payment or a mortgage. And the returns have historically been higher.That said, investing is not always smooth sailing, because there are no financial returns without risk. And last year wasn’t a great year for investing, with broader stock market measures down ~18-20%; last quarter was better, but the downfall of Silicon Valley Bank was pretty stressful. And First Republic was flirting with disaster before regulators stepped in this past weekend.And here’s a bonus reminder: Women investors outpace men, adding 0.5% to 1% in annual returns (depending on the study). That’s because women, more than men, tend to better “stay the course” and stay unruffled by the ups and downs of the markets.Not my opinion; that’s just a research-backed fact.So back to my first question: How are you holding up? For our Ellevest community, from where I sit, you’re doing pretty great.Read more about what to do with your money if you're worried about the economy on the Ellevest Magazine:",241,19,13,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAApgNwUBrPiN3Ni6Kx0QrLJbAceu1hjwzfc%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAApgNwUBrPiN3Ni6Kx0QrLJbAceu1hjwzfc&keywords=sallie%20krawcheck&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=892383d4-ac4d-4f1d-89ae-84463b5a06d9&sid=j1B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Here's what Brittany Holloway-Brown had to share about her experience working 1:1 with an Ellevest financial planner: “When I started, I was matched with Samantha Craig Vient, a senior planner with 15 years of experience. She started our first meeting with a single question: ‘Why now?’ The question cuts to the heart of a person's motivation. Is it fear? Is it reaching the next chapter of your life? Is it wanting to live a nontraditional life and figuring out how to fund it? It's a big step to open up your accounts to a stranger. I had anxiety about someone looking at my money habits.However, that's what Ellevest is here for. I was honest about my apprehension, and Samantha was quick to emphasize that she had no preconceptions of how I had to act or behave, and that it's important to turn the stress of feeling out of control over my finances into a vehicle that drove me to do better for myself.”Read the full article below, and learn more about our 1:1 financial experts at ellevest.com.",238,15,22,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAApgNwUBrPiN3Ni6Kx0QrLJbAceu1hjwzfc%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAApgNwUBrPiN3Ni6Kx0QrLJbAceu1hjwzfc&keywords=sallie%20krawcheck&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=892383d4-ac4d-4f1d-89ae-84463b5a06d9&sid=j1B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Sallie Krawcheck,Male,2023-07-27,"August 14 may be #FinancialAwarenessDay, but there rarely goes a day in my life where I’m not talking about, in some way or another, the importance of financial health — especially for women. We built Ellevest because we believe that your financial health is connected intrinsically with your overall health. It’s not just about dollars and cents — it’s about having control over your life, your choices, and your future. Deciding you want to take control of your money is the easy part. The tricky part can be figuring out how. It starts with establishing an essential set of habits and practices that create the lasting financial security and stability you need to design, build, and live the life you want. That includes checking in on your finances regularly, budgeting for spending *and* debt, investing a part of every paycheck, keeping a healthy emergency fund, and having an overall financial plan in place. What difference does this all make? Research shows that people with a financial plan have 3x the net worth of those who don’t. Triple the wealth!And for women, the difference is compounded — because we start out with less than men, have fewer financial opportunities than men, and end up with less than men. These gender gaps can be crippling: Women are more likely to end up in poverty in retirement than men. So if you don’t feel in control of your finances yet, today’s a good day to start.

Sallie Krawcheck,Male,2023-04-27,"By the time we launched Ellevest #PrivateWealthManagement, women had been telling us for some time: “I’m tired of supporting companies and institutions that don’t fully support me.”They told us the financial industry didn’t fully reflect them. That they didn’t want their money invested in places where they wouldn’t want their daughters to work. That they wanted their investments to reflect their values. And that achieving their financial goals was so much more important to them than whatever hot new investing trend people were buzzing about.So we dug into the research. And we found that these sentiments were pretty pervasive. For example:— 75% of women making more than $250,000 a year don’t feel in control of their money.— Women, particularly women of color, are still sorely underrepresented in the financial services industry, meaning a woman who needs a financial advisor most likely won’t be working with someone who reflects her. (This is despite the research that women investors post better performance.)— Women’s financial goals are often different from men’s (aka the standard offering). According to our latest Ellevest Financial Wellness Survey, women’s #1 financial goal is taking care of family, while for men it’s retirement (which is #4 for women).— When a spouse dies, 70%+ of women will leave the financial institution they shared within the first year.The evidence was clear: Something in our industry that has been working well for men has simply not worked for women.So we built the difference.Learn more about Ellevest Private Wealth — including our all-women team of financial advisors and best-in-class impact investing — here:",180,10,4,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAApgNwUBrPiN3Ni6Kx0QrLJbAceu1hjwzfc%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAApgNwUBrPiN3Ni6Kx0QrLJbAceu1hjwzfc&keywords=sallie%20krawcheck&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=892383d4-ac4d-4f1d-89ae-84463b5a06d9&sid=j1B&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Even as women claw back from pandemic-related hits to their employment, is AI yet another blockade that stands in their way?The biggest change — and one we likely aren’t ready for — that AI brings is the essence of automation. There’s a striking correlation between the types of roles that are being automated and the roles that are traditionally held by women. And there’s evidence that AI has a gender and racial bias.

Sallie Krawcheck,Male,2024-03-27,"Our new Ellevest Women and Wealth Survey 2024: The Great Wealth Transfer show that there is a fundamental shift that occurs when women receive a financial windfall: Their money confidence improves. How significant is this boost in financial confidence? • It’s so significant that it completely wipes out women’s well-documented money confidence gap. Receiving a financial windfall increases women’s confidence 1.8 times — from 45% reporting that they’re confident with money, to 81%. And it means that they become more confident about their ability to manage their money than even men are (at 77%).• It’s so significant that it obliterates the long-held taboos around women talking about money. 77% of women giving or receiving a financial windfall say they're comfortable talking about money with their families. This holds across generations, upending internalized money taboos.• It’s so significant that it propels women to leave relationships that no longer serve them. About 1/4 of women who have received or expect to receive a financial windfall say they're likely or very likely to leave their partner when or if they receive a financial windfall. That’s ~2x more than women who don’t expect to get a financial windfall.

Sallie Krawcheck,Male,2023-08-27,"Today is #National401kDay (yes, it's a real thing). And given our myriad of other responsibilities, women don’t prioritize planning for retirement as soon as men do. For example, in our Ellevest Financial Wellness Survey, men said saving for retirement was their #1 financial goal; for women, retirement was #4. #1 was taking care of their family. A third of women report that they never learned about retirement savings from any sources — including parents, a first job, or in school. (Missing out on all of that delicious compounding, due to starting later.)Layer in that we live longer; we earn less over our careers; we tend to serve as primary caregivers more often. Our earning power plateaus earlier. Hello, motherhood penalty / fatherhood bonus. These drawbacks come with real costs: it means that we have less margin for error.Perhaps it should be no wonder, then, given these facts, that the median 401(k) account for women is 65% lower than men’s. And there’s further pressure: With the resurgence of inflation over the past couple of years, nearly two-thirds of women say that will cause them to delay their retirement.The answer?

Perhaps even more of a wow is the financial confidence it can unleash for women.According to new research from the Ellevest Women and Wealth Survey 2024, receiving a transfer of wealth nearly doubles women’s financial confidence, to the point that they’re more confident about their ability to manage their money than men are. What will women do with this newfound financial confidence? Whatever they want. But also: Take control of their lives and their legacies. And likely change society when they do. After all, colossal change for women also means colossal change for everyone.The bad news? Hurdles remain: Women with financial windfalls don’t have the financial support they need.
