Thomas Helfrich,Male,2024-01-27,"Forbes published my article on 'Transforming Businesses with a Strategic Sales System'  !!!üöÄWhile this is a humbling honor, the true excitement lies in sharing the insights that can help your business grow.The core of the article ‚Äì and my passion ‚Äì revolves around implementing a strategic sales and marketing system for LinkedIn. It's all not just about leveraging social media and AI; it's about crafting a system that genuinely benefits our customers.A systematic approach brings clarity and efficiency. Here's a glimpse into the transformation phased strategy:Core Phase: Building a solid foundation by understanding your business goals and identifying your ideal customer using AI-driven data analysis.¬†¬†Connect Phase: This is where engagement happens. It's about forming genuine connections on platforms like LinkedIn and using AI to stay in tune with customer preferences and trends.¬†¬†Convert Phase: The final step is converting these connections into customers by presenting solutions tailored to their specific needs, fine-tuned by AI insights.Key elements of this system include niche focus, altruism in engagement, offering unique solutions, and the smart use of AI and modern offer theory.Pitfalls? Yes, they exist. An ego-centric approach, overly salesy tactics, misusing AI, and prioritizing growth over service can derail the process. The solution? Stay customer-centric and use AI as an enhancer, not a replacement for human insight.The result? Elevated engagement rates, higher conversions, and a significant ROI from social media efforts. Plus, a strong referral system adds the cherry on top, leveraging the power of word-of-mouth in our digital age.The future is bright for those who embrace a structured sales system in this digital era. Let's navigate this path together, transforming challenges into opportunities for unprecedented success!_____üôè I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this journey with you all.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-11-27,"I lost 140k followers in one day! (I could not have been happier about it...)Over 3 years ago, I embarked on a LinkedIn journey with a singular goal: build a massive following. Why? Because, like many, I equated a large following with success. It's easy to get caught up in the allure of vanity metrics and attention, isn't it?In the quest for numbers, I explored every shortcut, hack, and tech solution out there. The result? A staggering 175k followers in just a year. Impressive, right? Wrong. It turned out that a significant portion of these were not genuine. The landscape was riddled with scams, bots, and hollow numbers. It was a stark lesson in the pitfalls of chasing quantity over quality.Then, something remarkable happened. Last year, LinkedIn and LinkedIn Help stepped in and purged these inauthentic followers. Over 140k were removed in 24 hours, and you know what? It was the best thing ever. (Thank you!) It was a reset button to my approach on this platform. My network became relevant, engaging, and truly interactive.This shift in follower dynamics changed my focus on what really matters. No longer was I obsessed with numbers, but with how I could genuinely help others succeed on LinkedIn. I've discovered three key lessons that have reshaped my approach:1. No Shortcuts: Genuine growth takes time and effort. Hacking your way to a large following is a mirage.2. Add Real Value: Share knowledge you're confident about. Authentic insights resonate more than regurgitated content.3. Be Altruistic, Not Egocentric: Shift the focus from self-promotion to how you can help others.Today, as I celebrate reaching 35k genuinely engaged followers, it's not just about a number. It's about a community of meaningful connections and mutual growth. I'm here to help you navigate LinkedIn with the same authenticity that has enriched my journey.If you're looking to build a relevant and solid network, let's chat. I'm all ears for your aspirations and challenges. And if you think this message can help someone in your network, feel free to reshare.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2024-03-27,"Keeping promises is something we often talk about, but how frequently do we truly live up to this ideal, no matter the size or nature of the promise?I'm curious, have any of you made a promise that seemed small at the time but turned out to be more meaningful than you anticipated? I'd love to hear your stories!Here's a little tale from my side.  I promised my 9-year-old daughter that if my 'Never Been Promoted' YouTube Channel hit 1 million subscribers, I'd celebrate by getting the family personalized STANLEY mugs with our logo? Well, what started as a lighthearted moment turned into a touching family journey. Just 30 days later, while I was on a rare guys golf trip in Alabama, the first message I received at the crack of dawn on Sunday from my daughter was, 'It's Stanley ordering time' ‚Äî her excitement was palpable!She was so invested, tracking the subscriber count daily and even offering her creative ideas to boost it (kids today are so savvy, aren't they?). When the mugs finally arrived, it wasn't just about fulfilling a promise; it became a cherished family memory.This experience got me thinking and I'd like your thoughts too: the act of keeping a promise, no matter how insignificant it might seem, reinforces trust and strengthens our connections, be it in business, teamwork, parenting, partnerships, or just being a decent human.Have you found this to be true in your experiences? How do you ensure you keep your promises, and what do you do when you find you can't?Oh, and one more thing ‚Äì maybe it's just me, but doesn't water somehow taste better out of a mug that's filled with meaning?

I'm reaching out today to tap into the collective wisdom of this network and delve deeper into a topic that, as a digital marketing enthusiast, has piqued my interest considerably - the current state of backlinks in SEO strategy.Over the years, we've seen backlinks evolve from a simple 'numbers game' to a more nuanced, quality-driven aspect of SEO. However, the role they play in today's dynamic digital landscape is ever-changing. As someone who strives to keep up with these evolutions, I'd love to gain a more detailed understanding of how backlinks are perceived and utilized in contemporary SEO practices.Specifically, I'm interested in:1 - Are backlinks still as vital for SERP rankings as they used to be, or has their significance changed in Google's ever-evolving algorithms?2- How does the quality versus quantity argument stand today?3 - What are the current best practices for acquiring high-quality backlinks in a manner that complies with Google's guidelines?4 - Have you witnessed any novel trends or techniques in the realm of link building worth exploring?5 - How can we better measure and analyze the impact of our backlink strategies?I would truly appreciate any insights, links to vetted articles, case studies, or anecdotes you might have regarding these questions or anything else related to the topic.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-07-27,"What do an artist crafting a flamingo design on a hat and a business striving for potent lead generation have in common? More than you might think!üé® Have you seen this mesmerizing video of that artist swirling colors in a container and then brilliantly imprinting a flamingo on a hat? It's not only their technical skill that amazes us, but also their ability to see the hidden beauty in a blob of colors, their courage to experiment, and their dedication to their craft that makes the result truly magnificent. Similarly, as entrepreneurs and marketers, we are the artists of our business landscape. Our colors are the diverse skills we have, our hat is the market we aim to reach, and the flamingo - that's the unique value we want to imprint on our audience's minds. In the complex world of lead generation, we must allow our talents to shine through. üí°1Ô∏è‚É£ Understand your Palette: Just like the artist carefully selects the right colors, we must understand our tools and techniques - engagement, content marketing, social media, etc. Know them inside and out. Be confident in their application, and don‚Äôt be afraid to mix and match for the perfect blend. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create your Masterpiece: The artist didn't just splash random colors onto the hat; they had a vision - a flamingo. Similarly, we need a clear vision of our ideal customer. Who are they? What are their needs? Craft your strategy around them, paint a picture that resonates, and they will flock towards you.3Ô∏è‚É£ Master your Craft: No one becomes an artist overnight. It requires practice, patience, and a whole lot of perseverance. The same applies to lead generation. Stay on top of trends, continuously refine your strategies, and learn from your successes and failures.4Ô∏è‚É£ Let your Work Speak: The artist's work does the talking. The flamingo on the hat isn't just a design; it's a testament to their skill, creativity, and dedication. Similarly, let your services, interactions, and marketing efforts speak volumes about your business. Create an experience so delightful that your leads can't help but transform into loyal customers.Remember, we're not merely generating leads; we're creating relationships, fostering trust, and building a community. And just like the artist with the flamingo hat, we're creating something beautiful, impactful, and uniquely ours.So, let's pick up our brushes, mix our colors, and paint our business journey with bold strokes of innovation and creativity.

This might mean not speaking up in meetings, not volunteering for tasks, and refusing to work overtime. It might also result in greater absenteeism.""It's a bit controversial for some, but not for me.  I am not saying you should not do your job and collect a paycheck without adding value.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2024-04-20,"Never Been Promoted? Me Neither - Get advice from the guy with a cut tie, 2 thumbs, and one finger pointing at you with a creative (yet real) list of ways to never be promoted so you may launch yourself into entrepreneurship.1. Delegate absolutely everything, including your coffee runs and the tough task of deciding where to go for lunch. If a task requires more than two mouse clicks or a full sentence of explanation, it's above your pay grade.2. Treat your email inbox like a black hole. Emails go in, but they never come out. Set your out-of-office reply to, ""I am currently out of the office and will never return."" Only reply to those that can fire you.3. Always propose a meeting to discuss the next meeting. Bonus points if you can loop in departments that have nothing to do with the topic. The goal is to create a perpetual meeting loop where nothing gets done.4. Embrace casual Friday every day and take it to new heights. Think Hawaiian shirts for board meetings and flip-flops for client presentations. You're not just an employee; you're on a never-ending vacation from responsibility. 5. Be the most active on all company social media posts. No article, photo, or announcement should go without your insightful comment: ""Nice!"" or ""LOL üòÇ."" It's all about visibility!6. Develop a mysterious ailment that flares up during important deadlines or whenever someone mentions the word ""overtime."" It's crucial to keep them guessing whether it's chronic laziness or just an exotic virus.7. Gradually extend your lunch hour to a lunch afternoon. Return to work with no explanation other than a contented smile and a sun tan. Work-life balance is essential, after all. Leave as early as you can.8. Start every project with gusto and then slowly let the enthusiasm wane until it's unclear what the project was about in the first place. If anyone asks, you're ""pivoting to a new strategy.""9. During performance reviews, nod sagely while misunderstanding every piece of constructive feedback. Translate ""needs improvement in time management"" to ""needs more time to manage.""!0. Expense everything you can to the company. From pet grooming because your cat's stress levels affect your productivity, to meditation apps because a zen employee is a happy employee. Remember, it's about investing in your well-being for long-term gain. Live in the grey, But don't commit any crimes doing this.Enjoy and tag a frien that will appreciate this list.üëçLike ‚ôªReshare üîî Smash#neverbeenpromoted #entrepreneurship #beyourownboss #hrfails #ihatemyjob",17,4,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU&keywords=thomas%20helfrich&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=dacdeee3-e5db-4acb-901a-f38c03763a80&sid=Jjb&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-10-27,"üîî Exciting news! üîîI had the privilege of interviewing Jason Abell, the president of Rewire, Inc., on the latest episode of the Never Been Promoted podcast. In our conversation, Jason shared some incredibly valuable insights and advice for aspiring entrepreneurs and those looking to level up their careers. Here are my top three takeaways from our discussion:1Ô∏è‚É£ Invest in yourself: Jason emphasized that the best of the best are the ones who are willing to invest in their personal and professional growth. Hiring a coach can be a game-changer, so consider using your employer as your ""angel investor"" to support you on this journey.2Ô∏è‚É£ Mindset matters: Rewire takes a unique approach to coaching by focusing on mindset and ensuring that your thinking is aligned with your goals. It's essential to have the right mindset because no matter how skilled you are, if your head isn't in the right place, achieving success can be challenging.3Ô∏è‚É£ Niching and pricing: Jason stressed the importance of identifying your ideal client and niche. The more you niche down, the better you can understand your target audience and tailor your pricing accordingly. Remember, in order for others to value what you bring to the marketplace, you must first value it yourself.These takeaways only scratch the surface of the valuable insights shared in this episode.

Have you ever seen a sock-slipper combo so bizarre yet so irresistible?This cheeky sock trick may look like a good laugh, but it brings to mind a key learning from my own journey in social media lead generation. It‚Äôs about standing out, not fitting in. For anyone in the digital marketing trenches, you'll know just how crucial this is.I remember a campaign we did a while back, looking pretty much like every other campaign out there - following trends, mimicking 'what works'. But it was just that - a mimic. The results were as lackluster as you'd expect.The real growth happened when we kicked off the conventional shoes, went barefoot, and put on a sock that looked like no other.Now, isn‚Äôt this what our audience wants to see - a well-manicured, slipper-clad foot that dares to be different, that is unique, and that stands out from the sea of regularity? Isn‚Äôt that what leads to better engagement and meaningful conversations, that in turn create genuine leads?In the world of social media, it's easy to follow the herd. But experience has taught me that being different is what separates the men from the boys. And, often, it‚Äôs the odd, unexpected quirks that make us take a second look and stick around for more.So, what's your sock-slipper combo in lead generation?

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-11-27,"ChatGPT isn't helping you...In fact you are getting further and further behind...Ever noticed how some folks just zoom ahead when they start using AI, and others... not so much? I've been there, trust me. I spent half a year personally experimenting with GPT generated content.Here are the findings... three lines on a graph ‚Äì one orange, one blue, one green. The orange is your professional content creator.The blue is the average human. The green is the one that just doesn't get it. In the image you see they had relative differences but nothing too extreme.  Now toss AI into the mix. You'd expect all lines to go up as they do, but it's the talented that takes the hockey stick turn up.  Why?This is because talent plus accelerating technology is an exponential growth driver.  When you have limited talent, you will feel like you are going faster, but you are in fact, falling WAY behind. My own story? I was all in on GPT and have been for 3 years and have been running an experiment over the past 6 months. The findings: ChatGPT content does terribly when no thought is put into it. I proved this mid way through the experiment when I created content with personal insights, fresh takes, and trending topics. And bam! My content didn't just get better ‚Äì it quadrupled in awesomeness (vanity metrics and inbound leads). Even got a shout-out from the LinkedIn Editorial Team.So, what's the takeaway? AI's cool, but it's no stand-in for the human touch. It's the chef with the right ingredients, not the kitchen that makes the dish. Know your stuff, play to your strengths, and let AI amp up what you already rock at.Got your own AI story? I'm all ears.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-11-27,"Build the life you want‚Ä¶ - Arthur BrooksToday I went to a live leadership lab at hosted by Andy Stanley at Northpoint.org's main campus.   The guest speaker was Harvard professor and 13-time author, Arthur Brooks, discussed the art and science of becoming happier. He shed light on the reality of happiness in your 40s and beyond, explaining why it may not always be achieved despite all the indicators of a good life. He narrated stories of successful people who were not content with their lives.Arthur suggested three things to find happiness post 40. Firstly, find your second curve in life by focusing on fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence. Fluid intelligence refers to your analytical capabilities, while crystallized intelligence describes the experiential knowledge you acquire over your life. Secondly, have fewer wants. He gave a great metaphor of eastern art vs western art. Western art focuses on a blank canvas where you add more and more brush strokes, but eventually, you can't add anymore and end up with nothing new. On the other hand, in eastern art, you look at a massive jade boulder and chip away at it to reveal the art that lies within.Lastly, don't miss out. He painted another metaphor of a single tree vs an aspen stand. The single tree focuses only on its leaves while the aspen is connected all from its roots. Focus on your roots, the people in and around your life, and be present with them now.Overall, his advice was inspirational, and I am looking forward to reading his books and growing in my life to become happier.#behappy #balancedlife #entrepreneurlife #entrepreneurship #entrepreneur",12,5,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU&keywords=thomas%20helfrich&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=dacdeee3-e5db-4acb-901a-f38c03763a80&sid=Jjb&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Unconventional? Perhaps. But hear me out.Early in my career, my goals often felt like that elusive laser dot, seeming as intangible as winning a game of Jenga during an earthquake. But like our cat here, I learned to take gravity-defying leaps of faith. Scrambling up the business world wall, I've felt the exhilaration of the chase, the panting uncertainty, and the aftertaste of maybe a few too many espressos. And let's not forget the face-planting lessons learned from misjudged jumps - they add to the charm, trust me. Looking back, I wouldn't have it any other way. Each climb, each comical misstep, and even the dusting off and carrying on, they all made the journey worth it. I didn't always catch the dot, but hey, each chase led me somewhere higher, somewhere better.A question to ponder - are you chasing your goals with the same unwavering determination as this gravity-defying cat?#entrepreneurs #entrepreneurship #startups #strategy #smallbusiness #nonstoprelevance #neverbeenpromoted",12,1,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU&keywords=thomas%20helfrich&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=dacdeee3-e5db-4acb-901a-f38c03763a80&sid=Jjb&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-06-27,"Here's a thought: catching fish is a lot like generating leads.Sounds odd? Hear me out... First, you have to find the right spot, bait the hook, cast your line, and patiently wait. Often, just as a trout nibbles and you think you've got a winner, it slips away. Even worse?

The same heartbreak can occur in the business world.¬† So, where are we messing up? Let's dive into the muddy waters: - Using the wrong baitSometimes, we're not providing value that resonates with the leads. They need useful, valuable, and tailored content.- Casting a wide, impersonal netOne-size-fits-all doesn't work in the world of lead nurturing. Leads demand personalization, they want to feel special and understood.- Neglecting the waiting gameThe journey from a new lead to a sale is not a sprint, it's a marathon. Keeping the leads engaged, WARMED-UP, and building trust over time are key to avoid being ghosted. It's clear that the traditional fishing techniques are no longer serving us.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2024-03-27,"Three years ago, the notion of integrating faith into my business strategy seemed foreign, almost nonsensical. It was a time when the compass of my ambitions pointed squarely towards conventional measures of success.However, life, with its mysterious ways, has led me on a transformative journey. Perhaps it's the wisdom that comes with age, or maybe it's the unique season of life I find myself in‚ÄîI can't pinpoint the exact catalyst. What's unmistakably clear, though, is the profound shift within me. Today, I stand firmer, grounded in the belief that my business and personal endeavors must serve something far greater than myself.This evolution in perspective has not been without its challenges. Every day is a step forward in a journey that I know has no final destination. Yet, the changes within me are palpable. I've become happier, exuding a kind of joy that comes from knowing my work contributes to the larger tapestry of life.Kindness has woven itself into my interactions, driven by a newfound empathy and connection to others. The realization that we are all threads in the same fabric has deepened my sense of community and belonging.Despite these strides, I acknowledge the road ahead is long and winding. There's so much more to learn, to understand, and to improve upon. But the journey itself has become the reward. The shift towards serving a greater purpose has infused my life with a sense of fulfillment and peace that the younger me could have never imagined. As I navigate this path, I'm buoyed by the hope of not just achieving more, but being more‚Äîfor myself, my business, and the world around me. This is not just a phase; it's a profound transformation that's reshaping every facet of my life.share ‚ôªÔ∏è--> likeüëç--> smashüîî",12,9,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU&keywords=thomas%20helfrich&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=dacdeee3-e5db-4acb-901a-f38c03763a80&sid=Jjb&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-11-27,"Never do this on LinkedIn...Today, I'd like to share a negative experience that highlights a growing issue on our platform: spammy outreach tactics.Recently, I had an interaction with Olive Magramo (likely a fake or avatar account) from Akountify (Not Found on LinkedIn), which seems to be part of Obelisk Ventures.  The exchange shown in the images below encapsulates everything wrong with the brand-wrecking spammy nonsense going on with LinkedIn nowadays.üì© The Exchange:Olive reached out with a proposition to bypass LinkedIn's daily limits, using what appeared to be a scripted message. When I inquired further, the response was a blatant promotion of their services involving ""deploying real LinkedIn accounts"" for scaling campaigns. This not only felt automated but also struck me as an unethical way to manipulate LinkedIn's system.I can handle the first part of the exchange, the reach out, pitch slap, etc. - but the arrogance and rudeness at the end is the fuel of this post - insulting a prospect.  Maybe you read it as playful, or maybe you take it as I did - regardless, this ads an insult to an automated injury. üëâ My Takeaway:This experience is a stark reminder of how certain individuals and companies are choosing shortcuts over genuine connections, strategy, and engagement. Tactics like these not only spam our inboxes but also tarnish the reputation of the companies involved.What LinkedIn should do:Profiles and companies employing these spammy avatar strategies should be scrutinized and, if necessary, banned. LinkedIn is a platform for professional networking and growth, not a playground for questionable marketing tactics.What you should do:üìö Educate and Be Strategic:1 - Be Aware: Understand these tactics and recognize them. Education is the first step in combating spam.2 - No Shortcuts: Authenticity and genuine connections trump volume and automation.3 - Build a Solid Brand (and Protect It): Your brand's reputation is your strongest asset. Protect it by engaging ethically.4 - Report Spam: Help keep LinkedIn a professional and valuable space for all.Let's all work together to maintain the integrity of our professional network. Authenticity, respect, and ethical practices should be our guiding principles.Stay genuine - reshare if you agree and want to end these types of automated garbage.",11,20,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU&keywords=thomas%20helfrich&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=dacdeee3-e5db-4acb-901a-f38c03763a80&sid=Jjb&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-11-27,"Many individuals are choosing entrepreneurship over traditional jobs...Why - bad bosses, terrible work environments, and trends like the skit in the video...In the current corporate landscape, a growing trend needs urgent attention: the preference for personal connections over professional qualifications in hiring practices. This bias isn't just about who gets the job; it's about the broader impact on the workforce and the business ecosystem.Consider a scenario where qualified candidates like Susan and John are overlooked due to trivial reasons or biases, and instead, a less qualified personal acquaintance of the boss is hired. Such practices aren‚Äôt just unfair; they‚Äôre counterproductive. They lead to a workplace where merit is undervalued and diversity is not embraced.This environment is pushing many talented professionals to reconsider their career paths. Increasingly, they are leaving traditional roles to embark on entrepreneurial ventures where merit, innovation, and diversity are more valued. This shift is not just a loss to the companies that miss out on diverse talent; it's a wake-up call to reevaluate hiring practices.Entrepreneurship offers an alternative where individuals can create a culture that values talent and hard work over connections.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2024-01-27,"Time for a Change?In an age where technology reigns supreme, why do we still adhere to the archaic 9-5, 40-hour work week? This concept, a relic of the industrial era, was designed for assembly lines and agricultural needs - a time when daylight dictated productivity. But in the modern corporate world, is this still relevant?Consider the paradigm shift towards outcome-focused work cultures. Imagine a world where work-life balance isn't just a buzzword, but a reality. In this world, productivity isn't measured by hours spent at a desk, but by the results achieved. It's time to ask ourselves: Would a 4-day work week make us more effective? This isn't just about working less; it's about working smarter.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-07-27,"Stop guessing what to do on LinkedIn.It's not that hard. There are no shortcuts. Embrace your humanity first. üëá Every day, millions of users log onto LinkedIn to network, share content, and seek opportunities. But many are left scratching their heads, wondering, ""What am I supposed to post? How should I engage? How can I stand out amidst the cacophony?""There's a secret to navigating LinkedIn successfully, and it's not about mastering some mysterious algorithm or deploying the latest AI tool. It's about being human first, and leveraging technology second.1. Humanity Over AlgorithmsYour LinkedIn network isn't just a list of profile photos and job titles. Behind each profile lies a person with aspirations, challenges, and stories. Instead of aiming to impress a vague digital audience, visualize speaking to a friend, a colleague, or a mentor. Write, share, and engage in a way that feels genuine and heartfelt. Algorithms might determine reach, but genuine human connections determine impact.2. Share Authentic StoriesGone are the days when LinkedIn was just a digital CV platform. Today, it's a storytelling arena. Share moments from your career, lessons learned, and even those not-so-perfect experiences. Vulnerability and authenticity resonate more than a polished, flawless image. 3. Engage, Don't Just BroadcastIt's easy to post and forget. But the true essence of LinkedIn lies in engagement. Comment thoughtfully on others' posts. Offer support, provide insights, or just send a word of encouragement. It's in these micro-interactions that relationships are forged.4. Use Technology as an Amplifier, Not a CrutchYes, LinkedIn offers a plethora of tools, analytics, and features designed to boost your visibility and engagement. Use them, but don't rely on them entirely. Let these tools amplify your genuine voice rather than replacing it with a robotic echo.5. Listen ActivelyBefore jumping to post or comment, take a moment to listen. Understand what your network is talking about, what challenges they face, and what joys they celebrate. Active listening on LinkedIn can open doors to deeper, more meaningful interactions.6. Seek to Give, Not Just to GetApproach LinkedIn with a mindset of giving. Whether it's knowledge, opportunities, connections, or simply time ‚Äì when you give selflessly, you enrich the community and, in turn, enrich your own experience.7. Remember, People Connect with PeopleBrands, logos, and company names may catch attention, but it's the human stories and emotions behind them that foster real connections. So, present yourself as a multifaceted human being, not just a title or a job role.While the digital age tempts us to get lost in metrics, tools, and optimization hacks, let's remember the essence of LinkedIn: human connection. Embrace your humanity, let technology be your aide, and watch your LinkedIn journey transform.#leadgeneration #marketing #marketingstrategy",10,1,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU&keywords=thomas%20helfrich&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=dacdeee3-e5db-4acb-901a-f38c03763a80&sid=Jjb&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

As the sun sets on the illustrious career of a man whose fiery passion was only eclipsed by his unwavering commitment to excellence, we pause to celebrate the life and legacy of a coaching legend.An architect of champions a maestro of the hardwood, Coach Knight's tenure at Indiana University Bloomington was nothing short of legendary. With a coaching style as formidable as it was effective, he embodied the belief that success is not given but earned‚Äîno shortcuts, no excuses.For those of us who roamed the hallowed halls of IU during his reign, Coach Knight was more than just a figure pacing the sidelines; he was a North Star in a Hoosier sky, guiding his prot√©g√©s not just to victories on the court, but to success in life's grander arena. His booming voice echoed not only across Assembly Hall but also through the corridors of our aspirations, urging us to strive, to persist, and to conquer.While I did not have the privilege of knowing him personally, his presence was omnipresent, etched into the very fabric of IU culture. His tough, demanding approach was always tempered with a touch of humor‚Äîlike a Shakespearean character, complex yet profoundly impactful.As we look back on his monumental achievements‚Äî3 NCAA Championships, 11 Big Ten titles, and an Olympic gold medal among them‚Äîwe also remember the lessons imparted, the lives touched, and the indomitable spirit he instilled in all of us.So here's to you, Coach Knight. May your journey henceforth be as victorious as the legacy you leave behind.

Never been late. Never missed a payment. Always paid in full each month. Never asked for any consideration.Last Friday my payment was due.  Clicked the button to pay as I always do, and then thought nothing of it.I looked at the account today and got hit with a 40 late fee - Payment had hung on the internet connection and didn't send.Reached out to customer service and they said couldn't reverse the late fee because of my payment history (#wtf - never missed a payment and always pay in full for 22 years) and spending patterns (??? - they couldn't explain that one either).So my decision is to cancel the card, close the account, and end my relationship with American Express.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-12-27,"Go F%$k Yourself....Today, I want to share a little entrepreneurial wisdom with a twist of humor. Let's talk about the elephant in the room - our egos! Yes, those puffed-up, self-important parts of ourselves that can turn a minor hiccup into a business catastrophe.Remember the old adage, ""The customer is always right""? Well, in the world of entrepreneurship, it might as well be, ""The ego is often wrong."" Picture this: A high-profile entrepreneur (let's call him @Elon Musk) decides to respond to a business challenge not with calm strategy but with a fiery tweet that says, ""Advertisers, go F yourself!"" because they questioned and did not align with his public actions. Sounds like a scene from a sitcom, right?Here's the thing - our egos can be sneaky. They whisper sweet nothings like, ""You're always right,"" and, ""They just don't understand your genius."" But in reality, they're the little devils sitting on our shoulders, leading us down the path of poor decisions.So, what's the lesson here? It's simple: Don't let your ego drive the car. It's okay to make mistakes (we all do), and it's even better to learn from them. But when your ego takes the wheel, you might just drive your business into a wall.Instead, take a step back. Breathe. Remember that your business is bigger than your ego. Keep it light, keep it smart, and let's all have a laugh at those moments when our inner Elon tries to take over.Stay humble, stay wise, and here's to making smart decisions (with a smile)!----If you like the content, please ring the notification bell and give a follow.#Entrepreneurship #elonmusk #elon #EgoCheck #humility #businessstrategy #NeverBeenPromoted",8,9,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU&keywords=thomas%20helfrich&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=dacdeee3-e5db-4acb-901a-f38c03763a80&sid=Jjb&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Today marks April 20th, a date infused with a bit of rebellion and a whiff of legend. But there's a lesson in this hazy history that every entrepreneur should appreciate.Let‚Äôs roll back to 1971 when ‚Äú420‚Äù was just a time on the clock for a group of high school students, known as ""The Waldos."" These intrepid adventurers set out to find a mythical cannabis crop in California, using ""420"" as their rallying cry. Spoiler alert: they never found the crop, but they planted something far more enduring‚Äîa cultural phenomenon.Now, why should entrepreneurs inhale this story deeply? Because it's not just about the botanicals; it‚Äôs about the buzz! The Waldos started with a quirky idea, rooted in a distinct narrative, and passed it around their circle. Little did they know, they were cultivating a brand that would one day be celebrated worldwide. Their story teaches us the power of viral marketing‚Äîbefore social media even existed!As you navigate the entrepreneurial highs, remember the tale of 420. It's all about planting the seeds of your quirky, bold ideas and nurturing them until they catch fire and spread. Be like the Waldos: they may not have found what they were initially looking for, but they ended up setting a trend that redefined cool.So, spark up your creativity and let your business ideas grow wild. You never know‚Äîyou might just become the next big thing people are toking, uh, talking about around the world.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-07-27,"In his enlightening piece, Ed Juline shares his intriguing three-month journey exploring the world of marketing and sales automation tools used on LinkedIn. Ed, like many of us, started noticing an increasing wave of seemingly automated LinkedIn connection requests and messages. Wanting to peel back the curtain, he reached out to these senders, inquiring about the automation services they employ.Interestingly, 70% of these exploratory queries were met with silence, suggesting the depth of automation involved. Among the messages he received, many opened with standard greetings and statements of shared interests or traits, further fueling Juline's belief of their automated origins. Few claimed they were operating manually. The tools identified were quite varied, with names like Dux-Soup, Copilot, Zymplify, HubSpot, Powerconnector, Ulinc, and Sendzilla emerging.Through his experiment, he raises a significant concern - the looming 'LinkedIn message fatigue.' As he describes it, users might start to ignore these robotic communications due to their impersonal nature and low response rate. In a thought-provoking conclusion, Ed warns that the current use of automation in sales and marketing may soon meet its end if these trends persist.I found this interesting because I am hosting an audio event on the same topic now 3 years later!

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-11-27,"I enjoy true freedom - not just financial, but the freedom to make choices that align with my values and aspirations.Ever heard your boss say, ""We're not just colleagues, we're a family""? Sounds great, right? But let's get real for a second. When you really need them - say, if you're in a jam or dreaming about that family vacation - does your 'work family' actually step up? Or are you met with a polite, ""Sorry, can't help""?Here's a thought: what if, instead of relying on a fictional corporate family, you took the reins of your life and career? Imagine a world where you're not just working for a paycheck, but building a life that you're passionate about. Where 'family' means the people you choose and the dreams you chase.I've been there, in that 9-5 grind, believing in the 'work family' myth. But then, I decided to break free. Now, I run my own business, wrote a book, and have a successful monetized podcast.So, here's my invitation to you: Step out of the shadows of false promises and into a life where you're the boss, not just of your business but of your destiny. Check out how I did it and how you can too. Because at the end of the day, the only 'work family' that truly has your back is the one you build yourself.____Like this content?- Give a like on the post- Leave a comment - Follow Never Been Promoted  - Ring the bell on my profile Thank you!#Empowerment #Entrepreneurship #BeyondThe9To5 #RealFamilyValues #NeverBeenPromoted",7,6,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU&keywords=thomas%20helfrich&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=dacdeee3-e5db-4acb-901a-f38c03763a80&sid=Jjb&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Today, I'm not here to promote anything; instead, I want to share a piece of my heart‚Äîthe genuine love and the undeniable struggles that accompany the entrepreneurial journey.My journey as an entrepreneur feels like steering a ship through uncharted waters. It's a relentless quest to find harmony between my passion-driven late nights and those irreplaceable moments at the dinner table with my family.This journey is about balancing the pursuit of my dreams with being present for my spouse and children. It's about enduring financial uncertainties and sleepless nights, dedicating countless hours to work while constantly pondering over critical decisions. All these elements are woven into the fabric of my entrepreneurial life.What keeps me anchored in the face of these storms? It's resilience. This relentless spirit enables me to find the silver lining, even in the darkest clouds. The road is undeniably tough, filled with challenges like missed moments with my kids, dinner table conversations overshadowed by Zoom meetings, and the relentless pressure of financial stability.But my entrepreneurial journey isn't just about financial success. It's about the joy of creation, the thrill of innovation, and the deep satisfaction of making a difference. It's about building something enduring, something that impacts lives and tells a story of determination and passion.Entrepreneurship for me is more than a career; it's a lifestyle. It demands everything I've got and, in return, offers rewards in ways unimaginable.

You can't just hit and hope for the best. It requires insight, strategy, and a keen understanding of your target audience.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-07-27,"üí´‚ú®Has the entrepreneurial spirit been tugging at your heartstrings?  ‚ú®üí´ Let's start by watching this awe-inspiring video (linküëá) of a talented woman bringing life to her art with just a piece of chalk. üé®üí´In minutes an image of beauty emerges. It's an incredible talent, isn't it? But here's the golden nugget: What you see as an effortless talent started as a tiny seed of passion and grew through countless hours of practice, resilience, and dedication. Just like the woman in the video, every successful entrepreneur starts with a raw talent or skill - a seed of passion. It might not seem much at the outset, but it‚Äôs the heart and soul of every entrepreneurial journey. Now, WIIFM (What‚Äôs In It For Me), you ask? Well, you too have talents unique to you, waiting to be discovered, nurtured, and honed. Maybe you have a knack for designing, coding, writing, or even organizing things better than most people do. Your talent could be anything, as long as it's something you love doing and gives value to others. Turning this talent into a profitable venture is like the woman in the video chalking her artwork - it requires practice, dedication, and resilience. She didn't become a brilliant artist overnight, and similarly, no one becomes a successful entrepreneur in a day. It's a journey of continuous learning, adapting, and growing.The entrepreneur you are meant to be is not someone who has it all figured out from day one. It's someone who is brave enough to discover their unique talents, to nurture them, and to continuously adapt and grow. It's someone who has the courage to start chalking their own unique image on the pavement of the business world. So, go ahead! Start today. Discover your talent. Nurture it. Fail, learn, adapt, and grow. Your entrepreneurial journey begins with that single chalk of talent in your hand. What image of success will you draw with it? Start ""chalking"" your path today, entrepreneurs of tomorrow! Your dreams are waiting for you on the other side of fear and uncertainty.üíñ‚ú®Need help discovering your talent?

It's more than just an adrenaline-packed spectacle, it's a perfect metaphor for an effective lead-generation strategy.Remember those days when we'd jump headfirst into business, just like our daring diver? I certainly do. But as we all learned (some of us the hard way), you can't simply take the plunge without knowing the depth of the pool.Just as our high-flying friend strategized his descent, we must strategize our lead generation. Each tier of the pool represents a different stage of the funnel ‚Äì top of the funnel (awareness), middle of the funnel (evaluation), and bottom of the funnel (conversion).One must master the art of gracefully transitioning potential leads from one stage to the next, just as our diver seamlessly navigates the tiers. It's about maintaining momentum, balance, and making calculated moves to ensure a smooth landing ‚Äì the ultimate conversion.Every splash I made, every belly flop, taught me the importance of nurturing my leads, understanding their journey, and guiding them to make that final leap of faith.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-06-27,"Let's talk about the big elephant in the room: budget constraints. It‚Äôs a universal language we all speak.¬† As reported by Profit from Tech, 58% of startups have around $25,000 to play around during the startup phase.And here's the kicker: only 40% of them step into profitability.¬† Time to abandon ship? No, just ""Let's mass market everything"" mindset. You know, throwing money at fancy ads like confetti at a parade. For startups, that's about as effective as a chocolate teapot. So, what's the alternative? Here are my tips: ¬†- Be agile. Time, resources, and money are scarce in the startup world. Use them wisely, and your chances of survival go up. Think lean, mean, efficiency machine.- Build a community. Instead of marketing to the masses, focus on a niche. Foster a community of engaged, loyal customers who love your product as much as you do. Trust me, they're worth their weight in gold.BONUS TIP: Don't be a faceless brand. Be personal, connect with your audience, understand their needs, and provide value. The ROI on relationships is much higher than you'd think. In conclusion, it's not about how much money you have. It's about how you use it. Agile, not massive, is the new mantra.¬† For more wisdom on how to navigate the startup world with all its quirks and challenges, visit our website at www.instantlyrelevant.com.¬†¬† #entrepreneurs #entrepreneurship #startups #strategy #smallbusiness#nonstoprelevance #neverbeenpromoted",5,14,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU&keywords=thomas%20helfrich&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=dacdeee3-e5db-4acb-901a-f38c03763a80&sid=Jjb&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-11-27,"The best friend boss - yikes!As an entrepreneur, I've learned the importance of creating boundaries and being respectful of the employee-employer relationship. It's crucial to remember that while being approachable and friendly is beneficial, maintaining a professional boundary is key to successful leadership.From my experience, the first step is to set clear expectations from the outset. This involves communicating your role as a leader and the responsibilities that come with it. It's also important to understand and respect the personal space and professional ambitions of your employees. Encouraging open communication is vital, but it should always be within the context of a professional relationship.Another aspect is leading by example. Show respect in your interactions and decision-making processes. This sets a tone for the entire team and creates an environment of mutual respect. Remember, your role is to guide, mentor, and make decisions that are in the best interest of both the employees and the company.It's also essential to acknowledge the power dynamics at play. As a boss, your words and actions carry weight, and it's important to be mindful of this in your interactions. Avoid creating situations where employees feel obligated to participate in non-work related activities or discussions due to their relationship with you.Finally, always be open to feedback. Sometimes, despite our best intentions, we may cross a boundary without realizing it.

During my tenure at my previous organization, we experienced not one, not two, but three such moments. These challenges had the potential to completely derail us, but instead, they became defining moments that paved the way for our remarkable journey as a successful IPO company.ü§î What made the difference? It wasn't luck or mere survival instincts, but rather a mindset of unwavering determination and the ability to rise up to the occasion. Here are the key takeaways from our experience that can guide you towards achieving IPO success:1Ô∏è‚É£ Embrace the Tiger's Gaze: Recognize that moments of adversity are opportunities in disguise. They push you to tap into your fullest potential and uncover hidden strengths within your team. Instead of backing down, face the challenges head-on with courage and a fierce spirit.2Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic Navigation: When faced with a potential company death, a clear-sighted strategy is paramount.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-05-27,"Staying ahead of the game means spotting and filling gaps in your niche market. How do you do that? I'm sharing these 3 strategies to elevate your market analysis and give you a competitive edge:- Surveys & InterviewsWant to tap into the minds of your target audience? Go straight to the source! Conducting surveys and interviews helps you understand their pain points, desires, and unmet needs. - High-Intent Keywords: The digital realm holds a wealth of information, and understanding how your potential customers search for solutions is key. Look for phrases that indicate a strong intention to purchase. These keywords are the breadcrumbs that will guide you toward untapped opportunities and unexplored niches.- Competitor Analysis: Keep your friends close, but your competitors even closer! Analyzing your competition is not about copying their every move; it's about learning from their successes and failures. Investigate what they offer, how they position themselves, and most importantly, where they fall short. Identify gaps in their products or services and seize the opportunity to offer a unique value proposition. In other words, step into the niche, and own it!#marketing #nichemarketing #entrepreneurship #startup #strategy#nonstoprelevance #instantlyrelevant",3,2,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGOfVEBWgldhLmFyii51qvvI5RpCSUcAoU&keywords=thomas%20helfrich&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=dacdeee3-e5db-4acb-901a-f38c03763a80&sid=Jjb&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Your lead generation feels like shooting in the dark - hit or miss, mostly miss.Imagine transforming those NPS into a robust lead generation strategy.

Time for some quality feedback sessions and turning them into your biggest advocates.Engage and PersonalizeUse the feedback to engage in meaningful conversations. Personalized follow-ups make people feel heard and valued - turning them into leads.Incentivize the Promoters: Offer something more than just a 'thank you' to your promoters.

When Baby Delivery Becomes a DIY Project üçºYou know those first-day-at-work games where everyone goes, ""Tell us one interesting fact about yourself""? Yeah, well, my trump card is one that usually steals the show.So, picture this: a tranquil labor and delivery room in a major hospital. It's early in the morning. The ambiance is all set, and we're waiting for our third child to make her grand entrance. And then... *ta-da*... she does! Except... there's a teeny, tiny, somewhat significant detail that's missing. The doctor. And the nurse. Oh, and basically any medical professional.That's right! Yours truly played an unexpected starring role in the delivery saga. A real DIY birthing experience. While most parents are making last-minute nursery preparations or reading ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" for the tenth time, I was busy mastering the subtle art of unassisted baby delivery (Disclaimer: Not a recommended or planned practice).Turns out, my daughter was in quite a rush, earning her the title of a ""precipitous birth"". Who knew that was even a thing, right? Well, I certainly didn't... until that day.And speaking of discoveries, did you know how a freshly born baby feels? Like a dolphin that's decided to take a spa day. Warm skin, a lotion-like feel, and oh, so surreal! But then, just like any spa day, you're left feeling a little... sticky. üòÑNext time you're in a room and someone asks you for a fun fact, give them a run for their money. Because while someone might have scaled Everest or swum with sharks, how many can say they've felt a newborn ""dolphin"" on their first DIY delivery day?Stay wondrous and embrace the unexpected!P.S. Massive shoutout to all the wonderful medical professionals out there. We'll always be grateful for you.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-11-27,"Are you more than just a CEO, Founder, or Entrepreneur?Have you caught up with the latest drama at OpenAI?It's not just a corporate shuffle; it's a lesson in leadership and culture.If you don't know what happened, here's the scoop: OpenAI's board decided to let go of CEO Sam Altman. But what happened next is mind-blowing.Over 700 OpenAI employees were ready to walk out the door. Can you believe that? They chose loyalty to a leader over the organization itself. Now, pause and think: What does this mean for you as an entrepreneur or leader?This isn't just about paychecks or job titles. It's about YOU, YOUR vision, and the culture YOU nurture. How are you creating an environment where your team can thrive, innovate, and feel genuinely valued?As of this update, Sam's back at the helm. But let's not miss the lesson here. How are you building teams that resonate with your vision? Are you underestimating the impact of your leadership style?Remember, it's not just about the product or service you're creating.

Thomas Helfrich,Male,2023-06-27,"Thinking about taking the entrepreneurial plunge but afraid you'll miss having a boss? Let's flip that thinking! Ditching the 9-to-5 means no boss keeping you in check. No one to rattle your cage when you're procrastinating and certainly, no one to bring you a cup of coffee with a side of pep-talk. Here's the kicker - that's not necessarily a bad thing.¬† Sure, there might not be anyone around to give you a pat on the back, but who says you can't do it for yourself? Start by decorating your workspace with sticky notes full of inspiring quotes, like a hustler's version of Pinterest. Create your own motivational mood board that screams ""Carpe Diem!"" every time you glance at it.Remember, entrepreneurship is a game where the toughest opponent you'll face is yourself. So put on your game face, prep your cheers, and remind yourself: ""I didn't come this far, to only come this far"".
