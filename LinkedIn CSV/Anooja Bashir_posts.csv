Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-03-26,"Don't tell me this is happening! ⚡ ⚡ Excitement doesn't even describe the whirlwind of emotions I experienced as I received the prestigious Inspiring Women Leader 2024 award ✨ at the #ETEconomicTimesWomenConclave. It was truly surreal to stand before the ever-inspiring #SushmitaSen, a woman I'd admired throughout my youth, and have her present me with the honor.When I hugged her on the stage, I felt this was ""The Moment"" - one of the most memorable. For a second, I thought, is it the twice-failed entrepreneur standing on the stage today? As a woman entrepreneur and business leader, I can attest that the path hasn't always been smooth. I have always been called a woman who has shattered the glass ceiling. From my perspective, I believe in 3 things: believing in making my dreams come true, never giving up, and working towards my goals which make my dream world into a reality. The 2024 ET Woman Conclave event was an outstanding one as it provided an opportunity for me to connect with a powerful network of accomplished women, and men of business acumen. Thank you, CA Tripti Shinghal Somani (तृप्ति ) and Womennovator for nominating me.The esteemed chief guest, BK Shivani, offered invaluable insights that resonated deeply with the audience. Meeting Ayesha Shroff & Krishna Shroff was the icing on the cake. Let me tell you, the power of manifestation is truly magical. I have always dreamt of these accomplishments, which I achieved through sheer determination and hard work.Today women are increasingly occupying leadership roles across diverse sectors like technology, finance, healthcare, & politics. This progress is fueled by a growing recognition of the vital role diversity & inclusion play in driving innovation and business success.Here are some key trends that highlight this positive shift:▶️ Greater Representation: There's a slow but steady increase in the number of women holding executive positions and board seats in corporations worldwide.▶️ Supportive Policies & Initiatives: Organizations are adopting policies to enhance gender diversity in leadership, such as mentorship programs, women's leadership training, and flexible work arrangements for better work-life balance.▶️ Recognition of the Gender Pay Gap: Companies are increasingly committing to equal pay for equal work and transparency in compensation to address the gender pay gap.▶️ Challenges in Retention & Promotion: Despite progress, women often face barriers to advancement into leadership roles, including unconscious bias and a lack of sponsorship.▶️ Entrepreneurship Growth: Female entrepreneurship is growing rapidly, yet access to capital remains a major obstacle.I believe today's women are winds of change, transforming the business landscape with their incredible leadership and thought processes.Share your thoughts on improving the representation of women in leadership and boardrooms.LinkedIn LinkedIn News India#events #entrepreneurs #india #networking",1778,240,16,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g&keywords=anooja%20bashir&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=4abafcd3-bdf1-49e6-8d85-73c1976063c5&sid=(B5&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-03-26,"The Evolving Marketing LandscapeBeyond the TextbookThe world of marketing is constantly changing, and a traditional MBA from a top school just isn't enough to guarantee a good job anymore. Today's employers seek candidates who can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application.Recently, I was invited as a keynote speaker at Woxsen University, discussing the transformative power of technological innovation in marketing. It was great meeting some wonderful business leaders at the Conclave, - Mr. Ravindran Reddy, Consultant and Ex. Vice President – Marketing of Hogar Controls; Mr. Preetam Patnaik, Head Of Marketing, CCL Products (India) Limited; Brigadier Inder Sethi, Head Of Faculty, College Of Defence Management; Mr. Harshavardhan Gaddalae, Managing Director, Medha Research and Consulting Private Limited. Truly an inspiring experience to converse with these veterans and witness the university's unique pedagogy.Conversing with Professor Pradip Ganguli and Dr. Saradhi Gonela, gave me a lot of insights about the University. I was particularly impressed by Woxsen's focus on preparing students to thrive in the professional ecosystem, not just equipping them with a degree. Their proactive student body further exemplifies this commitment.The industry offers exciting opportunities for fresh graduates, but to ensure career success, honing specific skills is crucial. Here are some of my top tips:▶️ Continuous Learning: Stay updated with industry trends, technologies, and best practices through ongoing education and professional development.▶️ Adaptability: Be flexible and open to change, as industries and job roles evolve rapidly.▶️ Communication Skills: Master both verbal and written communication to effectively convey ideas, collaborate with colleagues, and engage with clients.▶️ Problem-Solving Abilities: Develop critical thinking and analytical skills to tackle complex challenges and find innovative solutions.▶️ Time Management: Efficiently prioritize tasks, manage deadlines, and optimize productivity to maximize output.▶️ Networking: Build and nurture professional relationships, both within and outside your industry, to access opportunities and resources.▶️ Leadership Skills: Cultivate qualities such as empathy, integrity, and resilience to inspire and motivate others, even in challenging situations.▶️ Emotional Intelligence: Understand and manage your emotions effectively, as well as empathize with and relate to others, fostering positive relationships and teamwork.By focusing on these skills, individuals can position themselves for long-term career success and growth.P.S.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2023-12-26,"Building Impact 💫 UN GCNI Connects with MSMEs in Kochi! 💫 I recently had the opportunity to attend the UN GCNI event held at Crowne Plaza Kochi. This wasn't just another event; it was a bridge, connecting ambitious businesses with the global sustainability movement and proving that joining the UN isn't a distant dream.✅ The Core TeamIt was wonderful to connect with Ratnesh Jha who helped bust myths about how everyone considers it to be a tedious process to be part of the UN circle.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-03-26,"How did I turn my passion into a successful one ??The journey that took me to the epitome of glory - My entrepreneurial saga✨✨The road to success is paved with passion, but let's be honest, it takes some serious persistence to keep that passion burning bright!  I recently received the incredible honor of being named the National Fame Award Most Enterprising Women Entrepreneur of the Year (Branding & Communications).Standing there, holding the award from the ever-gracious Dia Mirza, all I could think about was my journey.It wasn't always glamorous red carpets and award ceremonies. There were moments of doubt, late nights fueled by coffee (and maybe a little bit of fear!), and roadblocks that seemed impossible to overcome. But through it all, the fire within – my passion for what I do – never truly went out.At the ceremony, I even had the chance to meet the legendary Alka Yagnik – and let me tell you, she's as radiant as ever! It was a surreal moment, a reminder that chasing your dreams can lead you to some pretty incredible experiences.The biggest takeaway from my journey and the key to unlocking your potential is persistence the fuel that keeps the fire of passion burning.Here are some pointers I've picked up along the way:▶️ Believe in yourself, even when no one else does. There will be doubters, but your unwavering belief is your greatest asset.▶️ Embrace the grind. Persistence doesn't mean blind optimism. It's about putting in the hard work, day in, and day out.▶️ Learn from your mistakes (and celebrate your wins!). Every setback is a chance to grow, and every achievement is a moment to savor.▶️ Never stop learning. The business world is constantly evolving, so keep your mind sharp and stay ahead of the curve.Remember, success isn't a destination.

For me, it's about integrating my two passions: work and cherished personal time.✅ Team Time Triumph 🌐In my view, team bonding is pivotal for cultivating relationships and sparking creativity. Working collaboratively on projects and celebrating small wins fosters engagement, fun, and enhanced productivity. Team members are more engaged, have more fun, and get more done when they work together on projects and celebrate even the smallest of successes.✅Family, My Unyielding Pillar 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 My family is my rock, offering strength and perspective in challenging times. Regular quality time with loved ones creates an invaluable support system crucial for navigating the hurdles of business.✅ Me Time, Non-Negotiable 🌿A place of refuge for self-renewal, my time is non-negotiable. Taking time for yourself, whether that's to read, relax, or pursue a hobby, is essential for avoiding burnout and keeping your mind sharp. I utilize the Pomodoro approach, which involves dividing my work into intervals and then taking brief pauses to maximize concentration, to keep myself on track and focused. An effective way to manage one's time is to use a tool like the matrix created by Eisenhower to prioritize one's duties.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-03-26,"“The greatest power of a woman is absolutely to be a woman”Have you ever thought of how women can multitask so wonderfully?I usually get this question a lot, what is my secret recipe for the wonderful ability to manage everything so perfectly 💫Let me tell you - I AM NOT A SUPERWOMAN 💃🏻Today we as women are being celebrated nationally and internationally. We are called superpowers and glorified worldwide ✨✨Who is this Superwoman? The myth of the superwoman portrays an image of a woman who flawlessly balances work, family, and personal aspirations. Yet, this idealized figure belies the complex realities women face daily. As Women, we tend to balance a lot of roles in our lives and the balancing act is a never-ending roller coaster. According to a write-up by Chetan Bhagat in TOI - 87% of our women feel stressed out most of the time. His words are so true that reality for women is far more nuanced. She is under pressure to be perfect.The truth is, that striving for this perfection sets an unattainable standard, fostering imposter syndrome, burnout and mental health struggles among countless women.But the reality is that - ➡️ Women still shoulder a disproportionate share of domestic labor, even with dual-income families (Pew Research Center, 2022).➡️ In the US, women earn 83 cents for every dollar earned by a man (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023).➡️ Women hold only 27% of leadership roles globally (Grant Thornton, 2022).So, on Women’s Day let us celebrate ourselves. We are diverse, and our journeys are unique. True strength lies in embracing our individuality.  We achieve our greatness through ➡️ Resilience: Overcoming challenges and bouncing back from setbacks.➡️ Collaboration: Supporting and empowering each other.➡️ Authenticity: Being true to ourselves and defying expectations.Instead of ""Superwoman,"" let’s celebrate the real women that we are. We are skilled and determined professionals, loving mothers, daughters, and friends, visionary leaders, and changemakers.We are not all the same, but we all deserve to be valued and empowered.This year, the Women's Day theme is 'Invest in Women: Accelerate Progress'I believe that by empowering our women, we also help to boost the economy of the nation. Our nation's dream of achieving a $5 trillion GDP is impossible without the substantial contributions of women. Despite constituting 48% of the population, women only contribute 18% to the GDP. While men and women may be physiologically distinct, both genders bring unique qualities that can propel our society and country forward. Together, we can forge a more inclusive and prosperous future.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2023-12-26,"Nurturing Minds, Building Resilience✨Embracing the Vitality of Mental Health💫🌟In the fast-paced whirlwind of modern life, as a founder, co-founder, leader, and mother, where every click and scroll demands our attention, the significance of mental health has never been more crucial. As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, the spotlight on mental health has intensified, reminding us that caring for our minds is vital.✅The Silent Battle It's easy to overlook the silent battles that individuals face within their minds. I have gone through anxiety, depression, and stress in life. But today I have realized Mental health is a priority, my happiness is essential too. The first step towards a mentally healthy society is acknowledging the struggles we face and fostering an environment where seeking help is not a sign of weakness but an act of strength.✅Breaking Stigmas To champion mental health, we must dismantle the barriers of stigma that surround it. Mental health is not a taboo; it's a shared human experience. By dismantling these barriers, we lay the foundation for a society that embraces mental well-being as an integral part of overall health.Today, let's hope for a society that values and nurtures mental well-being and is poised for resilience and innovation.Let's ask ourselves a question, how can we contribute to a culture that prioritizes mental health, fostering a world where everyone's mind can flourish?Share your thoughts below 👇🏻#mentalhealth #wellbeing #mindfulness #selfcare #mentalwellness #positivity #mentalhealthmatters #selflove #stressrelief #mentalstrength #mentalhealthawareness #staypositive #mindset #healthyliving #innerpeace #mindbodybalance #mentalclarity #selfcarematters #anxietyfree #mentalhealthsupport #positivevibes #wellnessjourney #positivemindset #mentalhealthwarrior #emotionalwellbeing #peaceofmind #selfcompassion #resilience #forbeswomen #licreatoraccelerator #flexicloud",902,87,11,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g&keywords=anooja%20bashir&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=4abafcd3-bdf1-49e6-8d85-73c1976063c5&sid=(B5&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-01-26,"From Zero to Shero: 👸✨✨My Startup Success Secrets⚡️⚡️Hey everyone! Since my chat with Sharan Hegde on The 1% Club - Finance With Sharan podcast, you've been asking how I bounced back from startup failures to success. It's a question I hear everywhere, so let's talk about turning ""Failure"" to ""Fabulous""!🌟🌟First, 70% of startups fail, right? Why? Is it bad tech or the wrong market?Well, here's my journey: two flops followed by tons of self-reflection. Trust me, understanding my mistakes laid the foundation for my current empire.Here's what I learned:✳️ Crystal Clear Vision: Your startup needs a roadmap, like a lighthouse guiding your ship. Set clear goals for each stage of the journey.✳️Strategic Playbook: How will you and your co-founders reach that vision? Define your business strategies like a well-written recipe.✳️Money Matters: Build a solid financial structure with a realistic ROI model. Think of it as the fuel that keeps your engine running.✳️Dream Team Assemble: Surround yourself with people who believe in your vision as much as you do. Invest time in building the right crew.✳️Grit & Guts: No startup journey is smooth sailing. You need resilience, patience, and passion to weather the storms.✳️Enjoy the Ride: Don't just obsess over the destination. Savor the journey, learn from every step, and watch your dream unfold.✳️Be Your Own Captain: Don't let others define your success. Follow your passion, chart your course, and the wind will carry you in the right direction.P. S.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2023-05-26,"Celebration of a Brand ⚡⚡ Where Vision, Team & Fun Converge💫Recently, I had the incredible opportunity to attend a meetup in Hyderabad, organized by the remarkable team at Keka HR. This gathering not only provided valuable insights but also served as a whiff of fresh air, brimming with enjoyable and unforgettable moments. ✅ The Real Startup SolutionThe journey of Keka HR has illuminated a fundamental truth about startups – the most impactful solutions often arise from the founders and their teams personally experiencing and overcoming the challenges they set out to solve. In the case of KEKA, the inception of their remarkable product was rooted in their encounters with HR issues during the early stages of their tech venture. ✅ The Incredible TeamOne remarkable aspect of Keka HR is the team's diverse expertise and extensive experience across various domains. From marketing to technology, product building to research, each member brings valuable skills to the table, creating the perfect recipe for a thriving startup. During my interactions with Dheeraj Kumar Pandey and ☑️  Barun Mallick, who have been integral members of the founding team since its inception, I witnessed firsthand their unwavering passion and dedication to propel KEKA toward becoming an impactful brand. The team's relentless drive to propel KEKA to new heights was palpable in my conversations with Rajnish Kumar, Balaji and Neeraj Kumar. Their energy and efforts exemplify their commitment to taking KEKA to the next level. ✅ The Beautiful Vision of the FounderThe founder, Vijay Yalamanchili, possesses a remarkable vision that showcases his deep understanding of the purpose behind KEKA. From the very outset, Vijay emphasized the importance of infusing an Indian touch into the brand. This commitment to incorporating the essence of India eventually led to the name ""KEKA,"" which carries the meaning of ""awesome"" in Telugu, a regional language. This choice of name reflects the founder's belief in creating an Indian brand that not only resonates locally but also offers a global solution.✅ The Exuberant EventThe two-day event held in Hyderabad was an incredible amalgamation of entertainment, insights, and joyful moments. The presence of Anmol Garg, the famous standup comedian, brought boundless laughter that left me in stitches. His hilarious performance had everyone laughing uncontrollably, creating an atmosphere filled with sheer joy and mirth. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Aishwarya Gairola and Rutika Gangwani for curating this amazing opportunity.  As I left Hyderabad, I carried with me a treasure trove of happy memories and meaningful connections.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-04-19,"What is the connection between the Ambanis' pre-wedding celebrations and a startup from Kerala? 💫 💫 A taste of Kerala flew in for the event! Cremberie, an emerging FMCG brand from Kerala led by my friend and fellow startup founder Nahaz Basheer, recently captured the spotlight by providing his products for the high-profile pre-wedding functions of Anand Ambani and Radhika. Over 10,000 single-serving yogurts from Cremberie, were airlifted to grace the occasion.Curious about the brand's triumph, during our recent conversation, I sought to understand how #Cremberie upholds exemplary packaging practices to address typical e-commerce challenges like shipping damages and product leakage. Here are some crucial strategies that FMCG startups may find valuable in optimizing their products for better e-commerce adaptability.▶️ Lightweight Packaging: Opt for lighter, more durable materials that reduce shipping costs and environmental impact, while still providing sufficient protection.▶️ Eco-friendly Options: Utilize sustainable packaging solutions that appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, such as biodegradable, recyclable, or reusable materials.▶️ Bulk Packaging: Offer products in bulk or multipack options, which can be more efficient for online sales and distribution, reducing the per-unit shipping cost and packaging waste.▶️ Enhanced Product Information: Provide detailed product information, including high-quality images, videos, and comprehensive descriptions online. This helps replicate the in-store experience and aids in purchase decisions.▶️ Tamper-evident Features: Incorporate tamper-evident seals or indicators in the packaging design to assure customers of the product's integrity upon arrival.▶️ Optimized Product Design: Redesign products specifically for online sales, focusing on size, durability, and packaging that's conducive to shipping and handling.▶️ Customized Packaging: Develop packaging that's designed for the unboxing experience, which is valuable for brand building in the digital space.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-03-26,"The Importance of Choosing the Right Co-FounderThe saying goes, ""Some bonds form in an instant, while others blossom over time.""  Finding a Co-Founder can be similar - sometimes it's a quick click (or should I say LinkedIn click), other times a gradual realization of a shared vision.Last week, Headstart Kerala's WeWin Kochi event at the Kerala Startup Mission provided a valuable platform to connect and inspire over 30+ founders and aspiring founders. I had the pleasure of participating on a panel titled ""Challenges and Action Items to Scale Business,"" alongside my esteemed co-panelist, Noureen Aysha. During the discussion, Mittu Tigi, who was the Moderator, posed a question I've encountered frequently. How can we choose the Right Co-founder for a successful business venture? What key skills should we seek in a co-founder?Before I go further, I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to my Co-founder, Vinod Chacko, & CFO, Binu Mathew, for being my pillars of strength & sharing my vision. Choosing a Co-founder for your entrepreneurial venture is a critical decision that can significantly impact the success & trajectory of your business. Here are some key considerations & skill sets to look for in a potential Co-founder:▶️ Complementary SkillsFind a Co-founder with skills that complement yours, such as pairing product development strength with business or marketing expertise, for efficient progress.▶️ Shared Vision & ValuesA Co-founder who shares your business vision & values is crucial for aligning goals & minimizing conflicts.▶️ Entrepreneurial SpiritLook for a Co-founder with an entrepreneurial mindset, marked by resilience, flexibility, & a readiness to take calculated risks.▶️ Leadership SkillsChoose a Co-founder with leadership skills and team management abilities, vital for guiding growth and ensuring a productive workplace.▶️ Financial AcumenIf finance isn't your strength, find a Co-founder skilled in financial planning, budgeting, and fundraising, crucial for startup success.▶️ Network and ConnectionsA Co-founder with a strong network can be invaluable, connecting you with clients, partners, and investors, especially in the early stages.▶️ Problem-solving SkillsIn startups, a Co-founder with strong problem-solving skills is crucial for creatively & efficiently overcoming challenges.▶️ Commitment and PassionYour Co-founder should match your commitment and passion for the business, as this shared dedication is crucial. Finding the right Co-founder is like entering a marriage in the business world. It requires careful consideration & a shared commitment to the journey ahead. A huge shoutout to Sana Thayyil for beautifully coordinating the event.

Here’s what they are, and how they can be addressed. Let me spill the beans, my fellow tech community! Today, I'm here to share how I carved out a space for FlexiCloud.in in the jungle of startups.As a Co-founder of FlexiCloud, a managed cloud hosting platform, let me address some key challenges faced by tech startups in India involving several critical aspects:⏩Highly Competitive Market ⏩Scalability Challenges⏩Customer Education and Engagement⏩Customer Acquisition and Retention⏩Global Expansion⏩Rapid Market Shift⏩Securing Funding To stand out in a competitive market and adapt to tech challenges of how to do the marketing and position was indeed a tedious task. But disrupting the cloud domain by bringing in a differentiator by creating a PAAS platform with the end user getting the choice to select the cloud provider, location, application, and server. Here are the effective strategies that we adopted to scale our business.  ➡️ Conducted Market validation to confirm the demand for a managed cloud hosting platform, catering to the needs of small and medium-sized businesses lacking in-house cloud expertise.➡️ Built an exceptional team by fostering a robust company culture, providing competitive compensation, and offering growth and learning opportunities, which enabled us to attract and retain highly skilled talent.➡️ Effective marketing collateral and videos were developed to raise awareness and educate potential customers about the advantages of our product.➡️ Designed a user-friendly PaaS platform for startups, SMBs, and SMEs, guaranteeing 99.9% uptime, top-notch security, and backup options, all while allowing users to choose cloud settings, server sizes, and applications.➡️ Our go-to-market (GTM) strategy involved collaborating and forming strategic partnerships, leveraging networking opportunities.➡️ Adopted the right marketing strategies to enhance visibility and attract our target audience, implementing them across various channels, including our website and social media.➡️ Ensured steps to protect our intellectual property rights from potential infringements.We didn't just believe in it, we lived it. We hustled hard, brainstormed like crazy, and changed course faster than the caffeine we drank.We weren't mere dreamers; we were proactive doers Our emphasis on utilizing our distinctive value proposition, promoting innovation, strategic planning, and efficient execution enabled us to generate significant value in the market, resulting in a remarkable 5x growth within 3 years.

Inspirational women entrepreneurs are breaking barriers and leaving an indelible mark in diverse fields, including Bollywood! 🎬 The world of entertainment is no longer just about acting, singing, or dancing. Today's actresses are also savvy entrepreneurs, building their own brands and investing in promising start-ups. This trend is not just about diversifying their income streams; it's also about using their influence to make a positive impact on the world.As a a woman entrepreneur, I feel proud today to see women from different backgrounds coming together despite prevailing stereotypes, they are excelling in areas like negotiation, problem-solving, and decision-making. These traits translate into workplace success, proving that the future is indeed female.✅The New Breed of InvestorsToday social media has given actresses a powerful platform to connect with their fans and promote their brands. They have more opportunities to learn about business and finance than ever before, also there is a growing demand for products and services that are endorsed by celebrities.✅The Game ChangersEarlier there seemed to be a notion that acting has a shelf life. Today they are pivoting from acting to entrepreneurship, mentorship, investors, championing social causes, and many more. Some are launching their own brands, such as Katrina Kaif's Kay Beauty cosmetics line and Alia Bhatt's Ed-a-Mamma clothing brand. Others are investing in start-ups, such as Deepika Padukone's investment in the fitness app FrontRow, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas's investment in the hair care brand Anomaly. These are just to name a few.They are here to stay. They are the risk-takers, the visionaries, and the dream chasers. With their influence, resources, and business acumen, actresses are well-positioned to make a significant impact in the world of entrepreneurship. 🌈✨Ghazal Alagh Vineeta Singh Falguni Nayar Madhura DasGupta Sinha Dr. Harbeen Arora Rai Shradha Sharma Mabel Chacko Deena Jacob Sanjjanaa Galrani Smriti Chaudhry 🚀 CA Tripti Shinghal Somani (तृप्ति ) Kalki Subramaniam 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 Anushka Iyer Chaitsi Ahuja Aditi Anand Neha K Puri Tejaswee Tripathy Deeksha Ahuja Avneet Kohli Eashita Maheshwary Vinitha Joseph 🌏 Shreya Ghodawat Ⓥ Dr Lini Basil Elizabeth Jean Thomas Jean John Noureen Aysha Nita Menezes Anisha Singh Anisha Cherian Urvisha Koradia Aysha Ruby CMA Pushpy Muricken FCMA LLB ..

Anooja Bashir,Female,2023-09-26,"Elevate, Engage, Excel with Strategic Video Marketing! 📈📽️ Video Marketing - the new age emerging driving force behind brand success. It's a game-changer, but here's the catch – posting just video content alone won't cut it. To truly make an impact, you need a well-crafted video marketing strategy that hits the mark. Videos, when strategically marketed, have the incredible potential to go viral and captivate your audience. Take the infamous LG prank video, for instance, which was viewed by nearly 40 million people! It wasn't just entertaining; it ignited conversations across social media platforms. Imagine a simple prank turning into a brand conversation starter! That's the power of strategic video marketing – it boosts brand image, increases viewership, and demonstrates product efficacy like never before. As a brand strategist, allow me to offer some valuable tips:✅ Understand Your AudienceStart by understanding your audience's preferences and needs. While expanding your target demographic can be beneficial, it's essential to grasp what your current audience craves. ✅ Plan, Plan, PlanEvery video, whether it's a heartwarming Coca-Cola Christmas ad or a high-energy Nike promo, needs careful planning. Consider timing, relevance to events, and the customer journey when devising your content strategy. ✅ Storytelling MattersPeople love stories! Incorporate storytelling into your videos. Brands excel at seamlessly weaving product placement into compelling narratives that capture attention and boost sales. ✅ Production SimplifiedYou don't need a Hollywood production team to create impactful videos. Many free resources and video editing tools are available to help you craft high-quality content without breaking the bank. Video marketing is evolving at an unprecedented pace, and the key to success lies in strategic planning, engaging storytelling, and cost-effective production.

But what if I told you that sometimes, the seemingly trivial moments of small talk can be the catalyst for greater success in your team ?? ✨✨I recently saw a humorous Shraddha Jain (aiyyoShraddha) ad shared by a LinkedIn connection. It made me reflect on how seemingly trivial conversations can offer motivation and relief to others.The small talks and casual chats that occur in the workplace, such as those in the pantry or during team lunches, are often undervalued. Nevertheless, they are essential for fostering collaboration and teamwork. These informal interactions enable you to establish personal connections with colleagues and can greatly impact your organization's success ⚡️⚡️💫 Why it Matters:✅ Building Trust Small talk creates a comfortable environment, where team members can share not just ideas but also personal experiences. This trust is the foundation of strong collaboration.✅ Boosting Morale A cheerful chat about hobbies, weekend plans, or family can make the workplace a happier and more productive space.✅Resolving Conflicts Small Talk can help identify potential issues early on and lead to open, honest discussions that prevent bigger problems down the line.✅ Sparking InnovationInnovative ideas often arise from unexpected conversations which in turn cultivates an atmosphere of creativity.✅ Team CohesionSmall talk brings people together, strengthens bonds, and turns colleagues into a united team.For this, the mindset doesn't require a fancy title or extensive training. It's as simple as asking, ➡️ How was your weekend?➡️What's new with you?It's about listening actively and engaging with your team members on a personal level.Inspire your team with THE MAGIC OF SMALL Talk 💫💫And Watch your Organization Thrive ✨✨💬 Share your COST experiences!

Anooja Bashir,Female,2023-10-26,"Empowering Growth Through the Right Team ✨Navigating Business Scaling with Strategic HR Platforms 💫“For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack” From The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling is a favorite quote that resonates with my belief in the power of Teamwork.In the dynamic world of business, with over a decade of experience as a founder, I've been actively shaping the destiny of my ventures. I firmly believe that hiring plays a pivotal role in the growth of a business. Having a dedicated HR professional is of great relevance, as it extends beyond finding skilled individuals; it's also about aligning with people who resonate with the same vision and values your company upholds.📌Why Values Matter 📶In my experience with hiring, I've encountered many talented individuals—tech whizzes and creative minds. However, when bringing someone into the team, I prioritize more than just their skills. It's crucial to ensure they not only align with our company values but also possess the ability to collaborate effectively within a team. I see teamwork as a car with four wheels; each wheel is indispensable, and they all must work together harmoniously.📌 Brand Ambassadors 🚻Our team members go beyond mere staff; they personify our company. Their approach to handling situations, adept problem-solving, positive attitude, and crisis management are highly significant. I firmly believe that those exemplifying excellent organizational manners are the backbone of our company. In addition to this, I must say, that the human resources department also plays a crucial role in representing the organization to the outside world, acting as the primary point of contact for anyone seeking to connect.📌 The Real Heroes 🎦As the founder and CEO, recruiting has always been a challenging puzzle to solve, akin to finding the right pieces for a puzzle. However, with the support of my HR team and the assistance of the Keka HR platform, the process has become much smoother.

As a founder, you'll wear many hats, from leadership and decision-making to problem-solving and operations. 🫵🏻 Are you ready to embrace diverse roles and step outside your comfort zone?🫵🏻 Have you built a strong support system?

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-04-19,"Leadership Wisdom Unearthed in Inspiring Reads ✨How can books inspire you, perceive things deeply, and teach the art of detailing??⚡️⚡️There's something truly irreplaceable about curling up with a physical book.   It's no wonder I love reading such a wide variety of genres, from mysteries that keep me guessing to insightful business books that fuel my entrepreneurial spirit.  Today, I want to share some of my recent favorites that might pique your interest too!➡️Crime Thrillers▶️ The Sherlock Holmes series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is my favorite in crime fiction. The first book, ""A Study in Scarlet,"" introduces the iconic detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson in 1887. I'm especially captivated by Holmes's sharp deduction skills, where he masterfully pieces together clues to solve mysteries.▶️ Stieg Larsson's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" skillfully combines murder mystery, family drama, romance, and financial scandal into a compelling and richly detailed story. ➡️Motivational Reads▶️ ""The Alchemist"" is my favorite motivational book, known for its messages about pursuing dreams and seizing opportunities. It emphasizes perseverance, heeding our inner voice, and reading life's signs, making it an essential guide for those seeking inspiration and direction.▶️ James Clear's ""Atomic Habits"" offers a powerful roadmap for personal growth. By focusing on tiny, achievable changes, the book guides readers in building good habits and breaking bad ones. ▶️ ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie is yet another favorite in the motivational genre It is a classic for a reason as it focuses on interpersonal skills, communication, and the power of persuasion, influence, and empathy remains relevant even today.➡️Strategic Management & Leadership▶️ ""Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters"" by Richard Rumelt is an exceptional recommendation as it distinguishes sharply between genuine strategic planning and simple wishful thinking, offering deep insights into the elements of a truly effective strategy.▶️ ""Blue Ocean Strategy"" by W. Chan Kim & Renée Mauborgne is a must-read for any business leader looking to break away from the competition and create a new market category.▶️ ""Leadership and the Art of Struggle"" by Steven Snyder explores how effective leadership involves overcoming challenges and celebrating victories. It emphasizes the importance of embracing and learning from struggles to lead effectively and make a significant impact.These books each offer unique insights into their respective fields, whether it's the thrilling deductions in crime fiction, the motivational push toward personal growth, or the strategic depth in leadership and management.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-02-26,"A recent survey by Randstad indicates that employees in India are proactively seeking to upskill on their own accord, driven by the competitive nature of the job market. Self-directed professional growth arises as an alternative to relying solely on prestigious MBAs, like those from IIMs, to address current employment challenges. Meanwhile, firms like Deloitte are prioritizing the recruitment of candidates with substantial experience, rewarding them with higher salaries and enhanced benefits. This approach underscores a growing preference for experienced professionals over new graduates in the workforce.Recently I engaged in an interactive panel session at MECCA - The Marketing Club of Goa Institute of Management (GIM) with some wonderful panelists Pubali Sarkar, Arshia Dar, Padmini Janaki & Rashika Saraswat. We discussed the significance of data-driven storytelling. It was amazing interacting with the students as well, many of whom were curious about the essential skills B-school graduates need to succeed in today's competitive job market.                                                                          Given the challenging employability landscape in today's unpredictable economic environment, here are the essential skills MBA newcomers should concentrate on enhancing:                                   ▶️ Crisis Management and Adaptability: Mastering crisis navigation & leadership demands strategic foresight, risk management, & adaptability to swiftly respond to evolving business landscapes.▶️ Leadership and Team Management: Fostering leadership to inspire teams towards goals & boost collaboration in diverse and remote setups. ▶️ Innovation and Creative Problem-Solving: Developing the ability to think innovatively & craft novel solutions to intricate business problems, while fostering an entrepreneurial spirit to seize new market opportunities.▶️ Emotional Intelligence: Gaining insights into emotional dynamics enables empathetic conflict management & fosters strong professional relationships.▶️ Effective Communication: Improving communication skills, both verbal and written, & effectively managing interactions with various stakeholders, including clients, colleagues, & partners.▶️ Global Perspective: Improving cross-cultural competency for effective engagement in global business, encompassing understanding of international markets, trade regulations, and cultural distinctions.▶️ Continuous Learning: Demonstrating a commitment to lifelong learning and skill acquisition to remain pertinent in a swiftly evolving business landscape.These skill sets not only address the immediate demands of today's corporates, but they also lay the groundwork for future leadership roles.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-04-05,"My Mentoring Journey with topmate.ioA few months ago, my friend and LinkedIn influencer, Siddhant Garg, introduced me to topmate.io. He saw my potential to help aspiring entrepreneurs with marketing and business strategies, and Topmate seemed like the perfect platform to connect with them.Why topmate.io?topmate.io impressed me with its platform that helps connect entrepreneurs and professionals with experienced veterans.  This two-way exchange of knowledge empowers aspiring individuals and leverages the expertise of seasoned professionals.After reading a heartfelt testimonial from a mentee, I understood the profound impact mentorship can have. Many entrepreneurs lack access to reality checks and guidance, hindering their growth.  I realized topmate.io offered me a platform to become a valuable mentor and help aspiring entrepreneurs navigate their professional journeys.Another very dear friend, Tejaswee Tripathy, a LinkedIn Top Voice, encouraged me to participate actively. She recognized my potential to be a changemaker. While I've only been on topmate.io for three months, I've already helped numerous aspiring entrepreneurs pursue their goals. Juggling these responsibilities with my existing ventures and sessions was initially challenging.  However, topmate.io's efficient structure proved invaluable.Despite my busy schedule, mentoring, particularly for entrepreneurs, remains a passion. I believe expert guidance can significantly impact their success and help them avoid pitfalls.If you ask me why Topmate Compared to other platforms I've used, topmate.io offers several advantages:▶️ Streamlined Sessions: The platform simplifies scheduling and session management.▶️ Fixed Time Slots and Reminders: This ensures clarity and eliminates scheduling conflicts.▶️ Reduced Coordination Effort: topmate.io minimizes administrative tasks for both mentors and mentees.▶️ Empowering Potential: It connects passionate individuals with the guidance they need to thrive as entrepreneurs.I extend my sincere gratitude to Ankit Agarwal and the entire topmate.io team for creating this remarkable platform that bridges the gap between mentors and mentees.If you are looking to book a slot for mentorship, here's the link - https://lnkd.in/gPevGFGD So, have you used the Platform?

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-02-26,"Embrace Change, Unlock PotentialHow can Adaptability help you succeed in a competitive business landscape? ➡️  Adaptability is not imitation.        It  means power of resistance & assimilation""                           - Mahatma Gandhi Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, where I was deeply inspired by the ideologies and life journey of the father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi. One profound lesson I took away was his patience and mindset to be adaptable.In today's entrepreneurial ecosystem, adaptability stands as a cornerstone trait for founders to thrive in the dynamic landscape.The ability to adapt enables us to smoothly navigate through changes, acquire new skills, and maintain resilience amidst obstacles.Here's a glimpse into my approach to boosting adaptability in the workplace:▶️ Embrace a Growth MindsetAs Mahatma Gandhi once said, ""Be the change that you wish to see in the world."" View challenges as avenues for growth, transforming obstacles into opportunities for development.▶️ Enhance Emotional IntelligenceElevate your adaptability by mastering your emotions and understanding those around you. Skills like empathy and self-awareness are vital for smoothly navigating the complexities of workplace dynamics and change.▶️ Welcome Change""Adaptability is not imitation. It means the power of resistance and assimilation."" Change is inevitable; embracing it with an open mindset can reveal benefits and opportunities for both personal and organizational advancement.▶️ Expand Your Skill RangeCultivate a broad array of skills, blending technical expertise with soft skills to seamlessly transition between various roles and responsibilities as needed.▶️ Embody FlexibilityAdapt your strategies and plans with agility, adjusting to new information or shifting circumstances without hesitation.▶️ Cultivate ResilienceGandhi said, ""Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will."" Keep a positive outlook even when faced with challenges. A resilient spirit aids in overcoming setbacks and enhances your problem-solving capabilities through critical thinking and open-mindedness to different perspectives.▶️ Broaden Your NetworkForge connections across and beyond your industry.

So during my interaction with startups or aspiring entrepreneurs, a common question that always stands out was what key qualities should techies look for in a mentor, considering the rapid pace of technological advancement?As a mentor to more than 30+ incubators in India and closely associating with these startups, I deeply understand the mix of clarity and trepidation that budding entrepreneurs face as they chart their course through the uncharted territories of their startup voyage. The journey through the startup ecosystem is one of constant learning and adaptation, and those who have ventured deeply into its realms bring with them a wealth of insights and firsthand experiences. Having lived through the highs and lows of entrepreneurship, I've come to realize the immense value a seasoned mentor can offer.In the context of rapid technological evolution, tech professionals should seek mentors who embody a mix of technical proficiency, forward-thinking, and personal qualities that foster growth and resilience. Here are key qualities I might suggest budding techpreneurs look for in a startup mentor ▶️Expertise in Relevant Technologies: A mentor with a strong grasp of current and emerging technologies can provide guidance that is both practical and forward-looking.▶️ Lifelong Learning Mindset: Given the pace of change, mentors who are committed to continuous learning and self-improvement can inspire the same ethos in their mentees.▶️Adaptability: The ability to adapt to new technologies, and methodologies is crucial. A mentor who navigates change with ease can teach valuable strategies for staying flexible and agile.▶️ Visionary Thinking: Mentors who can anticipate future trends in technology and its applications can help their mentees prepare for and shape the future of their fields.▶️Problem-Solving Skills: A mentor with expertise in troubleshooting and creativity enhances mentees' problem-solving skills. ▶️ Emotional Intelligence: Mentors with high emotional intelligence can better support the personal and professional development of their mentees. ▶️ Networking and Resourcefulness: A well-connected mentor can provide opportunities for growth through their network and offer resources that can accelerate exposure to new ideas.▶️ Patience and Encouragement: A patient mentor who encourages perseverance and resilience can be incredibly valuable.Finding a mentor with these qualities can greatly influence a tech professional's career, providing insights into both technology and the dynamics of a fast-evolving industry.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-02-26,"Embracing Fear -The Catalyst for Entrepreneurial Growth Is fear truly our enemy, or could it be the key to unlocking our fullest potential?Often perceived negatively, especially in entrepreneurship, fear can be reframed as a powerful fuel propelling us toward growth.In my entrepreneurial journey, I've discovered that while fear may initially seem daunting, it can catalyze personal and professional development. Initially, stepping into entrepreneurship can indeed be fearful, particularly for individuals navigating the unknown terrain of startups.During a recent trip to Bali, I encountered fear when contemplating snorkeling at Manta Bay. However, I realized that fear was merely my body's response to the unfamiliar and potentially challenging. Reflecting on my entrepreneurial experiences, I recognized the parallels – the fear of failure, and the fear of the unknown, especially as a woman entrepreneur.Yet, by embracing fear and taking calculated risks, I've unlocked incredible opportunities and growth. Just as I plunged into the water, overcoming fear led to breathtaking experiences and profound discoveries, both underwater and in the realm of entrepreneurship.To budding entrepreneurs, I encourage you to confront your fears head-on.Let me give some tips to aspiring entrepreneurs as you take your first step towards entrepreneurship that I have accumulated during my own journey ▶️ Do your research and preparationFear of failure drives us to learn as much as possible before launching a venture.➡️ Seek support and collaborationFear of isolation pushes us to build strong networks and partnerships.➡️ Be innovative and adaptableFear of stagnation motivates us to constantly seek new ideas and solutions.Of course, there's a healthy balance to strike.Don't let fear paralyze you, but also don't dismiss it outright. Use it as a signal to be mindful and strategic, and ultimately as a springboard for growth and success.Speaking about fear, this was some of my list that I was able to tick off recently⏩️ Snorkeling in Manta Bay Bali⏩️ Parasailing at Bangkok ⏩️ Kayaking at Mandai Mangrove⏩️ Scuba diving in Phuket⏩️ White water rafting at Ubud➡️ The following is my bucket list that I plan to do this year - Skydiving, Himalaya base camp trekking, Hot Air Balloon - Cappadocia and Surfing in Australia.Share your experiences with fear in your entrepreneurial journey! What would be the most valuable lesson you have learned in your professional journey?What have you overcome, and how has it helped you grow? #LIPostingChallengeIndia #2024bucketlist #LinkedInNewsIndia #Entrepreneurs",469,79,4,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g&keywords=anooja%20bashir&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=4abafcd3-bdf1-49e6-8d85-73c1976063c5&sid=(B5&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-03-26,"Have you ever poured your heart and soul into a dream, only to hit a wall when it comes to scaling it into something bigger?  This is a familiar struggle for many passionate entrepreneurs, especially women.  I recently mentored a group of aspiring entrepreneurs venturing into D2C e-commerce startups, lacking experience or business backgrounds. Driven by a passion to see their businesses flourish & pave the way for others, they were determined to overcome the challenges of scaling up. One key theme emerged – the limitations of being a solo decision-maker. Many of these women were ""passionpreneurs,"" driven by their vision but lacking a diverse team to offer fresh perspectives and expertise. This can lead to decision fatigue & a feeling of being stuck in a loop. My advice to them was to have a diverse workforce because, as single decision-makers, they found themselves confused. Their next question was about hiring a more diverse team. I advised these founders to proactively implement the following strategies:➡️ Inclusive Recruitment Practices: Revamp recruitment processes and utilize diverse job boards, eliminate biases from job descriptions, & actively seek applicants from underrepresented groups. ➡️ Diversity Training for Hiring Managers: Provide training & resources to hiring managers to help them recognize unconscious biases during the recruitment process.➡️ Internship Programs: Establish internship or apprenticeship programs aimed at providing opportunities for individuals from underrepresented backgrounds to gain experience and skills in the e-commerce industry.➡️ Mentorship Programs: Implement mentorship and sponsorship initiatives to support the professional development & advancement of employees from underrepresented groups, helping them navigate career opportunities and challenges.➡️ Transparent Policies: Communicate the organization's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion through transparent policies and reporting mechanisms.➡️ Diverse Leadership Representation: Ensure diversity is reflected at all levels of leadership within the organization, from the executive team to middle management. ➡️ Flexible Work Arrangements: Offering flexible work arrangements, such as remote work options or alternative schedules, to accommodate the needs of employees from diverse backgrounds. ➡️ Continuous Evaluation: Regularly evaluate diversity and inclusion initiatives, collect feedback from employees, and make adjustments as needed. By implementing these strategies, e-commerce firms can create a more diverse and inclusive workplace culture that fosters innovation, creativity, and collaboration, ultimately driving business success.What are some of the challenges you've faced in building a diverse team?

How do I manage to strike a healthy balance amidst the hustle & personal care?😇🔄Let's talk about the real journey of an entrepreneur, beyond the awards. Here are strategies that have helped me navigate these challenges successfully:➡️ Prioritize Tasks: Learn to differentiate between what's urgent & what can wait. This helps in managing time effectively, ensuring that you're not always in a state of hustle.➡️ Set Boundaries: Establish clear boundaries between work and personal time. This might mean having specific work hours and ensuring you disconnect after those hours. ➡️ Practice Self-Care: Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep are non-negotiable. Prioritizing these aspects can significantly improve your overall productivity. ➡️ Mindfulness and Meditation: Incorporating mindfulness practices and meditation into your daily routine can help reduce stress & enhance focus, aiding in better decision-making.➡️ Seek Support: Whether it's delegating tasks to your team or seeking emotional support from friends and family, recognizing that you don't have to do it all alone is key.➡️ Celebrate Small Wins: Just as we celebrate big achievements like awards, acknowledging the small milestones keeps motivation high & provides a sense of progress.➡️ Continuous Learning: Allocating time for learning and personal development can provide a refreshing break from the routine hustle, offering new perspectives & solutions.➡️ Flexible Scheduling: Understand that some days might require more work, while others could be more relaxed, allowing for personal time.➡️ Passion for Your Work: Ultimately, a deep passion for what you do can make the hustle feel less burdensome. It's important to remind yourself why you started and the impact you wish to create.Remember, finding balance is an ongoing process of adjustment and learning.

It was also great catching up with positive and warm personalities - Dr. Anu Suraj, Priya Sivadas, Sujatha Santhanam, & Preethi Nair. We always had powerful women among us but their representation in business and leadership was too low compared to their counterparts, but the winds of change are happening, & we are seeing more women leading both the business and corporate ecosystem.Even though such leaders have existed, still today women are underrepresented at the leadership level across India.Achieving professional success as a woman leader involves a blend of strategic planning, skill development, & personal resilience. Here are some tips for women to navigate the path to leadership effectively:▶️ Develop a Clear Vision: Know where you want to go and what you want to achieve in your career. Having a clear vision helps in setting goals and creating a roadmap to reach them.▶️ Build a Strong Network: Build relationships with mentors, peers, & industry contacts. A strong network offers support, advice, and opportunities for growth. ▶️ Embrace Continuous Learning: Stay ahead in your field by continually updating your skills and knowledge. ▶️ Cultivate Confidence: Believe in your skills and proudly display your accomplishments. Confidence earns your team's trust and respect. ▶️ Master Communication Skills: Effective communication is key in leadership. Develop the ability to convey your ideas clearly and listen actively to others.▶️ Prioritize Work-Life Balance: Maintaining a healthy balance between professional and personal life is crucial for long-term success and well-being.▶️ Develop Resilience: The path to leadership can include setbacks. Resilience is essential to overcome challenges and continue moving forward.▶️ Lead with Empathy: Empathetic leadership fosters loyalty, motivation, and a positive work environment.▶️ Advocate for Diversity and Inclusion: Use your role to advocate for diversity and inclusion, fostering a fairer and more creative workplace.▶️ Maintain Integrity: Lead by example, with honesty and integrity, these virtues foster trust & credibility, key to effective leadership.Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to leadership.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-03-26,"Balancing Productivity and Wellbeing for FoundersBeing a founder is a demanding journey. We juggle a million tasks, wear countless hats, and constantly strive for growth. But what about our well-being? Can we achieve peak productivity while also prioritizing sleep, healthy habits, and celebrating small wins?Here's my approach to navigating this tightrope:▶️ Acknowledge the Sleep Monster: Sleep deprivation is a productivity killer. Founders are notorious for burning the candle at both ends but consistent, quality sleep is essential for focus, creativity, and overall health. Prioritize a good night's sleep – you'll be a sharper leader in the morning.▶️ Fuel Your Hustle with Healthy Habits: Fast food and late-night snacks might seem convenient, but they'll zap your energy and focus. Prioritize nutritious meals and snacks throughout the day. Even small changes, like staying hydrated or taking a brisk walk, can make a big difference.▶️ Embrace the Power of ""Off"" Time: Founders often feel the pressure to be ""always on."" However, taking breaks is not a sign of weakness; it's essential for recharging. Enjoy those dinners with family, those random shopping trips with your kids. Celebrate the small victories, big or small. These moments of joy and connection will fuel your long-term success.▶️ Celebrate the Imperfect You: Millennials were raised with a strong work ethic, often downplaying achievements and deflecting compliments. But self-compassion is key. Acknowledge your accomplishments – big and small. It's okay to feel proud!▶️ Find Your Productivity Sweet Spot: Experiment and discover what works for you. Maybe it's a morning power hour, dedicated ""focus time"" blocks throughout the day, or delegating tasks effectively. The key is to be intentional with your time and create a system that supports your well-being alongside your productivity.Remember, we're all works in progress. By prioritizing sleep, healthy habits, and celebrating wins (big or small!), we can create a sustainable pace for our entrepreneurial journey.My advice to fellow entrepreneurs is to - Celebrate small wins and you will thrive in the startup hustle.What are your tips for balancing productivity and well-being?

We believe in a symbiotic relationship between employer and employee – both must thrive for the organization to flourish.In my opinion, any organization can scale only if its team is productive and has a mindset wherein they believe they can also progress in their professional career along with the company's growth.We prioritize employee productivity, fostering a mindset where career progression aligns seamlessly with company growth. We invest heavily in upskilling our team members, ensuring they stay current with industry trends across all areas, from marketing to HR. Our leaders play a vital role in nurturing their team to bring in the ultimate growth of their organization.Leaders play a critical role in cultivating a culture of learning within an organization. Here, we explore key strategies that leaders can implement to foster continuous improvement, innovation, and knowledge sharing:▶️ Lead by ExampleLeaders should model the learning behavior they wish to see by engaging in their professional development and sharing their learning experiences with the team.▶️ Provide Learning ResourcesOffer access to online courses, workshops, books, and seminars. This shows a tangible commitment to learning. Allow employees to learn about different aspects of the business through job rotation or shadowing programs.▶️ Create a Safe Environment for LearningFoster an environment where mistakes are seen as learning opportunities rather than failures. Encourage employees to ask questions and explore new ideas without fear of judgment.▶️ Recognize and Reward LearningRecognize not just achievements, but also the effort put into learning. This can be through formal recognition programs or informal shout-outs. ▶️ Encourage Knowledge SharingPair less experienced employees with mentors who can provide guidance and share their expertise. Host regular meet-ups, workshops, or ""lunch and learns"" where team members can share knowledge on various topics.Additionally, be sure to also ⏺️ Set Clear Learning Goals. This helps employees understand the purpose and value of their learning.⏺️ Leverage Technology - Utilize platforms that enable social learning and collaboration, allowing employees to learn from each other remotely.By implementing these strategies, leaders can create a thriving culture of learning that not only enhances individual and organizational performance but also attracts and retains top talent by demonstrating a commitment to employee development and growth.Share your thoughts on leaders building a culture of learning in the comments below.LinkedIn Guide to Creating LinkedIn News India LinkedIn#Team #FlexiCloud #Leaders #LearningCulture #Ourea #PokketCFO",444,63,7,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g&keywords=anooja%20bashir&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=4abafcd3-bdf1-49e6-8d85-73c1976063c5&sid=(B5&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-03-26,"From Daily Wear to Life Choices - Mastering the Art of Decision-MakingEver been bombarded by seemingly endless choices – what to eat, what to read, even what color shirt to wear?  Recently while waiting at the airport lounge and browsing Instagram reels, I chanced upon a video of Raj Shamani. His video hit home for me. He captured the essence of our modern dilemma - a constant barrage of decisions, big and small, with no clear guidebook.As an entrepreneur, I wear many hats.  Juggling household chores, my maid's questions, my daughter's law school options, my son's internship choices, and the secretary's constant stream of questions about events, my Business and Marketing Head's questions on the different marketing campaigns can sometimes be paralyzing. Decision fatigue becomes a real threat.But here's the good news. Effective decision-making requires a thoughtful and strategic approach.While I'm still on this journey myself, I've found some helpful practices-▶️ Define the Problem: Clearly articulate the issue or challenge at hand, ensuring a thorough understanding of the situation.▶️ Gather Information: Collect relevant data, facts, and insights to inform your decision-making process. Consider multiple perspectives and sources of information.▶️ Identify Alternatives: Generate a range of potential solutions or courses of action. Evaluate the pros and cons of each option, considering potential risks and benefits.▶️ Analyze and Evaluate: Assess the potential outcomes of each alternative, weighing their feasibility, impact, and alignment with your goals and values.▶️ Make a Decision: Select the most appropriate option based on your analysis and evaluation. Trust your judgment and intuition, but also be open to feedback and input from others.▶️ Implement the Decision: Develop a plan for executing your chosen course of action. Communicate the decision effectively to stakeholders and allocate resources as needed.▶️ Monitor and Adjust: Continuously monitor the outcomes of your decision, making adjustments as necessary based on new information or changing circumstances.By incorporating these practices, decision-making has become less of a high-stakes game and more of a natural process.Now, let's turn the tables!

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-03-26,"In what ways can Marketing campaigns be made more accessible for differently-abled people?As an entrepreneur, I've always strived to create products and services that reach the broadest possible audience. But a real eye-opener came when I came to study more about Diversity and its intricacies. It made me acutely aware that traditional marketing campaigns often overlook a significant portion of the population – differently-abled people.This isn't just about good business sense. It's about ensuring everyone has the opportunity to engage with the products and services they need. Differently abled people represent a diverse and vibrant market segment, and neglecting accessibility creates unnecessary barriers to inclusion.Here's where things get exciting! By incorporating some key accessibility principles into marketing campaigns, we can create truly inclusive experiences.➡️ Use Accessible Design: Create marketing materials with accessible design principles in mind, such as using high-contrast colors, clear fonts, & large text sizes for readability.➡️ Provide Multiple Formats: Offer marketing content in multiple formats, such as text transcripts for videos, audio descriptions for visual content, & HTML versions of emails for compatibility with screen readers.➡️ Caption Videos: Ensure that the captions accurately represent the spoken content and include relevant sounds.➡️ Test Accessibility: Conduct accessibility testing of marketing materials using assistive technologies, such as screen readers, voice recognition software, or keyboard navigation, to identify & address any barriers to accessibility.➡️ Consider Alternative Input Methods: Allow for alternative input methods, such as voice commands or keyboard shortcuts, to accommodate individuals with mobility impairments.➡️ Ensure Compatibility: Ensure that marketing materials & platforms are compatible with assistive technologies commonly used by diverse people, such as screen readers, magnification software, or alternative input devices.➡️ Provide Contact Options: Offer multiple contact options, including email, phone, & online chat, to accommodate individuals with different communication preferences.➡️ Educate Staff: Train marketing team members on accessibility best practices and sensitivity to the needs of differently-abled people to ensure that they understand the importance of inclusivity in marketing campaigns.➡️ Solicit Feedback: Encourage feedback from customers on the accessibility of marketing materials and platforms, & use this feedback to make continuous improvements.By implementing these strategies, we can create more inclusive and accessible campaigns that reach a broader audience and demonstrate a commitment to diversity and inclusivity.Share your thoughts on making marketing campaigns more accessible.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-02-26,"The Home Office HustleDo you feel remote work hurts your work-life balance?Being an entrepreneur, blurring the lines between ""clock in"" and ""clock out"" feels like a rite of passage. ⏯️ But here's the thing: while remote work promises flexibility, it might be doing the opposite for our well-being.We work too much.Home, the supposed sanctuary for recharge, has become an extension of the office. Laptops open at sunrise, and close long after the stars peek out. This constant work presence erodes the very boundaries it's meant to create.The endless emails, the pinging notifications, the ever-present to-do list – it's no wonder we feel drained, stressed, and perpetually ""on.""↙️ When Covid hit us, remote work was the answer. We felt the freedom, the flexibility, and the control over our schedules. But did it really?It's true. There are perks. But the flip side is a constant tug-of-war between work and personal life, leaving us feeling like we're failing at both.So, what's the solution? Ditch remote work entirely? ⏺️ No way! But maybe, just maybe, we need a different approach. And this is why I always encourage a hybrid model at work, with dedicated office days that create clear physical and mental separation. Or setting stricter boundaries, even if it means leaving the laptop closed at 7 pm, even if it's just for one night.➡️ My advice is to remember that we are entrepreneurs, we're not robots. ⏭️ We need to recharge, disconnect, and nurture the parts of ourselves that aren't spreadsheets and deadlines. 🔄 A sustainable work-life balance isn't just a luxury, it's has become the fuel that keeps our businesses (and us) thriving.So, let's start a conversation.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-04-05,"Beauty brands are shifting the dynamics by engaging with the #WPL. This #WPL reflected the spirit of empowerment and support as beauty brands sponsored various teams.I've always been enchanted by beauty brands that not only elevate my confidence but also care for my skin and match my complexion flawlessly. My go-to brands for cosmetics are Charlotte Tilbury Beauty, Rare Beauty, and MAC Cosmetics, while Benefit Cosmetics and Estée Lauder are my skincare favorites. Recently, I've been intrigued by Indian beauty innovations like Mamaearth and SUGAR Cosmetics, which are carving their niche in the market with their strategic moves.However, beyond their renowned beauty products, these brands are steering a significant shift in the ecosystem, as demonstrated by the #WPL. This event highlighted a sense of empowerment and support through beauty brands' sponsorships of various teams. I believe this is because most of these brands are headed by women themselves. Vineeta Singh, co-founder of SUGAR Cosmetics, along with celebrities like Kareena Kapoor Khan attended to root for the players, demonstrating their solid support for women in sports.Katrina Kaif backed the #UPWarriorz, who sported jerseys bearing the name of her beauty brand, Kay Beauty, which teamed up with the squad as the lead sponsor in collaboration with beauty platform Nykaa. Masaba Gupta's LoveChild by Masaba also joined forces with the women's #MumbaiIndians team as an official partner. Additionally, personal care brands such as  Himalaya Wellness Company and Lotus Herbals Pvt Ltd had rolled out new campaigns in support of #WPL.My take is that these beauty brands really made an incredible breakthrough by leveraging the #WPL by ▶️ Embracing Women's Sports: Beauty brands are leveraging the influence of women's sports to reach a broader, engaged demographic.▶️ A Holistic Approach: The narrative is shifting to portray women athletes as icons of both strength and style.▶️ Inclusive Beauty Standards: These sponsorships challenge old stereotypes, offering a broader definition of beauty.▶️ Empowering Messages: Aligning with beauty brands’ mission, these partnerships endorse confidence and empowerment.▶️ Expanding Influence: Acknowledging athletes' role models beyond sports, these sponsorships touch upon lifestyle and culture.▶️ Changing Sports Marketing: The entry of non-traditional sponsors into women's leagues signifies an evolution in sports marketing strategies.This development signifies a vibrant synergy between sports and lifestyle, positioning women's sports as a dynamic arena for brands to engage with their audience and convey powerful social messages.

After Warren Buffett's loyal confidant Charlie Munger died on Tuesday, investors are worried that Berkshire Hathaway's succession plan might fail. Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom, and participation,"" Buffett, 93. Munger died a week after Buffett donated $866 million of Berkshire stock to four family organizations and released a rare shareholder letter acknowledging his limited time in the twilight of his outstanding investing career. Despite a 2012 prostate cancer diagnosis, he never resigned. ""At 93, I feel good but fully realize I am playing in extra innings,"" he said. Buffett said last week that Berkshire was ""built to last"" without him. 👉🏼As we bid farewell to the legend, let me throw some highlights on his invaluable contributions to the business and investing world. ✅ Inspiration and Wisdom Charlie's insight and wisdom were the driving force behind Berkshire Hathaway's success. His inspirational guidance shaped not only the company but also inspired countless entrepreneurs worldwide including me. ✅Critical Sounding Board Charlie played a pivotal role as a sounding board as his candid advice and ability to challenge ideas were instrumental in Berkshire's decision-making process. ✅Philosophical Investment Approach Munger's belief in acquiring excellent businesses at fair prices, and fostering continuous growth through reinvestment, became a cornerstone of his and Buffett's investment philosophy.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-02-26,"Ever feel frustrated when information seems stuck in different corners of your organization, making it hard to work together effectively?                                                  Our organization is deeply committed to fostering a culture where open communication and transparency are at the forefront. We believe that these principles are the bedrock of a collaborative, trusting, and ultimately more effective team. I would like to share a recent example from our company that highlights the impact of living by these values.A member of our team was experiencing personal difficulties, leading to noticeable sleep deprivation & stress. Despite our efforts to maintain an environment of open dialogue through regular check-ins, I was out of town & unable to directly engage. Fortunately, our Business Head, Abhijith E S, observed these signs and took the initiative to reach out to the affected team member. Through his proactive approach, he offered the necessary support, effectively addressing & mitigating the situation.Here are several strategies that firms can employ to encourage a positive work culture:➡️ Setting the Standard with Leadership Transparency: Leaders should exemplify transparency by openly sharing decision-making processes, admitting mistakes, and discussing challenges & visions, fostering an organizational culture of openness and transparency. ➡️ Facilitating Open Dialogue: Establish platforms for open employee feedback, like town hall meetings or suggestion initiatives. Ensure these inputs are not just heard but acted upon, building trust within the organization. ➡️ Implementing Comprehensive Feedback Loops: Adopt a 360-degree feedback system that allows for feedback to flow freely between managers, employees, and peers. This system fosters a balanced view & mutual accountability, enhancing personal and professional growth.➡️ Ensuring Information Accessibility: Offer transparent access to vital organizational information like financial health, strategic plans, and performance metrics. This cultivates a sense of ownership and commitment among employees as they grasp their role in the company's success. ➡️ Valuing Transparency Contributions: Recognize and celebrate transparency by acknowledging acts such as voicing concerns, suggesting improvements, or demonstrating vulnerability. This fosters a culture where openness is valued and rewarded.By implementing these strategies, firms can foster a transparent workplace that addresses modern workplace trends like ""quiet hiring,"" ""quiet quitting,"" and ""quiet firing,"" while also nurturing a healthier, more collaborative, and trusting work environment.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-04-26,"The IPL Heats Up with Creative Marketing Blitzes ⚡The crack of the bat, the roar of the crowd... the IPL is back! 🏏✨Cricket has always been an emotion for Indians worldwide. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is in full swing, and brands are taking the field with innovative marketing campaigns!From established giants like HDFC Bank, SBI, Britannia, and Pepsi to tech giants like Google Pixel and appliance brands like Haier, there's a fierce competition for fan attention.As the sixes soar and the passion of cricket enthusiasts reaches a fever pitch, brands are capitalizing on the excitement with engaging campaigns. These strategies aim to attract a massive audience, leveraging the star power of players like Virat Kohli and the overall energy of the IPL.As a brand strategist and IPL enthusiast, some of the strategic moves that I feel the brand can adopt are ▶️ Leverage Storytelling: Create compelling narratives that resonate with the audience. Ads that tell a story are more likely to engage viewers and be memorable compared to straightforward promotional content.▶️ Incorporate Cricket Themes: Align the ad content with cricket themes or narratives relatable to the IPL audience. Using cricket metaphors or scenarios can captivate the attention of cricket enthusiasts more effectively.▶️ Celebrity Endorsements: Featuring popular cricketers or celebrities in advertisements can draw more eyeballs. Fans will likely pay more attention to ads involving their favorite stars.▶️ Interactive and Engaging Content: Develop interactive ads that invite audience participation. This could be through social media contests, polls, or interactive games related to the IPL, enhancing engagement and recall.▶️ Real-Time Marketing: Capitalize on real-time events during matches. Brands that create quick, relevant content reacting to live match scenarios can engage viewers more actively and gain viral potential.Additionally, I would also suggest ⏺️ Employ unique and memorable visual or audio signatures that can make the ad stand out during the clutter of regular IPL ads. ⏺️ Brands can engage in sponsorship deals or on-ground activations that can provide more visibility during pre-game, post-game, and mid-game segments.⏺️ Use data analytics to target ads more precisely, reaching out to specific demographics or regions more likely to be interested in the brand’s products or services.Remember, IPL is about celebrating the spirit of cricket. 🏏 By injecting your brand with that same passion and creativity, you'll be sure to score a marketing home run!Thanks, Rakshit Ravindranathan, for sparking this great conversation!

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-02-26,"A heartfelt thank you to the amazing LinkedIn Editorial team for featuring me in LinkedIn News under top news category.It's an honor that has made me immensely happy. As an entrepreneur, I was never that active on any social media platforms. I joined LinkedIn to find some work during my initial startup failure phase. LinkedIn was the platform where I met my wonderful and amazing Co-Founder Vinod Chacko. It's when I reached around probably 8000 followers, that I began to seriously learn the platform and the services it offers. That is when it all started, a desire to share knowledge, and a passion for connecting. Today, standing at 22,000 strong, I'm filled with gratitude for the incredible community that's formed around my content.LinkedIn has been more than just a platform; it's been a springboard for growth and opportunity. Through engaging courses, I've honed my skills, gained new perspectives, and expanded my knowledge base. The platform has also opened doors to beautiful networking opportunities, connecting me with like-minded professionals from across the globe.But the true magic of LinkedIn lies in its people. The countless interactions, insightful comments, and amazing content from the creators on the platform fuel my passion and keep me going. LinkedIn has become part of my daily routine as my day begins with checking the feed and posting the content and in the evening too I spend some time on the platform to understand the updates and to take part in engagement with the audience. In case you are starting your journey on LinkedIn, let me share a few tips that have helped me▶️ Be Authentic▶️ Be Consistent▶️ Find your Niche ▶️ Engage with your audience, that is where the networking happens.Once again, thank you, LinkedIn Homith Bakshi, Vaishnavi Singh, Raunak Ramteke, Divya Pathak, Aanvi Kamdar, Neha Upalekar, Isha Chitnis Rakshit Ravindranathan #LinkedIn #ThankYou #Networking #Learning #LinkedinInsiderIndia #LinkedinNewsIndia",356,63,6,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g&keywords=anooja%20bashir&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=4abafcd3-bdf1-49e6-8d85-73c1976063c5&sid=(B5&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

It's a replica of entrepreneurship's journey – full of ups and downs, but always with the 'restart' mode on. ✅Risk-Taking and InnovationChallenging societal expectations, as shown in the film, is similar to the entrepreneur's path of risk-taking and innovation.It's about stepping into uncharted territories and breaking the mold to bring unique ideas to life.✅AdaptabilityThe protagonist's personal growth in '12th Fail' echoes the adaptability required in business. In a world that's always evolving, entrepreneurs must be agile, continuously updating their skills and approaches to stay ahead.✅A Resilient MindsetThe film also emphasizes the importance of resilience for entrepreneurs. Building this mindset is critical to navigating through the entrepreneurial journey, keeping focused and passionate despite the challenges.🪯 To me, '12th Fail' is more than a story about overcoming academic challenges; it serves as a powerful allegory for the entrepreneurial path. Its portrayal of resilience, continuous learning, and the courage to defy the norm offers invaluable lessons for anyone embarking on an entrepreneurial venture.                                                                                                          👉Indeed, movies like '12th Fail' do depict real-life challenges and victories that significantly motivate and educate us, impacting our professional and personal growth.If you have more examples of films or stories that have inspired you or others in their entrepreneurial journey, I'd love to hear about them. ♟️Sharing such inspirations can be incredibly motivating for those embarking on or currently navigating their entrepreneurial paths 💫#12thfail #forbeswomen #entrepreneurs #linkedininfluencer #linkedin #flexicloud #startuplife",352,59,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g&keywords=anooja%20bashir&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=4abafcd3-bdf1-49e6-8d85-73c1976063c5&sid=(B5&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-03-26,"Advancing Women's Leadership in India's Business Sector ✨As a woman entrepreneur, I see firsthand the lack of women leading the charge in Indian businesses. It's a challenge that needs our full attention, one that requires tackling both deeply rooted cultural norms and the systemic hurdles women face.Being featured in Outlook's Women's Day edition as a ""Woman Leader Shaping the Future"" was incredibly rewarding. But it also served as a powerful reminder of how much work remains. True progress comes from creating a future where such recognition is the norm, not the exception.Here are some strategies I believe can create that future:➡️ Mandating Gender Quotas: Implement laws and internal policies requiring a certain percentage of women in leadership and board roles to overcome initial obstacles.➡️ Launching Gender Diversity Initiatives: Create programs for women's leadership training, mentorship, and networking—partner with organizations that support women professionally.➡️ Offering Flexible Work Solutions: Provide options for flexible schedules, remote work, and family leave to balance professional and personal responsibilities, ensuring these don't impede women's career progression.➡️ Adopting Fair Hiring and Advancement Practices: Employ impartial recruitment and clear advancement criteria to afford women equal leadership opportunities, incorporating bias-reduction training.➡️ Establishing Mentorship and Advocacy Programs: Pair women with mentors and advocate for their advancement through executive support.➡️ Creating a Gender-Inclusive Workplace: Develop a company culture that appreciates diversity and inclusion, actively dismantling gender stereotypes and bias through ongoing training and awareness.➡️ Encouraging Support from Male Colleagues: Involve men in discussions and initiatives related to gender diversity, encouraging them to support and champion the cause of women's advancement in the corporate world.➡️ Monitoring and Communicating Diversity Progress: Regularly measure and openly share progress on gender diversity to ensure accountability and identify areas for improvement.➡️ Focusing on Succession and Development: Detail succession planning that includes women for leadership positions and supports the nurturing of female talent from the onset of their careers.By closing the leadership gender gap, we unlock a wider talent pool, fueling innovation, profitability, and sustainable growth. This commitment to diversity and inclusivity not only elevates women's roles but also reshapes the corporate world into a fairer, more dynamic, and inclusive space for everyone.Check out the full article here: https://lnkd.in/gw4aNhER#LinkedIn #LinkedinNewsIndia #WomenLeaders #Outlook #AccelrateProgress",337,44,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g&keywords=anooja%20bashir&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=4abafcd3-bdf1-49e6-8d85-73c1976063c5&sid=(B5&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Navigating Success Together - Mentorship Matters Being a Diversity Evangelist, I am always excited to support all the diversity segments especially women with my experience and my expertise. I truly believe that promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion can nurture a sustainable ecosystem for entrepreneurship.Despite my current success as an entrepreneur, I've personally experienced startup failure not once, but twice.The undeniable truth is that women often start as ""passionpreneurs"" before fully embracing the role of ""entrepreneurs."" While they invest their hearts in startup ventures, there can be a gap in having a structured roadmap for growth. One contributing factor to my past failures lies in this very aspect.Recently I had the opportunity to be a speaker at the Yuukke Global platform talking about my experience and expertise on Decoding Funding. No sugarcoating, I believe women need to be guided well so that they realize if they are ready for investment. So ask yourselves, Is your venture investor-ready? Speak the investor lingo? Have a solid plan beyond your amazing idea?Because here's the truth: diving headfirst into fundraising without that groundwork is like jumping off a cliff without a parachute. The key takeaways for women entrepreneurs were  ➡️ Stay updated with current trends.➡️Seek guidance from mentors and subject matter experts.➡️ Enhance networks through events and platforms like LinkedIn.Connecting with fellow panelists was a wonderful experience, as we shared a similar mindset regarding the entrepreneurial ecosystem Pushkar Singh, Savitha Kesav Jagadeesan and Poornima T M.A special thanks to the Yuukke Global platform and Dr. Senthamarai Gokulakrishnan for inviting me to be a part of this great session.Let's discuss!

It prompted me to draw parallels between the thrilling adventure of rafting and the dynamic journey of entrepreneurship.👉 Let me share my thoughts with you✅The LeadershipFor our group, we had a funny but experienced local raft guide, Yuko who helped us to navigate and row better with clear instructions with certain keywords like ""Dig In"" (Move forward), ""Bump"" (Keep your paddle inside the boat), or ""Eddy Out,"" etc. to ensure a safe rafting experience. Just as in rafting, I felt entrepreneurship also demands the presence of a mentor or leader who can steer the team towards success, navigating through the challenging currents of business with their expertise and vision.✅The TeamRafting is a great exercise in team building as it teaches unity, clear communication, and the joy of shared experiences as well as enhances team bonding. A lack of coordination leads to disarray, highlighting its value as a team-building exercise. In rafting, each member is vital for safety and success, much like in entrepreneurship, where every individual's contribution is key to a startup's strength and success.✅The ExperienceThe rafting experience was undeniably adventurous, filled with twists, turns, and unexpected challenges. Similarly, entrepreneurship is a thrilling journey with its share of highs and lows, creating a narrative that is both dynamic and unpredictable.

Anooja Bashir,Female,2024-03-26,"Scrolling through LinkedIn today, I was truly impressed by an ad from Puer. As a DEI advocate, it resonated deeply with my values.The ad beautifully captures the cultural shift towards supporting and empowering women. It's inspiring to see men portrayed as allies, rewriting the rules and actively cheering on women's journeys in every sphere of life.Puer goes beyond platitudes. The ad highlights the breakdown of biases, celebrating and respecting women as equals. It emphasizes a future where gender roles are redefined, with both men and women sharing responsibilities as breadwinners and partners.This is the true essence of women's empowerment: respect, celebration, and equality.Now I would say this is the true meaning of celebrating - “The Womanhood”Together, let’s pledge to create an inclusive future where every woman is recognized for her contribution both in her personal and professional journey.Let’s create a culture where both men of our country together create a sustainable economy.#DiversityAndInclusion #GenderEquality #IWD2024 #Puer #CatchUpWithHer #ReWriteTheRules",247,42,3,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAuDXVoBN0JflssjZAAhiLJqMNgh9h33Q5g&keywords=anooja%20bashir&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=4abafcd3-bdf1-49e6-8d85-73c1976063c5&sid=(B5&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
