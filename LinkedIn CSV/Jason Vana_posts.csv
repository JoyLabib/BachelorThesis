Jason Vana,Male,2023-09-27,"""What does a brand strategy actually look like?""‚òùüèº I get that question a lot.Most people see the word ""brand"" and immediately think:- logo- fonts- colors- design- feelingsAll aspects of a brand, for sure. But a brand strategy is far more than that.Here's the bare minimum that you should have in a brand strategy üëáüèº1. Ideal Customer ProfileYour brand is created for THEM, not you.2. Competitive ResearchWhat are the holes in the market?3. Positioning/DifferentiationHow will you show up and be different?4. MessagingHow will you communicate that differentiation?5. TouchpointsHow will you show that differentiation through marketing, sales, operations, product, and customer support?6. Tactical PlanWhat steps will you take to make all of that happen?7. Strategy StatementWhat's the overall strategy that will drive everything you do?‚òùüèº This is the bare minimum you should have in a brand strategy.Because this will align your efforts.And help you attract the RIGHT customers.Now, you can expand that strategy to include:- personality- tone and voice- brand/founder story- benefits and guarantees- logos, fonts, colors, patterns- marketing and content strategyBut for most of you, that's overkill.At least for now. Start with the essentials.You'll gain far more clarity and direction for your business.Which, in turn, means more...MONEY.If you're into that sort of thing, that is.(some of you clearly aren't)‚úåüèº#shftyourbrand",463,211,30,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAIDH3QB1kgnd7mmzNvZq8ST1rWTTtXIjBs%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAIDH3QB1kgnd7mmzNvZq8ST1rWTTtXIjBs&keywords=jason%20vana&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=ce0c0b1f-237a-4575-a25c-e6d468b77923&sid=1PI&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Jason Vana,Male,2024-04-13,"Brutally honest advice I'd give to my first-time founder self.That would have saved me time, money, and heartache.1. FocusYes, you can do everything from Google ads to content to website design.No, you shouldn't offer it all.You excel at brand strategy.Sell that and only that.2. Define SuccessYou'll be tempted to chase after something you don't even want.And listen to those who are building something you'll hate.Determine what success looks like to you.Chase that.3. Trust Your GutThe biggest mistakes you make will come when you ignore your gut.I don't care how awkward it may be.I don't care if it means having hard conversations.I don't care if you have to part ways with someone.Your gut will save you time, money, and a lot of heartache.Listen to it.4. Hire the Right PeopleThe wrong people will make you feel like sh*t about yourself.And stall your business big time.Stop letting your visionary side blind you from what's in front of you.Hire slowly.Fire quickly.5. Stop second-guessing yourself.You are a bad-ass entrepreneur.You know what you're doing.And you're going to build an epic business.Stop listening to the voice in your head that tells you otherwise.It's a furking liar.6. Have FunDon't take yourself too seriously.This business thing can be a sh*tload of fun, if you let it.Take breaks.Enjoy the journey.And be your magnificently weird self.7. Build a solid community.Find people who believe in you and want the best for you.Invest in those relationships.They are just as important for your business as who you hire.Remember:Building a business isn't easy.But it'll open the doors to the life you want.If you let it.‚úåüèº#shftyourbrand",340,255,5,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAIDH3QB1kgnd7mmzNvZq8ST1rWTTtXIjBs%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAIDH3QB1kgnd7mmzNvZq8ST1rWTTtXIjBs&keywords=jason%20vana&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=ce0c0b1f-237a-4575-a25c-e6d468b77923&sid=1PI&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Jason Vana,Male,2024-02-27,"How most businesses 'build' their brand:  - create an offer - try to sell that offer - dump money into marketing - guess at who will buy their offer - realize they aren't attracting the right people - go the custom route for every prospect - try to launch a new offer - repeat the cycle  Then eventually hire a brand strategist to fix their sh*t.  When they realize tactics aren't working.  ‚úÖ The better way to influence your brand:  - hire a brand strategist - figure out the gut feeling you want to create - determine who you want to have that gut feeling - find a way to be truly different in the marketplace - create an offer for your ICP and differentiation - create a brand persona with tone and voice - write messages to communicate the offer  THEN market and sell your offer.

That's why I also look at WHO's seeing my posts.  - companies - job titles - regions  Because getting a bunch of BDRs from India to see my content is not ideal.  And signals I'm moving in the wrong direction.  (Nothing wrong with BDRs or India, but they aren't my ideal customers)  But founders, marketing specialists, executive directors, consultants, and business owners seeing my posts?  From London, New York, Prague, Boston, Chicago, Toronto, Randstad, and Paris?  That means my posts are working.  And are being seen by the RIGHT people.  Meaning I generate far more qualified leads. With a shorter sales cycle. And larger contracts.  Prioritize the RIGHT audience.  Even if it's not big.  You'll generate more money for your business that way.  ‚úåüèº  #shftyourbrand",165,198,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAIDH3QB1kgnd7mmzNvZq8ST1rWTTtXIjBs%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAIDH3QB1kgnd7mmzNvZq8ST1rWTTtXIjBs&keywords=jason%20vana&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=ce0c0b1f-237a-4575-a25c-e6d468b77923&sid=1PI&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Jason Vana,Male,2023-12-27,"Attract, convert, delight, and keep your ideal customers.‚òùüèº That is what a brand strategy helps you do.Most people see brand as a fluffy add-on to marketing.It's the design.The feeling.The logo.The creative campaigns that only the big B2C companies can do.When really a brand is how your ideal customers see you.And a brand strategy is how you influence that perception.In every aspect of your business.Let me give you an example.Back in July, I built an MVB Strategy for Smiling Bowtie.I've known Antoni Tzavelas for years.And love everything this dude does.He literally is Mr. Smiley on LinkedIn.Now, most people would see his brand as the message we created.Make Happiness Your Company's Superpower.Or the cool character he created.Gotta love a cartoon mascot with a bowtie.But his brand strategy included so much more.Like:- Creating an ROI dashboard so CEOs can see the progress over time- Creating a 30, 60, 90-day plan to keep teams moving forward- Hiring collaborative coaches to cover more expertise- Creating a welcome video so people see and feel the happiness- Design fun bowties to give out during workshops and marketing events- Use a happy color palette in all marketing materials- Host his own happiness conferenceThose are just a few of the tactics to help build their brand perception.Most of those are NOT marketing ideas.Because attracting and converting are only 1/2 of the equation.A solid brand strategy addresses the full customer lifecycle.From ""I don't know who the hell you are""......to ""you are the best damn company I've ever worked with.""If you're struggling with any of those steps:- attracting- converting- delighting- keepingGet yourself a brand strategy.You'll find the clarity and alignment to level up your business.And turn people who don't even know you yet......into raving fanboys and girls.‚úåüèº#shftyourbrand",153,128,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAIDH3QB1kgnd7mmzNvZq8ST1rWTTtXIjBs%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAIDH3QB1kgnd7mmzNvZq8ST1rWTTtXIjBs&keywords=jason%20vana&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=ce0c0b1f-237a-4575-a25c-e6d468b77923&sid=1PI&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

It feels like a missing part of my identity as a person that now has been found. A natural and authentic essence of my professional being.""‚òùüèº That's what a personal brand SHOULD feel like.If not, keep working.Or book a clarity call with me.Steffen has clarity for his brand now.You could as well.‚úåüèº#shftyourbrand----Ready to get clarity for your brand?
