Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-02-26,""" 30 Million "" views on a reel - all 100% organic! Our conversation with Namita is still going viral on social media 1 year later! During our Shark Tank India Season 2 pitch, a reel featuring my brother Ashish asking Namita to name a few spice brands went viral.The post was all over the internet back then, but to my surprise, it went viral again in the last few days...With marketing, I've realized that nothing can be truly predictable.No one can predict trends, but all you can do is just flow with them at times. Plus, let's be honest, who doesn't love to have a good laugh? 😂Memes, with their humor and relatability, are lethal marketing tools, conveying messages that spread widely across online platforms.Memes = Organic Growth + Relatability + Chance of ViralityAlso, let's not forget, Shark Tank itself is a cultural staple. Memorable moments from the show, like Aman Gupta's ""Hum bhi bana lenge"" and Namita Thapar's ""Ye meri expertise nahi hai,"" are immortalized in the meme history book.So much so that the sharks themselves have fun with these memes now 🤣There's so much that comes out of Shark Tank apart from the deals!P.S. - Having said that, can you name 4 spice brands? 😂PPS: The most iconic answer to the aforementioned question is still Anupam Mittal's ""Zoff, Zoff, Zoff and ZOFF""PPPS: What is your favorite meme from the show?https://lnkd.in/gEfF2w_H#d2c #sharktank #brand #marketing #startup

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-06-26,"Naya season ho ya controversy- Shark Tank is always in limelight.We are a Shark Tank funded startup ourselves and we are not in favor of the recent show related controversies!I understand and respect other people’s differing opinions. But, I wanted to share this to make sure every person knows the other side of the coin as well!As audience, you just see the grand pitch and handing over of the cheque. But in reality, a lot goes on behind the stage. ✅ You have to go through a long due diligence process! And if you can’t give solid proof of the claims you have made- Why would the sharks go ahead with the deal? Think for yourself- Would you invest in someone if you can’t trust them? ✅ People have spread rumors that the sharks ghost you. I don’t stand by this statement. Personally, Aman Gupta is the best thing that could have happened to the company. We're extremely grateful to him and his team for the constant support.I have personally seen businesses get the much needed exposure with the help of sharks. Another point to think- The sharks can’t always be at your beck and call,  right?Simple hai- Commitment comes from both sides! I have seen businesses reap benefits just after the registration process. The show helps businesses look at their business from a different approach! ZOFF will always be thankful to the show for providing us with such an amazing platform. P.s.- A huge shout out to the whole shark tank team for taking entrepreneurship in India to the next level and making startups a dinner table conversation. Thank you to the sharks for giving in so much of their time to the show and to budding entrepreneurs.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-02-26,"8th February, 2023: The day that changed ZOFF from a brand from Raipur to a brand from “INDIA”.A year ago today, our Shark Tank India episode aired & saying that “It changed our life,” would be an understatement. So many people have asked me, “How did it feel?”Honestly, it’s the hardest question Ashish Agrawal and I’ve had to answer.  But, I don’t think any other experience of my life will ever come close to this one :)Unlike a common opinion, the impact of this show is MUCH MORE than getting an investor cheque or marketing!✅We represented the Raipur ecosystem in on national level. And, it has brought in a lot of hope and encouragement in founders building from Tier 2 🔥✅I’ve been invited to so many school and college events in and outside Raipur to share my story with aspiring entrepreneurs. ✅The show gave us a mentor who changed our lives. On the show, Aman Gupta entered ZOFF as an investor, but our relationship goes much beyond. He’s always been there to guide us, help us, and show us the right direction. And, we couldn’t be more thankful!Because of the show, it feels like all we have a responsibility to spread that enthusiasm in others and create a second-level impact! I’m sure all other entrepreneurs like Chinu Kala and Siddharth DUNGARWAL, would agree with me here 🚀🙌🏻I can go on and on about this, but LinkedIn has a word limit :)So, just a heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported us, from the entire team at Shark Tank India to everyone who watches the show!PS - To the upcoming entrepreneurs of Shark Tank S3: I'm rooting for you!

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-11-26,"A couple of years back, nobody would have thought that D2C brands would capture the market like this, much less launch an IPO. We were in for a surprise. Mamaearth launched its IPO less than 20 days ago and has been creating buzz since then. Launched at Rs. 324, it has risen by 41% in a short duration. Lekin one might wonder ki aakhir ismein badhi baat kya hai? After all, the stock market is full of shocks, and rollercoaster case studies. Mamaearth itni headlines kyun bana raha hai?The simple answer: nobody saw this coming. Despite the public support and good financials, critics are of the opinion that the future of D2C brands is limited and find it hard to believe that people would actually invest in such companies. Well, if you are one of the confused ones, consider these: 》Honasa Consumer Ltd., the parent company has been in high spirits since finalizing the IPO launch as revenues in FY 22 doubled from the previous year to Rs 943 crores, recording a profit of Rs 14.4 crores. 》Admittedly, Mamaearth is planning to improve brand visibility and inorganic growth such as exclusive brand outlets, and that might be one of the reasons why primary stakeholders are aiming to sell their shares. 》Jefferies reported the share being a “high conviction buy,” and for good reason: The company's management is confident about achieving over 30% revenue growth, mirroring the success seen in the first half of the year. 》Mamaearth has demonstrated an impressive 33% year-on-year growth in the first half of FY24, surpassing the average growth of FMCG companies in India by 3.8 times.Aam bhasha mein bolein toh the growth is making heads turn, the future seems stable, and all seems to be going well for Mamaearth. Anyone who has interacted with Varun Alagh and Ghazal Alagh would understand why. All credit to them! The trajectory of the company has been nothing short of a wonder, and it’s all thanks to raising confidence in the stock market and a generally positive reception from the public. Now that Mamaearth has done it and paved the way, I am sure we will soon see more D2C brands launching their IPOs. PS: Who knows, ZOFF might be the next one! :)#d2c #brand #startup #ipo #mamaearth #business #investing #ipo #stockmarket",566,33,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-01-26,"6500+ orders in just 3 days!!Haan haan sahi padha hai :) ZOFF clinched a remarkable 6501 orders in a mere 3 days through the Open Network For Digital Commerce (ONDC)! ZOFF is enabled as a seller on the network by Shiprocket !ONDC is presently transforming the digital marketplace, providing an invaluable Network for both sellers and buyers. ONDC currently:→ has 1.5L+ merchants→ has expanded into 620+ cities → charges lower commission compared to its competitors who charge as high as 25% commission.What I really like about this Network is that they allow all the players, whether a big name or a kirana store, to put up their products. This not only encourages healthy competition among them but also provides more choices for the consumers. A win-win for both!ONDC is also government-backed, so you know it’s legitimate! Iske alawa there’s always some kind of discount or promotion going on there. Customer support bhi top-notch hai boss! These are just a few reasons why ZOFF has been a distinguished member of ONDC for some time now, and we couldn't be more delighted about it!We're immensely proud of this achievement.

Aaj bhi almost har Indian ghar mai Haldiram ki Bikaneri bhujia toh mil jaati hai, nahi?I noticed how they’ve also adapted their packaging, keeping up with the evolving market. Not just this, unki advertising bhi hamesha se kaafi traditional rahi hai.But, to be in sync with current times, they have also switched to modern forms for better reach and discoverability. 📈 Recently, they tied up with a Bollywood movie- Bawaal, starring Varun Dhawan and Janhvi Kapoor.Isn’t it crazy to see an age-old brand constantly advancing itself according to the market?

Yes, ‘co-create’.The smartest of entrepreneurs believe in the power of building a community. Par, ek community ka part banna hi kyu hai? Hear me out. A community acts like a helping hand, where all the members contribute to their mutual growth by sharing learnings from their unique experiences. Maano ya na maano, kabhi-kabhi na khudki galtiya kaafi mehengi pad jaati hai. So, isn’t it always wiser to learn from the mistakes of others than your own?

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-09-26,"From a packet of chips to detergent to personal care items - everything you can think of in the FMCG space is available in smaller packaging that will cost you somewhere between INR 1-20.But did you know that we didn't have the concept of sachets and smaller packaging introduced till the late 1970s?Back then even shampoo was considered a luxury because the salary of educated white-collar employees used to be around ₹1000 - 5000 a month and a bottle of 50 ml shampoo used to cost ~₹40, making it unaffordable for most.Enter Late Shri R Chinnikrishnan who with his idea changed the trajectory of the FMCG sector.He didn't apply any rocket science, all he did was some simple math (jo hum sab school main seekhte hai).A 50 ml bottle cost around 40 bucks and on average a person uses 5ml for a single wash. So though they couldn't afford to pay 40 bucks in one go but they could pay 1-2 bucks which would be the per wash cost.And that's how sachets came into the picture—smaller packets with less stuff but super affordable.This made luxury items like shampoo affordable for many people. Soon, big companies like HUL and P&G also started selling their products in small packets, allowing them to tap into even the lowest economic class of the society.Now, in the present day, everything from chips to soap is available in small packets. These small packets have become a huge market, worth $9.76 billion in 2022. It's expected to keep growing at about 5.60% every year until 2028 when it might be worth $13.43 billion. That's how powerful a simple idea can be!Even at ZOFF, we are experimenting with smaller packaging.Now, look around you and name all the things that are in sachets/smaller packaging in the comments below!#d2c #zoff #fmcg #packaging #startup",308,63,6,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

And we didn't just lose a little money; we lost crores!! 📉The right thing to do then was to take a step back and re-strategize, exactly what we did. We shifted to D2C amidst COVID, and thankfully it worked in our favor. We kept exploring and experimenting via the D2C channel for 2 more years before finally getting back into general trade and Q-commerce, this time with much more learning.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-02-26,"Did you know rats (yes, you read that right) were a game-changer in transforming how oil was packaged in India?Here is the story of Marico Limited’s Parachute oil.Today, Parachute has 54% of the market share in terms of the total volume of coconut oil sold in India. But it wasn’t always like this.Let’s go back to the 1970s when coconut oil was sold in metal containers. Since coconut oil was a commodity product, meaning that it had to be sold for consumption or production as it was found in nature, it was sold in bulk to retailers in tin containers.Marico’s Parachute Oil was already in the market but was viewed as a premium brand by traders. Why? Because Parachute had:🥥 A distinct aroma that set it apart &🥥 Better clarity and purity than others.Harsh Mariwala, chairman of the brand, was keen on maintaining its status and turning Parachute into a top brand. He identified these key points to bring in a change in the status quo at that time.✅ Selling smaller packages for better sales: distributors in Nagpur and Vidarbha region were already selling Parachute oil in smaller packages. This boosted their sales and Harsh decided to take this move PAN India.✅ Shifting from tin to plastic containers: Parachute was already a niche brand so to visualize it, Harsh proposed to shift to plastic containers. Plus, plastic was cheaper than tins. This, however, was resisted by retailers as they had seen the horrors of it before.Rats loved the smell of coconut oil and plastic containers attracted them. The square-shaped containers made it easy for rats to nibble at the edges which damaged the containers and the other products around it, causing losses for the retailers.To this, Mr Mariwala proposed a cylindrical plastic container which rats couldn't nibble at due to no edges and the coconut smell did not escape from the bottle due to the good quality material. He even went on to experiment to show that this new bottle did not attract any rats and got photos to prove his point.The retailers finally gave in and Parachute was then sold in the iconic blue teardrop-shaped bottle that we know of today.After making these significant changes in the product, the money saved from production was put into marketing campaigns to build public trust. And the rest is history.I think this is a great and inspiring story that shows us that:Quality product + innovative packaging + good marketing =  A success storyWhat is your take on this? What significance do you think packaging can hold for a product?#packaging #fmcg #retail #india #business",239,37,7,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-05-26,"Shark Tank se pehle kya tha ? 🤔 Let’s talk about that chapter!We started from Raipur, a city famous for its steel plants . Toh jab humne Raipur se masalon ka business karne ki baat kari, sab shocked the. 🤯 Then why did we go for it ?We saw our competitors and realized- “Yaar ye market to bahut badi hai”Kuch bhi hojae, log khana nahi chordenge and khana masalon se hi toh banta hai. 🍲 Thus in 2018, we started ZOFF. How were we different from others ?The spice business in India was very regional and we wanted to establish our presence PAN India !So, apart from using the latest technology and attractive packaging, we tried to capture the online space !A month before we came to shark tank-🌶️We made a revenue of 4.5 crores through online sales. 🌶️A total revenue of 7 crores in the past month (both offline and online). 🌶️We had appointed Shilpa Shetty as the brand ambassador. The goal before and after Shark Tank has always been-✔ To become a top name in the Spice Industry.✔ To never be limited to a specific region. Zoff is and will be a national brand.We have come a long way through, and Shark Tank was indeed a trajectory changing platform. And with all the ups and downs we have learned a lot, and we don't intend to ever stop learning.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-04-26,"Dhandha ya startup?A lot people now find traditional businesses “boring.” 😴 But, I recently met someone who changed my view here - Falak Sheth, a third-generational entrepreneur running Kayam Churna. I asked him why hasn’t he ventured into the E-Commerce and D2C space yet?“Akash mera business is working well the way it is, I get free by 4 and then family ke saath time spend karta hu. Me and my family are fully satisfied.”Not the answer I was expecting. 😲 Falak is a third-generation entrepreneur carrying ahead his family’s brand that was built even before ‘ startup’ was a fancy word. He is super clear about scaling the brand through traditional and offline channels of business, which seems pragmatic. There is no playbook for entrepreneurship. Everyone has to define their own vision and set their own goals. When you’re in for the real cause - funding, ecommerce, valuations, IPO etc. are just mediums to reach the bigger goal.What did I learn from Falak? Entrepreneurial priorities can be different.

Here are more facts that might surprise you 🛍~65% Indians tried something new because the package caught their eye🛍~55% purchased a product again because of the package🛍~50% switch brands due to negative experience with packaging Brings some context into why every other founder and investor is so serious about packaging, now? From day 0 we at ZOFF have emphasized on our customer interaction journey. And while the consumers are used to old uncles on their masala packets we wanted to make our packaging more than just a cardboard box with a foil packet inside. So we innovated. → We introduced high quality 4 layer packets with zip locks that can keep your spices fresh for days without having to transfer them into different air tight containers. → We painted beyond the transitional red, yellow , pink colors and presented our packets in soft, attractive and colorful shades ranging from vibrant blue to pop green.→ And most importantly, we communicated our brand essence through our packets- with everything a consumer should know clearly mentioned at the back of the product. Turns out, all that creative thinking paid off!  Not only did the sharks love our packaging, but our customers did too!Zoff's innovative packaging became a key factor in disrupting the spice market and fueling our 100 crore turnover!The takeaway?  Think beyond the box (pun intended!) to stand out on crowded shelves.PS: Saw this Instagram post of someone re-designing our packets.

That is what most entrepreneurs lag- A CLEAR VISION. There is no rule book that entrepreneurs have to stick by; you can have your own sets of goals and work as per your own style.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-04-26,"Grooming young minds is a privilege, I am extremely grateful for!I had the opportunity to speak with some incredible students at a prestigious college about the journey of entrepreneurship and what it takes to succeed. Here are some key takeaways from our conversation:💡 Mindset: Having the right mindset is crucial in the world of entrepreneurship. It's important to approach every obstacle with a positive attitude and a growth mindset..💡 Companion: Having a support system is essential. Whether it's a co-founder, mentor, or friend, it's important to surround yourself with people who believe in your vision and are willing to support you on your journey.💡 Never fear failure: You need failure to succeed. Don't be afraid to take risks and make mistakes. It's through failures that we learn the most and make the biggest strides forward.💡  Be wise with money: While having access to funding can certainly help, it's not the be-all and end-all. It's important to focus on building a self-sustainable business model and providing value to your customers. If you're solving a real problem and delivering a great product, the money will eventually follow.Overall, the journey of entrepreneurship is not easy, but it's incredibly rewarding. 💫 Keep these key takeaways in mind as you pursue your own entrepreneurial dreams.Any other point you'd like to help me include in this list?#d2c #business #opportunity #growth #help #students #zoff #linkedinlearning #startupindia",172,18,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-04-26,"“ Apke pass toh pehle se paisa tha, islie aapke lie aasan tha”“ Paisa tha islie business bana lia”“ Apka toh background hi rich hai, apko kya dikkat”These were the comments on few of my posts.So let’s break your bubble, that family business hone se startup karna easy ho jata hai.Family businesses and startups are very different. Yes you get access to financial resources, but with that comes immense pressure. To move out of a family business is a tough task. Pahad todne jaisa lagta hai. Your family doesn’t allow you to leave the traditional and well set business. They need to be convinced way more than an investor. Yes, the first check is sorted, but to scale up you will need to pitch to other investors. Also, when your family’s money is involved, your stress is higher. Your ego to make things work comes in between. You sacrifice a lot to make sure the investment made by your family is worth it. That is not the case otherwise. Ghar ka paisa dub gaya, toh guilt overcome karna, ek task banjaega.So yes, we had the initial investments to set up, but scaling up and making Zoff reach where it is today took a lot of sacrifices, hardwork and dedication.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-02-26,"“Ab toh tu celebrity ho gaya hai,” is a sentence that is hard to interpret: was it appreciation, or just plain old sarcasm? A genuine question pops up, though: what even is a celebrity, and what’s all the hype about? Untrue to the common notion, being a celebrity isn’t just about fame. Of course, the greater public life is a given, but it’s often owed to being highly respected in your field. The past couple of years have been transformative. From merely thinking of celebrities as TV figures, to actually interacting with them in real life, a whole new personality of people come to the surface. You learn about their struggles, challenges, and the worldview they hold, and it impacts you deeply. You start making choices that they would, and your social standing and reputation change accordingly. It's no wonder then that celebrities get way more criticism for indulging in acts that we do every day, without a second thought. But there is also a positive light to all this. With greater eyes on them, they hold the power to influence the public for a good cause. The time I’ve spent surrounded by celebrities has revealed some interesting facts to me: Yes, at times, things seem superficial, but beneath all those layers are normal people, like you and me, leading normal lives.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-08-26,"What would you do if you got punched by a random stranger?I still remember Gauranga Das Prabhu Ji narrating this hilarious yet profound story at G20 Summit 2023.It was a story in which people from diverse parts of the country were travelling in a boat. Suddenly, a commoner went to a wrestler and asked- “What’s the time right now?”Out of nowhere, the wrestler punched him right in the face.The passengers were shocked and got furious at him for such an offensive gesture.The wrestler then broke the silence by saying: “In our village, it’s a tradition to tell the time through punches. I punched him once so that he gets to know that it’s 1:00 p.m. right now. ”Silence prevailed. Everyone found it a little weird. Then, what the commoner did next will blow your mind!He smiled and said: “Thank God that I didn’t ask for the time an hour ago.”The entire crowd laughed out loud.No one saw that coming, kyuki naturally sabhi ko lag raha tha ki wo gusse mai aakar uspe bhi haath utha dega.Lekin nahi, he decided to do what 99% of us wouldn’t have.2 things to learn from this:1) How we react influences the people around us.Notice how the anger of the crowd melted away after hearing from him and they burst into laughter.2) Act, don’t react.As a founder, we need to understand the power of being tolerant.Once we learn to keep our calm, people will never be able to bring us down.Never!What is your takeaway from the story?#zoff #d2c #brand #startup #founder #mindset #work #people #linkedinlearning",154,26,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Snacking is a daily staple as 76% of people in the country snacking at least twice a day.➡ Healthy food options: With the rise in demand for healthy food options, especially fuelled by covid, the per capita spending on healthy foods could reach 2x by 2026. Even as global inflation remains at ~6.6%, 84% of consumers still keep health and wellness in mind when purchasing food.➡ Spices: The Indian spice market still remains largely untapped with over 77% of it being unorganised. There lies a huge opportunity in this sector as customers switch from an unorganised to an organised market looking for better quality spices.➡ Cloud and Home kitchens: The cloud kitchen market is expected to reach a market size of USD 1.05 billion by 2025 kyunki aakhir maa ke haath ka khana to maa ke haath ka khana hota hai.The majority of F&B consumption in India is being driven by people between the age group of 18-40.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-09-26,"Consider this: 81% need to trust a brand before buying from it.Today, trust in business is unnegotiable-✅Trust with the consumers✅Trust with the team✅Trust with the investorsAnd brands will build that trust by sharing their story with their consumers.People no longer just buy a product- they buy the story, narrative an d vision associated with it.→ 92% of consumers want brands to make ads that feel like a story.→ 55% of consumers are more likely to remember a story than a list of facts.→ 68% of consumers say that brand stories influence their purchasing decisions.→ Companies with compelling brand stories have a 20% increase in customer loyalty.And hence amongst all of this lies the importance of storytelling while building a brand.Studies from the Harvard Business Review reveal that our brains have a natural inclination for storytelling.

And that made me realize how much I missed home cooked food .( Nothing comes close to it, bhale hi mess ka khana ho ya bade hotel ka )You know what I did ?I learnt to cook !I asked my mother to teach me some of my favorite dishes and I started cooking them whenever I missed home.If, you’re someone who is living alone, then my advice to you is- Take out time and cook for yourself !It will give you that “Ghar Wali Feeling.”And this was one of the things that we kept in mind while developing ZOFF products.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-03-26,"Interacting with the youth nourishes me as a founder. Recently, I spoke with some amazing kids at NIT Raipur.With the surge in entrepreneurship, it's critical to provide education, guidance, mentorship, and support to existing & potential student entrepreneurs. Here’s a 3-point summary of what I shared with them:✅Do it for yourself, not to impress others.Don’t pursue entrepreneurship because it looks glamorous on Instagram. Do it for yourself and your soul, it will fuel your life’s purpose. Entrepreneurship is a journey of self-discovery and personal growth, emphasizing authenticity over external validation and valuing inner fulfillment above all else. ✅Don't waste time; seek quality advice.When starting your own business, consult experienced mentors and peers to avoid unnecessary trial and error. Their guidance can speed up your path to success by helping you navigate challenges more efficiently.✅Opportunities = Vision + Determination + ResourcesIn entrepreneurship, seizing opportunities is paramount. And, you’ll only be able to make the most out of these opportunities, when you’re ready with the right vision, determination & resources. Secure them first so that when opportunities knock; you’re ready to open the door :)These are just a few of the many things I’ve learned & realized during my journey of building ZOFF. There’s a lot that has happened and there’s a lot we’re hoping to happen! So, cheers to the 1000s of lessons entrepreneurial life teaches you :DWhat’s your take on this?

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-09-26,"1 in 4 entrepreneurs face a mental health disorder in their lifetime. A study by the University of San Francisco found that entrepreneurs are more likely to experience mental health problems than people who don't own their own businesses. In fact, 72% of entrepreneurs participating in the study reported mental health problems.This is deeply concerning. Yes, entrepreneurship ek easy journey hai nahi. It is tough. Tougher than a lot of other career prospects if you ask me.And amidst all the what-ifs, long hours, hustling, and firefighting it does get overwhelming!!And worse of all, for many it also gets lonely. Personal experience se kahu, toh there have been many times when I myself have felt lost and alone, but here are a few things that have always helped me navigate the ups and downs of business→ Having a support group. With all the communities emerging in the ecosystem, you get to meet a lot of people on the same wavelength as you who get where are you coming from. → Spending time with family, especially my kids. It’s adorable how their life is so simple and how much one can learn from them. → Working out. After all, your body and mind are connected. Figure out what helps you disconnect and unwind. Remember, there are people ready to help, but you have to ask for it. On that note, how do you cope up with the stresses of business?#startup #founder #entrepreneurship #business #mentalhealth",59,30,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-01-26,"'Everything under the sun is political.' This phrase, as poetic as it sounds, is profoundly true. From the breakfast table debates to the policies shaping our work, politics is deeply woven into the fabric of our day-to-day existence. It's not just about parliament and elections; it's in the choices we make.Like a lot of people, I've started getting more into politics recently. It all began with the 2014 elections, seeing more young people get involved, and how Narendra Modi has made us all take more notice.(Like him or not but you can’t ignore our PM)“Staying away,” is a personal choice today, not the norm, and there’s a rising awareness that In the world’s largest democracy, politics is not just a word, and it’s not just for the privileged. Sure, we all have different views and ideas about how involved we should be, but more and more people realize that we're all part of growing our country. It's exciting to think about what we want to change and create.Every single person: from a daily wage laborer to a CEO has a part to play. For me, engagement in politics looks like → Asking Questions: I'm always curious and I ask a lot of questions. This helps me understand things around me better. → Joining Conversations: I don't always argue or debate. Often, I just listen to what my friends are saying. It's amazing what you can learn just by being part of a conversation.→ Keeping Up with News: I read the news on my phone. It's not hard, you literally have 100s of apps for the same. It's like feeding my brain with new information every day, and it helps me know more about the world.And most importantly, staying involved has sharpened my ability to view things impartially. It's like switching from seeing the world in just black and white to appreciating the various shades of gray in between. After all, in a country of such diversity, how can our politics not be the same! So, what's your take on the intricacy of Indian politics? How do you stay actively engaged and informed?#india #politics #development #growth",57,18,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-04-26,"As the founder of ZOFF, I was thrilled to read this report on the potential of Digital Commerce in India. The report highlights how reduced buyer and seller app fees could make it financially attractive for sellers to build up their own D2C brands. This is a game-changer for small businesses across the country, who could suddenly have access to a national (and even international) market. 🚀But it's not just small businesses that stand to benefit. ✅ The report suggests that big brands may also rethink their innovation strategies to reach microsegments directly.✅ This could lead to a revolution in the way D2C ecommerce operates in India, as more and more companies start to see the potential of building up their own brands and engaging directly with consumers.As someone who's passionate about entrepreneurship and innovation, I believe this is an incredibly exciting time for D2C brands in India. With the right strategies and tools in place, there's no limit to what we can achieve.🔥 I'm super excited to be a part of this ecosystem and experience this revolution first hand! 💛What's your take on D2C brands? Would love to know about your favourite D2C brand also ;)#zoff #spices #d2c #d2cbrands #d2cindia #digitalcommerce #experience #entrepreneurship #ecommerce #innovation #india #brand",56,24,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-11-26,"20% of all advertising features a celebrity and brings around a 20% - 40% boost in trust and sales. In fact, celebrity endorsements impact the purchases of 28% of 18-to-34 year-olds.But these investments cost an arm and leg, and the doubt creeps in.For us, at ZOFF, the decision was clear from day one. Shilpa Shetty is the face of healthy eating, and we wanted someone who could resonate with our ideas.However, it would have made much less sense agar we were asking someone jiska health and khaane koi talluk hi na ho, to promote our products.So step one is to find the perfect person who can be the ambassador of your back-end effort. Once you have gotten the right person, the second step is to figure out the right balance between equity and cash payments.For a single post on social media, enormous amounts are charged, but if this doesn’t suit your startup's current cash flow, a better alternative is in place.Most celebrities in today’s time switch cash payments for equity in the company, and this benefits not just one, but rather, both parties.For the company, this is, in a way, consistent promotion, without constant pressure of finances. For the celebrity, it is a long-term partnership and better stability.Marketing today may be more complicated than it was a couple of years jab sirf newspaper aur Doordarshan hi the, but with the new alternatives popping in, everywhere you look, something or the other is being promoted.Have you found your ideal endorsement yet?#zoff #d2c #branding #marketing #celebrityendorsement",54,7,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-04-26,"What's that FREE marketing tool which has brought immense ROI for ZOFF & other D2C brands?WORD OF MOUTH ⭐ According to a survey of 40,000 consumers across 56 countries, 88% of consumers trusted recommendations from people they know, over all other forms for marketing.⭐ McKinsey & Co reported that the word of mouth is the primary factor, behind 20-50% of all purchasing decisions. ⭐ BCG reported that word of mouth was 2-10 times more effective than paid ads. ⭐ 23% of consumers talk about their favorite products with friends and family .So, if you're on a tight marketing budget, focus on getting people to talk about your brand. I'm proud to say that ZOFF has well capitalized on this approach and has seen great results!Word of mouth marketing is the D2C version of ""let your work do the talking!"" How about you?
