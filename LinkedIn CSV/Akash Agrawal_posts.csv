Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-02-26,""" 30 Million "" views on a reel - all 100% organic! Our conversation with Namita is still going viral on social media 1 year later! During our Shark Tank India Season 2 pitch, a reel featuring my brother Ashish asking Namita to name a few spice brands went viral.The post was all over the internet back then, but to my surprise, it went viral again in the last few days...With marketing, I've realized that nothing can be truly predictable.No one can predict trends, but all you can do is just flow with them at times. Plus, let's be honest, who doesn't love to have a good laugh? üòÇMemes, with their humor and relatability, are lethal marketing tools, conveying messages that spread widely across online platforms.Memes = Organic Growth + Relatability + Chance of ViralityAlso, let's not forget, Shark Tank itself is a cultural staple. Memorable moments from the show, like Aman Gupta's ""Hum bhi bana lenge"" and Namita Thapar's ""Ye meri expertise nahi hai,"" are immortalized in the meme history book.So much so that the sharks themselves have fun with these memes now ü§£There's so much that comes out of Shark Tank apart from the deals!P.S. - Having said that, can you name 4 spice brands? üòÇPPS: The most iconic answer to the aforementioned question is still Anupam Mittal's ""Zoff, Zoff, Zoff and ZOFF""PPPS: What is your favorite meme from the show?https://lnkd.in/gEfF2w_H#d2c #sharktank #brand #marketing #startup

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-06-26,"Naya season ho ya controversy-¬†Shark Tank is always in limelight.We are a Shark Tank funded startup ourselves and we are not in favor of the recent show related controversies!I understand and respect other people‚Äôs differing opinions. But, I wanted to share this to make sure every person knows the other side of the coin as well!As audience, you just see the grand pitch and handing over of the cheque. But in reality, a lot goes on behind the stage. ‚úÖ You have to go through a long due diligence process!¬†And if you can‚Äôt give solid proof of the claims you have made- Why would the sharks go ahead with the deal? Think for yourself- Would you invest in someone if you can‚Äôt trust them? ‚úÖ People have spread rumors that the sharks ghost you.¬†I don‚Äôt stand by this statement. Personally, Aman Gupta is the best thing that could have happened to the company. We're extremely grateful to him and his team for the constant support.I have personally seen businesses get the much needed exposure with the help of sharks. Another point to think- The sharks can‚Äôt always be at your beck and call,  right?Simple hai- Commitment comes from both sides! I have seen businesses reap benefits just after the registration process. The show helps businesses look at their business from a different approach! ZOFF will always be thankful to the show for providing us with such an amazing platform. P.s.- A huge shout out to the whole shark tank team for taking entrepreneurship in India to the next level and making startups a dinner table conversation. Thank you to the sharks for giving in so much of their time to the show and to budding entrepreneurs.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-11-26,"A couple of years back, nobody would have thought that D2C brands would capture the market like this, much less launch an IPO. We were in for a surprise. Mamaearth launched its IPO less than 20 days ago and has been creating buzz since then. Launched at Rs. 324, it has risen by 41% in a short duration. Lekin one might wonder ki aakhir ismein badhi baat kya hai? After all, the stock market is full of shocks, and rollercoaster case studies. Mamaearth itni headlines kyun bana raha hai?The simple answer: nobody saw this coming. Despite the public support and good financials, critics are of the opinion that the future of D2C brands is limited and find it hard to believe that people would actually invest in such companies. Well, if you are one of the confused ones, consider these: „ÄãHonasa Consumer Ltd., the parent company has been in high spirits since finalizing the IPO launch as revenues in FY 22 doubled from the previous year to Rs 943 crores, recording a profit of Rs 14.4 crores. „ÄãAdmittedly, Mamaearth is planning to improve brand visibility and inorganic growth such as exclusive brand outlets, and that might be one of the reasons why primary stakeholders are aiming to sell their shares. „ÄãJefferies reported the share being a ‚Äúhigh conviction buy,‚Äù and for good reason: The company's management is confident about achieving over 30% revenue growth, mirroring the success seen in the first half of the year. „ÄãMamaearth has demonstrated an impressive 33% year-on-year growth in the first half of FY24, surpassing the average growth of FMCG companies in India by 3.8 times.Aam bhasha mein bolein toh the growth is making heads turn, the future seems stable, and all seems to be going well for Mamaearth. Anyone who has interacted with Varun Alagh and Ghazal Alagh would understand why. All credit to them! The trajectory of the company has been nothing short of a wonder, and it‚Äôs all thanks to raising confidence in the stock market and a generally positive reception from the public. Now that Mamaearth has done it and paved the way, I am sure we will soon see more D2C brands launching their IPOs.

ONDC currently:‚Üí has 1.5L+ merchants‚Üí has expanded into 620+ cities¬†‚Üí charges lower commission compared to its competitors who charge as high as 25% commission.What I really like about this Network is that they allow all the players, whether a big name or a kirana store, to put up their products. This not only encourages healthy competition among them but also provides more choices for the consumers. A win-win for both!ONDC is also government-backed, so you know it‚Äôs legitimate! Iske alawa there‚Äôs always some kind of discount or promotion going on there. Customer support bhi top-notch hai boss!

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-09-26,"From a packet of chips to detergent to personal care items - everything you can think of in the FMCG space is available in smaller packaging that will cost you somewhere between INR 1-20.But did you know that we didn't have the concept of sachets and smaller packaging introduced till the late 1970s?Back then even shampoo was considered a luxury because the salary of educated white-collar employees used to be around ‚Çπ1000 - 5000 a month and a bottle of 50 ml shampoo used to cost ~‚Çπ40, making it unaffordable for most.Enter Late Shri R Chinnikrishnan who with his idea changed the trajectory of the FMCG sector.He didn't apply any rocket science, all he did was some simple math (jo hum sab school main seekhte hai).A 50 ml bottle cost around 40 bucks and on average a person uses 5ml for a single wash. So though they couldn't afford to pay 40 bucks in one go but they could pay 1-2 bucks which would be the per wash cost.And that's how sachets came into the picture‚Äîsmaller packets with less stuff but super affordable.This made luxury items like shampoo affordable for many people. Soon, big companies like HUL and P&G also started selling their products in small packets, allowing them to tap into even the lowest economic class of the society.Now, in the present day, everything from chips to soap is available in small packets. These small packets have become a huge market, worth $9.76 billion in 2022. It's expected to keep growing at about 5.60% every year until 2028 when it might be worth $13.43 billion.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-02-26,"Did you know rats (yes, you read that right) were a game-changer in transforming how oil was packaged in India?Here is the story of Marico Limited‚Äôs Parachute oil.Today, Parachute has 54% of the market share in terms of the total volume of coconut oil sold in India. But it wasn‚Äôt always like this.Let‚Äôs go back to the 1970s when coconut oil was sold in metal containers. Since coconut oil was a commodity product, meaning that it had to be sold for consumption or production as it was found in nature, it was sold in bulk to retailers in tin containers.Marico‚Äôs Parachute Oil was already in the market but was viewed as a premium brand by traders. Why? Because Parachute had:ü•• A distinct aroma that set it apart &ü•• Better clarity and purity than others.Harsh Mariwala, chairman of the brand, was keen on maintaining its status and turning Parachute into a top brand. He identified these key points to bring in a change in the status quo at that time.‚úÖ Selling smaller packages for better sales: distributors in Nagpur and Vidarbha region were already selling Parachute oil in smaller packages. This boosted their sales and Harsh decided to take this move PAN India.‚úÖ Shifting from tin to plastic containers: Parachute was already a niche brand so to visualize it, Harsh proposed to shift to plastic containers. Plus, plastic was cheaper than tins. This, however, was resisted by retailers as they had seen the horrors of it before.Rats loved the smell of coconut oil and plastic containers attracted them. The square-shaped containers made it easy for rats to nibble at the edges which damaged the containers and the other products around it, causing losses for the retailers.To this, Mr Mariwala proposed a cylindrical plastic container which rats couldn't nibble at due to no edges and the coconut smell did not escape from the bottle due to the good quality material. He even went on to experiment to show that this new bottle did not attract any rats and got photos to prove his point.The retailers finally gave in and Parachute was then sold in the iconic blue teardrop-shaped bottle that we know of today.After making these significant changes in the product, the money saved from production was put into marketing campaigns to build public trust. And the rest is history.I think this is a great and inspiring story that shows us that:Quality product + innovative packaging + good marketing =  A success storyWhat is your take on this? What significance do you think packaging can hold for a product?#packaging #fmcg #retail #india #business",239,37,7,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-04-05,"Packaging is almost 3x more important for consumer satisfaction in developing markets such as India, than it is in developed markets such as the US. Sounds interesting?

From day 0 we at ZOFF have emphasized on our customer interaction journey. And while the consumers are used to old uncles on their masala packets we wanted to make our packaging more than just a cardboard box with a foil packet inside. So we innovated. ‚Üí We introduced high quality 4 layer packets with zip locks that can keep your spices fresh for days without having to transfer them into different air tight containers. ‚Üí We painted beyond the transitional red, yellow , pink colors and presented our packets in soft, attractive and colorful shades ranging from vibrant blue to pop green.‚Üí And most importantly, we communicated our brand essence through our packets- with everything a consumer should know clearly mentioned at the back of the product. Turns out, all that creative thinking paid off!¬† Not only did the sharks love our packaging, but our customers did too!Zoff's innovative packaging became a key factor in disrupting the spice market and fueling our 100 crore turnover!The takeaway?¬† Think beyond the box (pun intended!) to stand out on crowded shelves.PS: Saw this Instagram post of someone re-designing our packets.

It's important to approach every obstacle with a positive attitude and a growth mindset..üí° Companion: Having a support system is essential. Whether it's a co-founder, mentor, or friend, it's important to surround yourself with people who believe in your vision and are willing to support you on your journey.üí° Never fear failure: You need failure to succeed. Don't be afraid to take risks and make mistakes. It's through failures that we learn the most and make the biggest strides forward.üí°  Be wise with money: While having access to funding can certainly help, it's not the be-all and end-all. It's important to focus on building a self-sustainable business model and providing value to your customers. If you're solving a real problem and delivering a great product, the money will eventually follow.Overall, the journey of entrepreneurship is not easy, but it's incredibly rewarding. üí´ Keep these key takeaways in mind as you pursue your own entrepreneurial dreams.Any other point you'd like to help me include in this list?#d2c #business #opportunity #growth #help #students #zoff #linkedinlearning #startupindia",172,18,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-04-26,"‚Äú Apke pass toh pehle se paisa tha, islie aapke lie aasan tha‚Äù‚Äú Paisa tha islie business bana lia‚Äù‚Äú Apka toh background hi rich hai, apko kya dikkat‚ÄùThese were the comments on few of my posts.So let‚Äôs break your bubble, that family business hone se startup karna easy ho jata hai.Family businesses and startups are very different. Yes you get access to financial resources, but with that comes immense pressure. To move out of a family business is a tough task. Pahad todne jaisa lagta hai. Your family doesn‚Äôt allow you to leave the traditional and well set business. They need to be convinced way more than an investor. Yes, the first check is sorted, but to scale up you will need to pitch to other investors. Also, when your family‚Äôs money is involved, your stress is higher. Your ego to make things work comes in between. You sacrifice a lot to make sure the investment made by your family is worth it. That is not the case otherwise. Ghar ka paisa dub gaya, toh guilt overcome karna, ek task banjaega.So yes, we had the initial investments to set up, but scaling up and making Zoff reach where it is today took a lot of sacrifices, hardwork and dedication.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-02-26,"‚ÄúAb toh tu celebrity ho gaya hai,‚Äù is a sentence that is hard to interpret: was it appreciation, or just plain old sarcasm? A genuine question pops up, though: what even is a celebrity, and what‚Äôs all the hype about? Untrue to the common notion, being a celebrity isn‚Äôt just about fame. Of course, the greater public life is a given, but it‚Äôs often owed to being highly respected in your field. The past couple of years have been transformative. From merely thinking of celebrities as TV figures, to actually interacting with them in real life, a whole new personality of people come to the surface. You learn about their struggles, challenges, and the worldview they hold, and it impacts you deeply. You start making choices that they would, and your social standing and reputation change accordingly. It's no wonder then that celebrities get way more criticism for indulging in acts that we do every day, without a second thought. But there is also a positive light to all this. With greater eyes on them, they hold the power to influence the public for a good cause. The time I‚Äôve spent surrounded by celebrities has revealed some interesting facts to me: Yes, at times, things seem superficial, but beneath all those layers are normal people, like you and me, leading normal lives.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-08-26,"What would you do if you got punched by a random stranger?I still remember Gauranga Das Prabhu Ji narrating this hilarious yet profound story at G20 Summit 2023.It was a story in which people from diverse parts of the country were travelling in a boat. Suddenly, a commoner went to a wrestler and asked- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the time right now?‚ÄùOut of nowhere, the wrestler punched him right in the face.The passengers were shocked and got furious at him for such an offensive gesture.The wrestler then broke the silence by saying: ‚ÄúIn our village, it‚Äôs a tradition to tell the time through punches.

Do it for yourself and your soul, it will fuel your life‚Äôs purpose.

Their guidance can speed up your path to success by helping you navigate challenges more efficiently.‚úÖOpportunities = Vision + Determination + ResourcesIn entrepreneurship, seizing opportunities is paramount.

Well, let us give out our specific demands for the prospective tie-up:üîç Uniqueness: looking for something new that hasn't been seen in the market before. ü§î Sensibility: we don't want people to throw our food back at us!üå∂ Matching: what complements Zoff and its taste well?

Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-09-26,"1 in 4 entrepreneurs face a mental health disorder in their lifetime. A study by the University of San Francisco found that entrepreneurs are more likely to experience mental health problems than people who don't own their own businesses. In fact, 72% of entrepreneurs participating in the study reported mental health problems.This is deeply concerning. Yes, entrepreneurship ek easy journey hai nahi. It is tough. Tougher than a lot of other career prospects if you ask me.And amidst all the what-ifs, long hours, hustling, and firefighting it does get overwhelming!!And worse of all, for many it also gets lonely. Personal experience se kahu, toh there have been many times when I myself have felt lost and alone, but here are a few things that have always helped me navigate the ups and downs of business‚Üí Having a support group. With all the communities emerging in the ecosystem, you get to meet a lot of people on the same wavelength as you who get where are you coming from. ‚Üí Spending time with family, especially my kids. It‚Äôs adorable how their life is so simple and how much one can learn from them. ‚Üí Working out. After all, your body and mind are connected. Figure out what helps you disconnect and unwind.

Akash Agrawal,Male,2024-01-26,"'Everything under the sun is political.' This phrase, as poetic as it sounds, is profoundly true. From the breakfast table debates to the policies shaping our work, politics is deeply woven into the fabric of our day-to-day existence. It's not just about parliament and elections; it's in the choices we make.Like a lot of people, I've started getting more into politics recently. It all began with the 2014 elections, seeing more young people get involved, and how Narendra Modi has made us all take more notice.(Like him or not but you can‚Äôt ignore our PM)‚ÄúStaying away,‚Äù is a personal choice today, not the norm, and there‚Äôs a rising awareness that In the world‚Äôs largest democracy, politics is not just a word, and it‚Äôs not just for the privileged. Sure, we all have different views and ideas about how involved we should be, but more and more people realize that we're all part of growing our country. It's exciting to think about what we want to change and create.Every single person: from a daily wage laborer to a CEO has a part to play. For me, engagement in politics looks like ‚Üí Asking Questions: I'm always curious and I ask a lot of questions. This helps me understand things around me better. ‚Üí Joining Conversations: I don't always argue or debate. Often, I just listen to what my friends are saying. It's amazing what you can learn just by being part of a conversation.‚Üí Keeping Up with News: I read the news on my phone. It's not hard, you literally have 100s of apps for the same. It's like feeding my brain with new information every day, and it helps me know more about the world.And most importantly, staying involved has sharpened my ability to view things impartially. It's like switching from seeing the world in just black and white to appreciating the various shades of gray in between. After all, in a country of such diversity, how can our politics not be the same! So, what's your take on the intricacy of Indian politics? How do you stay actively engaged and informed?#india #politics #development #growth",57,18,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-04-26,"As the founder of ZOFF, I was thrilled to read this report on the potential of Digital Commerce in India. The report highlights how reduced buyer and seller app fees could make it financially attractive for sellers to build up their own D2C brands. This is a game-changer for small businesses across the country, who could suddenly have access to a national (and even international) market. üöÄBut it's not just small businesses that stand to benefit. ‚úÖ The report suggests that big brands may also rethink their innovation strategies to reach microsegments directly.‚úÖ This could lead to a revolution in the way D2C ecommerce operates in India, as more and more companies start to see the potential of building up their own brands and engaging directly with consumers.As someone who's passionate about entrepreneurship and innovation, I believe this is an incredibly exciting time for D2C brands in India. With the right strategies and tools in place, there's no limit to what we can achieve.üî• I'm super excited to be a part of this ecosystem and experience this revolution first hand! üíõWhat's your take on D2C brands?¬†Would love to know about your favourite D2C brand also ;)#zoff #spices #d2c #d2cbrands #d2cindia #digitalcommerce #experience #entrepreneurship #ecommerce #innovation #india #brand",56,24,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Akash Agrawal,Male,2023-11-26,"20% of all advertising features a celebrity and brings around a 20% - 40% boost in trust and sales. In fact, celebrity endorsements impact the purchases of 28% of 18-to-34 year-olds.But these investments cost an arm and leg, and the doubt creeps in.For us, at ZOFF, the decision was clear from day one. Shilpa Shetty is the face of healthy eating, and we wanted someone who could resonate with our ideas.However, it would have made much less sense agar we were asking someone jiska health and khaane koi talluk hi na ho, to promote our products.So step one is to find the perfect person who can be the ambassador of your back-end effort. Once you have gotten the right person, the second step is to figure out the right balance between equity and cash payments.For a single post on social media, enormous amounts are charged, but if this doesn‚Äôt suit your startup's current cash flow, a better alternative is in place.Most celebrities in today‚Äôs time switch cash payments for equity in the company, and this benefits not just one, but rather, both parties.For the company, this is, in a way, consistent promotion, without constant pressure of finances. For the celebrity, it is a long-term partnership and better stability.Marketing today may be more complicated than it was a couple of years jab sirf newspaper aur Doordarshan hi the, but with the new alternatives popping in, everywhere you look, something or the other is being promoted.Have you found your ideal endorsement yet?#zoff #d2c #branding #marketing #celebrityendorsement",54,7,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAO3nzQBfuJYkFoVwLugVZkyjyQWPu7WYss&keywords=akash%20agrawal&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=70360449-c259-4c24-8181-b4d827fc7a4d&sid=NiU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
