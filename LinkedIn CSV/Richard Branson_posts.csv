Richard Branson,Male,2024-04-06,"I stumbled across this school reports from the Easter break, 65 years ago. It felt very fitting to hear that I was “very backward” in spelling and reading – as I get set to launch my audiobook next week! In case you can’t read the handwriting, here are a few highlights: Classics: “Very keen, but handicapped by a bad memory. Some progress.” Mathematics: “The first half of the term saw a great improvement in his work, but once he began to get onto really new processes his keenness declined, and his standard dropped.” French: “A slight improvement this term but his work is still below standard.” English: “He is still very backward in this subject, especially in spelling and reading - constant practice in the latter is necessary.” Drawing: “If he took a little care he could be good.” Going through school with undiagnosed dyslexia wasn’t at all fun, but I’m glad I didn’t let it squash my big ideas. I hope this inspires anyone out there who might be struggling at school right now. Just remember there’s a whole lot more to life out there, and one day you’ll be able to look back on these reports and smile.

Richard Branson,Male,2023-08-27,"I started my very first business with £300 my mum gave me after selling a necklace when I was a teenager, and this £300 sparked the whole Virgin story. Throughout my career I began to wonder why budding entrepreneurs couldn’t get a similar leg-up from loan providers? I asked myself: ‘What if entrepreneurs could easily get a small loan to turn their idea into reality? What would that mean for them, and what would it mean for the economy and wider society?' I knew that Virgin was in a position to help too, and so the follow up question was, ‘how?’. Virgin StartUp became the answer to the question, and 10 years later our not-for-profit #entrepreneurship incubator has given out over 5,000 loans and distributed over £70 million in funding. Here’s the full story:  https://virg.in/woyM#WorldEntrepreneurshipDay #WhatIfAndy Fishburn

Richard Branson,Male,2024-01-27,"Our ‘secret sauce’ at Virgin has and always will be the people who work with us. This is why we decided to turn the old-fashioned notion of a testimonial video on its head. The Virgin team invited three brilliant members of the #VirginFamily to talk about how great it is to work at Virgin, so they were shocked to realise that Virgin had created a song that sung their praises instead. The team wrote this delightful tune for Marie, Emma, and Sulaimon - describing the wonderful ways they each go above and beyond at work, and why we’re so grateful to have them in the Virgin Family. From Marie’s world-class people skills at Virgin Money, to Emma’s endless passion in the kitchen at Virgin Hotels, and Sulaimon’s infectious energy at Virgin Atlantic, it’s important to remember that your ‘secret sauce’ as a business is your people. Thank you to Marie, Emma, Sulaimon and everyone at Virgin who brings our brand to life every day; and thank you to the brilliant team who worked on this project.

Richard Branson,Male,2023-08-27,"I’ve always asked myself ‘what if…’ questions as an entrepreneur, and the inception of Virgin Atlantic was no exception.The idea of starting Virgin Atlantic came when I was 28-years-old and was catching a flight to the BVI to be reunited with Joan (who is now my lovely wife). When the flight was cancelled at the last minute, I was disappointed but started to think, ‘what if there was another way…?’ I figured there was a whole plane load of people who wanted to get somewhere – all I needed was the plane...I went to the back of the airport, hired a plane, and found a blackboard. As a joke, I wrote ‘Virgin Airways: $39 single flight’, and filled up the flight with all the bumped passengers. As we landed, a passenger said to me: “Virgin Airways isn’t too bad – smarten up the service and you could be in business.”This led to my second ‘what if…’ thought, and it ultimately sparked the launch of Virgin Atlantic.

It’s a trait I suppose I inherited from my dad, who catchphrase in life was: “Isn’t life wonderful?”The book Humankind: A Hopeful History struck a chord with me, because it is a book full of hope. The book explores many negative stories of recorded history, and then it exposes the positive parts of these stories that we rarely get to hear. The unknown heroes and the rebels with a cause. The book reminds us to expect the best in people and in situations, instead of assuming the worst. It also highlights that if we think the worst in others and in ourselves, we bring out the worst sides of humankind.Here’s more about this wonderful book, and the lessons we can learn from it: https://virg.in/wUC5

Richard Branson,Male,2023-12-27,"When I was having dinner aboard Virgin Voyages in Sydney last week, I had a clear view of the Sydney Opera House and could see hundreds of people gathering for an outdoor event. I quickly thought, “We should light up the ship with a message that everybody gathered could see. I was sitting with a group of old friends from Virgin Galactic, and Virgin Australia so we quickly started brainstorming messages we could share, on the back of my menu card! We wanted to say something cheeky like: “The party’s over here!” or “The headline act is on-board” but they were over the character limit. We ended up with “Ship Hot” and “Virgin House”, which was still fun! It reminded me of the old days at Virgin Atlantic when we had a blimp and would quickly paint it with cheeky messages like “BA can’t get it up” (when the British Airways sponsored London Eye was stuck on its side during construction) or “Fly Virgin” (to get some free marketing at the Super Bowl). Thanks to the wonderful Virgin Voyages team for acting on it so fast! The best brainstorms are often the most spontaneous ones: https://virg.in/iNyX

Richard Branson,Male,2024-02-27,"One of the best parts about travelling is the people you meet. I met Aaron Sansoni when I visited Australia in 2011, and I gave him some advice after he shared his entrepreneurial goals with me. Having grown up in a broken home and struggling in school with ADHD, I was inspired to hear how he defied the odds and carved out a remarkable career – which began at the age of 12! I started my first business at the age of 11 and I struggled with dyslexia throughout my schooling years, so I saw a little bit of myself in Aaron. We’ve met a few times since, and in 2023 I caught up with Aaron again in Melbourne. He showed me a tattered copy of a book I wrote many years ago called Business Stripped Bare. It was dog-eared, highlighter ravaged, and scribbled in all over. He told me how he still runs his companies from the principles in the book, which was heart-warming to hear. Aaron has now built up over 85 investments, and dedicated much of his life to educating the next generation of entrepreneurs. A wonderful story of resilience, entrepreneurship, and the importance of passing on everything you learn in life. Until next time, Aaron!

Richard Branson,Male,2024-02-27,"When the devastating earthquake hit Morocco last year, we immediately got together (as Virgin Unite, Virgin Limited Edition and The Eve Branson Foundation) to figure out how we could best help. I flew out to help the people on the ground, and we started thinking about the businesses that could be the most helpful in this situation. I decided to write a personal letter to Andrew Denton – CEO of the Outdoor Industries Association (OIA). Andrew and Thomas Reilly (the former UK Ambassador to Morocco) went above and beyond by leading an appeal to OIA members. This created a brilliant and impactful response. EverTrek sent hundreds of reusable water bottles; JD OUTDOOR supplied a large consignment of insulated outerwear and tents; and Adventurous Eve, AlpKit and Churcher’s College all made donations. More than 100 pallets of supplies have recently arrived, including 2,000 Octagon tents donated by Coleman UK, alongside sleeping bags, roll mats, blankets, warm winter clothing, filtered water bottles and children’s activity boxes. As a result, more than 16,000 people in the High Atlas Mountains now have reliable shelter against the winter weather. This type of collaboration is business at its best, and I’m moved by how Virgin Unite, the Eve Branson Foundation, and these partners continue to support the impacted communities. I’m also forever inspired by the Berber people in the High Atlas Mountains and I’m sure they will continue to rise from this challenge they continue to face.

Richard Branson,Male,2024-01-27,"Virgin Voyages, meet the BVI. Incredible to wave Valiant Lady into the British Virgin Islands, the place I have called home for so long. One of the most memorable parts of the journey was seeing the ship glide past Necker, as we watched on from the beach. It was a dark evening, but the ship lit up the sky with the most fantastic fireworks display.Just a month earlier, I was standing on top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge welcoming Resilient Lady into Australia’s shores for the very first time, and it moved me to realise just how far our team have come in the past few years. Virgin Voyages now sails to more than 100 destinations all around the world, with 60+ itineraries across three ships. We created Virgin Voyages to shake up a stagnant cruise industry and do things differently. We wanted to attract people who love travelling but sceptical about cruising, so we designed a superyacht style ship with no buffets, no kids (sorry grandkids!), Michelin dining experiences, and a big focus on health and wellness. It was a bit of a risk, as it is so far from the typical cruising experience, but it’s all been worth it in the end.

Richard Branson,Male,2024-02-27,"What if entrepreneurs could easily get a small loan to turn their idea into reality? This is the thought that led to the launch of Virgin StartUp. About halfway through my career, I began to wonder why it was so difficult for budding entrepreneurs to access capital for their start-ups.   If they could access small loans, I began to wonder what it would mean for them? what would it mean for the economy? And what about the future? If university students could access loans, why couldn’t businesses and banks work with the government to do the same for the people who are building the businesses of tomorrow? I knew that Virgin was in a position to help, and so the follow up question was, ‘how?’Virgin StartUp became the answer to this question, and 10 years on it has now backed over 5,000 founders in the UK.

Richard Branson,Male,2023-10-27,"Dyslexic Thinking skills such as imagination and communication have helped me so much throughout my career. Without them, Virgin wouldn’t be the brand it is today. These soft skills (and others such as innovating, lateral thinking, and complex problem solving) are the kind of skills that AI cannot replace. This is why workforces need to embrace dyslexic thinking and better support dyslexic colleagues if they want to future-proof their businesses. It’s also just the right thing to do. Made By Dyslexia's new course on LinkedIn Learning is a brilliant starting point as it explores ways for you to empower dyslexic thinking at work, and actively recruit dyslexic colleagues too.

Richard Branson,Male,2024-01-27,"How can we ensure technology and innovation makes us happier?With 2024 well and truly underway, I thought this question (prompted by Mohamed Yunus Vhora FCCA) would be nice to address in my first newsletter of the year. As Mohammed eloquently put it: “technology and innovation has been created by man to make things faster, better, cheaper, or within reach… Whilst all the outcomes are being realised, it feels that we are not necessarily happier, more free, content, or improving ourselves. It sometimes feels like [technology] is having an adverse impact on our lives…” In a world that is digitising and innovating at a rapid pace, Mohammed makes an important point. The focus of technology and innovation should always be about bettering society, bringing people together, and making our lives more seamless. However, I agree that this is not always the case...

Richard Branson,Male,2023-11-27,"The spirit of innovation is getting out there and trying to prove that we can do things better for everyone’s benefit. Flying onboard Virgin Atlantic's Flight100 reminded me of other moments where we’ve pushed for change. One of those is when we tried to encourage Airbus and Boeing to make their planes using carbon fibre composite, which would reduce the amount of fuel used and cut enormous amounts of carbon emissions, but they weren’t sure it could be done.We wanted to show them it could work, so aerospace engineer Burt Rutan built a plane for us that we called the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer and we flew it around the world non-stop, breaking records, with Steve Fossett – demonstrating that carbon fibre worked. Not only did it work, it was the most carbon efficient aircraft ever built. After the flight we called Airbus and Boeing and urged them to come and see the plane and learn more about the clean technology it was utilising. Their teams flew over to the Mojave Desert and worked with our teams to find out about the carbon fibre technology and to learn more about how to build much lighter planes out of principally carbon. We told them if you build them, we will buy them - and they did. This resulted in beautiful planes made of mostly carbon fibre like the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 (both of which Virgin Atlantic now flies), which both emit much less carbon dioxide. Sometimes you must show the world something can be done, to then spur action. This flight will hopefully achieve that. This is the defining challenge of the aviation sector and we must always be pushing for innovation.If you make it, Virgin Atlantic will fly it. Flight100 proves it. https://virg.in/iSsd

Richard Branson,Male,2024-03-27,"When we bought Kasbah Tamadot back in 1998 to transform it into a Virgin Limited Edition property, my mum crossed the valley to visit the Moroccan local villages and meet our neighbours. She met a young woman called Fatima who invited her in for mint tea and Mum ended up teaching her how to knit and sew. Before long, they’d started a knitting group of over 30 people so more women could come together to learn a new skill.Mum wanted to help empower the local community near Kasbah Tamadot to be able to make a living, while still preserving their rich Berber heritage. It was from this knitting group that the ethos of The Eve Branson Foundation (EBF) was created.Over the years, the charity has expanded in many ways. Right before the earthquake struck six months ago, the team was preparing to welcome students back to its newly restored study centre. Devastatingly, the centre was badly damaged.No strangers of rising to a challenge, EBF immediately ensured the students had the school supplies they needed to continue their studies remotely. Six months on, and the extensive restoration is now complete, and students are set to return soon. Thank you to everyone who made this possible by donating to EBF’s earthquake relief fund.

Richard Branson,Male,2024-04-06,"At the outset, each of my adventures was a step into the unknown for the company – a bit like the loss of one’s virginity. But, unlike really losing your virginity, in whatever world you make for yourself, you can keep embracing the new and the different over and over again. That’s what I have always wanted for Virgin and, whether it’s achieved by judgement or luck, I wouldn’t have it any other way. This is an exclusive snippet from my (first-ever) audiobook, Losing and Finding My Virginity – which is out today! I really hope you enjoy it: https://lnkd.in/ehTMgbd8

Richard Branson,Male,2024-02-27,"The best ideas don’t always need detailed financial projections and complicated business proposals. Sometimes they come from a simple ‘what if’ moment and some sketches on the back of a beer mat. One such idea led to the fastest growing Virgin company of all time: Virgin Australia. The beer mat sketch had been scribbled by Brett Godfrey, who became the CEO of Virgin Australia (which was then called Virgin Blue) and was instrumental in its launch. When Brett came to me with the idea of a low-cost carrier airline in Australia, I was immediately intrigued. At the time, people were being ripped off by the duopoly that Qantas and Ansett had on the market. This was exactly the kind of industry Virgin was built to disrupt. And so we called the airline Virgin Blue and launched it with a A$10 million budget. Within a year, the A$10 million investment turned into a A$120 million valuation, and over two decades later the airline is still reaching new heights. Who knew that a few pints, a beer mat and a ‘what if’ moment could lead to this! This is the story of Virgin Australia: https://virg.in/3OH2nqz#VirginFamily#launch #scale #risktaking #growth #aviation

It truly inspiring to see a young person like Ben following his dreams and helping other neurodiverse people realise they can achieve anything they set their minds to. It was fascinating to learn how auticon will deploy its autistic data analysts and software engineers to help Ben take his driving to the next level. Such a powerful way of showing the brilliant skills that people with autism bring to the table – particularly in terms of IT, coding, and analytics. Wishing you the best of luck for the season ahead, Ben and team! Can’t wait to see you breaking boundaries, both on and off the track.

Richard Branson,Male,2023-11-27,"Our vision is to have all our customers around the world rewarded for choosing Virgin. This sparked more what if questions – what if we could reward people for going about their daily lives and earning points for doing things they would be doing anyway? An obvious one for us is travelling – we have planes, hotels, cruise ships. But what about everyday travel? What if every time you took a train, you could get something in return? We want to make earning points an everyday experience that builds up and turns into something brilliant.Enter, Virgin Trains Ticketing - our app where you can buy train tickets anywhere across Britain. When you book with Virgin Trains Ticketing, you'll earn 3 Virgin Points for every £ spent, which can be used to cut the cost of future travel or unlock rewards with Virgin Red (think flights, experiences and holidays, as well as everyday treats such as hot drinks and snacks). We also didn't like the thought of customers having to pay a booking fee, so we got rid of those too. And we also offer split ticket options, which helps customers find cheaper options. Virgin Trains Ticketing started with a ton of ‘what if’ questions. And just because the business has launched, it doesn’t mean those questions stop!

Richard Branson,Male,2023-10-27,"It’s incredible to believe that it has been 10 years since we welcomed our first guests at Mahali Mzuri. Mahali is Virgin Limited Edition's magical safari camp in Kenya, which sits right at the heart of the Great Migration. The idea behind the camp came about in 2007, when I visited Nairobi and learnt about the conservation threats to the Olare Motorogi region. And so we worked with the Maasai landowners to find a solution, and Mahali Mzuri became the wonderful result. It’s amazing to see how conservation remains the driving force behind everything the team does at Mahali, and that 80% of the team now hail from the local community. Over the years, I’ve witnessed the most magical scenes at Mahali Mzuri. From front row views of the Great Migration, to leopards and lions lounging around with their cubs, cheetahs hunting in packs, elephants walking into the sunset, dust storms forming around galloping wildebeest, and gangly giraffes with necks that seem to touch the purple skies at dawn. I can’t count the amount of wildlife I’ve seen strolling past my tent, or how magnificent it is to see Maasai warriors dancing the Adumu. Wilson Odhiambo, who has been general manager of Mahali Mzuri since 2017, tells the story behind the camp so well in the video here. I've shared more memories from the time I've spent at Mahali here too: https://virg.in/wrUn

Richard Branson,Male,2023-11-27,"How could we approach philanthropy with entrepreneurial thinking? This was the ‘What If’ moment that sparked the launch of Virgin Unite. Early on in my career, I learnt that success comes faster if you bring brilliant minds together. It’s what helped us launch Virgin Records and Virgin Atlantic, and it’s been indispensable in our philanthropic efforts too. In 2003, I worked quickly to bring two leaders together to address the looming conflict in Iraq – an unjust war I was avidly against. I arranged a trip to Baghdad with Nelson Mandela and Kofi Annan (to try and encourage Saddam Hussein to step down) but a couple of days before they were due to fly, Allied bombs were dropped on Baghdad. I was devastated, but more determined than ever to start our own foundation that would challenge unacceptable issues by uniting brilliant minds in an entrepreneurial style. Almost 20 years later the foundation has gone from strength to strength, with Jean Oelwang as CEO all this time, still partnering closely with me. It makes me so proud to look back on everything that Virgin Unite has achieved in that time from criminal justice reform, to ocean conservation, helping catalyse the clean energy transition, advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, creating opportunities for people to lift themselves out of poverty, supporting entrepreneurs, and incubating leadership collectives such as The Elders Foundation, The B Team and (most recently) the Planetary Guardians. This is the impact you can create through radical collaboration. Here’s the full story:  https://virg.in/iU6E #WhatIf#Philanthropy #Entrepreneurship #Leadership

David vs Goliath stories have endured for millennia because we like to see strong, healthy competition, and we want to support the longshot. People love stories, and there are few more beloved tales than the underdog overcoming the big guy. David vs Goliath stories have endured for millennia because we like to see strong, healthy competition, and we want to support the longshot. Virgin has thrived on this competitive streak throughout our brand’s history. When we started Virgin Records, we wanted to beat the bigger labels to signing the most exciting bands, because we were more nimble, more attuned to what artists wanted, and more willing to take risks. When we launched Virgin Atlantic to take on British Airways, we wanted to create a flying experience people loved, rather than endured. We strived to fix everything about aviation people hated and introduce things that would make them smile, and we’ve carried this ethos on with every Virgin company we’ve launched since. Here’s my thoughts on why chasing  the competition isn't everything: https://virg.in/3Gbf

Richard Branson,Male,2024-04-27,"It makes me so happy to see our thriving conspiracy of lemurs (I love that collective noun!) on Necker. We’ve successfully raised some of the rarest breeds, including panda lemurs, red-ruffed lemur triplets and ring-tailed lemur twins. As well as lemurs, scarlet and white ibis and stout iguanas, one of the things I’m most proud of about Necker is the reintroduction of flamingos to the region. I love going down to the smaller flamingo pond where they breed. They may be courting, strutting up and down with their heads going back and forth, showing off, much like humans. The wildlife of Necker spurs me on to support the conservation of all species. My definition of a sin is for humans to allow a species to die out. Animals cannot speak for themselves – it is up to all of us to protect them and their habitats. This is why we’ve tried to make Necker a real Garden of Eden. Our house is surrounded by huge iguanas, which are very friendly, but sometimes terrify the guests. I have to make it clear they are vegetarian. I get into traffic jams with giant tortoises and have to abandon my golf buggy and wait for them to cross the road. I hope you enjoyed this little snippet from my new audiobook!

Richard Branson,Male,2024-02-27,"It’s time for a long-term leadership view on tackling existential threats. This is why I signed a powerful  letter from The Elders Foundation and the Future of Life Institute (FLI), calling on world leaders to work together to address these existential threats more decisively. The knowledge and resources to address these challenges exist, but many leaders lack the political will or capability to take decisive action. They seek short-term fixes over long-term solutions.  Long-view leadership means showing the determination to resolve intractable problems not just manage them, the wisdom to make decisions based on scientific evidence and reason, and the humility to listen to all those affected. Long-view leaders must have the moral strength to address both current concerns and long-term risks, often at the expense of vested interests. As leaders prepare to gather in New York in September for the UN Summit of the Future, it is time to change direction. Here’s how and why: https://lnkd.in/eCq4JysU#leadership #wisdom #leaders #threats

His advice became critical to our success, so when we launched Virgin StartUp to support entrepreneurs in the UK, I wanted mentorship to be a big part of the story.

Richard Branson,Male,2024-04-13,"Your uniqueness is your power. I stumbled upon this realisation early on in my career, when my dyslexic thinking led me to find new solutions to old problems that businesses were struggling to address. Over the years, I learnt to harness my dyslexic thinking, and embrace the curious ways my mind would work. I was also drawn to other people with eccentric characters and curious ways of thinking. And so, we hired people with bold ideas, and we gave them the freedom to execute them. We weren’t fussed on qualifications or credentials – we hired for the skills we needed, and we focused on attitude over accolades. As Adam Grant wrote in his fantastic book, Originals: how non-conformists changed the world: “I learned that great creators don’t necessarily have the deepest expertise but rather seek out the broadest perspectives.”I’ve gathered my thoughts on the matter on my blog.

Richard Branson,Male,2024-04-13,"What’s the biggest lesson I've learnt in the past 54 years since releasing our very first album on Virgin Records? - Say yes - Cherish your loved ones - Look after your health - Trust the people around you  - Only enter industries that are ripe for disruption - Be an eternal optimist - Write everything down  This last point helped me write my two memoirs, which I've now turned into an audiobook. I've shared the story of my life and all the lessons I've learnt along the way into this audiobook, which is out worldwide today, so I hope you find it insightful and inspiring. Pick it up from wherever you listen to audiobooks, all around the world: https://lnkd.in/ehTMgbd8
