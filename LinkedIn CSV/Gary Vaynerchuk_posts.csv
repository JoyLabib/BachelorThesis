Gary Vaynerchuk,Male,2024-04-27,"Two things every manager needs to do to keep their employees motivated:#1 Lead By ExampleLead with your actions. Actions will always speak louder than words. If you are motivated and bring energy, your employees will react to that. And I mean in every aspect of the day, not just when you‚Äôre running a meeting. How you interact with people. Emails you send. Your posture in a meeting.Everyone is always watching and they are looking to you for an example of how to behave. Don‚Äôt forget that everything stems from the top. The way you act and behave in the presence of your employees will dictate so much of how motivated they are.#2 Knowing what your employees wantFigure out what it is that your employees want most in life, and help them get it. Let them know that you are invested in it. Check in with them often on how it is doing.Everybody is driven by different things. We all have our own dreams, aspirations, and beliefs that motivate us. So you need to use your ears and listen. You need to sit down with your employees and understand where they want to take their careers. What‚Äôs their ambition? What do they want to do with their life? By sitting down with people and actually listening, you‚Äôll be able to set up your employees for success while also motivating them to work hard and fast.#leadership #business",629,81,61,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAACgAVMBb8w4dbaqCMriT5tTYE0H4M_oFKE%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAACgAVMBb8w4dbaqCMriT5tTYE0H4M_oFKE&keywords=gary%20vaynerchuk&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=e214fa94-7d13-4c23-ba32-8efb196ddcac&sid=xia&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Gary Vaynerchuk,Male,2024-02-27,"Everybody wants to talk about beating the competition.Here are 3 key pieces of advice for every CEO looking to stand out.1. Get comfortable with failureFailure is just data that you can use to make yourself and your business better.Some of the ventures I started over the course of my career were ""micro failures"" - like Cork'd, ObsessedTV, VaynerSampling, and others - meanwhile,¬†VaynerMedia¬†is destroying it.Micro losses mean nothing in the bigger picture.2. Understand the importance of humilityHumility gives you the advantage of speed.When you‚Äôre humble, you‚Äôre never ‚Äútoo good‚Äù to follow your curiosity and try new things or even change your mind when you realize you were wrong. It allows you to bounce back quicker from those micro-losses and get back to executing.3. Don‚Äôt dwell on the competition. Focus on the game.I decided early on to take a different route. Instead of worrying about what others were doing, I focused my attention on the consumer and day-trading attention which is exactly what helped me stand out.Don‚Äôt play for the trophies ‚Äì play because you love the game.What did you think about these 3 tips?

Gary Vaynerchuk,Male,2024-03-27,"In 2024 it has become more evident that the roles of both CFOs and CMOs have evolved beyond the financial facets and marketing aspects of the business, and both are incredibly interested in data analytics and have a greater desire to see the ‚Äúwhole picture‚Äù.Similarly, in today's corporate environment, there is an emerging need for greater collaboration between various business units within a company and the corporate roles within Finance, Marketing, Supply Chain, Sales, and inventory management.Tingley Lane Trading is a VaynerX company I launched a few years ago to cater to this new emerging world. Tingley Lane's trade solution fosters this relationship between the business units to develop positive business outcomes and enhanced bottom-line results.As one of the many examples, while the world was struggling with many business challenges during the pandemic, Tingley Lane‚Äôs client was able to completely offset the loss from their looming inventory write-down and enjoy cash savings through the activation of media campaigns delivered by Tingley Lane.VaynerX‚Äôs Tingley Lane was created to help build contemporary brands that lead to our client's growth‚Ä¶ We drive business outcomes for our partners and in the current business environment, this is a 360 process that transcends marketing and speaks to sound business collaboration of all of our partners‚Äô business units. Tingley Lane‚Äôs trade solution brings an abundance of disciplines together to the benefit of our partners and we are super pumped to bring Tingley Lane into the mainstream.
