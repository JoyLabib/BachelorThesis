Maynard Webb,Male,2024-04-20,"The best companies support employee career growth by continuing to do what they’re doing—being successful. Success begets success. If a company isn’t growing, opportunities are more limited for the people who work there. When I started as a director on the Salesforce board in 2006 there were 2,500 employees. Now, there are more than 70,000. This kind of growth has given a lot of people a lot of opportunity.But this isn’t just a numbers game. Great companies make sure that their employees feel valued. They give people new assignments that build their capabilities and expertise. The best companies are always investing in training, paying for classes and seminars, and offering “extra credit” assignments. They make employee growth a priority and they walk the talk. They promote from within when they can, and help people achieve their full potential.#LinkedInTopCompanies",20,2,0,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAI4Aw4BS3TllsKr6E15v4CDckxNKmfQpTY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAI4Aw4BS3TllsKr6E15v4CDckxNKmfQpTY&keywords=maynard%20webb&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=fdd4c72b-bd61-4019-a39f-42877ff2b81a&sid=KrU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Maynard Webb,Male,2023-04-27,"Congrats to all the recent graduates! Many will be starting new jobs in the coming weeks; others might still be searching. While the headlines point to a bleak job outlook, this is still an exciting time to enter the workforce. And when it comes to new advances like AI, your generation is the one who gets it the most. You are not bound by the old rules. At the same time, there are some timeless learnings that stay the same. Some career advice as you start this new chapter: Focus on being voted on the team every day. Make sure you do something every day to show others you deserve to be part of their team. It’s all about integrity. Do what you say. Say what you do. Always act in a way that makes people remember you positively. Have a great attitude. We all know cranky people. You might be brilliant, but if you are hard to manage it’s simple to find someone else. Be fun and easy to work with. Work for a higher purpose. You will find more meaning in what you do every day, and it will drive you through the inevitable tough days. Pick your battles. There are a million things to be upset about in any work situation. Only fight about things that are important. Don’t get distracted by noise. Only worry about what you’re doing. It’s hard to run up the stairs as fast as you can when you are looking to the side or at the hundred people behind you trying to catch up.  Don’t be afraid of change. As you advance, don’t look back and wish for things to be the way they used to be. You always want to be growing. Step up to challenges, always volunteering, “I can do that.” Have a higher opinion of yourself and live up to your view of yourself—not what others think of you. Don’t confuse action for traction. Focus on outcomes. Have a talk with your boss. Ask, “What does success look like in 30 days, in 90 days.” Also ask, “What does great look like?”  Focus on expanding your sphere of influence. Don’t get upset about things over which you have no control. If you, invest your energy instead into expanding your sphere of influence, you can make a dramatic impact over more zones. Take time to sit back and reflect on where you are and where you want to be. Make time for a ‘compass check’— it is so easy to fall into a routine and not take the time to see if you are heading where you want to go.  Be a breakout. Most things worth doing are hard. Successful people get to where they are in their careers because they make the hard easy. Be especially brave and bold right now in this crazy economic time. Out of the craziest times come the world’s best innovations. Have fun. I didn’t focus on that enough early in my career. Figure out what you aspire to do and go for it with gusto. P.S.

Maynard Webb,Male,2023-09-27,"What it takes to start a business in today’s economy is the same as any economy. We’re focusing a lot on #resilience, but it really comes down to #adaptability. External and internal factors are always in flux and therefore great companies are always changing. In the early days, leaders must be judicious about the use of cash, they have to test their way to product market fit. Once they turn on the jets, they have to hire feet on the street. There’s so much that changes as a startup grows from having a product in one country to one that’s sold globally, or as a company scales from three to 3,000 people. This is the natural cycle of building a business that demands constant evolution. Then there are external factors and black swan events—which are unpredictable and outside of anyone’s control—that demand further adaptability. All of this requires having a calm hand at the tiller. The best leaders have very good judgement and can pivot when necessary. Leading a company in any time demands a unique combination of arrogance required to build something out of nothing, and humility necessary to listen to customers and the market. Leading successfully comes down to having a strong value system where there’s great clarity on what you are trying to build and how you will get there.  What do you think are the most important skills for founders?#LinkedInTopStartupsPhoto by Håkon Grimstad on Unsplash",13,2,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAI4Aw4BS3TllsKr6E15v4CDckxNKmfQpTY%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAI4Aw4BS3TllsKr6E15v4CDckxNKmfQpTY&keywords=maynard%20webb&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=fdd4c72b-bd61-4019-a39f-42877ff2b81a&sid=KrU&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
