Dean Seddon,Male,2023-10-27,"ALWAYS look beyond the surface...In a world where appearances often take the spotlight, it's crucial to remember that just because something looks good from the outside doesn't necessarily mean it's good on the inside.We're constantly bombarded with beautifully curated images on social media and polished presentations in business, making it easy to be deceived by surface-level allure.This can apply to everything from products and services to personal relationships and career opportunities.The truth is, that the superficial can be misleading.We must learn to see beyond the fa√ßade and dig deeper to uncover the substance beneath.In Business, it's about evaluating the actual value a company or product offers, rather than being swayed solely by slick marketing.In our personal lives, it means valuing authenticity and character over image and popularity.The lesson is clear: Look past the aesthetics, explore the depths, and assess the true worth of what lies beneath the surface. This discernment will not only help you make wiser decisions but also build more meaningful and genuine connections.In a world that often prioritizes the glitzy veneer, remember that substance and integrity are what truly matter in the end.#leadership #management #marketing",785,81,96,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAcEjSkBZ0YdUbxNrqzBhjBkPFSLNDGfTD8%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAcEjSkBZ0YdUbxNrqzBhjBkPFSLNDGfTD8&keywords=dean%20seddon&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=a83a2fa7-2549-4092-a90e-68f85c4fb648&sid=D1R&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
Dean Seddon,Male,2024-03-27,"Is it a job or a mission?People with a purpose are easy to spot - their energy is infectious.Their work isn't a job, it's a mission.They believe in it, they're passionate about it, they go the extra mile.Working just for the pay check is no way to live.Becoming great at something and wanting to make a difference with your skills is how we find purpose and meaning to life.So, how can you use your skillset and turn your work into a mission? ‚û°Ô∏è Passionate Pursuit: Find what truly ignites your passion and aligns with your values. Discover the area where your skills and interests converge, and where you feel most alive. ‚û°Ô∏è Lifelong Learning: Embrace a growth mindset and commit to continuous learning.

When you have a mission, work no longer feels like a mundane routine it fuels your ambition and gives your life meaning.People living with a purpose are great people to be around.They are a source of inspiration - a catalyst for personal and professional growth, and a platform for making a positive impact on the world.

E.g. Quoting the ¬£10k package first, to disarm people to your ¬£3k package.‚û°Ô∏è #Framing - Structuring your conversations with customers, so they see the gains of your offer. E.g.

Dean Seddon,Male,2024-04-13,"I've set goals and failed to achieve them.I've written down goals and never hit them (here is why).- I didn't integrate my goals into my daily activities.- I didn't make my goals smart ( it was a wish list).If you write goals more like a wish list, here is what happens...- Unimportant tasks will take priority.- You won't have daily actions to move you closer to your goals.- Your action taking will be inconsistent / make it up as you go along.But there is something worse...You'll lose confidence in achieving your goals. It will create doubt. You'll have a sneaking suspicion your goals are impossible.It becomes a vicious circle.You don't take the goals seriously, so you fail to hit them. You doubt the goal is possible, so you don't want to put effort into them.It's vicious circle that confirms you can't achieve your goals.BUT if you do want to hit your goals, you need to make them smart.You need SMART goals - goals that are clear and actionable. SPECIFIC - MEASURABLE - ACTIONABLE - RELEVANT - TIME-BASEDWrite down your SMART goals.Then diarise the actions you need to take.Example:Specific: Get more leads per week from social media.Measurable: 4 Leads per week.Actionable: Posting 3 times per week, grow my network, offering a lead magnet to new connections.Relevant: More connections will increase my reach, leads will help me win clients.Time-bound: By 7th May 2024, I'll be getting 4 leads per week.

Dean Seddon,Male,2024-01-27,"I had a very weird encounter with a bunch of rich people in London.It changed my view on money ‚¨áÔ∏èI went to pitch my services to a prospect, it turned into a long lunch with some City execs.It started at 12pm and ended at 8pm and I was ¬£20k better off.During the 'meeting' I was telling my prospect how I could help but the conversation would drift all over the place.It was difficult as it turned from a meeting into social.I felt like I was wasting my time.I finally got my proposal out and told him it was ¬£5k for 3 months.I'd never met any of these people before and I had no idea why 4 other people showed up.I was ready to call it quits and write the day off, then something even weirder happened....Then this fiery discussion got started about why they should all sign up.I was pitching one person. But now 4 of them were debating buying.One of them said ""Should I really spend ¬£5k on social media?""Then one of the others ripped into him ""you spend more than ¬£5k on f-king lunch""4 people signed for my ¬£5k social media package.‚û°Ô∏è They paid upfront and were an absolute dream to work with.‚û°Ô∏è They appreciated that things take time.‚û°Ô∏è Didn't make demands or want to chop and change strategies.‚û°Ô∏è Respected my time and efforts.It was one of the weirdest encounters that have ever happened to me.Were they all drunk?

Dean Seddon,Male,2023-11-27,"My stupidity nearly cost me ¬£240k and my biggest shift in my careerFearful of looking stupid and carrying a victim mentality, I nearly missed the biggest opportunity of my life.I'd got a little down in the dumps after getting a wave of people wanting freebies or pay on results.I was posting online and networking but it felt pointless.What I didn't know, was that I was about be asked to name my price.So, I got a coffee invite from a follower on Twitter (turned out to be Terry Heath).I nearly cried off.  Another coffee. Another hour of my life wasted achieving nothing. That was my first thought. Within 8 days, that coffee would change my life.I did go for the coffee. It was nice to meet Terry, but it seemed like all the other coffees. Good conversation, but not much more.Then 3 days later, when I was asked to meet with the CEO.The CEO then asked me to go to their HQ and present my ideas, 1,500 miles away. They'd cover accommodation, but I had pay for the flights.I was just above broke. I could barely afford the flights. I thought it would be a bit of fun and a jolly, so I went.I hadn't even considered how much to charge. I thought it would come to nothing.I presented my ideas.I was asked ""How much and when can you start?""Even at this point, I thought it would go nowhere. I quickly worked out a price in my head.The whole deal was signed, sealed and paid within 30 days of the coffee.I'll never take an opportunity for granted ever again.It is hard to see the big opportunities coming.#business #leadership #marketing",246,55,7,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAcEjSkBZ0YdUbxNrqzBhjBkPFSLNDGfTD8%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAcEjSkBZ0YdUbxNrqzBhjBkPFSLNDGfTD8&keywords=dean%20seddon&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=a83a2fa7-2549-4092-a90e-68f85c4fb648&sid=D1R&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Dean Seddon,Male,2024-04-06,"How to build a FREEDOM business (so you don't become an employee in your own business)I've met lots of business owners who have created their own job.They quit working for someone else for freedom, but now find themselves a servant to their own enterprise.Their dream was holidays, flexible working and clients who are a joy to work with.They now look at people who are employed with envy that they can switch off at the weekend.How does this happen? How do you build a business that gives you freedom?Freedom comes by making deliberate choicesTo get freedom, you need to turn your choices into a plan.If you don't, you become victim to circumstance. ‚Üí If money is tight, you'll onboard clients that will suck your time.‚Üí If work is short, you'll trade freedom for financial stability.If you do that for long enough, you end up forgetting your goals and losing who you are.No plan = No freedom.So, let me ask you....‚û°Ô∏è Do you have a written-down financial goal for the year?‚û°Ô∏è Have you broken that down into the number of clients you need?‚û°Ô∏è Do you have a written plan to secure those clients?‚û°Ô∏è Do you know the daily actions you need to take to achieve it?Most of the people who started for freedom, that now feel trapped, don't have these documented and those that do, don't follow it.They get distracted or fall into a vicious circle of feast and famine.""Eventually, once x and y and z, I'll get there""If you just keep busy hoping it will come, you won't create freedom, you'll create a full-time job.When it comes to social selling...‚û°Ô∏è Do you know what you are selling on the platform?‚û°Ô∏è Do you know who your target audience are?‚û°Ô∏è Do you have a system to convert connections into clients?‚û°Ô∏è Do you follow it religiously?If you want freedom, you need to create it by making a clear choice FOR it.Freedom means making a choice.---------‚úçÔ∏è Thoughts?

Dean Seddon,Male,2024-04-06,"The 3 biggest mistakes people make building their personal brand:1. They think they need a big audience.2. They think it's all about selfies and self-promotion.3. They think it's about proving you know your stuff.The reality is some of the top experts, real subject matter experts, believe these 3 things and others leave them in the dust.Here are 10 tips to build a PROFITABLE personal brand:1 - Have a very defined goal from your brand (sell coaching, consultancy speaking etc).2 - Decide what you want to be known for (Outcome + Industry + Topic)3 - Grow your network with the people who resonate with your message. you can add 100 per week with a subscription.4 - Align your profile and content so that you are hyper focused. Your profile should make it clear who you are talking to and about what.5 - Share you unique opinions, different views and spark up discussion and debate. If everyone agrees with you, you are too middle-of-the-road.6 - Build a system to convert connections into curious leads. Grow a list, create demand and offer calls to interested people.7 - 20% of your content should be promotional and showing your success and offer.8 - 40% of your content should be about you and your experiences, personal stories, beliefs and values.9 - 40% of your content should be educational and helpful content, but still contain your opinions beliefs and worldview.10 - Start now and iterate with the audience, learn and grow, doing more of what works.A personal brand, coupled with a strong system will allow you to win more clients and do it without pitching people like crazy.‚úÖ REALITY CHECK:If you build a strong personal brand in an industry or vertical, it does not matter if you are known outside your vertical.If you appeal to the mind and not the heart, you'll struggle to build a strong connection with your audience. It's about connection to you first.You don't need to prove yourself to anyone. Your job is to share your ideas, your personal mission and others will join you, because they buy in to who you are.---------‚úçÔ∏è Thoughts?

Dean Seddon,Male,2024-03-27,"If you read this, it will make you money.(and stop you going broke BECAUSE of social media).Too much emphasis is placed on content.For the majority, content just won't deliver what you need.CONSISTENT LEADSWhy is that?Content marketing is an attraction model. Outside of influencers, no business on planet earth operates a 100% attraction model.‚ùå You're placing all your success on 3rd party distribution.‚ùå It's slow, needs 21+ touchpoints to get a lead.‚ùå You have to wait for people to contact you.Social Selling is more than content....There are 4Cs to social selling, not one:‚û°Ô∏è Connect - Growing your network with your ideal clients.‚û°Ô∏è Content - Sharing stories, tips and info to help those ideal clients.‚û°Ô∏è Curiosity - Creating assets that help you identify interest.‚û°Ô∏è Conversation - Follow up and having a conversation.That's a process anyone can do.You can't just keep churning out content, hoping leads will come.I've met solopreneurs who are burnt out, broke and have spent all their time on content. They've done nothing to get conversations with people in their network.(I don't mean pitching either)Let's say you're doing well right now with your content. What happens when the algo changes or you have a rough patch?Your business goes to zero.You need a process.Content is part of it, but it isn't the whole process.If leads are critical to your business, you need a process more predictable than banking all your success on your content.üëÇNOW LISTEN Stop playing the content merry-go-round.You only need a handful of clients.‚û°Ô∏è CONNECT ‚Üí CONTENT ‚Üí CURIOSITY ‚Üí CONVERSATIONThis process works whether you have 1,000 or 10,000 connections.--------Why am I sharing this?Because so many solopreneurs are trying to replicate influencers.They get trapped into thinking more engagement and followers = success.They burn themselves out trying to do it, run out of money, and end up getting a job before they go broke.Meanwhile, they are missing opportunities to make money.-------‚ùìGot questions?

I had to build my top and middle of funnel from scratch.‚û°Ô∏è Credibility - Nobody knew me or my track record. I had to work out what my personal brand was and be more proactive in collecting reviews.‚û°Ô∏è Messaging - I had to simplify my message to get value and point across more concisely. I didn't have the luxury of a 20-min call on the back of an intro.‚û°Ô∏è Process - I had to build a process with daily actions to achieve consistent success. I needed a plan that could fit around everything else and bring in leads.The temptation was to fire out pitches and try a more volume based approach.he problem is it can shred your reputation‚Ä¶and make you look desperate.But by focusing on becoming valuable to 100 connections, I can yield more than sending 1000 pitches.The long term high-value clients don't come in that way.Once of my clients made ¬£12k in 7 weeks just using social selling and LinkedIn.When I started, I spent ages tweaking my offer, shifting who my audience was, I probably spent two years wasting time.I went round in circles too many times.It doesn't have to take years. But have to do the right things and avoid overthinking it.I cracked it and started building my business. I went from solopreneur to a team of 30+ people.And for 10 years, I've been teaching others to do the same.In a 45-minute daily routine you can consistently create new opportunities by selling without the sales pitch.If you‚Äôre ready to augment your referrals, DM me WIN and I‚Äôll show how to get clients on LinkedIn.#coaching #socialselling #leadership",83,35,2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAcEjSkBZ0YdUbxNrqzBhjBkPFSLNDGfTD8%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAcEjSkBZ0YdUbxNrqzBhjBkPFSLNDGfTD8&keywords=dean%20seddon&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=a83a2fa7-2549-4092-a90e-68f85c4fb648&sid=D1R&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Dean Seddon,Male,2024-01-27,"How prospects use social media is different from us.This changed totally changed my approach ‚¨áÔ∏èSocial media is like NetflixMost login with no agenda, just looking to pass the time.They scroll looking for something, but not specific.Something catches our eye and we dip into it.On Netflix we choose what to watch based on: üé¨ Other peoples recommendations / reviewsüé¨ What genre you're interested inüé¨ What you've watched beforeüé¨ What the cover looks likeüé¨ What mood you're inüé¨ What we see firstOn social media, prospects are scrolling to pass the time.They aren't in the headspace of buy right there and then.They're discovering stuff and responding as it comes at them.This means right now, prospects are on a journey of discovering you.‚úÖ Here is the point - If you watched an actor's film before and enjoyed it, you'll give a film more consideration.If it's totally unknown, if it hasn't flipped our switch in the first few minutes we switch off.I started a series the other night. Less than 5-minutes in, I checked out. It just wasn't for me. Then I got into Fool Me Once by Harlan Coben, loved it and checked out all the other Harlan Coben series.This how people respond to us online.The principle is simple - we extend more grace to things we've had a positive encounter with before.Most don't get that.They overthink it or forget we are marketing to humans, not analytical robots.They think prospects should read their messages and reply.They believe promoting their offer should logically lead to sales.More positive encounters your prospects have with you, the more consideration they'll give you.They'll be more open to giving you their time and attention.Yes - we have to make an offer to them.Yes - we have to promote what we do.But how and when we do it matters.",77,28,1,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?fromMember=%5B%22ACoAAAcEjSkBZ0YdUbxNrqzBhjBkPFSLNDGfTD8%22%5D&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAcEjSkBZ0YdUbxNrqzBhjBkPFSLNDGfTD8&keywords=dean%20seddon&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&position=0&searchId=a83a2fa7-2549-4092-a90e-68f85c4fb648&sid=D1R&sortBy=%22date_posted%22

Dean Seddon,Male,2024-01-27,"""I'm posting, get loads of impressions but NO LEADS????""Here was my answer ‚¨áÔ∏èI was speaking at an event last week and someone asked my why they were getting loads of traction but no leads.He'd had more than 1m impressions but no clients.Content is just not predictable.Yet, it feels like it should be.The problem is....‚û°Ô∏è Broad Appeal - The posts which get you the visibility often have a broad message and don't directly speak to your ideal clients.‚û°Ô∏è Unpredictability - It is impossible to predict who will see your content, this makes it difficult to build a education funnel just through the feed.‚û°Ô∏è Depth - It's difficult to go deep with your network through content, the format lends itself to short soundbite content.‚û°Ô∏è Competition - you are in a rat race to sustain your visibility this means awareness content often consumes the posting schedule.‚û°Ô∏è Inefficient - You need to move people down your funnel, it's easier to do that through other means.‚û°Ô∏è Wrong people - Getting the best engagement often means talking to your industry rather than your customers.Where content is great is....‚úÖ Trust and relationships - at a shallow level but at scale.‚úÖ Personal brand - being known for the right reasons.‚úÖ Top of funnel - helping move people into your funnel.‚úÖ Micro value - adding value in small doses.Moving your audience through a funnel is critical.Taking people into an email list, buyer education process or starting conversations is how the money is made.Do you have a written plan to create conversations with your connections?Are you growing an email list?Do you have a buyer education process not reliant on feed content?Don't wing it.Content is a VERY long game and it's not for everyone.
