What were some of the biggest trends that came up at Slush this year?  Antler’s Livia Moore shared her thoughts with Tech Funding News  Some highlights: ➕ It’s the Year of AI. Founders are keen to prove their AI credentials and show investors that machine learning is at the heart of their products. ➕ Navigating the downturn. Discussions reflected a sentiment that times are tough. But while the downturn is set to continue into 2024, there is a cautious sense of optimism. ➕ Climate tech and gaming were big themes that came up on both days. ➕ Diversity & inclusion in Europe's startup ecosystem. An important topic. There is a growing sense there needs to be more action in the industry. Read Livia’s articles in the comments below.
