0,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Linda Rottenberg,26/5/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-linda-rottenberg/,"
As the co-founder and the CEO of the Endeavor company, Linda Rottenberg has served as an inspiration to many. She has made it her life’s mission to provide budding entrepreneurs with the help that they need to turn their bright ideas into decisive action. Even if the person does not have a great deal of experience or a concept that seems outrageous, Rottenberg still takes the time to provide aid.
No idea is too crazy or out there for Rottenberg and her work serves as an inspiration to anyone who has been told that they cannot achieve their goals. After taking a dive into her book, Crazy Is A Compliment, these are the top five lessons I believe that every entrepreneur can learn from the works of Linda Rottenberg.
1. Being Called Crazy Is Not An Insult
Whenever a would be entrepreneur comes up with a brand new idea, they are usually called crazy by people who cannot take the time to think outside of the box and see their vision. Rottenberg believes that anyone who is going to try something new and seemingly insane will experience blow back from a variety of sources. She is quick to tell her acolytes about the problems Henry Ford experienced on his way to the top and how Sam Walton’s Wal-Mart idea was considered crazy at the time.
It is important for an entrepreneur to realize that there are no physical barriers standing between them and success, their obstacles are purely psychological. One of the most enduring mottos that she shares in her work is that “crazy is a compliment.”
2. Risks Are Not Always Risks
While most people see entrepreneurs as being wacky and adventurous types, Rottenberg is quick to tell her audiences that this perception does not always match up with reality. She is quick to speak about the importance of taking risks that may seem crazy to the outside observers, but are actually calculated in nature. A common piece of advice that she gives is to keep your day job while you are trying to get your business off of the ground. 
Rottenberg speaks about how crucial it is not to bet the entire farm on one idea. Craziness and the ability to stomach risk taking are great qualities to have, but only when they are properly utilized. Even some of the biggest names in the world of entrepreneurs hedged their bets. Phil Knight worked as a tax preparation expert before Nike took off and even Richard Branson (who is seen as being wacky and nuts) talks about containing the potential for disaster. Rottenberg makes sure that these parts of the story are not left out.
3. Want To Be An Entrepreneur? No Hooded Sweatshirt Required!
Rottenberg takes great pains to dissociate people from the common mental image of the disheveled, rumpled entrepreneur who drapes themselves in old hooded sweatshirts, telling stories of women who launched successful enterprises in the comfort of their own kitchens at home. Despite what you may think, you do not need to be a young male clad in a sweatshirt in order to meet the stereotype of what an entrepreneur should look like. 
Young males are no longer the predominant group of budding entrepreneurs. Statistics now show that an entrepreneur is just as likely to be an older male (over the age of 55) or a female. With more and more Americans being forced to work for themselves during this turbulent economic times, it is crucial to get with the current program or end up being left behind.
4. Don’t Be Afraid To Fire Family
Many startups employ family members, not because they are the most qualified for the position, but because they have the time on their hands and are able to work for little to no money. That is why a startup prenuptial agreement is necessary. As your company grows, you may need to replace some of these beloved family members with people who have more experience in the particular areas of expertise that you require. 
When you start your business, Rottenberg preaches the importance of coming up with a formal partnership agreement and having it in writing. The vision that you and your family members start off sharing for the company can change and in many instances, a family member may even want out, but be too timid to speak up. Avoid these circumstances by spelling out exactly what you expect from your employees and/or partners during the early stages.
5. Going Big and Going Home Are Not Mutually Exclusive
Rottenberg often talks about her past as an extreme workaholic and attempts to teach her audiences about the importance of work/life balance. When you are a workaholic, not only is it difficult for you to maintain a normal lifestyle, but it can also be difficult to retain talented employees. Make sure that you get a life and encourage anyone who works alongside of you to do the same. After all, what good is success if you don’t take a moment to enjoy it?
The idea that you have to ignore your family or put the people you love on the back burner is a foreign concept to Rottenberg and she often speaks about the surprise in people’s voices when she mentions her daughter’s dance recitals or other family events. In order to be successful, your personal life does not have to fall by the wayside, a lesson that Rottenberg goes out of her way to preach.

1,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Carol Sanford,21/5/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-carol-sanford/,"
Carol Sanford has risen to prominence as a consultant in the world of business development and is also well known for speaking to potential business owners in a number of different settings. She has authored a book, The Responsible Entrepreneur, where she discusses the importance of responsibility and accountability in the entrepreneurial field and her insights continue to be shared in the business community time after time.
“Entrepreneurism isn’t born within a rare few; it’s a fire waiting to be lit inside us.” – Carol Sanford (highlight to share)
There are a number of lessons that every entrepreneur can learn from Carol Sanford and the following list focuses on the five that I find to be the most crucial for you to learn more about how you can emulate Sanford’s tactics.
1. Accountability Exists Within the DNA of a Responsible Entrepreneur
An entrepreneur does not fail or succeed based exclusively on his or her own merits, a lesson that Sanford teaches in all of her works. Success is achieved within a team context, while failures are typically achieved alone. The entrepreneur who tries to do it all by themselves or ignore the needs of those underneath is setting themselves up for continued disappointment. 
One of the most common pitfalls that a budding entrepreneur falls victim to is the perception that they need to take on each of the most important tasks by themselves and minimize the amount of help they need from partners and staff members. However, a truly successful entrepreneur knows how to hold themselves accountable and delegate duties to those who are more talented than themselves. No one ever rises to the top alone, but there are certainly more than a few would-be entrepreneurs who have sunk to the bottom all by themselves. 
2. Self-Awareness Is Key
Carol Sanford speaks about the importance of self-awareness and talks about what it takes for a person to leave their mark on the world. She communicates her thoughts and ideas about the traits needed for a person to reach their full potential. One of the ideas that she regularly touches on is that a successful person does not take any event that takes place in their life too personally. In order to achieve success, an entrepreneur must be able to look at the bigger picture.
Instead of allowing the outcome of certain situation to affect how they feel about themselves, Sanford talks about recognizing the impact of their actions and remaining focused on the task at hand. No one rises to the top without experiencing a few setbacks along the way and none of these issues should ever be taken personally. Your higher aim is what matters most. 
3. Learning As You Go Is Essential
When Sanford speaks to her audiences, whether in person or through her writings, she consistently focuses on the responsibilities that come with along with responsible entrepreneurial work. No one starts off their entrepreneurial journey knowing it all or being able to predict the future. Problems lie ahead and while there is no way to control them, you can control the manner in which you react to them.
Rather than being waylaid by every single challenge that comes along, Sanford shows her acolytes how to use them as learning experiences, as a method for enriching themselves intellectually. Thanks to her years of experience, she knows about how rewarding it can be to face a challenge head on and learn from it. There is going to be resistance along the way as you climb the ladder to your ultimate goal, so embrace these challenges and use them as a tool for self-improvement.
4. Don’t Ignore Your Calling
We often have moments in life where we feel a certain magnetic pull that encourages us to shoot for a certain goal or to pursue a particular endeavor. Carol Sanford encourages her audiences to stop ignoring those feelings and start pursuing the goals that will truly make them happy. When you pursue the goals that are most important to you, your capabilities will be stretched to the limit, which is the best way for a person to shake off their current comfort zone and grow into a successful entrepreneur.
Your capacity to grow is as limitless as your imagination. If you are someone who is constantly doubting themselves and refusing to see the bigger picture, then you are going to struggle to pursue your true calling. We all have that magnetic tug inside of us, that little voice in our heads that encourages us to stop working at jobs that we hate and to go after our dreams. Sanford ensures that her audiences do not continue to ignore that voice.
5. Reflect and Consider Your Goals
Another area of emphasis for Sanford is the importance of self-reflection. She urges her audiences and readers to take a moment to really reflect on what is important to them. What is your goal and even more importantly, what are you going to do in order to reach it? Goals are great, but without a definitive plan, a goal is merely a dream. 
Until you can look deep within and decide on what your true goal entails and what you are willing to do in order to achieve it, you will remain in your current state. An entrepreneur is someone who is not afraid to challenge themselves and a person who thrives when they are pushed out of their preferred comfort zone. Thanks to Carol Sanford’s lessons, what once seemed like a dream can become a reality, when you are ready, willing and able to put in the work necessary.

2,3 Super Solid Ways to Create New Business Ideas,19/5/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/3-super-solid-ways-to-create-new-business-ideas/,"
The hardest part about beginning a startup company is coming up with an idea that not only fills an important void, but that no one else has already come up with. It is exceedingly likely that the first idea you come up with will not be a success. As such, it is imperative to not let yourself become discouraged by initial disappointments and to keep on pushing.
These popular techniques will go a long way towards helping you create new business ideas:
1. Try Your Best To Predict The Future
The entrepreneur who successfully creates a new business and can withstand the test of time is the one who is able to peer into their crystal ball and predict the trends of the future. While this process does require just a smidgen of good luck, a great entrepreneur knows that luck is merely the residue of skill and hard work. Luck does not come to those who park themselves on the couch and wait for it to come along, it happens to those who get up, get out there and work for it.
A top notch idea for a business is one that is ahead of the curve and anticipates changes in the landscape. The person who is monitoring current trends instead of future trends is going to come up with ideas that are instantly outdated. A decent entrepreneur looks at what is going on now and thinks of a way to fit in with the current landscape.
On the other hand, a great entrepreneur thinks about the future and wonders how they can create the next big thing, rather than an inferior knockoff version of the current big thing. Monitoring the current trends in the business world can provide some help when it comes to developing new ideas, but you have to consider the amount of time it takes to start a new business.
An idea that seems fresh in the moment is often past its sell by date when you are finally able to get down to brass tacks and start the process of opening a business. Consider the future and what place your product will hold in that future. 
2. Consider The Things That Annoy You
I am willing to bet that there are many things in your everyday life that drive you crazy. One of my personal favorite ways to create new business ideas is by taking the time to consider the things about life that annoy you the most. If you hone in on the things that “piss you off,” you will be able to brainstorm real solutions to everyday problems. If you are are the type of person that feels like you have to “do things on your own,” this task brainstorming technique will come naturally to you. As I’ve come to learn from many authors on innovation, the best entrepreneurs are those who find out about what we lack most and discover a new way to provide the public with the needed item.
Invention is not a must in these scenarios, but it can help you to develop new ideas. Brainstorming about products that every human being would want, but have yet to be created is a great way to amplify the creative process and ensure that you remain ahead of the curve at all times. 
Speak to people you know, as well. There are many instances where the things that annoy you and frustrate you will also annoy and frustrate them. Canvasing close friends and family can also provide you with important information about frustrations that they are having that you had failed to consider.
Consult with members of the opposite sex and ask them about their daily frustrations. A company that is able to consider a variety of concerns from various walks of life is one that will prosper in the long term. Having a narrow focus leads to a lack of creativity and should be avoided. 
Most people prefer to avoid frustrating moments at all costs, but those who can train their mind to look deeper can find valuable business ideas that no one else has considered. 
3. Consider Improvements To Existing Products
Just because you cannot create new business idea does not mean that you should give up on your entrepreneurial dreams. Some of the best and brightest entrepreneurs are those who analyzed the current marketplace, discovered inefficiencies that could easily be corrected and decided to do something about it.
This strategy is helpful for entrepreneurs who are struggling to come up with ideas of their own. Perhaps you are someone who enjoys a certain product, but finds it to be overpriced. This is your opportunity to research the product you enjoy and see if any changes can be made during any part of the process that can have a positive effect on the pricing structure. 
Or, maybe you can take a closer look at what the major players in your desired niche are doing wrong. A company does not have to be the same size as the big boys to successfully compete with them. The playing field has never been more level and a person can learn a lot from what the major business in their field are doing wrong.
There are typically enough gaps in the industry that you seek to join that can be easily exploited. Perhaps there is a service that a major company should be offering that they have not thought of. By using this as your starting point, you can start a business that already has built in clientele. 
Some larger businesses are no longer in the business of innovation, they are more focused on maintaining their current piece of the pie. If so, this also provides an opportunity to come up with an idea that takes a product that is already available to the next level.

3,7 Essential Steps to Becoming A Public Figure,13/5/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-essential-steps-to-becoming-a-public-figure/,"
Any entrepreneur worth their salt has dreamed of becoming a public figure. Even considering they are slow to the stage, the majority of entrepreneurs do not wish to toil behind the curtains forever. Since the turn of the century, we have been graced with the presence of a variety of entrepreneurs and visionaries that have been able to deliver lasting changes in a wide range of different fields. 
From the many well-known authors we have had on The Entrepreneurs Library, I have come to learn that any entrepreneur who is thinking about becoming a public figure will excel quickly by learning from other leaders that have found tremendous amounts of success. Here’s a closer look at the essential steps that many leaders today when they first started becoming a public figure.
1. Don’t Forget Where You Came From
Andrew Carnegie is one of the first entrepreneurs that we are taught about. He was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth and grew up in a lower class household. His poverty stricken family left his native Scotland to come to America and raise their quality of life. Carnegie used his impoverished childhood as motivation.
Once Carnegie became wealthy, he was not content to sit on top of his stack of money. He reached out to those who were less fortunate, donating tens of thousands of dollars to fund hospitals and libraries. He was also one of the first entrepreneurs who wrote a book about his success, imparting his secrets to others who were in the same position he used to be in. 
2. Share Unpleasant Experiences
Unless you have been living under a rock for the past 20 years, you have heard the name Oprah Winfrey. Oprah is a testament to what you can achieve if you have the willingness to overcome the bad things that have happened in your past and continue to work towards your goals.
Oprah has become an influential public figure because of her eloquence and her ability to speak passionately about the experiences that shaped her. Because of this, people do not see her as a billionaire who is above them, she is seen as a peer, which makes more people want to purchase her products.
3. Be Yourself
No matter who you are or where you are from, you have heard of Steve Jobs. While Jobs may be a polarizing person to many, there is no question that he is an influential public figure. Even in death, his quotes and philosophies are still discussed. The main lesson to be learned from Jobs is to always be yourself.
Jobs has been criticized for his sometimes abrasive approach, but he was able to command respect and become an important public figure because of his honesty and unwavering commitment to his own personal principles. 
4. Tell Your Life’s Story
The Social Network was more than just a movie about the creation of Facebook, it also displayed Mark Zuckerberg‘s best and worst tendencies. While some entrepreneurs would be reticent to allow themselves to be portrayed in an unfavorable light, Zuckerberg gave Hollywood the permission to tell his story, warts and all.
Every entrepreneur is not going to receive the opportunity to tell their story on the big screen. By telling your whole story, you allow your audience to relate to you on a whole new level. It has the effect of humanizing you and showing people that you are far from invincible. 
5. Provide Useful Information
The Huffington Post has become one of the Internet’s most trafficked websites, making a star out of the site’s creator, Ariana Huffington, in the process. Because she provides an important publication service and educates her readers about current business, political and entertainment issues, Ariana Huffington has developed a much higher profile in recent years.
When an entrepreneur provides people with more than a simple product or service, it increases their appetite for knowledge about the person, which eases their transition into a public figure. She has gone from unheralded blogger to the pages of Time magazine, without having to pander to the lowest common denominator. 
6. Variety Is The Spice Of Life
Martha Stewart is a name known throughout the world and even a prison stint could not deter her businesses. She has been able to endure as a public figure because she has successfully diversified her portfolio. While some may know Stewart from her television persona, others may know her because they purchase her linens or her magazines. Martha even makes appearances on shows like The Apprentice and Comedy Central’s Justin Bieber roast.
Martha’s media presence is varied, which gives her the unique ability to speak to a plethora of different audiences and ensures that her shelf life as a public figure is not artificially shortened. Some entrepreneurs are content to live a low profile life, working in the same field, but to become a public figure, you must be able to reach different segments of the population. 
7. Have An Engaging Social Media Presence
Some may know Mark Cuban as the man who was smart enough to cash out before the tech bubble burst, while others may know him as the outspoken owner of the MBA’s Dallas Mavericks franchise. Mark Cuban is able to remain in the spotlight because of his transparency and ability to tell it like it is. 
For instance, Mark was one of the first major entrepreneurs to harness the awesome power of Twitter. His official, verified account now boasts nearly 3 million followers, many of whom do not even follow basketball. He gives his followers valuable insights into the business world and as a result, he has become a beloved public figure.

4,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Bo Burlingham,11/5/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-every-entrepreneur-can-learn-from-bo-burlingham/,"
Who is Bo Burlingham and what you can learn from him:
Bo Burlingham is a shining example of what can happen when a person does not take no for an answer and simply finds a new way to do their own thing. After years working for Inc during the early 1980s as an executive editor, he resigned that position down to an editor-at-large in order to pursue his own interests.
From there, he wrote many successful books about life in the modern business world, giving out helpful tips to all of his readers about how employees can own their own companies. There is a great deal that an entrepreneur can learn from Bo Burlingham, so let’s focus on the five most crucial lessons.
1. Don’t Get Complacent
It would have been easy for Bo to get comfortable and settle down at Inc. After rising to the position of Senior Editor, Burlingham could have allowed himself to become satisfied. Most people would have been fine with remaining in that position and thinking of ways to advance the company that gave them the job. 
It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to make it to any sort of senior editing position at a major publication. Most would not have wanted to see all of that effort potentially go to waste while they take the time to chase after a dream.
However, Bo Burlingham is not most people. Instead of settling in, getting comfortable and allowing himself to fall into complacency, Burlingham decided to strike out on his own path, leaving Inc to publish his own books. Had he not had the courage to do this, he never would have had the time to write The Great Game Of Business, a book that has sold hundreds of thousands of copies. 
2. The Importance Of Specialization
Burlingham wrote a book entitled Small Giants. In this book, he does a deep dive into what makes small businesses successful. One of the main reasons he discovered? Smaller companies are more able to train their focus on being the absolute best at what they do. Whereas larger companies may find that it is more important to be everything to everyone, a smaller company spends their resources on performing one particular task.
By specializing, smaller companies are able to stand shoulder to shoulder with their larger counterparts and experience many of the same benefits. People are not looking to make purchases from the largest company possible. The consumer is all about finding the best quality at the most affordable price. The company that provides a top notch service and does not allow themselves to be hemmed in by traditional success definition is the one that will prosper over the long haul. 
3. Smaller Companies Can Compete With Larger Companies
Small Giants delved into a variety of smaller companies, with the objective of showing readers how all of these companies were able to become so successful, so quickly. Whether it is a record company, a deli or a microbrewery, there are a variety of principles that define prosperous small businesses. 
Even a tiny company can go about the same tasks as a corporate giant and experience continued success. While these tasks take place on a smaller scale, a company still must raise the necessary capital, invest the funds wisely and choose the right times to expand their operations or make pivotal acquisitions. 
One of the most pivotal that an entrepreneur can take from the works of Bo Burlingham is that it does not matter how big or small a company is. The route to success is the same as it would be for a large company. Small business owners are encouraged to take the lessons that have worked for big companies and apply them to their own situation.
4. Employees Can Control Their Own Destiny
A common mistake made by entrepreneurs is that they do not trust their employees to get the job done. In Burlingham’s book, The Great Game of Business, he outlines the benefits of an open book management style. He did not come up with these strategies in a Fortune 500 boardroom or at a high end business meeting.
Instead, Burlingham investigated the plight of a company known as International Harvester. When all of the employees of this heartland factory stood to lose their jobs forever, they banded together and came up with a solution: the open book management style.
When employees feel like they are truly an integral part of the equation, their performance becomes much better. Burlingham has preached the importance of allowing your employees to know about how the company is functioning as a whole. This keeps them from being taken by surprise when certain events occur. 
5. There Is No Magic Formula
When Burlingham came together with Norm Brodsky to write Street Smarts, he did so with one goal in mind: showing people that there is no magic list of bullet points that an entrepreneur can hit that will guarantee their long term success. He preaches the importance of your overall mentality when trying to start a new business and displays the importance of street smarts.
Being book smart is not enough. An entrepreneur needs to know how to read people and judge a situation that may not come with a helpful handbook. Burlingham also teaches his readers that there will be mistakes made along the way and that these mistakes do not have to come to define you. It is how you rebound from these errors that determines your level of success.

5,Latest Books for Entrepreneurs in May 2015,6/5/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/latest-books-for-entrepreneurs-in-may-2015/,"
A Quick Look at 5 of the Latest Books for Entrepreneurs
The Entrepreneurs Library presents some of the latest books for entrepreneurs in May 2015. These books are brand new to the market and the authors are in line to give a thorough deep dive of their books. Stay tuned this month for the release of the interviews with these great books and their authors. Below is an overview of what Amazon has to say about these books:
1) Unselling by Scott Stratten & Allison Kramer
You don’t need social media, but you can be connecting with your clients socially. Your video doesn’t have to be viral in front of a million people, just contagious in front of your specific market. Content, connection, engagement. It’s time to separate from the pack of noise.
UnSelling is about everything but the sell. We put all of our focus on the individual purchase transaction, while putting the rest of our business actions second. We’ve become blind to customer service, support, branding, experiences and even product quality.
In this book Scott Stratten teaches sales companies how to see the big picture in order to:

— Create repeat customers, not one-time buyers

— Create loyal clients that refer others, not faceless numbers

— Become the go-to company for something, before they even need you
After reading UnSelling, there will be no doubt in your mind that it’s true. Up to 60 percent of all purchases are made before the sales pitch even begins, yet we still focus on the sales funnel above all else. UnSelling is about removing this “funnel vision,” reaching out to clients in a meaningful way, and becoming the go-to brand. The sales figures will follow.

2) S.U.M.O: 10th Anniversary Edition by Paul McGee
Now newly updated to celebrate 10 years since its first publication and including up-to-date case studies and examples, as well brand new exercises to test yourself, S.U.M.O: 10th Anniversary Edition will help SUMO fans, as well as SUMO amateurs, get more out of this bestselling, self-help classic.
Weighing in with humor, insight, practical tips, and personal anecdotes, it’s a thought provoking and possibly life-changing read. In this special 10th anniversary edition, including fresh stories and updates throughout, Paul McGee’s bestselling book will show you how to:
— Create and enjoy a brilliant life
— Change your response to life’s challenges
— Take responsibility for your own life and avoid being a victim
— Recover from life’s setbacks and stop putting things off
— Increase your understanding and awareness of other people’s worlds

3) How Much Money Do I Need to Retire? by Todd Tresidder
In one evening you can know more about how much money you need to retire than your financial adviser. This book is a practical, no-nonsense guide complete with a step-by-step plan that tells you how much money you need to retire with confidence.
The conventional approach used by experts to determine how much money you need to retire is fundamentally flawed. The worst part is you won’t even know it until it’s too late. This book takes you behind the scientific facade of modern retirement planning to reveal:
— Why most estimates for how much you need to retire are a case of garbage-in garbage-out causing you to either overspend and run out of money or underspend so that you never get to enjoy your savings.
— The 5 critical assumptions that can destroy your financial security. Which one are you making?
— 3 models for estimating how much money you need to retire (your financial planner only knows 1 and it’s not the best).
— How to reduce the amount you need to retire by $300,000–$600,000 or more.
— How to plan for inflation, changes in Social Security, and much more so you don’t run out of money before you run out of life.
— 7 creative ways to spend less while also improving lifestyle.

6,5 Popular Ways Entrepreneurs Can Launch A Startup,4/5/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-popular-ways-entrepreneurs-can-launch-a-startup/,"
For an entrepreneur, launching a startup begins with the creation of something from nothing. This creation should take into account what an individual is passionate about and this can be done by listing the items and prioritizing them to help an individual remain focused on their idea.
When launching a startup, an entrepreneur must make sure that he or she stands out from the crowd especially because of the large number of new businesses that are launched every year. This is the reason that a successful launch is necessary to help an individual have a strong social proof, build a user base rapidly and improve the chances of long-term growth.
The following are five popular ways entrepreneurs can launch a startup:
1. Determine your target market
The target market chosen should be an industry that is growing fast, big and profitable. The selected market can then be won by differentiation where a business gives customers more of what they want and this boosts their willingness to pay or a business that serves as a low-cost producer and charges the lowest price in the industry. When customers buy the products, the entrepreneur should monitor the changing customer needs as well as new technologies and figure out other additional products to build as well as fresh markets to conquer.
The competition should be studied through the performance of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis. A list of businesses that offer services and products similar to the one being launched should be done, a review of the marketing materials which includes brochures and ads should also be done.
The marketing tactics and strategy should also be chosen. This involves the sales as well as the marketing channels that can be used which include online, catalog or using dealers. Multichannel marketers usually achieve great success because customers like it when they can shop when and however they like. 
Knowing the product’s life cycle is important because the campaign used during the introduction as well as education phase of the service or product needs to be updated as the service or product matures. An entrepreneur should monitor the marketing results carefully so as to notice any diminishing returns that indicate when to revise the service or product, alter the media message or phase out the particular offering.
2. Build an email list
This is important so that people can start signing up to receiving emails from an email list. This should be done before the official launch. Email is important because it can get people engaged as well as convert them into customers. For the email list to work an entrepreneur must get their contact list together, this can be done by downloading contacts from those on the email or from people spoken to. This data can be put in a customer relationship management system. Emailing people directly with the launch announcement is more effective than posting it on social media.
Having a large list of motivated and qualified email subscribers is important if the business is to grow. This list can be built by using list building strategies as follows:
> The list can be built with article marketing where the content is taken from the entrepreneur’s blog or website and is then submitted to article directories.
> Videos can be used to build the list because videos help to authentically connect with the people who visit the entrepreneur’s site and allows engagement in a compelling manner. Videos also allow an individual to interact with prospects better.
> Pay-Per-Click advertising can be used in list building and is one technique that can attract many ideal as well as highly qualified leads consistently.
This list dictates the number of clients and customers that sign on and this affects the income of the business.
3. Optimize your website for signups
For an individual to optimize their website, it is important that they give the right kind of information that will grab people’s attention as well as leave an element of mystery that will generate curiosity. The content on the website should be useful, link-worthy and entertaining as this increases the chance of the start-up being discovered. Assess the type of content the competition is creating and use gaps in the content as an opportunity to deliver something the competitors have missed or are lazy to perfect. Keywords should be worked into the posts and the blog optimized for the search engines. 
Having a page that is a basic “Coming Soon” page, can be used to entice people to sign up. Offering a special bonus can be an effective way to get early subscribers. Make social sharing an important part of your website and lead generation plan as well.
The sign-ups should be monitored on a daily basis and this should be set up in a way that an email is received every time someone signs up. This can be used to send the person a follow-up thank-you note.
4. Communicate regularly and clearly
Attracting clients consistently requires that the entrepreneur’s marketing message be clear and stand out. When this message is clear, the marketing plan will be so much easier as well as less costly. To communicate regularly it is important to engage the audience immediately. This can be done by sending out emails regularly, as well as offering people something that will be useful to them with each message. This is one way to keep them signed up, and respond positively to the launch. Have email programs that will allow the set up of “autoresponder” sequences that enable the automatic sending to people a particular set of messages once they sign up.
The emails can offer sneak peeks concerning the progress of the business, industry news, fun quips and also how-to.
5. Develop strategic partnerships
To launch a startup successfully, align it with relevant companies that have significant reach. With that being said, it is very important that an entrepreneur looks for opportunities in brands that will complement their product offering and provide unique value for the customers. Build relationships with people regarded as influential in the industry. This will open the business to powerful resources, endorsements as well as introductions to other key influencers in the industry.

7,5 Ways Entrepreneurs Can Master The Art Of Speed Reading,29/4/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-ways-entrepreneurs-can-master-the-art-of-speed-reading/,"
One of the hardest parts about being an entrepreneur and owning your own business is setting aside a significant amount of time for personal development especially when it comes to reading educational material. When your business’ welfare and growth potential lies in your ability to learn new business practices quickly and keep as much time free as possible, it can be challenging to make sure that you are not reading too rapidly.
Once you learn to read, you will be forever free. – Frederick Douglas (highlight to share)
When an entrepreneur can perfect the art of speed reading, they are able to use their time for more efficiently and focus more on their business. By following these five helpful tips I’ve gathered from very busy entrepreneurial authors, you can master the art of speed reading your business books and other educational material. 
1. Read In The Morning
There is an erroneous belief that circulates among those who read over important business books and documents, a belief that reading should be done at night, when there are fewer distractions. But did you know that a person actually reads best during the early hours of the day? There are far fewer distractions that present themselves during the morning, and this is when important reading should be completed. 
Your brain functions best early in the morning, whereas your nighttime brain functionality is compromised by all of the events that have already taken place that day. Reading in the morning gives your brain a clean slate to work with and is proven to increase your concentration skills. By reading earlier in the day, your speed is doubled and you are able to deal with your most important tasks first, clearing the remainder of your schedule for other crucial entrepreneurial duties. 
2. Look For The Main Ideas
A great way to read business books faster is to skim the text first, before you do a full-fledged read. This allows you to isolate the key points and phrases and figure out the main ideas. Once this has been accomplished, you can then take a deeper plunge into the material, knowing that you have a greater understanding. This technique is especially beneficial to those with a job that requires them to read a great deal of non-fiction material. 
By taking the time to understand the structure of the book you are trying to read, you decrease the total amount of time you will need to spend reading it. Not only does this technique exponentially increase your overall reading speed, but it also does wonders for reading comprehension. Being able to speed read is great, but it is all for naught if you do not fully grasp the material you’ve consumed. 
3. Choose The Best Environment For Reading
What many entrepreneurs do not know is that the environment that they choose to read in makes a huge difference in their ability to read quickly. Even something as simple as the way you hold the book can make a world of difference. Rather than holding the book up on your own, use a reading stand, one that allows the book to rest at a 45 degree angle. This reduces the strain on a person’s eyes, while also enabling a much faster reading speed.
Some enjoy reading in bed, but this is not a good place to absorb crucial materials. The body’s natural instinct is to relax once you have laid down in bed, which decreases reading comprehension, increasing the chances that you will need to go over it a second time. More difficult materials should be read during the daytime hours, in a place where your mind will remain focused. Relaxing and reading comprehension do not go hand in hand. 
4. Don’t Worry About Highlighting
Of course, highlighting may have worked for you back in your college days and there are a variety of people who swear by this tactic when it comes to speed reading. Yes, highlighting in bright, pretty colors may give you the illusion that you are reading faster, that you can skim the material and come back to the important stuff later on. When you highlight, you’re essentially delaying your actual learning of the material.
When you highlight, all you are doing is giving yourself more work to do. Instead of taking an extra second to ensure that you understand the material during the first read, you will know have to go backwards and read it again. The more times you read a certain piece of material, the less of a chance you are able to retain over the long haul. So put the highlighter away and make sure you read properly the first time.
5. Adjust Your Speed As Needed
There are bound to be moments in any business text that are less important than others. Learning what is truly important and training your focus on these specific parts will help you to cut down your overall reading time. Don’t be afraid to preview the book before you read it, so that you get a true sense of the book’s structure and the lessons it is trying to teach.
This will allow to speed up your reading and slow down as necessary. Speed reading is not about attempting to fly through a book as rapidly as you can, it is about absorbing the material quickly and efficiently, without sacrificing your comprehension. Certain materials can be read at different speeds than others and an experienced entrepreneur knows how to speed up and more importantly, when to slow down.

8,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Peter Voogd,27/4/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-peter-voogd/,"
Who is Peter Voogd and what you can learn from him:
Peter Voogd has received a great deal of attention from a variety of outlets, due to his inspiring true story. Voogd was completely and totally broke, but did not allow his circumstances to define him. He set out on the path to riches and was able to go from being dead broke to having six figures within a mere six months. Peter Voogd was not content to sit back and rest on his laurels, so he wrote a book. The book, entitled 6 Months To 6 Figures became a bestseller.
The following are some of the most important lessons that every entrepreneur can learn from Peter Voogd and his book:
1. Never Ever Give Up
While most people would be inclined to give up when they are completely broke, Voogd did not let his situation bring him down. As a result, he was able to triumph under difficult circumstances. If nothing else, Voogd’s story should serve as inspiration to every would be entrepreneur out there. No matter what your current situation is or how many obstacles stand in your path, there is way to make all of your wildest dreams come true. 
“Never let someone who gave up on their dreams talk you out of yours.” – Peter Voogd (highlight to share)
So many entrepreneurs fall into the trap of allowing themselves to be defeated before they have even had a chance to begin. Voogd did not. Since his story is no fairy tale and he provides realistic ways for his readers to achieve the same goals as he did, there is no reason why an entrepreneur should not be able to take some level of inspiration from it. 
2. Function At Peak Efficiency
A regular complaint from the majority of entrepreneurs who are starting out is that there simply aren’t enough hours in the day to get everything done. Voogd knows this and his work is dedicated to showing entrepreneurs more efficient ways of doing things. He shows his readers how to get their bigger tasks accomplished in much less time, without taking any shortcuts that could potentially damage the quality of the work being produced.
His strategies are not sugarcoated for mass consumption and he did not rely on any sort of gimmicks to achieve his fortune. Voogd was able to make himself a millionaire several times over by the young age of 27, so his tactics are proven to work. His success is what gives him an immense amount of credibility in the entrepreneurial community. 
3. Choose Your Associates Wisely
A lesson that Voogd constantly preaches to his acolytes is the importance of selecting your inner circle wisely and knowing about the dangers of associating with the wrong kinds of people. There are certain people in your life who are just not as vital to your day to day survival as you may believe they are. There are some people in your life who do not matter and never will.
If you hang around with people who do not have goals and plans for their life, then you will end up in the same boat as them. On the other hand, if you spend your time around those who are driven and goal oriented, then you are able to soak up the lessons that their presence teaches you.
The term that Voogd uses to describe this phenomenon is “circle of influence”. In an ideal scenario, a person’s circle of influence would include several people that they can look up to, some true role models. While the term is bandied about too much in modern times, it is crucial for an entrepreneur to spend time around like minded people that they can gain valuable perspective from. 
4. Make The Right Choices With Your Time
Voogd preaches the importance of being able to do more with less time and not being afraid to tell people no if what they are asking for will interfere with your ability to accomplish all of the necessary tasks for the day. Organizing your schedule is key and Voogd shows entrepreneurs how to organize their schedule in a manner that leads to maximum productivity.
Whereas some entrepreneurs believe that spending 80 hours a week working is the path to success, Voogd shows them how to work smarter and not harder. He realized that he was using 80 percent of his effort to accomplish 20 percent of his goals and made the needed changes so that he could flip those numbers to his benefit. He began to focus on the most important 20 percent of his daily activities, the ones that created 80 percent of his overall results.
5. Destroy Your Insecurity
Voogd speaks about confidence and why an entrepreneur needs to destroy their insecurity to move forward. In order to have the utmost confidence, an entrepreneur must have clarity. Clarity only comes to those who have done the proper amount of thinking and know what their goals are and what it will take for them to reach these goals.
An entrepreneur does not get anywhere unless they have a take charge attitude and believe in their own ability to make things happen. No one is going to come along and make things happen for you and this is a lesson that Voogd spends his time teaching to younger entrepreneurs who are struggling with uncertainty. 
Talking about success is one thing, but having the guts that it takes to go out and actually pursue it in earnest is quite another. Obstacles are always going to be in your way, but a confident person knows that they have what it takes to overcome them.

9,5 Social Media Mistakes Most Entrepreneurs Make,23/4/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-social-media-mistakes-most-entrepreneurs-make/,"
When starting any sort of new business venture, social media marketing and online promotion have become two of the most important ways for an entrepreneur to get their products out to consumers.
While social media is free (for the most part) and easy to use, it is also easy to make mistakes. Getting distracted by all of the bells and whistles that come with social media can keep a budding startup business from true success.
“Marketing is no longer about the stuff that you make, but about the stories you tell.” – Seth Godin (Highlight to Share)
There are a variety of social media mistakes that entrepreneurs make when it comes to marketing their business online. Using social media platforms to communicate is a great format, but only when done properly. We’ve interviewed many authors on social media marketing and I compiled a list of the common social media mistakes most entrepreneurs make so you know what to avoid. 
1. Living In The Past
Perhaps you were extremely accomplished in your previous ventures or maybe you have a very strong pedigree. There is nothing wrong with being proud of the accomplishments of your past, but most of your social media followers will not care to hear about them on a daily basis. When you share too much about your past achievements, it is a huge turn off to those who do not already know your work. 
Just like anything else in life, talking about your past achievements is best done in moderation. There are instances where your past experiences will come in handy and when they are germane to the discussion, there is nothing wrong with bringing them up. 
However, social media users are savvier than ever. They will see through any attempts to call attention to yourself by being boastful and may decide not to use your products or services because of your arrogant social media presence. Even worse, this affects your company’s word of mouth in a negative manner. 
2. Becoming Mired In Negativity
Social media is great, because it gives potential consumers a chance to get to know you on a more personal level. This can be a bad thing if you are a person who allows themselves to get swept up in negativity. We all have bad days and personal beefs, but social media is no place to air your sour grapes or complain about the hard times in your life.
Consumers use social media as a means for escaping the drudgery of day to day living, so the last thing they want to be confronted with are the harsh realities of your life. Airing your personal frustrations about the problems that you are having with other people or whining about how hard you life is will lose you social media followers and create bad word of mouth.
Put yourself in the shoes of the consumer. Would you want to buy a product from someone who used their social media profile as a place to vent and complain? The answer is usually no in most instances. Before you fire off your negative social media post, take a moment to consider what your customer base will think of it.
3. Not Enough Attention Paid To Consumers
Social media is a great outlet to speak intelligently, but it is even more important for you to use it as a place to listen. By using social media to garner consumer feedback, you have the opportunity to collect information that is specifically designed to help you. If a consumer has a complaint, you can rectify it immediately and ensure that you do not lose their business.
You can also use social media to engage with customers on a more personal level, getting to know them better. While it is great to let consumers learn more about you, learning more about them allows them to feel more valued. Speaking to them about matters more important than your latest sales and promotions is pivotal.
4. Failing To Use Analytic Tools
The plethora of tools and usages that social media provides for its users can be overwhelming, causing an entrepreneur to lose sight of the ones that are most important. Social media comes equipped with analytic tools that are geared towards measuring the impact of your social media marketing push.
These tools often come free or can be purchased at exceedingly reasonable prices. The tools will show you which of your posts have become most popular and let you know if any of your materials have shown the ability to go viral. 
Posts can also be scheduled when you are too busy to get to a computer or smartphone. With so many options available to you, an entrepreneur would be a fool not to at least explore some of them. No matter what goal you are trying to accomplish, there is an analytic tool designed to help. 
5. Spreading Yourself Too Thin
One of the best parts of social media is its ability to offer you a means of promoting several different products at once. An entrepreneur can easily leverage social media’s reach to gain as many new customers as possible. There are so many possibilities and there are a million thoughts that are probably crossing your mind about how to pursue them. Enhancing your business prospects comes first and foremost. 
Be careful about getting caught up in the madness of trying to promote several different products and services at once. Over promotion can fatigue the audience and cause them to pass by your posts when they are using social media. Training your focus on just one venture allows the audience to get to know the product better. It also decreases the the number of distractions.

10,5 Questions Entrepreneurs Should Ask Before Exiting A Business,21/4/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-questions-entrepreneurs-should-ask-before-exiting-a-business/,"
Once an entrepreneur has become established and they have built their business to a point where it can become self-sufficient or the infrastructure is strong enough to withstand a transfer of power, there are many questions that should be asked. Exiting a business that you have built is not a decision that should be made quickly, so take a moment to ponder the following questions before making a choice that could adversely affect your destiny.
Here are the top questions some authors on exit planning suggest entrepreneurs ask before exiting a business:
1. Is The Business Ready For My Departure?
Entrepreneurs often make the mistake of stepping away from their business too quickly, before the business has had a chance to grow to a point where exiting is feasible. Most business experts recommend taking at least two years to properly evaluate the marketplace and their business’ place in the landscape. Business trends that can torpedo everything you’ve built can emerge seemingly overnight and scuttle even the best laid plans. 
In order to get the best sale price for your business or pass it down to the next person in line, you need to be able to show all of the correct paperwork. Entrepreneurs will often try to execute a rapid transfer, but you need a great deal of time to ensure that your exit goes smoothly. If you are planning on being able to exit your business within a month or two, you should reconsider this plan. 
Putting together the correct plan for exiting your business takes years of careful preparation. Do not allow yourself to be swayed by those who present you with plans that entail walking away in a more expeditious fashion. 
2. Who Is On My Team?
Before you exit your business and pass it on, you should know what members of your current team are going to remain in place after the transition has been made. You will also need a team that can help you through the transitional period. This means hiring experienced business attorneys, accountants and appraisers. If you are inexperienced in these matters (and even if you aren’t), you should bring in a consultant to provide valuable advice.
Having a team to guide you through the process of exiting your business gives you the help you need in avoiding a variety of common pitfalls. You should also know which members of your current team wish to remain on board after the transition period has been completed. Some team members may wish to exit as well, in order to pursue new opportunities. Others may decide that they wish to remain a part of the company, but may be concerned about potential changes to their role. 
3. Is The Timing Right?
In the business world, certain periods are much more tumultuous than others. As a result, the timing may not be right for you to step away from the business that you carefully shepherded through its infancy and watched grow into what it has become. A lot of entrepreneurs choose the wrong times to sell their business or hand it down to the next person in line.
If you are trying to exit your business during a period of decline, don’t. In order to think like a true entrepreneur, you must strike when the iron is hot. The best time to exit your business is when things are on an upswing. Stepping away when you are at the peak of your powers is incredibly difficult, but necessary. 
When you decide to remain at the helm during a period of prosperity, this is thinking with the mind of a business owners, not the mind of an entrepreneur. Make sure the timing is right before handing your company off to the next person.
4. Can The Business Continue To Thrive In My Absence?
Is whoever you are passing your business down to ready to handle the responsibility? Is there a strong infrastructure in place that will allow them to succeed, even after you are gone? A business that has become entirely too dependent on its owner is one that is doomed to failure, should they ever decide to exit. 
The best businesses are the ones that can still run at maximum efficiency if the owner is not there. Take a moment and consider times in the past when you decide to step away. When you have gone on vacation, was the company able to run properly or were there a variety of hiccups? Or were you never able to go on vacation because you were worried about potential complications?
No one wants to see everything they have worked for crumble the moment they step away. So make sure you know for certain that the business can continue to thrive and grow without your constant presence. 
5. Can I Stay On If Needed?
After control of the business has been transferred over, the new executive or executives may need your help to ensure that the transition goes smoothly. Are you willing to remain on board, albeit in a smaller, more advisory type of role? The person who you are handing the company down to could want your help and they may have a certain level of trepidation during the early going.
Before exiting your own business, be sure that the new regime has the ability to hit the ground running. If not, then you may need to stay attached for a little while so that the transition period is not as rocky. Staying on and becoming a consultant can help ease the growing pains for whoever you are passing your company down to.

11,7 Personal Finance Secrets Of Very Wealthy People,15/4/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-personal-finance-secrets-of-very-wealthy-people/,"
In a world where the rich are only getting richer and the income gap between the upper class and lower class is only getting wider by the day, many citizens wish to know the secrets of the wealthy.
How do these people manage to get wealthy and more importantly, how do these people keep their wealth?
As I have learned from the many wealthy authors we have interviewed, a much larger percentage of the rich are self-made than many are willing to believe. Generally, wealth is not just handed down from generation to generation, and every person who is rich did not get there because someone simply gave it to them. By following these 7 personal finance secrets of very wealthy people, you too can join the financial elite.
1. Quit Trading Hours For Dollars
The typical way of thinking is for a person to trade in their valuable time for an income. By following the majority of society and using this method to make a living, you are trapping yourself at the bottom of the financial totem pole. Wealthy people do not allow themselves to fall into this lifestyle and do everything they can to break out of the cycle of trading 40 hours or more for a relative pittance.
A wealthy person earns their money by tapping into their creative mind or by discovering a consumer need that has yet to be adequately filled. To become wealthy, stop burning the midnight oil and breaking your back by working as many hours as possible. Work smarter, not harder. 
2. Blend Logical Thought and Emotional Thought
People with wealth do not let themselves be boxed into one way of thinking. There are decisions in life that must be made rationally, others that need to be made logically and some that require a blend of both mindsets. Each form of thought has its rightful place and the wealthy know when it is time to tap into their logical thought and leave their emotions out of the equation.
Lower and middle class citizens tend to make decisions that are based entirely on emotion. By blending the two ways of thinking, a person can maximize their ability to make the correct decisions and improve their financial position.
3. Money Is Not a Finite Resource
Since ideas are how people acquire true wealth and great ideas are all around us every day, that means that money is infinite. Those who are not wealthy do not see money as something that is easy to acquire and hold onto. This mindset starts to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, which will keep you from reaching your true financial potential.
The reality is that there is more than enough money out there for everyone to live their dreams. It is as simple as realizing that money is generated by ideas, not hard work. While you can work hard for your money, those who are truly rich abandoned this idea a long time ago and you should too. 
4. Viewing Money As Freedom
The wealthy view money as the freedom to do whatever they want to do, a passport to pursue their heart’s desires. Lower and middle class citizens begin to equate money with status and will purchase items to make themselves appear to be more rich than they really are. The wealthy do not waste their time with attempting to project an aura of riches.
If you are trying to build up your fortune so that you no longer have a boss and can live your life the way that you want to, this is the right mindset to have. If you are seeking riches so that you can purchase items that will show off your abundance, this is the mentality of the poor.
5. Live Conservatively Rich
This means that you should live the way that you would if you were rich. This does not mean purchasing a Mercedes and a mansion, this means that you should expect to become rich. You are not going to win the lottery to earn your riches, so it behooves you to start structuring your life in a way that will allow you to make more.
By training yourself to expect large amounts of money, it will become much easier for you to make the sort of aggressive moves that it takes to become. Expecting to become rich means less trepidation when the time comes to take a major risk.
6. No Need To Choose A Lifestyle
Those who have never acquired any wealth will bemoan the lack of family time that the wealthy have and try to tell you that it is impossible to live a balanced life. This notion is patently false and the wealthy are never forced to pick one way of life over the other.
Since they longer trade their money for time, it is much less challenging for them to balance their schedules. The wealthy generate their income by focusing on ideas, not by ignoring their families and friends. 
7. Self-Education and Personal Development
The wealthy believe in continuing their education and they do not believe in the classroom environment. While the rich are often well educated, they do not confine themselves to traditional methods of learning. They are a hands on sort who train themselves on the job.
As the lower and middle classes allow themselves to fall under the spell of trashy entertainment, the wealthy seek knowledge and enlightenment wherever they can find it. They are intellectually curious and always seek new forms of mental stimulation.

12,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn from Melinda Emerson,13/4/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-melinda-emerson/,"
Who is Melinda Emerson and what you can learn from her:
Melinda Emerson is known as the Small Biz Lady. She is the founder and president of the Quintessence Group, a marketing consulting firm based in Philadelphia, PA. Melinda founded an organization that aims to provide training materials to small business owners and entrepreneurs. Her curriculum is available for purchase, but she also gives out free advice to those who need it. Here are five of her biggest tips that I got out of her book, Become Your Own Boss in 12 Months:
1. Create Working Hours
One of the great things about being your own boss is that you get to set your own hours. But you should create a schedule and stick to it. Try to get most of your work done during your most productive hours. If you are a morning person, get up early and be at your desk ready to make the most out of that part of the day. If you think more clearly at night, sleep in as late as you want but don’t go out with your friends until you’ve finished what you need to get done that day.
Setting hours also helps friends and family respect your schedule. Many people will get the impression that you can take off whenever you want since you don’t have a boss to report to. While it’s okay to take advantage of this from time to time, it is not the path to success. By letting people know that you are not available for a set time period each day, they will get the message that you take your work just as seriously as they take theirs.
2. Don’t Quit Your Day Job Yet
There is a lot of research that goes into opening a new business. Once you quit your job to pursue your own company, you are living off of savings. This gives you a limited time to start pulling in money through your new company before you have to return to the workplace. So instead of setting yourself up for disappointment and failure, do as much of the preliminary work as you while still holding your own job.
Research is one of the most important steps in pursuing any new venture. And much of it can be done before you quit your job. Spend one hour each evening looking into what the growth potential is for your business. Learn what you need to succeed in this field. Get as much lined up as possible ahead of time. That way, once you do put in your two weeks’ notice, you can tackle this project with your full energy and get up and running in no time.
3. Do Your Own Research
Corporations have huge budgets dedicated simply to market research. You don’t have six figures to spend on this. So you’re going to have to do a lot of the legwork yourself. But this isn’t that difficult. Much of it can be done just by asking yourself a few key questions.
You can get a large number of responses simply by asking people. Once you’ve run your ideas past a few trustworthy sources, send out a Facebook message to get as many answers as possible. But if you leave open ended questions hanging out there, you are going to be overwhelmed with the endless answers you receive. Instead, ask simple yes or no questions to keep people focused and to collect the specific information that you are looking for.
4. Identify Your Target Audience
Don’t assume that anyone and everyone is going to want what you are selling. Something that appeals to a wide audience is of course more likely to succeed than something that only a few people are going to want. But when you are just starting out, it’s helpful to focus in on a tight group.
This gives you a concentrated focus that can keep you centered. Particularly in the beginning stages, you are going to have limited resources for things like advertising. Instead of trying to appeal to everyone, send a strong message out to a target audience. As they support your company, your reputation will spread through word of mouth. Once you’ve established yourself with your original audience, you can reach out to other groups.
A word of caution on branching out: you don’t want to betray your existing customers. If you change your image too much to attract a different crowd, you will lose your original audience. This type of change leads to a drop in customer loyalty that can have far reaching negative consequences.
5. Use Social Media Consistently
Social media is a cheap and easy way to reach out to a wide audience and develop relationships with your customers. But it has to be used well to be effective. This is not your personal profile that you use to catch up with friends. You need to use it to present a consistent business image that lets your customers know who you are.
This doesn’t mean that everything has to be overly polished. Customers appreciate rough pictures that show behind the scenes action. But just because something looks spontaneous doesn’t mean it is. Thing through something before you post it. Pictures and videos can always be taken down later, but if the Internet has taught us anything, it is that nothing ever completely disappears.

13,7 Successful Attributes Of A Billionaire,8/4/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-successful-attributes-of-a-billionaire/,"
People who are working towards their financial goals each day will often wonder what it takes to be a billionaire. We are often led to believe that billionaires are different types of people, who are only wealthy because they inherited generational wealth or knew high powered investors during the early stages of their career.
What these people do not know is that billionaires are normal, everyday people just like the rest of us. While some may have inherent advantages, there are several attributes of a billionaire that can be ascribed to most, as well as normal, working class people.
Here are 7 successful attributes of a billionaire shared by many expert authors on The Entrepreneurs Library:
1. Hard Working
When you research any billionaire’s life story, a common theme emerges. They were willing to outwork everyone else and remained focus, even in the face on extreme adversity. Some would like to believe that becoming a billionaire is the product of luck and genetics, but those who have actually done their homework know that this is not true.
A billionaire does not sleep in until noon. They are up before their competitors and constantly seek out new advantages, so that they can remain ahead of those who are pursuing the same goals. Everyone wants to be a billionaire, but very few are willing to put in the work necessary to do so.
Great book on building work ethics: 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do by Amy Morin
2. Patient
Once a person decides that their goal is to accrue a billion dollars, they know that this is a long term goal, not a short term pursuit. Being able to keep their eyes on the prize and not be deterred by setbacks is what separates a billionaire from the pack. They know that there will be issues that arise along the way and they do not allow themselves to become frazzled by them.
Without patience, it is incredibly difficult to become a billionaire. No one ever has a smooth path to their goals and financial pursuits are no different. Being blessed with the patience to realize that there is a solution to every problem and knowing whether you need to stay the course is incredibly crucial when you are on the road to riches. 
Great book on managing patience and stress: Performing Under Pressure by Hendrie Weisinger
3. Frugal
This is the attribute that confuses those who are not already billionaires themselves. Since someone has more money than they can spend, it seems somewhat foolish to let it sit in a bank account. But it is more crucial for a billionaire to have assets on hand to make transactions that can boost their financial status even further.
It takes money to make money in the modern business world. While it may be fun to blow your new earnings on a mansion, a fleet of luxury cars and a private jet, these are all items that depreciate in value the moment they are purchased. A billionaire is focused on remaining a billionaire does not make these types of purchases. They realize the importance of having liquid assets at the ready. 
Great book on building wealth: Get Rich with Dividends by Marc Lichtenfeld
4. Thinks Outside Of The Box
In order to become a billionaire, you need a new and interesting idea, a fresh take on things. One person’s route to earning a billion dollars is not going to be the same as the next person’s. To capture the attention the public, you need to think about the voids that exist in everyday life and find a way to fill them. 
A person cannot come up with an inventive plan by thinking just like everyone else. They need to think outside of the box, which is an attribute shared by most billionaires. They know how to think differently than their peers and will zig when most have decided to zag. 
Great book on innovation and creativity: Anticipate by Rob-Jan de Jong
5. Insightful
Being insightful is about more than being book smart. Being insightful is all about knowing how to read people and deliver what they want. An insightful billionaire is one who knows that their wealth is not the be all/end all. They are constantly searching for ways to remain in tune with the world around them.
Once a person ceases to be insightful, they are no longer as useful to their clientele. A person with lack of insight is a person who does not have their finger on the pulse of what is currently happening in the world.
Great book on being insightful: Credibility by James Kouzes
6. Takes Calculated Risks
Becoming a billionaire does not happen because the person decided to stand pat and stop taking risks of any kind. It happened because they were willing to stick their neck out for a cause that they truly believed in. Billionaires do not sit around and wait for things to happen, they make things happen.
The only way to make things happen is to take risks. This does not mean that a billionaire simply lunges at the first opportunity that comes their way. These risks are typically taken in a calculated manner and considered from every angle. Taking risks is a foolish endeavor when they are not properly considered beforehand.
Great book on taking smart risks: The Metronome Effect by Shannon Susko
7. Self Confidence
What gets a billionaire through the hard times? Their unwavering belief in themselves. A person who has an unshakable belief in themselves can conquer any problem that comes along and reach any goal that they set for themselves. They do not wait for pep talks from close friends or read self help books.
They simply dig down deep within and find courage in places that they did not even know existed. They do not allow naysayers to deter them in any way and they know that everything they are doing is done with a purpose in mind.

14,Latest Books for Entrepreneurs in April 2015,6/4/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/latest-books-for-entrepreneurs-in-april-2015/,"
A Quick Look at 5 of the Latest Books for Entrepreneurs
The Entrepreneurs Library presents some of the latest books for entrepreneurs in April 2015. These books are brand new to the market and the authors are in line to give a thorough deep dive of their books. Stay tuned this month for the release of the interviews with these great books and their authors. Below is an overview of what Amazon has to say about these books:
1) The Self-Made Billionaire Effect by John Sviokla
The Self-Made Billionaire Effect  breaks down the five critical habits of mind of massive value-creators, so you can learn how to identify, encourage, and retain such individuals—and maybe even become one yourself.
Drawing on extensive research and interviews, the authors concluded that many of the myths perpetuated about billionaires are simply not true. These billionaires aren’t necessarily smarter, harder working, or luckier than their peers.
The key difference is what the authors call the “Producer” mind-set, in contrast with the far more pervasive “Performer” mind-set. Performers strive to excel in well-defined areas, and are important. But Producers are critical to any company looking to create massive value because they redefine what’s possible, rather than simply meeting preexisting goals and standards.
“The first billion is the hardest. I know from experience. If you are interested in giving it a shot, The Self-made Billionaire Effect is a good starting point. Great research. Great stories. Great opportunity.”
– T. Boone Pickens, Chairman, BP Capital Management
“A fabulous profile of value creation that all organizations need to ponder as they build talent for the future.”
– Thomas Colligan, former Vice Dean and Director, Aresty Institute of Executive Education, The Wharton School

2) Mindsharing: The Art of Crowdsourcing by Lior Zoref
In Mindsharing, Lior Zoref offers proven guidelines for applying what he calls “mind sharing” in new ways. For instance, he shows how a mother’s Facebook update saved the life of a four-year-old boy, and how a manager used LinkedIn to create a year’s worth of market research in less than a day.
Whether we need to make better financial choices, find the love of our life, or transform our career, crowdsourcing is the key to making quicker, wiser, more objective decisions. Zoref reveals how crowdsourcing has the ability to supercharge our thinking and upgrade every aspect of our lives.
Lior Zoref knows the research and makes useful reference to it throughout the book, but he doesn’t pretend to be offering a survey of group psychology. Instead, he gets down to practical matters, like how readers can harness the power of the crowd by frequently updating their LinkedIn profiles and knowing what not to ask their Facebook friends.

3) Doing Good by Doing Good by Peter Baines
Consumers are now expecting that big businesses with ever-increasing profits give back to the community from which those profits arise. At the same time, shareholders are demanding their share and are happy to see dividends soar. Getting this right is a balancing act, and Doing Good by Doing Good helps companies delineate a plan of action for getting it done.
Doing Good by Doing Good shows companies how to improve the bottom line by implementing an engaging, authentic, and business-enhancing program that helps staff and business thrive. The case studies in this book draw out the companies that are focusing on creating shared value in meeting the challenges of society whilst at the same time bringing strong economic returns.
You will learn how to:

•	Define an effective CSR strategy that promotes better business and makes a real impact
•	Understand the current landscape to evaluate the CSR options that are right for your company
•	Understand why corporate philanthropy is no longer enough
•	Identify the hard and soft key performance indicators that help keep your program on track

“Baines makes a highly practical contribution to how the best businesses create value by having a more positive social impact. And considering his track record of actually doing so, who better to listen to.”
– Peter Sheahan, author, founder and CEO of ChangeLabs
“Peter Baines has correctly written that innovation and a sense of the entrepreneurial spirit are the key to the future, irrespective of industry or academic discipline. This is advice offered at an important time in our collective search for best practices and the truth.”
– William E. Strickland Jr, President and CEO, Manchester Bidwell Corporation

4) Die Empty: Unleash Your Best Work by Todd Henry
Die Empty is a tool for people who aren’t willing to put off their most important work for another day. Todd Henry explains the forces that keep us in stagnation, and introduces a process for instilling consistent practices into your life that will keep you on a true and steady course.
Todd Henry shows how to cultivate the mindset and the methods you need to sustain your enthusiasm, push through mental barriers, and unleash your best work each day. Sure to bring a newfound clarity and a sense of urgency to how you approach your work every day, Die Empty will help you reach for and achieve the following:

•	Define Your Battles: Counter aimlessness by defining your goals wisely and build your life around achieving them.
•	Be Fiercely Curious: Prevent boredom from dulling your senses by approaching your work with a curious mindset.
•	Step Out of Your Comfort Zone: Make a valuable contribution to the world by getting uncomfortable and embracing lifelong growth and skill development.

“One of the best books of the year. Passionate, practical and powerful, Todd will help you do more and do it better, starting right now.”
– Seth Godin, author of The Icarus Deception
“A simple, masterful manual for leading a fulfilled life. I couldn’t put it down. Bravo, Todd Henry!”
–  David Allen, author of the international bestseller Getting Things Done

5) Succession or Failure by Kristofor Behn
Succession or Failure is a handbook that will assist you in navigating your small to mid-sized business through key employee identification, succession planning, and ultimately value extraction. By using this handbook as a guide to running your business, you will have an appreciation for the need to run your business with an exit strategy in mind. In the end, there are only two options: Succession or Failure.
The question is, why does this happen to so many small to mid-sized business owners? The reason is simply pilot error, just like in flying. Through a series of distractions, adverse conditions, or fuel starvation, we find ourselves with red indicators.
Succession or Failure is designed to address mission-critical questions and provide workable solutions that you can begin to implement in your quest for your ultimate retirement. Managing your lifecycle in business is the same as flying an aircraft.

15,4 Effective Public Speaking Tips For Entrepreneurs,1/4/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/4-effective-public-speaking-tips-for-entrepreneurs/,"
Public speaking ranks as one of the biggest fears when the general public is polled on the matter. There are those out there who actually fear public speaking more than death, which is quite silly when you stop to think about it. When it comes to public speaking, there is no reason to be afraid.
Entrepreneurs often experience fear before public speaking engagements. Their opportunity to convince clientele and investors of their products’ worthiness hangs in the balance and this can cause a speaker to become tongue tied and sweaty. But when you follow these effective public speaking tips for entrepreneurs, you can overcome the crippling fear that keeps so many from reaching their goals and dreams.
1. Practice Makes Perfect
Of course, this is a cliché, but the reason why clichés endure is because there is a great deal of truth to them. There is no skill in life that cannot be improved by practicing it over and over again and public speaking is no different. Write your speech down and read it to yourself several times. This will help you make sure that you did not use any language that does not make sense and ensure that the speech flows naturally.
Enlist friends and family who are not afraid to tell it like it is. Getting friends and family that are known for sugarcoating the truth will not help your speech either. You need as much honest feedback as you can possibly get. Those who know you are bound to be much more forgiving than those who are considering investing their resources in your product.
The more you practice, the better your delivery will become, which allows you to develop a greater connection with your audience. It also decreases the chance of your audience becoming bored and restless during your speech. As you practice, larger portions of the speech become committed to memory and you are able to increase the level of eye contact you have with audience members. 
Developing more comfort with your speech is crucial. You can begin to add jokes or humorous anecdotes to spice things up and take the time to include every one of your most important points, while also trimming the fat to ensure that you do not run over the time you’ve been allotted. 
2. Learn The Space You’re Using
Before giving your speech, it helps to take a trip to the space that you will be using, so that you can learn more about the acoustics of the area. It will also help you to walk around a bit on the stage or to stand at the podium. The entrepreneur can mentally picture a room full of people and make sure that their voice will be easy to hear.
Taking these sorts of steps ensures that you will not be caught off guard by any minor issues related to the room being used. Checking out the room you’re going to be speaking in is a great use of your time and should be done by any entrepreneur who is looking for ways to calm their nerves prior to the day of the speech. 
A greater understanding of your surroundings is pivotal to giving a great speech. Removing the element of surprise from your speech is a boon to both you and your audience.
3. Learn Your Audience
When you are preparing your speech, it is best to know what kind of audience you will be speaking to. Is your audience younger, with a shorter attention span? If so, you may want to add some visual ads and incorporate slang terms that can help to get your point across when necessary. Use any method that can help the speech resonate in the mind of your audience.
Or you could be speaking to an older, more seasoned audience. They may not be as apt to respond to visual ads and will want cold, hard facts to help them in their decision making process. No matter who you are speaking to, knowing the audience and being able to decipher their needs and wants is important. 
Another component to be aware of is your virtual audience. More and more speeches are being live tweeted and streamed for interested parties all around the world. If this is true for your speech, make sure you include content that has a much greater chance of being able to go viral.
4. Know What You Want To Say
This sounds deceptively simple enough, but there is a difference between speaking about yourself and speaking about the goods and services you provide. It is good to tie in some personal facts about yourself during your speech, but not at the expense of any knowledge that could be dispensed about the product you’re speaking about. 
The best speeches are those that do not come across as sales pitches, while still giving the audience all of the pertinent information that they came to hear. Walking the line between being informative and entertaining is an incredibly difficult balancing act. The person who is able to do so will have a captive audience for the duration of their spiel.
When you are formatting your speech, know which points you want to take and what knowledge you would like to impart. This will help you to tie in important information, while still being able to remain entertaining. No one wants a speech filled with personal anecdotes or one that is larded with dry facts that do not hold their interest.

16,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn from Mike Michalowicz,30/3/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/mike-michalowicz/,"
Who is Mike Michalowicz and what you can learn from him:
Mike Michalowicz launched his first company when he was 24 years old. After selling it in 2002, he founded PG Lewis & Associates, which he sold in 2006. He now works as a writer, speaker, and consultant through Provendous Group. He helped found the company, which is a profit sharing venture group, and currently serves as the CEO.
Mike is more than happy to share his success with other aspiring entrepreneurs. His books are full of advice, and his blog is loaded with helpful articles. Here are his top 5 pieces of advice for new business owners.
1. Be Patient
Get rich quick schemes are a fool’s dream. You can build a large and successful business. But it will probably take 10 to 15 years. If you go into a new project expecting instant wealth, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. When you don’t reach your goals, you’ll likely become discouraged and may give up on your dreams too soon. Setting realistic goals is the most important thing you can do for your new company.
If it was common place to become a billionaire by opening your own business, everybody would be doing it. It isn’t uncommon for people to open a new business planning on astronomically large financial returns. Realistically, just managing a business that keeps its doors open is a huge success. Don’t expect to make millions by doing it.
You also need to step back and watch for long term results. Any new venture is going to have setbacks. Keep reminding yourself that big success takes time and perseverance. It also takes a little luck much of the time. As long as you see forward progress towards your goals, be content with the pace at which things are moving. The only really bad sign is if your company remains stagnant for a long period of time.
2. Be Prepared for Competition
Just because nobody else has the exact same idea as you doesn’t mean that you won’t face competition. Any available alternative to using your product or service is competition for your business. This includes the possibility that people choose to do nothing.
It isn’t enough to convince people that there isn’t anything like your product on the market. A truly superior product almost always costs more- you need to convince your customer base that the extra features of your product are worth the extra money it costs. People might recognize that you have the best product on the market, but they don’t need anything that does what your product does. You need to convince them that they do.
3. Take Time Off
Many entrepreneurs make the mistake of putting their entire lives on hold as they focus on getting their business off the ground. If you don’t take care of yourself, however, your business will suffer. Everybody needs time off to relax, de-stress, and remember why they do what they do. A little time away from your company can serve to remind you how much you love it and send you back to work with a renewed enthusiasm.
Nobody can fire on all cylinders 100% of the time. As you get more stressed, you will become harder to work with and for, affecting your employees. As you get more tired, you will start to miss little details that just slip right past you in the rush. If you run yourself too hard, your health will start to suffer. In order to take care of your business, you need to take care of yourself.
4. Have a Clear Message
Startup companies succeed in attracting employees away from established corporations by having a worthy goal for people to rally around. A dedicated team of people focused on the same outcome is a very powerful force. But if you attract different people with different messages, you aren’t going to have a unified objective. It’s okay to tailor your pitch to each party a little, but the core message has to remain the same.
This is also true in marketing. There are countless outlets for you to use to raise brand awareness. Different outlets lend themselves to different messages and you’re going to want to refine your message to reach your target audience with each marketing campaign. Newspaper ads, for instance, as far more likely to be seen by an older audience, so you’ll want to present yourself slightly differently than you would on a social media site with a young following. But you company image has to be consistent across all these platforms. If people don’t know who you actually are and what you do, they aren’t going to become customers.
5. Be Upfront
The Internet is not known as the Information Highway for nothing. One tiny leak can spread across the globe in seconds. For this reason, it is very important that you are always upfront about everything. It is almost certain that anything you try to cover up will become public knowledge. People will forgive and forget a mistake that you own up to relatively quickly. But a cover up that gets exposed in a juicy scandal will hang over your company for years. Your reputation may never recover from such a blow.

Hal Elrod, known as “Yo Pal Hal,” started hosting his own radio show at age 15. When he was 20 he was hit by a drunk driver. He was clinically dead for 6 minutes and in a coma for 6 days. Doctors told him he may never walk again. Today, Hal is an ultra-marathon runner. 
Hal is the author of 2 of the most acclaimed books on Amazon, regularly appears on television shows all over the country, and is one of the most popular life coaches today. Here are 5 lessons that all entrepreneurs can learn from Hal Elrod:
1. Responsibility is not to Blame Others
The first thing you need to do to start reaching your goals is to accept responsibility for all areas of your life. It is impossible for you to determine the course of your life when you are placing responsibility on someone else. When someone else is to blame for the current situation we find ourselves in, we often become passive. But when you accept the responsibility of getting yourself out of that situation, you reclaim power over your own life.
Many people hesitate to claim responsibility because they assume that they have to accept the blame for that situation as well. But responsibility and blame are two different things. Blame identifies who is at fault. But the fact is, it doesn’t mean why you find yourself in any given situation. What matters is that you commit to finding a way out of it. And that is responsibility.
2. Be Proactive not Reactive
It is only natural for people to be very emotional about a new business that they are starting. This venture makes up a large part of your life and it only makes sense that you would feel very strongly about it. But when we allow our emotions to dictate what we do, we become reactive. This always puts us one step behind. Instead, we need to be guided by our minds, which makes us proactive.
“The number one cause of unfulfilled potential is never deciding that now matters more than any other time in your life.” – Hal Elrod
When we make emotional decisions, we choose things based on what will make us feel good right now. No business will ever succeed if it is built on such short-sighted goals. We need to take the long term view of everything. It may require sacrificing short term pleasure for long term happiness and success. Before making any decision, take a step back to review the consequences of each choice objectively.
3. Reach Out and Help Out
One thing that is true of all great leaders is that they help other people reach their personal and professional goals. When you focus on how you can help others, you will find yourself receiving countless offers of help in return. The more people we help, the more influence we will accumulate. This directly translates into more success. 
If you help people get what they want, you will be much more likely to get what you want. Far too many entrepreneurs treat competitors like the enemy. The fact is, the market is almost definitely big enough to accumulate your company and theirs. Partnerships and friendly cooperation are the building blocks of success.
4. Learn from Your Mistakes
Everybody has bad days. It’s just a fact of life. You will encounter obstacles and setbacks in reaching your goals, some of them of your own making. Unsuccessful people use these bad days as an excuse for future failures. Because yesterday was bad, they are running behind today and that negatively affects tomorrow. With this mindset, they create a whole series of bad days out of one mistake.
Successful people, on the other hand, learn from their mistakes. They own up to their bad choices and use them to grow as a person. They refuse to let one bad day turn into two. Instead, they seize the opportunity to analyze what led them to that bad day and study how they can avoid repeating it in the future. The difference between success and failure is not the number of mistakes you make, but rather how you react to those mistakes.
5. Push Through Fear and Embrace Risk
Doing anything for the first time is uncomfortable. It’s often at least a little scary as well. It is perfectly natural to feel fear when you are beginning a large project. That fear does not mean that this is a bad idea or that you are not ready to start something. It just means that you are trying something new and unfamiliar.
Fear paralyzes. The best way to combat fear is with action. Once you actively begin pursuing your goals, the fear will fade away. It is when you stand still and allow the fear to overwhelm you that your goals elude you. You don’t have to deny the fear or pretend that you don’t feel it. But you do have to move ahead through it.

18,7 Hard-To-Swallow Truths About Entrepreneurship,23/3/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-hard-to-swallow-truths-about-entrepreneurship/,"
While entrepreneurship is a path to a better life, there are many harsh truths that come with choosing this career option. It is not an easy route to untold riches and there are several issues that typically arise along the way. Unless you are fully capable of handling them, your dream of being an entrepreneur may die before it even has a chance. Read on to learn more about seven truths about entrepreneurship that are the hardest to swallow: 
1. You’re Not As Useful As You Think You Are
When it comes to entrepreneurship, you are only as useful as the last product or service that you provided to your customers. No one is ever as useful as they think they are, no matter how many successes they’ve had in their past. The most important question that consumers ask of those who provide their goods and services: what have you done for me lately?
You must remain focused on the cutting edge and always have a new idea on top. Even the best entrepreneurs need to be coming up with new plans for the future, so that they can remain valuable to their loyal customers. 
2. Success Breeds Envy
The more successful you become, the harder people will try to tear you down. There is no handbook for becoming successful and how to deal with it, so be prepared to handle the envy and disloyalty that comes your way. People who were once in your corner may decide to turn against you.
This is not because they don’t like you as a person, it is because they do not like your success. It makes them feel inferior, so as a result, they are forced to tear you down and poke holes in your triumphs. While some people see the success of others as a motivator, the majority of those who are in direct competition with you do not.
3. Personal Relationships Matter
Everyone is going to tell you that personal relationships do not matter and that entrepreneurship is all about who brings the best products to the attention of the consumer. This may be true to a certain extent, but personal relationships are also of extreme importance. 
Talent and hard work can only get a person so far, in certain scenarios. An entrepreneur who has connections and combine their talent and hard work with their ability to open doors will usually get much further than someone who does not have any connections and is forced to open these doors by themselves. 
4. Money Does Not Solve Every Problem
Entrepreneurship is a field where simply throwing a bunch of money at a problem does not make it go away. If your products aren’t good enough, if you are unable to connect with people, if there is nothing for the consumer to grab onto, there is no amount of money that a person can spend to make those kinds of problems go away.
In order to keep your business functioning, you need a large reserve of cash on hand at all times. If you decide to spend all of your discretionary funds to put out every fire that comes along, you won’t have anything left to deal with the day to day expenses that come with running your own business. A person must get used to solving problems with their brain and not their wallet. 
5. Do Or Don’t Do, There’s No Such Thing As “Trying”
To paraphrase Yoda, there is only what you can do what you cannot do. The consumer does not care to hear about your trying or what you might be able to do. Can you deliver on what you’ve promised or not? Everything else is merely window dressing. Unless you can live up the promises you make to your consumers, they will take their business elsewhere.
Without delivering on your promises, all you are is a big talker and no one likes a big talker. Word will get out about your ability to talk the talk and your inability to walk the walk. Once this happens, that is a death knell for your career as an entrepreneur.
6. Investors Don’t Care Unless There Is Money Involved
Your relationships with your investors have nothing to do with the flowery speech that you gave them or the wining/dining you did. The health of your relationship with your investor depends on one factor and one factor only: your ability to continuously make them money. If you start to make more excuses than money, this puts a strain on the relationship. 
No one cares about the sad times that happened in your past. Nor will they care to hear about whatever passion project you have or the sob story that led to the loss of their money. When it comes to entrepreneurship, money talks and experienced observers already know what walks. 
7. You Are More Likely To Fail
Most entrepreneurship endeavors fail. This is not meant to discourage a potential entrepreneur from trying, this is merely the statistical evidence that is currently available. 
Three quarters of all start up businesses end up failing and this is not because of a lack of ideas. It is much harder to make a business work over the long haul that people believe. There are many businesses that did well during their first year, only to crash and burn because the entrepreneurs running them were not prepared for success. The majority of entrepreneurs fail before they ever succeed.

19,4 Scenarios Where Raising Money For Your Startup is a BAD Idea,17/3/2015,Travis Steffan,https://www.theelpodcast.com/4-scenarios-where-raising-money-for-your-startup-is-a-bad-idea/,"
Raising money for your startup can seem exciting. It seems as though it’s the first step in what will eventually become your Zuckerberg-sized concept you’re going to blow up to the moon.
These investors want to give me money? …Well of course they do because my company is totally destined for greatness.
Okay, you may not get this absurd with your internal monologue, but in all likelihood it’s the feeling you’ll get when you get a “yes” in a room with an investor.
That said it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. In fact, if you can get creative and scrappy and bootstrap your company for as long as you possibly can prior to raising a round of funding (IF you have to raise one at all), you’re going to get a WAY better deal when the time comes, AND you’re going to be a lot more likely to use that money wisely.
As a business mentor for MentorMojo, I spoke on this topic in more detail here:


Don’t get me wrong – I’m not anti-VC money. In fact, I’m a huge advocate of it under the right circumstances.
Here are 4 instances where raising funds may be a very bad idea for you:
1. You’re a brand new founder
If you’re a new founder, chances are you’re a combination of smart, hungry and clueless. We all were – and it can be a profound asset for us in the early days. As in anything, no matter how predisposed you may be to success, there are going to be some hard lessons you need to learn before you’re good enough for the next level.
I’ve had the privilege of living among a few different first-time founders who just raised a round of venture capital, and rather than allowing themselves to fail on a small scale by trying to leverage some creative financing and/or bootstrap things before upping the ante, they instead burn $1 million or more because they’re simply too green to know when they’re making good, informed decisions, or when they’re simply throwing money at a problem they’re not yet intellectually capable of solving on their own.
2. Your idea came from your own brain
Most founders start their first business – or even their first couple – because they had what they believed was a good idea. Every time they think about it, they get so fired up to the point where they take the leap, and soon begin investing time and hard-earned money to make it real.
What they soon start to realize is that an idea is only good for one thing: to spark the very first action. However, as you move forward, you’ll find that your success will not come from any one person’s idea – even if it’s your own. After all, you are only one single plot on your overall customer graph. If you want to grow and move forward, you have to look at and adapt to the overall patterns in the feedback you gather from your target customers, and allow your product or service to evolve as a result.
If you can begin doing this even before you build anything at all, you’ll find that you’ll be able to craft a solutions that your customers may even finance themselves through pre-sales and early-access discounts – negating (or at least prolonging the time before) the need for outside funding.
3. You believe your idea is the path to untold riches
Start a successful company, no matter what it is, could be one of the more difficult, confusing and anxiety-ridden journeys you ever embark on. Every single founder is going to have terrible days where it feels like the walls are closing in around them. These moments are the ones that separate a successful founder from one who cracks under the pressure.
Regardless of how mentally tough you THINK you are, you’ll be a lot LESS tough if you’re only in it for the payday. We all love money, but as strong of a motivator as it can sometimes be, it’s almost never strong enough to kick a struggling founder into gear. Your customers will also sense when you’re only in it for the money as it’ll be a lot less about their ROI and a lot more about yours. Soon after, they’ll run for the hills.
That said, if you’re instead intensely passionate about solving the problem your product or service has set out to solve for your customers and you absolutely love living and breathing what you’re working so hard to create, you’ll be a lot more likely to weather the storm and move forward. Your customers will also gravitate to you – so by focusing on helping them, they’ll help you in return.
4. Your team is made up of friends and friends of friends
Your team’s implementation of your concept or company strategy, not your concept or strategy itself, will be what determines the success or failure of your brand. However, new founders often justify hiring their friends – or friends of friends – because they both don’t know how to find and recruit talent, and they simply want to work all day with their friends.
Most of these new founders then soon realize how tricky having a prior friendship can make an employer/employee relationship. While they can succeed in some rare cases, they’re nearly always much more complex in nature.
Instead, forego hiring friends and personal connections and instead focus on educating yourself on how to recruit great talent. Embrace the “hire slow, fire quick” mantra, and never raise a round of funding until you have a great founding team comprised of passionate, proven individuals. 
Every single investor will ask you about your team as they know how important it is for you – and you need to ensure this is one of the first things you address before walking into a room expecting VC money.
So when SHOULD you raise venture capital?
In my humble opinion (after starting, bootstrapping, scaling and selling 6 tech companies in the last 6 years), there is only one and only scenario where raising venture capital is appropriate:
When you’ve built a small, strong team with proven track records who have put together a minimum viable product you’ve crafted through extensive feedback sessions with your target customers (many of whom are currently using and paying for your product) and you’ve got a well-researched plan on where you’ll target more customers, how much it will realistically cost, what you’ll need build next, and what a realistic exit strategy will be for both you AND your investors.
Oh…and you have discovered, after doing all these, that you actually NEED outside funding to scale your business (in many cases, you no longer will).
If you don’t have ALL of these, keep bootstrapping!

20,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn from Carol Dweck,16/3/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-carol-dweck/,"
Who is Carol Dweck and what she can teach you:
Carol Dweck is the Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. Her work is mostly focused on studying motivation, personality, and development. She ties these subjects together in her bestselling book, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success.
Here are five of the lessons that entrepreneurs can learn from reading her book:
1. Be a Learner
Everyone has a mindset. The simplest definition for a mindset is how a person takes in and processes information. According to Carol, people can broadly be divided into learners and non-learners. Non-learners have a fixed mindset. They see talents and abilities as something that you either have or don’t have. If you don’t have them, then you can’t succeed.
Learners have a flexible mindset. They see talents and abilities as something that can be developed. If they don’t have the skills they need right now, they learn how to acquire them. They don’t worry about making mistakes. Instead, they learn from their mistakes and keep pushing forward.
2. Build a Team
If you ask people to picture Thomas Edison inventing the light bulb, most people will describe him as standing alone in a lab tinkering with various equipment. But the fact is, Thomas Edison was not a loner. The exact opposite is true. When he invented the light bulb, he had 30 lab assistants working with him.
These lab assistants included chemists, mathematicians, physicists, engineers, glass blowers, and more. Thomas Edison was a genius, but he didn’t know everything that this group of people did collectively. To be the leader of a team, you don’t have to be the smartest person in the room. You just need to find the smartest people in their field and cast your vision onto them so that they join your team.
3. Hear Criticism Constructively
Some people just aren’t good at giving constructive criticism. However good their intentions are, it may come across as harsh and judgmental. But the fact is that there is more to criticism than how it is given. You can control how you hear it as well.
It’s all too easy to react to criticism defensively. To you, it might sound like they are saying that you are not good enough. But all they may be trying to do is point out where you have room for improvement. Since you should always be striving to better yourself and your business, you should welcome this feedback. It shows you where you can target your focus in order to increase efficiency or improve service.
What you do not want to do is attack the person giving you the criticism. You might feel yourself getting angry, and it is very tempting to lash out and put someone in their place if you believe that you are being unfairly criticized. But if they are trying to help you, you do not want to drive them away. Even if they are phrasing their criticism harshly, and even if they are doing so deliberately, you can choose to find the grain of truth in their words that you can use to improve your business.
4. You Have a Choice
Different people are wired differently. Some people have a natural optimism that allows them to always find the silver lining. Other people get discouraged more easily and are not as naturally resilient to setbacks. But just because you have to work a little harder to find a productive lesson that can be learned in any situation does not mean that you can’t do it.
How we react to setbacks and obstacles is ultimately our choice. We can choose to see them as proof that we just don’t have what it takes to succeed in business. Or we can choose to see them as opportunities to challenge ourselves and grow. Some setbacks can be catastrophic and take years to recover from. But even these can be tackled constructively if we embrace the challenge to stretch ourselves and expand our abilities.
No matter how naturally optimistic you are, there will be days when you get discouraged. This is when it is most helpful to have friends and partners who will come alongside you and help you find your motivation again. But ultimately, no one can change your mindset except you.
5. Take Action
Setbacks can present such huge obstacles that we don’t even know where to begin on damage control. This is when fixed mindsets tell us that we just aren’t good enough to do this. If we were mean to succeed, we’d know what to do. Since you don’t know what to do, you end up doing nothing.
Instead, take action. It doesn’t matter what that action is. It may not even begin to address the problem as a whole. But identify one small step that can get you moving in the right direction. And then take that step. As tiny as it might be, that first move towards growth is the most important thing you could possibly do.
It helps you feel like you are in control again and it snaps your brain back into action. Nobody is every entirely comfortable when they feel like events are out of their control. Doing even the smallest thing to reclaim some measure of control is a huge first step. And it also sends an important message to your employees and your investors. Yes, things have taken a turn for the worse. But you are letting them know that you are still in control and still hopeful for a positive outcome in the end. This is the most important image that you can portray when facing any large obstacle.

21,5 Secrets For Developing Your Own Personal Brand,12/3/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-secrets-for-developing-your-own-personal-brand/,"
5 Secrets for Developing Your Own Personal Brand
What is the secret to successful brand building? Well, it is a combination of a great plan, and lots of hard work. Whether you are a multi-million dollar enterprise or a home-based small business, you need a clear idea if you want to build a brand identity. 
Let’s take a look at the important pointers that can help you with developing your own personal brand: 
1) Put your story out at the front
Want a good example of brand storytelling done right? Just check out the Lego Movie. A fun representation of the possibilities that the brand creates, the movie is equally enjoyable for both children and adults. 
Consider who you are, what your business promises are, and how you started out to get some ideas about your brand’s story. Keep it crisp and concise. And be true about who you are. And you’ll have the base on which to build your brand. 
2) Give your business a personality
Serious? Cool? Quirky? Every business has a personality of its own. It depends on a number of factors, such as your target market, your products/services, your approach, and so on. 
While McDonalds and Burger King both serve burgers, they have a distinctive personality. If you sell video games to peppy teens, your brand needs to reflect a hip and cool image to attract the right crowd. 
But it won’t surely suit your brand’s image if you offer technology solutions to new businesses. Again, either of these images won’t suit a luxury brand selling fragrances to the ultra high net worth individuals. 
3) Take a consistent approach
The simple logo, use of green and white, and the entire look and feel of Whole Foods Market convey the concepts of health, freshness and sustainability. Consistency is the key to brand building. 
After you have identified the personality of your business, it is important to focus on how to reflect it at every step. Your logo, website design, color choice, text use, and every little detail needs to be consistent with the image you want to project. 
4) Introduce your business on social media
If you aren’t on social media yet, it is high time you do it. Consider your brand’s personality and who your audience is before you decide which platforms to engage on and how to do it. 
A jewelry designer hoping to reach out to women may do well on Pinterest (as Etsy established). But if you are a telecommunication solution provider aiming to connect with followers, Twitter and LinkedIn may be more advantageous. 
You also need to come up with the right ways to engage on social media. Remember, a conversation is a two-way thing. And if you fail to converse, your presence alone won’t be of any help to your brand. 
5) Help others…always
The best way to establish your personal brand is to be there for others. Whether it’s as simple as answering a question on social media or as complex as creating a how-to guide, extend a helping hand. 
Not only will it make you feel good, it will also help you earn respect and admiration. And you never know when a good turn results in a new opportunity. While it is essential to learn to say no at times, it is also important to say yes, whenever you can. 
Little tactics help create a brand identity that is known and valued by all. 
Don’t expect overnight results. Developing your own personal brand takes time. You have to plan it well, put in the required work, and wait for the results. It may be slow, but once your brand identity catches on with the audience, it’ll grow on its own.

22,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Guy Kawasaki,10/3/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-guy-kawasaki/,"
Who is Guy Kawasaki and what you can learn from him:
Guy Kawasaki is one of the most famous entrepreneurs alive today. He has worked for Apple and Google, written for Forbes and MacUser, founded Fog City Software, and is now a successful author and speaker. He also founded or helped found Garage Technology Ventures, Truemors, and Alltop.
With so much success under his belt, it is no wonder that entrepreneurs all over the world want to learn from him. He shares many of his secrets to success in his book, The Art of the Start. He recently updated it for 2015, and The Art of the Start 2.0 has only just hit bookshelves. 
He understands that one of the hardest parts of starting your own business is finding the capital you need. In his recently updated book, he shares the following 5 tips for how to get the startup money that you require to launch your new company.
1. Familiarity Breeds Consent
People are always more willing to loan money to people that they know. If you are lucky enough to be on a first name basis with someone who could potentially hand you a large amount of funds, obviously they are going to be your first pitch. If you don’t know anyone with the appropriate funds, or if you need more than one investor (and both of those are almost certainly true for most entrepreneurs) then you’re going to have to reach out to people who aren’t familiar with you.
When you meet with potential investors, you’re going to have to create a feeling of familiarity. The best way to do this is through common ground. To establish this, you need to do your homework on potential investors. Social media profiles are a perfect place to find background information on a person. Find out if there is any overlap between you and them. Attending the same school or frequently travelling to the same destination is the perfect place to start. Other connections like shared hobbies are also fertile ground for making connections.
Above all, be truthful. Never lie to your investors. Trying to make up common ground is almost sure to end in disaster. Name dropping people that you don’t really know or faking enthusiasm for something you are completely ignorant about will destroy your credibility.
2. Show Traction
Have something to show investors when you meet with them. It is supremely unlikely that anyone will invest in your company if all you have is an outline and a dream. Throwing money at such a venture requires an enormous leap of faith on the part of your investors. Anything tangible that you can show them increases the chances of them supporting you.
Actual sales are one of the best evidences of forward progress. If you can show that people are buying your product or service, investors will be happy. Even if you haven’t sold anything yet, there is still evidence that you can provide. Set up a website and track the traffic flow through it. Ask people to register on your site and show an increasing number of users. No matter how little it looks to you, any traction at all is better than none.
3. Catalyze Fantasy
People often meet with investors to pitch ideas with independent studies that show a demand for their product. While this does provide hard evidence that there is a market for your company, it is still a finite vision. It is better if you can drop a few numbers that allow investors to do their own calculations. This will lead to them building their own fantasy. Not only does this create the idea of a vast market, but it also gives them more interest in your startup. When they are casting their own vision, they are much more likely to support you.
An example of catalyzing fantasy is how Pets.com got their start. They showed investors that there are 300 million Americans and 25% of them own a dog. The math leads investors to the conclusion that there are 75 million dogs in America. Then you let your investors know that these dogs need 2 cans of dog food per day. Which means that 150 million cans of dog food are being used in America every single day. That is a huge market that investors will naturally be attracted to.
4. Hook One Person
The hardest investor to get is the very first one. Everyone is reluctant to be the first person to put their money in a new venture. If you can show them that even just one person has already invested in your company, they will be much more comfortable supporting you.
It might sound like a good plan to cast a wide net in order to attract as many investors as possible, but that isn’t the best way to start. Do your research on possible investors and target just a few that you really believe you can convince. Focus on them until you get your first investor. Then you can start reaching out to more people. It is better to have one investor fully committed than to have ten investors who are thinking about it.
5. Create the Illusion of Scarcity
People are much more likely to act if you let them know that this is a limited time offer. Tell them that you are raising this set amount of capital and once you reach it you won’t be accepting any more investors. Or determine that you are only going to accept a certain number of investors, at which point it will no longer be possible to join this exciting new venture on the ground floor.
As previously stated, you cannot lie to your investors. If you set a cutoff number, once you reach it you have to stop accepting investors. This might mean that you have to get creative in order to raise any money you need over and above you original investments. While this might seem like a step in the wrong direction, it is a proven way to make your venture more attractive to possible investors.

23,Latest Books For Entrepreneurs in March 2015,5/3/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/latest-books-for-entrepreneurs-in-march-2015/,"
A Quick Look at 5 of the Latest Books for Entrepreneurs
The Entrepreneurs Library presents some of the latest books for entrepreneurs in March 2015. These books are brand new to the market and the authors are in line to give a thorough deep dive of their books. Stay tuned this month for the release of the interviews with these great books and their authors.
1) Entrepreneurship for the Rest of Us by Paul B. Brown
Based on extensive research, Entrepreneurship for the Rest of Us reveals the best practices of the most successful entrepreneurs, those who are adept at continually innovating and seeing opportunity where others do not.
What works for the most successful entrepreneurs will work for us, Brown argues, whether we want to stay employed working for someone else or are thinking of going off on our own. Though of course we won’t all start or run our own companies, we need to learn to think like entrepreneurs so that when uncertainty hits, as it will again and again, individuals and companies will be better prepared to not only survive but win.
In short, the entrepreneurial mindset is a protection against economic uncertainty, and Brown’s goal is to spread that thinking to individuals and large organizations alike.
“I believe entrepreneurship has to the power to go a long way toward providing the future we as individuals and corporate businesspeople aspire to have. Innately, we are all entrepreneurs, but too few of us get to practice it. Entrepreneurship for the Rest of Us can help change that.” – Leonard A. Schlesinger, Baker Foundation Professor, Harvard Business School
“In searching for ways to become more innovative, there is no better role model than successful entrepreneurs—people, who by definition, have created something that did not exist before. In Entrepreneurship for the Rest of Us, Paul B. Brown explains simply and in detail how they think so we can learn from their success. Everyone from Fortune 100 executives to potential entrepreneurs can benefit.” – Andrea Coville, president and CEO, Brodeur Partners

2) The Social Profit Handbook by David Grant
The Social Profit Handbook presents assessment and evaluation not as ends in themselves but as the path toward achieving what matters most in the social sector. The result: more benefits to society and stronger, more unified, more effective organizations prepared to make the world a better place.
The Social Profit Handbook offers those who lead, govern, and support mission-driven organizations and businesses new ways to assess their impact in order to improve future work rather than merely judge past performance.
David Grant’s insights, illustrated by numerous case studies, make this book a unique organizational development tool for a wide range of nonprofit organizations, as well as emerging mission-based social venture businesses, such as low-profit corporations and B Corps. 
“For many years, David Grant has helped our organization create firm foundations for new projects and initiatives through the principles outlined in this excellent roadmap for rethinking success. At last his guidance and wisdom are available to anyone fortunate enough to come across this book.”– Robert Lynch, President and CEO, Americans for the Arts
“Anyone in the business of improving lives—whether they spend their days in government or in mission-driven organizations—can benefit from this simple, elegant, and incisive guide to having not just more impact, but also the right impact. David Grant has produced a book that belongs on the shelves of every political and social leader interested in translating goals to successes.”– Peter Welch, Congressman, U.S. House of Representatives

3) Seeing What Others Don’t by Gary Klein
Both scientifically sophisticated and fun to read, Seeing What Others Don’t shows that insight is not just a “eureka!” moment but a whole new way of understanding. 
Gary Klein is a keen observer of people in their natural settings—scientists, businesspeople, firefighters, police officers, soldiers, family members, friends, himself—and uses a marvelous variety of stories to illuminate his research into what insights are and how they happen. 
We also need insights into the everyday things that frustrate and confuse us so that we can more effectively solve problems and get things done. Yet we know very little about when, why, or how insights are formed—or what blocks them. In Seeing What Others Don’t Klein unravels the mystery.
“His analysis of how Google searches and corporate culture inhibit insight is intriguing, while suggestions for improving the chances of having a breakthrough are practical and useful for many facets of life.” —Publishers Weekly
“No one has taught me more about the complexities and mysteries of human decision-making than Gary Klein.” — Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point and Outliers

4) Nice Guys Finish First by Doug Sandler
Nice Guys Finish First provides stories, lessons, concrete takeaways and action items. The reader will go beyond finding out why nice guys finish first and discover how to be successful using the lessons provided. 
In order to win relationships in today’s business climate, you must first understand the importance of having systems in place to provide exemplary service, making people a priority over products, putting the client experience at the top of the list and valuing relationships over technology. 
The book walks the reader along a path to becoming a student of Sandler’s system: Invest, Inspire and Execute. The chapters break the system down into smaller pieces, guiding the reader through practical application and lessons about leadership, technology, consistency, trust and empowerment.
“Doug Sandler has written an inspiring, well structured, easy to read book that is a success system for life in general and not just for your business. Readers will appreciate the practical examples and end of chapter action items.” —  John Watson, author of The Ultimate Guide to Consulting in the Networked Age

5) Free Agent: The Independent Professional’s Roadmap to Self-Employment by Katy Tynan
Despite the proliferation of people engaging in freelance and contract work, however, the path to success is not always easy. Free Agent: The Independent Professional’s Roadmap to Self-Employment Success details a pragmatic action plan to help you succeed in this new skills marketplace.
Supplying practical strategies to help you get ahead of the change and become an in-demand resource with a steady stream of income, the book describes how work is changing and what is driving the growth of freelancing. Next, it explains how to get your new independent venture off the ground, how to find your first client, and what you need to know to avoid common pitfalls.
Detailing the tools and practices that will enable you to succeed as a free agent, the book includes case studies and interviews with those who have already made the transition. The book concludes by describing how to optimize your new freelance work style to make the most of your time and energy, so you can focus on doing more of what you love.

24,7 Secrets to Running a Business While Traveling,3/3/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-secrets-running-business-traveling/,"
7 Secrets to Running a Business While Traveling
Living the life of a ‘digital nomad’ seems to be the trend these days. But it’s harder to maintain than you think. Do you really have the will power to say no to a skiing adventure in Vermont or a ballooning opportunity in Greece and sit down to work on your laptop instead? Most don’t!
Even if you think it’s the perfect life, it is fraught with hurdles too. It’s very important to focus and remember to work on your business while you travel. Running a business while traveling requires some acquired skillsets and will take a significant amount of learning in advance. 
To prepare yourself for running a business while traveling, here are some pointers I learned that will help you become an entrepreneur on the go:
1) Plan ahead.
Instead of planning for a year, do it for a week. And try to adhere to your schedule. At times, you are sure to keep the task at hand for later and go on a hike. But keep to your plans as much as possible. Also, set smaller goals that you need to achieve within a short period, and that will lead to the larger objective. 
2) Identify when you work best.
While some work best in the morning, others are more productive at the late hours. Track your daily routine for a week to learn when you perform best. And keep those hours for work. A 9-5 schedule doesn’t work for everybody; and working without being productive is just a waste of time and effort. 
3) Stay at a place for a considerable period.
If you plan to stay at Bali for a week, you’ll always be in a rush to see and do as much as you can. And such a rush is sure to hamper your work. But if you plan to be at Bali for a month or two, you will have ample time to explore the place and it won’t affect your work either. 
4) Be sure about Internet connectivity.
No entrepreneur on the go can become successful if they fail to find a place where the Wi-Fi works fine. Imagine what a nightmare it will be if you lose connectivity just before a video chat with a potential client. So, before you check into a place to stay, check Wi-Fi availability.
5) Learn to say no.
It’s often hard to resist the temptation of a new experience. But at times when your business needs you, the wise thing to do is to postpone it. The same applies to work as well. If a communication isn’t going anywhere, it’s better to end it. When you have so much to see and do, you just can’t waste a moment. 
6) Keep an open mind.
Every experience you have helps you gain an insight into the world around you. And when you keep your mind open to them, you can learn from each. Roxanne Genier of Agence:Luxury learned what makes ‘luxury’ craftsmanship unique from the Mayan women on her visit to Guatemala.
7) Be proactive.
Don’t wait for anything to happen and then plan your step. Instead, take the initiative. It will help you achieve more, both as an entrepreneur and a traveler. If focusing on a certain area of your business seems essential, do it now. After all, it’s your call to keep it running even when you are traveling. 
Living the life of a digital nomad comes with its perks. But it also comes with its challenges. If you want to be a successful entrepreneur even on the go, you need to hone your time management and planning skills.

25,4 Common Reasons Why Startup Companies Fail,25/2/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/4-common-reasons-startup-companies-fail/,"
4 Common Reasons Why Startup Companies Fail
You have a superb business idea. The question is – how do you know it will be a success? 
The answer is simple – you don’t. And unless you try it out, you will never know it for sure. You need to take the step to find out whether your brilliant idea will transform into a successful business. 
But before you take the step, be cautious. 
The facts can be dampening – 8 out of 10 startups fail. But if you are aware of the common pitfalls, you can try to steer clear of them. Why exactly do startups fail? Often a combination of reasons works together and ultimately leads to failure.
“Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.” – Robert F. Kennedy
Let’s take a look at the most common reasons why startup companies fail:
1) The Core Idea isn’t Right
The idea may be too small, and attract only a small niche market, in which case you won’t be able to attract investors. Or, it may be the solution to only a really frivolous problem, in which case you won’t get customers. 
Another possibility is that the product or service you offer really isn’t necessary, but only an addition to whatever is already available. In each of these circumstances, the possibility of building a successful new business will remain a distant dream. 
Tip: The best way to assess the potential of your idea is to present it to investors. 
2) The Funds Are Dried Up
Perhaps you miscalculated how much you may need, or you spent more than you can afford, or you misjudged the time you will need to break even, or maybe it was some other reason. Whatever it is, it can spell doom for a startup. 
Also, if you want to run it as a lifestyle business, you may not want to involve investors. But this strategy won’t work if you want to build a big business. Running out of cash can forestall any chance of success, and eventually lead to shutdown. 
Tip: Plan your budget; and double it. Also, keep aside an emergency fund. 
3) The Team Doesn’t Work
Put together a directionless leader, an unmotivated team, and no advisors – and you have the perfect recipe for disaster! A startup needs a team with all the components right; and one that knows how to manage a startup. 
You need to come up with a management that understands how to build up a new business, a team that works together with the same vision, mission and ethics, and advisors who can help overcome the hurdles on the way. 
Tip: Don’t take it all on yourself; it will go haywire if you have to stay away for a week. 
4) The Competition is Too Tough
Unless your startup involves an original invention, you have to worry about competition, even in the first phase. Be it selling pencils or managing yacht charters, many new businesses are outcompeted by the established ones. 
Again, sometimes your product may be too complicated to use, or your service may really be unnecessary. And customers prefer the time-tested solutions to innovations. If there’s a gap in your strategy, your idea may never become a successful business.  
Tip: Do thorough market research, especially about your competitors, in advance. 
A startup may fail for any of these, or some other reason. And even if yours does, it’s no cause to think of it as a failure and regret your step. Even Edison failed 1000 times before he came up with the light bulb. 
Instead, analyze why you failed, and learn from your mistake. It’s the only way to success.

26,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Stephen Key,23/2/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-stephen-key/,"
Who is Stephen Key and what you can learn from him:
As an award-winning inventor and author, Stephen Key and his runaway success serves as a motivator to all other entrepreneurs. His belief that all a person needs is a well-executed idea in order to be truly successful provides hope to those who lack it. Key is determined to show budding entrepreneurs the ropes and give them the lessons they need to turn their fortunes around. Here are five of the most important ones.
1. Trust Your Instincts
Key teaches his followers to trust in their gut and believe in their instincts. He achieved his success by trusting in his instincts and you can too. Key preaches the importance of accepting when something does not have the right look or feel to it. When a situation does not feel right to you, there is typically a very good reason for that.
If you are looking into something that does not sit well in your gut, it is time to do your homework and take a long look into whatever aspect concerns you the most. We tend to minimize our own intelligence in these sorts of scenarios, but Key teaches us that we are much smarter than we believe.
The old saying that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck holds true here. There is no need to over think a situation to death. Trust your instincts and go with the choice that makes the most sense to you. 
2. Time Is Your Friend
Rushing into a decision due to time constraints goes against every principle that Key attempts to teach. He is not afraid to talk about times that he made a decision hastily and how it did not benefit him to do so. Since he makes it so easy to learn from his mistakes, it becomes easier to make the right choice in our own lives.
One of the most important lessons Key teaches is that hastiness has no place in the world of business. When a deal is being made, there is no reason why the other side of the negotiation table should be pushing for a fast decision. If they do, this should serve as a gigantic red flag.
In order to come to the right decision, a person needs time to think it through. While others will try to convince you that there are great reasons for urgent behavior, Key preaches the importance of not buying into such a mind state. 
3. The Wrong People Can Waste Your Time
Key has experienced a great deal of aggravation by trying to convince businesses to change their ways and try something new. By spending time selling his inventions, he has been able to get an insider’s view as to how business is done and is not shy about sharing all of his revelations.
As such, he has learned the importance of tailoring your products towards the people who actually need them, as opposed to selling to someone who has no need for your product. When you waste valuable time trying to pitch to someone whose mind is already made up, that is time that you cannot get back.
Most people have a comfort zone that they like to remain inside of and pitching to those is a hopeless endeavor. Even the best idea of all has little to no value when it is being wasted on someone who has no interest, so plan accordingly.
4. All Things Are Not Meant To Be
Just because we want something badly does not mean that we are meant to have it. Key teaches us that things not going our way is not always a cue to work harder. Sometimes, we must accept that a situation will not turn out in a way that is favorable to us. Instead of continuing to battle, it is preferable to cut our losses and live to fight another day.
While having a great deal of willpower is great, it does not always serve us well. Stubbornness and the ability to fight are great, but they are not always the most useful tools we have at our disposal. Letting things go is often the best course of action, whether we want to admit it or not.
Pushing too hard to make something happen that is not meant to be can lead to regrets. One of the hardest lessons in life is knowing when to push harder and when to let something go. Navigating this difficult divide takes time and no one should be expected to fully grasp this concept overnight.
5. Don’t Be Afraid To Call
In a world where more and more communication takes place over e-mail and text message, lack of proper communication is bound to happen from time to time. When you are in doubt as to whether your message is being communicated in the manner you prefer, do not hesitate to pick up the phone.
Key teaches that e-mail and text message are convenient, but do not have the personal touch needed to properly convey a message. When a person is unable to witness or hear the intent behind your words, this leads to issues that can be tough to solve. 
Picking up the phone can be inconvenient, but it also nips minor problems in the bud before they have a chance to become major ones. By making the call and/or taking the time to meet someone in person, you demonstrate a far greater level of commitment, giving you an advantage over your competition.

27,6 Practical Tips to Become an Effective Entrepreneur,18/2/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/6-practical-tips-become-effective-entrepreneur/,"
6 Practical Tips to Become an Effective Entrepreneur
When you start on your entrepreneurial journey, you are sure to hear one important piece of advice – you need to maintain a work-life balance. But what exactly does it mean? Does it imply that you divide your day into two equal parts – one dedicated to work and the other to life? Not really! 
Work-life balance implies that you put equal emphasis on the two. But it’s easier said than done. It can be difficult to think of your life separately when you have to juggle numerous roles and handle numerous responsibilities. So, what do you do? 
Here are a few tips that can help you become an effective entrepreneur:
Tip 1: Remember why you decided to be an entrepreneur.
If you started because you loved what you did and wanted to do what you loved, work will never feel as a burden. And while it can take up most part of your day, especially when you are just starting out, it will not make you feel as if you have wasted it. 
Tip 2: Schedule your day.
Not just the work portion, but every part of it. And try to stick to your routine. There will be times when you have to reschedule a meeting or attend your child’s ballet recital. But otherwise, you need to plan out how you will spend the day. This way you can avoid the fear that something you wanted done won’t be on done on time. 
Tip 3: Don’t set yourself up for failure.
Setting a big goal for the year isn’t a good idea. Instead, focus on smaller goals that you need to achieve within a week, or may be a month. It will make you feel good when you achieve these smaller goals. And it will also help you attain the bigger goal you want to achieve in the long run. 
Tip 4: Don’t neglect your health.
While you may love to handle every little detail for your business, if this means that you skip your breakfast, miss your exercise or don’t get enough sleep, it isn’t really the best thing for you. Eat healthy, exercise regularly, and get enough rest; and you’ll see what a difference this little things make in your life. 
Tip 5: Set aside some ‘me’ time.
Taking care of your physical health isn’t the only thing you need to do. You need to refresh and re-energize your mental and spiritual self too. Go on a date, indulge in a spa break, plan a vacation, or do whatever you feel like. And switch off your Smartphone and leave your laptop behind on these occasions. 
Tip 6: Remember your family and friends support.
Be grateful every day for how everyone in your circle of life helps and supports you. It may be your spouse helping with housework or a business associate chalking out a financial plan. Say thank you whenever you feel; expressing your gratitude always makes you feel better. 
Being an entrepreneur doesn’t necessarily mean losing sleep or finding no time for it altogether. If you love what you do, you can build your business into your lifestyle. And this way, you will be able to achieve the right balance between work and life. 
Also, don’t stress about balancing your work and life. It will only mess up things even more. Instead, focus on what you need to do to stay healthy and happy. And when you love your work as an entrepreneur and be part of your circle, you will find that the work and life portions works out on their own.

28,7 Reasons Why You Should Quit Your Job,16/2/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-reasons-quit-job/,"
7 Reasons Why You Should Quit Your Job
Is it a good idea to quit your job and chase your dream of being an entrepreneur? Well, there are numerous reasons that tell you not be so foolish as to quit a job that pays you well and helps you live the lifestyle you do and go down the road of uncertainty. But life is too short not to live it to the fullest either!
Need a few good reasons to quit your job and start on your own? Here are 7 that will help: 
1) You are stuck.
If you feel that you work, but you never achieve anything, it may be a good reason to quit. Sometimes you get too comfortable in a job to notice that you are stuck in stagnant waters. Do you accomplish anything? Do you make an impact? Do you feel that you have a purpose? If you answered no to any of these, it’s time to move on. 
2) You have lost passion.
Do you wake up every day and think – why do I need to go to work? Some parts of your job are sure to suck. But if there are no parts that you look forward to (it doesn’t necessarily have to be fun, it can be motivating, challenging, stimulating, or anything else), it isn’t really the best opportunity for you. 
3) Your pay doesn’t reflect your work.
You put in your best at work. But if you are just working to build a career for your boss, it won’t amount to anything in the long run. Your pay including the perks and benefits you get as well as the way it boosts your career matter; and if it doesn’t reflect how much you put in at your job, it’s no good. 
4) You want to do what you love.
Sometimes, the job you want isn’t even there; you need to create it. And what better way to do it than to leave your job and start on your business? So, whether you want to write a book, start an online handmade jewelry store, or offer after party cleaning service, the best time to do it is now!
5) You need flexibility.
Certain circumstances may make it necessary to have a flexible schedule; and a regular job may not be able to offer you that opportunity. When J. T. O’Donnell wanted to spend more time with her kids, she moved from the corporate world and concentrated on building her virtual career coaching venture Careerealism. 
6) You want to push yourself to the limits.
Can you make it with the skills you have? Can you make the money you have stretch to meet your business needs? Can you create and manage a team that will work towards a better future for them as well as for the business? When you take the entrepreneurial road, you are sure to find out!
7) You desire success.
It’s true that no business can succeed in a day. But it’s also true that your business may have the potential to succeed in time. If you crave to be a success; and are always depressed because you cannot attain it in your present job, it is time to move on and start something where you know you’ll accomplish what you want. 
But before you take the leap, you need to exercise caution too. How do you do it? 
The best way is to prepare for the uncertain times. Don’t fail to put aside at least the amount that will see you through for 6 months (you’ll still have to pay for food, gas, and such necessities). If possible, opt for a part-time job at the beginning; so that you’ll have a steady source of income when you are waiting for your business to break even.

29,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Jon Gordon,11/2/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-jon-gordon/,"
Who is Jon Gordon and what you can learn from him:
For the budding entrepreneur, there are many lessons that can be learned from the teachings of Jon Gordon. No matter how old a person is or what their level of business experience is, they are able to gain important perspective by practicing what he preaches. The following are the five key lessons to be learned from Jon Gordon.
1. Discover Your Passion
Gordon is consistent with his message, telling his acolytes about the importance of discovering what they are passionate about and pursuing it. He believes that we are all put on this planet for a specific purpose and that life is meaningless unless you take the time to chase it. 
Fortunately, he also teaches people that their passion may not reveal itself immediately. While you may not know what your passion is at the current moment, you must live your life in a way that increases your chances of finding it. 
The best way for a person to find their true calling is to seek certain jobs and experiences that will nurture their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. Everyone has a gift, something that they were born to accomplish. Identifying that gift and allowing it to blossom is crucial to a person’s long term success and happiness. 
2. Beware Of Your Hobbies
When people are trying to figure out what their gift is and how to fulfill their purpose on this planet, they will often select hobbies as their default strength. Jon Gordon teaches us that just because we love spending time doing something, this does not mean that we will be able to make a career out of it.
Someone may truly enjoy spending time on their social media pages, but this does not mean that they should be working for Twitter or Facebook. You may enjoy making food for your friends and family. However, this does not mean that you have what it takes to be the next top chef.
It’s important to zero in on the aspect of the hobby that you truly love the most and focus on that. For example, a person who enjoys restaurants and fine dining may believe that they need to own a restaurant in order to realize their dreams. 
There is a way for every person to participate in their hobby, without simply trying to monetize something that they would do for free anyways. 
3. Learn From Past Experiences
Even if the current job or career that you have is not totally fulfilling, there is no reason why you should not be able to gain valuable lessons and insight from it. Every experience that you have, no matter how good or bad it is, prepares you for the future in ways that you are not able to currently imagine.
Being forced to take a job that is below your current station or is not related to the field you’d truly like to be working in can be a tough blow. But the person who dedicates themselves to the task at hand and focuses on how they can help the company or business they are a part of can open up doors to new opportunities down the line.
Nothing in life is permanent and the person who realizes this fact and decides to simply gain as much as they can from the situation they are in positions themselves for bigger and better things. Each moment of our lives, even those that seem truly insignificant, prepares us for what’s to come. 
4. Your Dream Job Isn’t The One You Dreamed Of
Jon Gordon teaches us that the first step towards our dream job is to quit the one we have. But, he preaches the importance of quitting that job for the right reasons. Our dream job will not materialize just because we get frustrated with the job we have and walk off in a huff.
People spend their whole lives preparing for a job that they’ve envisioned in their mind’s eye since they were young. Life does not tend to work out that way. Most times, we tend to end up with a great career that is unlike the one we spent our lives dreaming about and preparing for.
The dreams we have during childhood and throughout our formative years can help to guide us, but should not be seen as a blueprint for living. Keeping your options open allows you to end up with an amazing career, one that you did not see coming.
5. The Future Can’t Be Rushed
We are always in a hurry to move on to the next thing, before we’ve even figured out the present moment. Jon Gordon believes that there is a seed inside all of us and that the process of nurturing this seed so that it can grow into a proper plant should not be rushed for any reason.
It is human nature to want things to happen for us right now. People tend to be very impatient, not realizing that if they get what they want before they are truly ready, they may not be able to rise to the occasion.
There is a certain process that must be adhered to and work that needs to be done along the way. The path to achieving your purpose does not occur in a linear fashion. Allow the process to prepare, shape and mold you, so that when opportunity finally does knock on your door, you are prepared to answer.

7 Recommended Books for Starting an Online Business
Do you really need to attend a business school to be a successful entrepreneur? While it may help you in certain circumstances, it isn’t a necessity, especially when you want to start an online business. Pete Cashmore began Mashable when he was only 19. And look at how amazingly successful it is today!
But the road to success isn’t easy. You need to gather adequate information, couple it with wisdom and imagination to make things work. And what could be a better source for all these than books! Just take your pick, read and absorb what the best have to say.
Here’s a quick look at 7 of the best books for starting an online business:

Will It Fly? By Thomas K. McKnight
Does your business idea have wings? Or will it fall flat? The 44-item checklist in this one will help you find the answer to this vital question. Do you have the right personal traits?

The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau

A pleasant read, this offers great value if you are on the lookout for a book that helps you understand why you should do what you love – and how to do it too.
The E-Myth Revisited by Michael E. Gerber
Being an entrepreneur isn’t exactly similar to being the mythical hero it is often cut out to be. If you wish to get the entrepreneurship facts straight, this is the book to read. It also illustrates the distinction between working ‘on’ your business and working ‘in’ your business.
The Barefoot Executive by Carrie Wilkerson
Want a little inspiration? Take up this book and glimpse Wilkerson’s journey to become a home-based entrepreneur. An entertaining read, this helps you understand the ways in which to tackle the core issues – identifying the target market, creating marketing strategies, building your brand, and so on.
The Lean Startup by Eric Ries
Creation and assessment of business processes may not be an easy task. And it is where this book can be a handy guide – when you are planning to start an online business, especially a software startup, this is one of the must-reads. And the best part, it comes from his experience.
The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss
Well, flexible work hours are one of the chief points that drive individuals to begin their own businesses. This book explores the opportunities that you can get when you decide to take the plunge. And the way the author relates the points in a fun and motivational manner makes it all the more interesting.
Lucky or Smart? by Bo Peabody
Bo Peabody was an online multimillionaire in his twenties. In this book he answers the important question – was it luck or was he smart enough to do it? He illustrates the way you can cultivate your perception and identify when he was plain lucky. Smart for him to do it!

No single book can be your only guide; read up on as many as you can before you take a step.

31,5 Effective Ways To Raise Money For A New Business,4/2/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-effective-ways-raise-money-new-business/,"
5 Effective Ways To Raise Money For A New Business
You may have a winning business idea, but unless you can arrange for the right amount of funds it most likely will not transform into a successfully scalable venture in the 5 plus years to come. The question is – where do you get the money from? Well, there is always the bank loan; but it’s the hardest to get for a new entrepreneur. 
How do you manage to raise money for a new business? Here are 5 of the most effective ways to do it. Remember though, you may have to mix and match all or a few of them to make it work to your advantage. 
1. FUND IT ON YOUR OWN
Self-funding is often the only option for a new entrepreneur, as financial institutions make it difficult for them to get a loan. Liquid assets aren’t the only option though. You can leverage your other assets to raise the necessary money. 
It can be anything – downsizing to a smaller home, selling off your luxury car, selling off jewels, and so on. You can also take out a loan against your home, your savings account or even your whole life insurance policy. 
2. RELY ON FAMILY AND FRIENDS
While banks will ask for business plans, financial projections, and collateral before they give any loan, you may not have to face any such hurdles when you decide to borrow from your close ones. But it’s easier in theory than in practice.
You may not have to pay any interest (or even if you have to, it’s usually quite low). But make sure you get every detail in writing. And also make sure it is a loan, and you don’t give away a legal stake in your business to everyone. 
3. GET TRADE CREDIT
If you can convince your suppliers to work with you in such a manner that you have a fixed period of time before you need to pay for the supplies, things can work out. It works in the same way for established businesses. 
But it isn’t easy. You have to provide suppliers with a good business plan, financial projections, collateral, and any other documents they ask for to make it work. Once you have the agreement in place, you will have a fixed time before you need to pay them. 
4. APPLY TO ANGEL INVESTORS
These are successful entrepreneurs who can help you get your business on track. But remember, it’s not a loan; it’s an equity investment. So, you have to hand over a slice of ownership to them when you get their money. 
The advantage is that you don’t need to fret over regular payments or interest rates. But on the downside, you may have to share the authority over your business. And it may be a little difficult at times to ask for approval from every investor. 
5. FIND SMALL BUSINESS LENDERS
Certain companies specialize in finding lenders for small businesses. All small business loans can help you find the funds for your new venture. But you need a business plan, financial projections and some money for the startup. 
Online lending sites are good places to get loans for your small business too. But they are unsecured loans. And it’s essential that you scrutinize every detail, especially the fine print, of the loan agreement before you sign on the dotted line. 
You can also check out the loan programs available from the government to identify possible opportunities to get adequate financing. If you are eligible, it can take out one of the biggest hurdles in creating a successful business – startup costs.

32,Latest Books for Entrepreneurs in February 2015,2/2/2015,Wade Danielson,https://www.theelpodcast.com/latest-books-entrepreneurs-february-2015/,"
A Quick Look at 5 of the Latest Books for Entrepreneurs
The Entrepreneurs Library presents some of the latest books for entrepreneurs in February 2015. These books are brand new to the market and the authors are in line to give a thorough deep dive of their books. Stay tuned this month for the release of the interviews with these great books and their authors.
The Opposite of Spoiled by Ron Lieber
The Opposite of Spoiled is both a practical guidebook and a values-based philosophy. The foundation of the book is a detailed blueprint for the best ways to handle the basics: the tooth fairy, allowance, chores, charity, saving, birthdays, holidays, cell phones, checking accounts, clothing, cars, part-time jobs, and college tuition.
But The Opposite of Spoiled is also a promise to our kids that we will make them better with money than we are. It is for all of the parents who know that honest conversations about money with their curious children can help them become more patient and prudent, but who don’t know how and when to start.
“Finally, an honest, modern, comprehensive and nuanced book about kids and money. Parents report that conversations about money fill them with so much dread and confusion that they change the subject rather than dive in. The Opposite of Spoiled comes to the rescue.” – Wendy Mogel, author of The Blessing of a Skinned Knee

“The Opposite of Spoiled is a thoughtful, and often inspiring, book that also delivers dozens of smart, practical tips for turning conversations about money into lessons about living. If you’ve got kids, want kids — or heck, have been a kid — read this book.” – Daniel H. Pink, author of Drive and To Sell is Human
Learn more about Ron Lieber | Buy The Opposite of Spoiled on Amazon
The 3% Signal by Jason Kelly
Relayed in the same easy-to-understand language that has made The Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing such a staple in the investing community, The 3% Signal is sure to become your most trusted guide to investing success. Simple and effective, Kelly’s plan can be applied to any type of account, including 401(k)s — and requires only fifteen minutes of strategizing per quarter.
The plan’s simple technique cuts through the folly of human emotion by reacting intelligently to price changes and automatically buying low and selling high.
“We often hear, and have come to believe, that models beat experts. Kelly offers the individual investor a simple, mechanical model that instills discipline, removes a lot of self-sabotaging emotion, and has a good track record. Will it continue to outperform? Actually, it just might.” — Brenda Jubin, “Reading The Markets” book review at Investing.com and ValueWalk

Get What’s Yours by Larry Kotlikoff, Phillip Moeller, and Paul Solman
You could try reading all 2,728 rules of the Social Security system (and the thousands of explanations of these rules), but Kotlikoff, Moeller, and Solman explain Social Security benefits in an easy to understand and user-friendly style. Many personal finance books briefly address Social Security, but none offers the thorough, authoritative, yet conversational analysis found here.
Get What’s Yours covers the most frequent benefit scenarios faced by married retired couples, by divorced retirees, by widows and widowers, among others. It explains what to do if you’re a retired parent of dependent children, disabled, or an eligible beneficiary who continues to work, and how to plan wisely before retirement. It addresses the tax consequences of your choices, as well as the financial implications for other investments.
“Choosing when to take Social Security is one of the biggest decisions of your life. By doing it right, you can add hundreds of thousands of dollars to your lifetime income and leave more money for your spouse as well. This great book tells you how . . . and it’s funny, too!” — Jane Bryant Quinn, author of Making the Most of your Money NOW
Learn more about Larry Kotlikoff | Buy Get What’s Yours on Amazon
Refire! Don’t Retire by Ken Blanchard and Morton Shaevitz
In the trademark Ken Blanchard style, the authors tell the compelling story of Larry and Janice Sparks, who discover how to see each day as an opportunity to enhance their relationships, stimulate their minds, revitalize their bodies, and grow spiritually. As they learn to be open to new experiences, Larry and Janice rekindle passion in every area of their lives.
Ken Blanchard and Morton Shaevitz point out that some people see their later years as a time to endure rather than as an exciting opportunity. Readers will find humor, practical information, and profound wisdom in Refire! Don’t Retire. Best of all, they will be inspired to make all the years ahead truly worth living.
“Once in a while a book comes along that should be featured on every talk show. Refire! Don’t Retire is just such a book. Read it and you will experience aging in a whole new way. A must-read for anyone who plans on getting old.” — Richard Leider, bestselling author or coauthor of The Power of Purpose, Repacking Your Bags, and Life Reimagined
“If you answer only one-third of the questions at the end of each major section, this book will be worth its weight in gold! It is not only for those considering retirement but also for anyone interested in the pursuit of love, learning, and longevity.” — Beverly Kaye, founder of Career Systems International and coauthor of Love ‘Em or Lose ‘Em; Love It, Don’t Leave It; and Help Them Grow or Watch Them Go

Four Seconds by Peter Bregman
Peter Bregman, author of the Wall Street Journal bestseller 18 Minutes, offers strategies to replace energy-wasting, counter-productive habits that commonly derail us with truly effective ones.
In Four Seconds, Peter Bregman shows us how to replace negative patterns with energy boosting and productive behaviors. To thrive in our fast-paced world all it takes is to pause for as few as four seconds—the length of a deep breath—allowing us to make intentional and tactical choices that lead to better outcomes. Four Seconds reveals:
    Why listening—not arguing—is the best strategy for changing someone’s mind
    Why setting goals can actually harm performance
    How to use strategic disengagement to recover focus and willpower
    How taking responsibility for someone else’s failure can actually help your team
“Peter Bregman is back, this time with an even faster way to find your focus and get back on track when life throws you off. His honesty and empathy for his own failings make Four Seconds a refreshing read.” – Daniel H. Pink, author of To Sell Is Human and Drive
“This book is priceless, a book that could change your career, your marriage, your life. I hope you get a chance to read it.” – Seth Godin, author of The Icarus Deception

33,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Jesse Krieger,28/1/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-jesse-krieger/,"
Who is Jesse Krieger and what you can learn from him:
Reading through Jesse Krieger’s story is like peeking into a world where all your dreams come true. From a successful rock star to a bestselling author, it seems like everything Krieger touches turns to gold. And while it may be tempting to read his story and think that he was born under a lucky star, there’s no reason why you can’t duplicate his success. Here are five lessons that any entrepreneur can learn from Jesse Krieger’s life.
1. What if Money Were No Object
Probably the first thing you think about whenever you get a new idea is, how much is that going to cost me? New businesses (and old businesses too, sometimes) live and die by their budget. It certainly isn’t irresponsible for you to be mindful of how much a new investment is going to cost and running some figures to see if it’s worth the money. To really kick your business into the next gear, however, Jesse Krieger suggests a different approach.
Begin by asking yourself what you would do if money were no object. Don’t be afraid to dream big here. Paint a big picture and have fun playing with the details. Solidify your ideas by putting them down on paper. And then start investigating how much it would cost to actually turn this dream into a reality. Usually, it turns out that things cost much less than we fear they will. It may not start out quite the same as that dream image, but with a little creative thinking you can get a good start at making things happen. You never know until you try.
2. Lifestyle First
Being a lifestyle entrepreneur is much more than just getting a new job. Incorporating your business into your lifestyle makes it much easier for you to manage your business without giving up any of your loves. Many people think that when they structure their business, that has to get top priority. The rest of their life gets put on hold until they have their new company up and running. But the fact is it could be years before your business really finds solid ground. That’s a long time to be tied down to one project that is eating up most of your time. 
Just like asking what you would do if money were no object, ask what your ideal life would look like. Do you want to do a lot of traveling? Do you want to see the cities of the world or would you rather explore the wilderness areas? Maybe travel isn’t your thing and you just want to settle down in a quiet country town somewhere. Determine those factors first and then build your business model around scenarios that makes that possible.
3. Structure for Scalability from Day One
If your business is a product based business, make sure it is a systems-based process. Each and every order goes through the exact same process so that once you have your system in place, it never needs to be revisited. For an online business, having a fulfillment system in place is the biggest time saver here. At the very beginning of your business, it might not seem very difficult to have a basement full of inventory that you are shipping out. As your business grows, however, you are going to have a bigger and bigger inventory to manage. Setting it up from day one so that your products are being shipped directly from the manufacturer, for instance, will make it much easier for your business to grow without becoming too much for you to handle.
For a service-based business, it’s all about having a one to many offer. One on one coaching may sound appealing, but it makes it very difficult to expand your business as you only time for so many meetings or sessions in a day. To keep up with a growing client base, you have to structure your business from the very beginning to allow you to reach multiple people at once.
4. Master Online Talent Markets
There are a lot of sites out there, such as Elance and Odesk, which allow you to place ads for jobs that you need done and receive competitive bids from skilled workers. Website design, marketing work, programming, and even administrative work can all be farmed out on these sites. 
To get great deals from these sites, divide work between designers and programmers. Splitting the project up makes it a smaller job, which means that you can pay less per job. If you send the job off to one group, they are going to want enough money to pay a team as it is unlikely that one person will be able to meet your deadline on a large job like designing and programming a website. Dividing the work can halve your cost.
5. Cultivate a Culture of Contribution
Many people go into entrepreneurship worried only about getting ahead and helping themselves. But anyone who has ever tried to start a business can tell you that it’s not a one person job. Reaching back to share your experience with those who have only just started a new business helps build a culture of contribution. The more this culture develops, the easier it is for you to find help when you need it. And remember, someone asking you for help today may be in a position to give you help tomorrow.

34,8 Resolutions For Improving Your Health And Happiness,28/1/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/8-resolutions-improving-health-happiness/,"
8 Resolutions for Improving Your Health and Happiness
When you have to work over 10 hours a day on the multiple tasks it takes to establish a business and keep one on track, the one thing many entrepreneurs tend to neglect is their own personal health and happiness. From one hard worker to another we all need to slow down a little and consider what we can do to make our lives better. Considering it’s that time of the year when everyone is making new resolutions, why not set some personal goals? 
Here is a solid list of resolutions for improving your health and happiness: 
1. SMILE AND LAUGH
Just as the brain signals your facial muscles to smile when you are happy, the flexing of these muscles sends signals to the brain that there must be a reason to smile. And it starts to feel happy. And a smile brings out the best in you. A laugh can put your life in perspective too. 
2. EXERCISE REGULARLY
An entrepreneur has to deal with high levels of stress, and regular exercise helps you reduce this. It also fights health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis. And it greatly boosts energy and aids sleep. And exercise also lifts your mood and helps you face the challenges that come your way.  
3. EAT HEALTHY
A bagel and a cup of coffee don’t exactly count as breakfast. If you don’t have time, at least have a bowl of quinoa or oats before you start your workday. And instead of munching on fries and gulping down smoothies, opt for nuts or sprouts and fresh fruits. Fat and sugar slow you down; cut down on those. 
4. DON’T SKIMP ON SLEEP
Margaret Thatcher may have done with 4 hours of sleep a day, but it isn’t the best idea for most. Make sure you get ample shuteye to make sure you feel fresh and energized for the workday. Otherwise, you will just end up as a lousy entrepreneur, and may be a cranky boss. 
5. SET SOME ME-TIME
Don’t let your work eat up your entire day. Set aside some time when you can be on your own, doing whatever you feel like. It may be catching up on your sleep, reading your favorite book, or just chatting with your mates. It will help you get a mental recharge, one you will need once you are back to being an entrepreneur. 
6. LEARN TO SAY NO
Saying yes, or even maybe, when you know in your heart that the best answer is no is a bad idea. It will mess up your life, work and relationships. Cannot deliver an order on the required date? Say no. Cannot go out with your best friend this Thursday? Say no. And you’ll see that things get much better. 
7. STAY ON TOP OF SCHEDULE
While it isn’t always easy to do it, it really is your best bet to work out your life and work. It is tempting to check your email at the beginning of the day, but if you have set your heart on working on a difficult project, stick to your routine. And while it is fun to be spontaneous at times, it is better to keep it in check. 
8. MOST IMPORTANTLY, DON’T BREAK THE RESOLUTIONS
It is easy to make big proclamations; but often it isn’t easy to keep them. Just taking them won’t do, you need to maintain them too. If you fear that you won’t be able to do it, pin the list down on a board and keep it somewhere you’ll always see it. 
Once you do it, even a busy entrepreneur such as yourself will have a happy and healthy life.

35,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Greg Reid,21/1/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-greg-reid/,"
Who is Greg Reid and what you can learn from him:
Greg Reid is the modern voice for inspiration and motivation. He is a best-selling author, a motivational speaker, and a highly acclaimed filmmaker. He has published over 45 books, despite claiming that he isn’t a writer, including Three Feet From Gold which is inspired by the original landmark seller Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. Greg Reid has learned to overcome his weaknesses to find success. Here are five important lessons that any entrepreneur can learn from his life in order to find their own success.
1. Work Your Strengths, Hire Your Weaknesses
Chances are, if you’re starting your own business you’ve already spent a bit of time figuring out what your strengths are. Be brutally honest in this process. It’s not shameful to admit that there are some things that just don’t come easily to you. Focus on the things that do fall under your natural abilities. There’s no reason for you to pay someone else good money to do something that you are perfectly capable of doing yourself.
Likewise, there’s no reason for you to spend a lot of time trying to achieve skills that you can hire out. Hire quality employees whose strengths match up with your weaknesses. People might say that birds of a feather flock together, but we’re looking for more of an opposites attract approach here. Find someone who can fill in the gaps in your skill set. Together, you’ll form an unstoppable team.
2. Don’t Quit
Perseverance is the most important quality in an entrepreneur. In the early days, there will be setbacks. There will probably be setbacks in the later days, too. Some of these might feel like catastrophic failures, but you can recover from anything that life hits you with. It’s okay to take a step back to get yourself together after an unexpected blow, but then get right back into the game.
You never know how close you are to success until you get there. Holding on just one more month, week, or even day could be the difference between closing your doors and finding the answer to your biggest problem. A new investor could be right around the corner. Hold out for him to get there.
3. Be Committed
Most people will tell you to go into a business in a field that interests you. But the fact is, being interested isn’t enough. You have to be committed. Most people have a variety of interests. Those are your hobbies. Those are the things that you do when you find yourself with some free time. That’s what you do when you’re in the mood and it sounds found. But a business isn’t a hobby, it’s a commitment. You make time for your business, which means some things are going to have to take a backseat. You take care of your business no matter what mood you’re in, even when it’s anything but fun.
Interest is what gets you to the office the first couple weeks when everything is new and exciting. Commitment is what gets you to the office an hour early to go over the books even though your kids kept you up all night. Don’t just be interested. Be committed.
4. Seek Wise Counsel
Everybody has an opinion. And most of those people will let you know that opinion, whether you asked for it or not. It’s certainly good to take advice wherever you can find it, but consider the source. Don’t let your family talk you out of your dream because they’re concerned about what it will do to you if your business doesn’t make it. Nod, smile politely, and don’t pay any attention to the know it all who’s convinced that he hold the answers to all of the universe’s questions. To run a successful business, you don’t need the opinion of everyone who walks through your door. You need sound advice from people who know what they’re talking about.
Successful people seek out counsel from experts in their field. Spend a lot of time networking. Talk to people who own businesses in the same area as you. Talk to people who own the same type of business on the other side of the world. Pick their brains for what worked and what didn’t work. As important as it is for your business to stand out, don’t feel like you need to reinvent the wheel just to be different. Listen to those who have experience in your field.
5. Turn Your Obstacles into Opportunities
No obstacle has the power to stop you. It might delay you, will certainly force you to reevaluate and perhaps change your approach, but an obstacle is not the end of the road. Keep this in mind whenever you hit a stumbling block and you will blast right through whatever is in your path. Instead of stopping at an obstacle, take this opportunity to strengthen your resolve. Remember to be committed. An obstacle is the perfect opportunity to test that committed. The interested walk away from an obstacle. The committed charge right at it.
An obstacle is also an opportunity to try new things. Maybe you’ve had a crazy idea floating around in the back of your head that you never would have tried with smooth sailing. But since you have to change your course anyways, you might as well give it a shot, right? Some of your best ideas may be inspired by spur of the moment desperation. Embrace the opportunities that obstacles present and you will find yourself on the path to success.

36,7 Morning Routines of Very Wealthy People,20/1/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-morning-routines-of-very-wealthy-people-2/,"
7 Morning Routines of Very Wealthy People
No matter if you’re an insomniac or an early-to-bed, early-riser type, we all have to start our day in a way that creates a sense of accomplishment. Morning routines are not one size fits all, we have to choose the one that works best for us. But we also desire wealth and wish to learn more from those who have been able to obtain it.
There are a wide range of options on how to start your day and the following are some that are favored by the wealthiest of people when they need a kick start. Let’s take a quick look at a few routines of very wealthy people:
1. Write Down What You Wish To Accomplish
The CEO of American Express, Kenneth Chenault, says that he makes a list at the start of every day, writing down the three things that he most wishes to accomplish in the next 24 hours. By having a list in front of you as a jumping off point, you too can make the necessary changes in your life. 
It’s easy to have a vague idea in your head of what you wish to achieve, but when you make a list, it’s much easier to visualize the accomplishment. The sense of accomplishment that you feel inside as you cross items off of your daily to do list is just an added bonus. 
2. Begin With Physical Activity
Many successful, wealthy people report that they start off their morning with brisk physical activity. This helps to wake up the brain so that they are constantly able to fire on all cylinders. Starting the day with exercise provides a person with more energy and keeps them from feeling tired throughout the day.
Vogue’s editor in chief, Anna Wintour, does not consider her day to have started until she has played an hour long tennis match. Wintour wakes up before 6 AM to do so. People who start their day with physical activity tend to be much more enthusiastic and highly motivated. 
3. Check Social Media
While some may be surprised to see one of their most prized early morning routines end up on this list, there are many wealthy, successful people who also feel the need to check Twitter and Instagram as soon as they roll out of bed in the morning. This may be a time drain for some, but for others, this practice helps them to keep their finger on the pulse.
The editor in chief of Lucky magazine states that she checks Twitter every morning and avoids watching TV as much as possible. This strategy may not work for everyone except for those who are able to self-motivate. 
4. Focus On The Customers
Craig Newmark, best known for founding Craigslist, says that he begins each day with a complete and total focus on customer service. Newmark is proof that no matter how far you rise, it is still extremely important to put the customer first. He even goes so far as to say that he thinks of himself as one of Craigslist’s customer service representatives.
In order to gain wealth and maintain it, sharpening your focus so that you can properly address any and all customer concerns is incredibly important. Otherwise, you could fall into the same habits that have derailed other CEOs.
5. Spend Time On Positive Visualization
Popular self-help guru Tony Robbins urges his acolytes to take 15 minutes at the start of each day and spend it visualizing positive occurrences in their life, even those that have not actually taken place yet. He also tells his clients that they must use the time to envision the things in their life that they are grateful for.
By doing so, a person is able to achieve greater self-certainty and increase their overall confidence. Many are skeptical of this practice, believing it to be too New Age and not grounded in reality. Those who are able to overcome their skepticism report far greater success in their day to day living. 
6. Eat Those Frogs
Mark Twain has a quote about how everyone should start their day by consuming a live frog. That way, nothing else that takes place could possibly seem any worse than that. Obviously, this is meant to be a metaphor about tackling your most difficult tasks first. Taken literally, this piece of advice could lead to a great deal of trouble.
Getting your toughest tasks out the way early clears the way so that you can enjoy the rest of your day without having to worry about taking care of it later. Whether it’s getting up early to get your workout out of the way or dealing with difficult correspondence, there is no shortage of tasks that should be handled early. Otherwise, they have the ability to hang over you and take away from your overall level of enthusiasm. 
7. Remain Informed
There is a wide range of ways to consume the news nowadays and the majority of wealthy, successful people have a way of remaining on top of all the latest information. A person does not maintain success by allowing themselves to fall out of the loop. Some may prefer to grab the local newspaper, others might leaf through the Wall Street Journal. 
However you choose to keep yourself informed about the world around you, starting the morning with a healthy dose of information is how many of the world’s best and brightest get their day going. You never know when that valuable piece of information will come along and change your entire perspective.

37,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Chris Ducker,14/1/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-chris-ducker/,"
Who is Chris Ducker and what you can learn from him:
Entrepreneurs and those planning to be one in the near future can learn some essential job outsourcing tips from outsourcing guru Chris Ducker on how they can get on top and increase profits using simple low-cost outsourcing methods. Chris is also widely known for his book, Virtual Freedom that comes highly recommended by many successful entrepreneurs.
In his book and presentations, Chris Ducker teaches business people on how they can take their online marketing efforts to the next level with the help of virtual staff. These lessons will show you how to become more successful than you possibly thought using new mediums such as video. Online video is huge, and yet still many small businesses are not utilizing the power of online video to increase brand awareness and increase profits.
The following are 5 lessons entrepreneurs can learn from Chris Ducker:
1. Brainstorm Ideas for Online Video Content with Your Virtual Staff
One major reason why small businesses shy from creating web videos is that they don’t exactly know the kind of topics to present to their audience. According to Chris Ducker, “ It’s all simple. Like blogging, you should offer solutions to problems that plague your target audience.” You can do that with video presentations.
Ducker explains that brainstorming ideas with your virtual staff to know what exactly your target audience needs help with will be your first step. He goes on to emphasize the importance listing everything as this will be your source of video content. You can even list for the future too. Organize topic ideas into groups and see if you can create a video series that grow that list. Think of the common questions you get every day and consider making a video series to answer them.
2. Have Your Virtual Staff Perform Keyword Research
In today’s evolving world, the best way of going about this is doing some keyword research. Ducker writes, “ Think about it rationally, you certainly wouldn’t go and launch a business if there wasn’t money to be made by selling your services and products, likewise there’s no need to keep creating content unless there is a real need for it.”
You can use the latest Google Adwords Keyword Planner Tool, especially if you are just starting out. This will help you know if people are visiting search engines to look for the information that you’re considering to record. Create a Google Adwords account to access this free tool.
If you’re looking to take things higher, there are also other keyword tools like Long Tail Pro and Market Samurai which do much more than give search engine volume results and cost per click. With these tools at your disposal, you can view exact statistics, check search traffic and analyze competition.
3. The Need for Graphic and Web Designers
Fiddling around with Photoshop is a critical waste of time for any entrepreneur who hasn’t yet figured out what they’re doing. Ducker writes, “We enjoy the idea of allowing our Superhero Syndrome cloud us, and end up believing that we can do everything ourselves, even graphic and web design.” He explains that we pay the right skills to do the right job, because they will do it right the first time. Doing this won’t only make it look better, but it will also give you time spend on other marketing areas or putting in-place your next info-product!
Among other things, graphic and web designers will do the following:
• Design logos, icons, eBook covers, banners and headers 
• Design infographic images 
• Design websites and create mock-ups 
• Design landing, sales and opt-in pages 
• Do basic video editing, splice intros and outros with raw footage
4. Why You’ll Need Virtual Video and Audio Editors
The use and need for virtual staff in video and audio editing is still fairly new—it only started emerging over the last couple of years. But as Chris Ducker writes “I can personally tell you that this has generated a ton of extra time for me. Without the need to edit my videos, even the most basic ones has given me more time to spend developing content instead of scratching my head over the details. I did the same for my podcasting and the end results are always sexier in appearance.”
Virtual video and audio editors will do the following:
• Basic editing of video and audio files 
• Remove background noise from video and audio
• Add intros and outros to videos 
• Do basic Photoshop and edit images 
• Setup podcasting 
• Insert podcasts on blog posts 
5. The Role of SEO and a Web Marketer
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) has drastically changed over the last couple of years. What worked before, doesn’t anymore. And likewise, what works today may not work tomorrow. If you however create captivating and solid content, you’ll be contender in the races. But what really happens after you’ve successfully promoted your online video, podcast episode or blog post through social media? The tide recedes right?
Ducker explains that having a firm SEO and Web Marketing virtual assistant will put you in a strong position for long-term and consistent traffic.

The Entrepreneurs Library presents some of the latest books for entrepreneurs in January 2014. These books are brand new to the market and the authors are in line to give a thorough deep dive of their books. Stay tuned this month for the release of the interviews with these great books and their authors.
1) Procrastinate on Purpose by Rory Vaden
Procrastinate on Purpose grew out of the Rory Vaden’s quest to see how super-achievers accomplish their work. We have all heard that time is finite, but Vaden insists that is wrong. In fact, he says, everything you have learned about time management is wrong. Of course, we all have the same hours in a day, but super-achievers invest time in tasks today that give them more time tomorrow.
In his book, Rory Vaden brings his high-energy approach and can-do spirit to the most nagging problem in our professional lives: stalled productivity. Millions are overworked, organizationally challenged, or have a motivation issue that’s holding them back. Vaden presents a simple yet powerful paradigm that will set readers free to do their best work—on time and without stress and anxiety.
“A brilliant insight turned into an actionable method. Start now!”— Seth Godin, author of Linchpin
“We all have the same 24 hours in a day to make an impact but what if you could actually create more time? Procrastinate on Purpose shows how the greatest leaders in the world have figured out how to literally multiply their time. This book is a game changer.”— Jon Gordon, bestselling author of The Energy Bus and The Carpenter

2) What More Can I Say by Dianna Booher
The world has changed and you can’t use yesterday’s communication strategies to create tomorrow’s successes. Dianna Booher is the master on this subject and this may very well be called her masterpiece. This book is timely and relevant and it teaches you how to what matters most in communication: build trust and reinforce relationships.
In her book Dianna Booher provides an essential nine-point checklist for success in the art of communication and persuasion—for building solid relationships, and for increasing credibility in the workplace. With lessons from politics, pop culture, business, family life, and current events, the book identifies common reasons that communicators fail to accomplish their goals, along with examples and analyses of messages that succeed and those that fail.
“Dianna Booher has done it again! What More Can I Say is the definitive book on the hows and whys of communicating effectively. I’ve always said leadership is an influence process—and to influence others, you have to know how to get your point across clearly. What more can I say, other than ‘Read this brilliant book!’ –– Ken Blanchard, coauthor of The One Minute Manager® and Legendary Service
“Dianna Booher may have accomplished the impossible. By following the tactics revealed in What More Can I Say?, you will communicate in a way that creates a dynamic engagement with others after which all parties walk away satisfied and smiling. Excellent work from one of today’s most important communication experts.” –– Marshall Goldsmith, author or editor of 34 books including the global bestsellers MOJO and What Got You Here Won’t Get You There

3) Fairness is Overrated by Tim Stevens

Short, powerful chapters end with actionable discussion questions. Four pillars hold up every successful leader: Be a person of integrity. Identify the right people around you. Build a great culture. Lead through crisis.
Stevens knows that creating a healthy and successful organization requires throwing out the conventional instruction manual and writing one that balances practical lessons, spiritual truths, and twenty-first century realities—exactly what you will find in Fairness Is Overrated. This is a manual of doing, not talking. No fluff, no stale inspirational platitudes. It’s time to move past planning and kick-start Monday into action.
Each chapter packs a punch with many practical lessons learned, deep truths, and actionable next steps for yourself, teams and organizations. These 52 unique chapters are spread nicely across four distinct focus areas: Be a person of integrity; Identify the right people around you; Build a great culture; and Lead through crisis.

40,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From David Allen,5/1/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-david-allen/,"
Who is David Allen and what you can learn from him:
David Allen claims that he has had 35 professions by the age of 35. These include: a waiter, magician, travel agent, vitamin distributor, gas station manager, karate teacher and another 30 more.
Obviously he didn’t succeed or master all of these professions. Nonetheless today he’s one of the world’s most renowned productivity experts and his book Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity has sold well more than 600,000 copies globally.
Besides being an author, David Allen is also a successful businessman who consults Fortune 500 companies. In the online arena, he’s known as the “The Godfather of Productivity.”
What entrepreneurship lessons can be learned from David Allen?
Don’t settle for one role in life
A lesson from one failed endeavor can be transferred to the next
According to Allen, “Anxiety results from a lack of organization, preparation, control and action.”
Here are five thought-provoking lessons that entrepreneurs can learn from him and his book.
1. Take the Bottom-Up Approach
David Allen writes that it makes intellectual sense to start your business mission on a high note, but if your daily tasks are distracting, you may end up failing to focus on the bigger picture. Taking care of your inbox first and gaining full control of that will free up your mind to think bigger. If your home is what you are talking about, the equivalent of your in-box may be the laundry room calamity, the mail that piles up or the clutter which gets in the way of your bigger plans for your family and household.
2. Foresake the Daily To-Do-List
David Allen mentions that in the face organizational, it will benefit you to do away with the list making habit, although he swears by it. Rather, he recommends having a calendar that is kept free of miscellanea with the following types of listings:
Time sensitive actions – these include appointments and other things that have a set time and date to it.
Day-sensitive actions—these include tasks and appointments that don’t have a specified time on the date like deadline to register for camp or school picture day and so on.
Day-sensitive information—this may include directions and your appoint location or event details.
Eliminating your daily list will give you ample time and flexibility to attend to more urgent things, and better yet you won’t feel bad for not striking some items off the list and moving them to the next day.
3. Design a Rapid Fire Filing System
In his book, Allen writes that your filing system should be simple and easy to navigate through such that if you need to file something, you can pick it from your mail stack or email print and place it in the proper file within a minute. He further on explains that if your filing system is easy, fun and current, you will procrastinate and make the clutter worse.
He recommends having an A to Z filing system which will reduce search time, and must be within arm’s reach. He also states when your filing system reaches ¾ full, shred or recycle what’s outdated and consider digitalizing some.
4. Four Prong Method To Figure Out What to Do
Whether you are stay a at home mom, self-employed, retired or in the workforce, there are certain things you must do. Allen proposes a four criterion analysis to determine what you should do with your time.
Context—can you complete a task where you are? If the case, focus on another criteria. Of not, then move a different potential task.
Time available—can you complete a task within a set time? It’s better to complete two shorter tasks in 10 minutes than leave a longer one incomplete.

Energy available—consider your physical and mental energy. Analytical and creative tasks require a clear, focus mind while physical tasks require a more energetic approach.
Priority—if your tasks fit the above criteria, go for one that ensures the highest returns in terms personal or work productivity.
5. Saying “No” to More Things and More Often
Although this little nugget is buried deep in Allen’s book, it is however possibly one of the best pieces of advice. He explains our tendency to become overbooked for both our personal and work lives. He writes, “You will have to say no to more things and more often to stay comfortable and afloat.”
For this he recommends a section called ‘The Weekly Review’ where you put aside an hour or two to reflect on what you did the past week, what needs to be done the following week and if there’s anything that went by without being attended to. The review will help you view how you managed to commit yourself to different tasks and what you can do about your level of commitment in the future.
To conclude, would-be entrepreneurs can employ some of these tips if not all to ensure productivity and efficiency which will eventually lead to quicker project completion times and higher revenue.

41,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Chris Brogan,2/1/2015,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-chris-brogan/,"
Who is Chris Brogan and what you can learn from him:
As an American author, marketing specialist, business owner and motivational speaker, Chris Brogan helps others to learn how to run a business. This is especially helpful to entrepreneurs and small business owners. He does this by giving lectures, writing books and also by having classes for groups of people desirous of succeeding in their business. 
He has developed a combination of business strategy and professional leadership; he works with others to own their life, their choices and their business future. By providing the education and tools necessary, he can teach a person how to make their own business thrive and succeed in today’s world. There are also times that he provides personal coaching, but this is very limited. 
There are more than five basic lessons that Chris Brogan educates about in order to be a successful leader and business owner. These lessons may seem quite basic to most people, but with the understanding will come successful ventures in life and business.
Some of these lessons include the following, with short explanations to each. The best way to learn and hear the complete explanation is to attend one of Chris Brogan’s seminars or courses and reach his award winning books.
1)	When you own a small business, you are the brand.
 You want a profile, an outstanding picture and you want to stand out more than anyone else. How you do this is simple. You are the brand, be the best you are and can be. You are who people see when they go to your business, who they think of. You want your picture to be the one that people say ‘Wow” to or about. At this point, you do not want a casual picture showing that you know how to relax and just socialize. You want others to see the business side, the cleaned up aspect, the business minded individual, and the intelligent side of you. Customers and people in general will relate to you better when they believe that you know what you are doing, that you look like you know what you are doing. 
2)	Stand out above all others.
 When you are a small business owner or entrepreneur, you need to be known. What better way of doing this, than to put yourself in the midst of everyone. Stop by as many locations as possible on your way home each day. Introduce yourself, be there if only for thirty seconds. When people see you, and hear you, they remember that you are there. You need to make yourself a Unique Value Proposition. This basically means that you need to create yourself in public, be the person that everyone remembers seeing. So make those extra stops on the way home each day, just to say hello and introduce you to them.
3)	Have a conversation.
 This does not mean that you need to stop at each business and strike up a full-fledged conversation with every person you meet. In today’s world there are so many opportunities to speak with people it is uncanny. The social networking sites and applications like Twitter make this easy for us all. Connect with people in every way possible. Most of these can be done when at home relaxing in the evening also, or riding the bus. The point is to connect with others. The more you connect with, the greater people’s knowledge is of you. Do not just lecture and give advice, have conversations, ask questions. That is one of the simplest ideas, but seems to be so complicated for so many.
4)	Turn your passion into a business.
 Easier said than done right? Wrong. If it is your passion, you are an expert at it. Do what you know best and jump in. When work is not just mundane habits on a daily basis, it is fun, it is enjoyable and it is more than worth doing. Your passion and commitment to doing what you enjoy is what keeps you going daily, therefore your business must be something you enjoy also. Focus on the mission ahead, daily. Surround yourself with like-minded individuals, and those who see the same vision. These people will help you to succeed, not drive you into ruin. Follow the passion and it will surely follow you through the hard times and the best of times.
5)	Be an employeepreneur.
 Not really a word is it? Make it your word! Do not be the business owner who sits at the desk telling everyone how to do things. Get out there in the business and show them how it is done. The best way to be a leader is to lead by example. When you, as the owner, understand what has to be done and how it has to be done, it is easier to explain this. However, it is even easier to show the employees that you are not afraid to get out there and do the work too. This sets a standard for others, proves to them that you have the knowledge and the desire. Being an employee and the boss, helps you to work your ambitions and desires, but it also shows others your commitment to the goal. Follow the goal, achieve the goal.

42,5 Most Popular Types of Startup Companies from 2014,29/12/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-popular-types-startup-companies-2014/,"
Unlike Google, not all businesses start their humble journey from their garages. You will find some types of startup companies operating from brick and mortar stores whereas some others maybe working from startup incubator centers. 
Thanks to the massive development in the field of technology, we are surrounded by many different forms and types of startup companies that are consciously or unconsciously changing our perception of how a startup should work. 
As we move into the new year, let us recap some of the most popular types of startup companies from 2014 – 
1) SMALL BUSINESS STARTUPS
It is a fact that the vast majority of startups are still the same old small businesses. Travel agents, plumber, electricians, carpenters, storefronts, consultants etc are some of the types of startups that fall under this category. It is a fact that these types of small businesses struggle to hog the limelight of the popular media but the truth is that these small business owners work as hard as any other startups in the Silicon Valley. The good thing about these small business startups is that they mostly hire local talents and thereby contribute to the local economy. The purpose of these startups is to earn enough money to feed their families. Small business entrepreneurs rarely make it to the magazine cover but they do play a prominent role in the economic development of the country. 
2) LIFESTYLE STARTUPS
We are now seeing an increasing number of startup companies who are blurring the line between passion and profession. For example, people, who are passionate about drawing, are launching Animation startup companies as it gives them the perfect opportunity to do what they do best. People who have some level of expertise in sky jumping are now offering sky jumping training as well; this is another form of lifestyle startup. Lifestyle Startup is all about pursuing ones passion and finding a way to earn money through it. 
3) BUYABLE STARTUPS
The cost of designing and developing a mobile based or web based app has plummeted massively and this has given birth to the new breed of Startup Company known as buyable startup. Some of these startup companies are not even looking for traditional Venture Capitalists rather they are trying to raise money for their startups by opting for angle finding or crowd funding. However, this type of startup is generally sold to a third party after some time in return of a handsome amount of profit. This type of startup is gaining traction and is most likely to become more popular in coming years. 
4) SOCIAL STARTUPS
Unlike other types of startups, social startups are not driven by profit rather they are driven by a powerful cause. Just because social entrepreneurs are fighting for a cause it does not mean that they are any less passionate about success or adverse to the idea of making profit. Unlike traditional startup companies, the goal of most social startups is to make the world a better place. However, there are some social startups who are into wealth creation as well. 
5) SCALABLE STARTUPS
Scalable Startups are vastly different from small business startups despite the fact that they too have very humble beginnings. Unlike small business startups, scalable startups aim high. They believe that their ideas can change the world and the perfect examples are Facebook, Twitter, Skype and their likes. Scalable Startup revolves around a simple but powerful concept and they always look for financial investors to raise capital for their dream idea.

43,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Brandon Epstein,24/12/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-brandon-epstein/,"
Who is Brandon Epstein and what you can learn from him:
Brandon Epstein is a full-time entrepreneur, fitness model, and is the coach and founder of Entrepreneur Fitness. These days, he spends his time teaching other entrepreneurs how to be the best versions of themselves. Most notably Brandon is also the author of “Limitless Energy” and has been successful when it comes to showing people how to have more energy and achieve a higher level of health.
There are five lessons every entrepreneur can learn from Brandon Epstein.
1. Make Time for Exercise
Everyone needs to make time for exercise, no matter how busy they may be. Too many people complain that they don’t have enough time or that they are too tired. Brandon Epstein has heard all of the excuses that are out there and he wants to make sure everyone is well aware of one thing: exercise provides more energy. When there is cardiovascular activities performed, it unlocks the physiology and provides a burst of energy that can be needed to get a person through the rest of the day.
The exercise can be first thing in the morning or in the middle of the day. Often, waking up one hour earlier can be the best way to start off the day – and it will provide more energy to work the long hours that entrepreneurs must often work.
2. Learn the Healthy Foods to Eat
Entrepreneurs will often have power lunches where there is a lot of brainstorming. Connections are made over meals and this is a great way to meet people and close business transactions. What a person orders matters. There are healthy foods, whether they are being cooked in the kitchen or ordered at a restaurant. Learning about the foods that boost energy and don’t cause an energy depletion are critical.
It’s important to know about the starches and how to create a balanced meal. There are a lot of foods that have hidden starches, such as corn and peas. Many people think they are doing right by eating the vegetables, but they are really consuming extra starch. A good rule of thumb is to add color to the plate and this can be done with some leafy vegetables like spinach or kale.
3. Meditation Is Great for Entrepreneurs
Meditation is not just for the “New Age” people or the hippies. Brandon Epstein learned about meditation many years ago and it has helped to shift his mindset and release stress. When the body and mind is less stressed, the body uses less energy and there is a more personalized state of flow – one that works specifically for the individual.
There are visual and audio cues that can be used for meditation and it is of the utmost importance to take the time to meditate throughout the day. This can be as a way of establishing a mental center when everything is chaotic. Sometimes it is just about making the time to close the door, close the eyes, and focus on what’s going on. The deeper a person goes, the more it can help to heal the body, mind, and spirit.
4. Energy is Limitless
An important lesson that every entrepreneur needs to learn is that energy is limitless. There are too many business professionals that walk around sipping coffee and performing like zombies because they have allowed their energy levels to get dangerously low – and this is not only bad for productivity but bad for one’s health as well.
Energy is limitless and there’s a Zen-like approach known as Zentivate that allows individuals to tap into all of the stored energy more effectively. This will lead to more synchronization and a boost in one’s spirit. It’s a combination of exercise, eating right, getting enough sleep, meditating, and simply being in tune with one’s body. It’s an easy concept to grasp as soon as one learns what is involved.
5. Envision the Change
Vision boards have grown in popularity because they allow people to envision the change they want to see in their lives. Such tools are not foreign to Brandon Epstein. He envisions the changes he wants to see in his life and this allows him to pursue them more effectively. This is one of the lessons that entrepreneurs can learn from him. The only way to create change is to see it – and many people need to have a clear path to figure out how to make this happen.
The change that one envisions can take on many shapes. It can include how a person wants a sexier body, more clients, a more refined sales approach, better networking skills, or anything else. Change can also occur across the board in multiple categories. 
Entrepreneurial coaching allows people to become the best versions of themselves. Brandon Epstein is available for coaching, where people learn how to transform their body, mind, and ultimately their life in order to succeed in all areas.

44,10 Last Minute Holiday Gifts To Buy An Entrepreneur,22/12/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/10-last-minute-holiday-gifts-buy-entrepreneur/,"
Gift shopping isn’t easy; you have to think of something unique and yet something that will be useful too. And when it comes to gifting to entrepreneurs, the problem just doubles. What do you give someone who stays busy all the time? What do you give them that matters the most? 
Well, it can be a real head-scratcher! But here’s a little help. Here are some of the top last-minute holiday gifts that suits every entrepreneur, be it a new one just setting up their venture or someone who has been there, done that!
For the always-into-business type:
What could be a better gift than a subscription that helps with the business? Online backup from Carbonite, office supplies from Office Depot or a subscription to LivePlan – every one of these ideas will be well-loved. 
For the always-on-the-go type:
The ChargeAll portable power outlet will never let you down; be it your laptop, Smartphone or your stereo, this little portable power pack is exactly what any entrepreneur needs to stay on the go. A Coffee Cup Power Inverter is another good choice. 
For the coffee-aholics:
Is it coffee that makes your entrepreneur friend going? Well, a subscription to Philz Coffee (Mark Zuckerberg recommends it) or a gift card from Starbucks may be the ideal thing to give them this holiday. 
For the health conscious entrepreneur:
One gift that every fitness freak will love is the FitBit Aria! Just get on the scale, and it will send the details such as weight, BMI and fat percentage to the app. It can remember data for up to 8 individuals. And the best part, it rewards with digital badges and awards once you achieve your health goal. 
For the music-loving one:
A Prizm smart music player can be an ideal gift. This little pyramid brings the best tunes to suit the individual and the ambience. It quickly learns what type of music you love, and also understands what kind of music to play in a specific environment. 9mm Earphones from Munitio is also a good choice. 
For the hip-n-cool type:
Two great choices are available – Smart Watch from Android and Hero4 Black Camera from GoPro. While the watch will be a good one for any entrepreneur, the camera will be best for one that enjoys all the outdoorsy stuff. 
For the absent-minded geniuses:
Tile – your forgetful friend will never lose even their keys with this gift! Just attach it to the key ring or stick it to the USB and the Bluetooth will help you track it down from your Smartphone or tablet. It will be able to track 8 things at once, so your friend needn’t bother about losing any little thing anymore. 
For the fun-loving entrepreneur:
A gadget to help you mix a great cocktail – sure sounds like fun! Perfect Drink does just that. Just choose a recipe for what you wish to create, place a glass on the scale and it will guide you about what and how much to add. Tipped something more than needed? No worries; the recipe will adjust to suit it!
For the stylish organizer:
Not every entrepreneur’s desk is a mess! If your friend is an organizer, and a chic one, the Pfeiffer Collection by Evernote is a cool choice. The sleek minimalist stands add a touch of elegance to the desk. And if you want something that is a tad more useful too, opt for the wireless printer from Canon. 
For the book-loving type:
Book lovers are a little hard to shop for during the holidays. You can’t really buy them their favorite book because they most likely own it already. To make a book lover happy on Christmas you must get a little more creative with your gift selection such as a handy FingerPrint Bookmark. Or a thumb ring page holder on Etsy. For the technologically advanced how about a Kindle Fire HD from Amazon? As always, if you are looking for a quality book that your entrepreneur might not have read yet, check out the latest book previews we have released.
Well what are you waiting for? Get out there and get your shop on! These are just a few last-minute holiday gifts to buy for an entrepreneur, but either way I’m sure whatever you by your favorite entrepreneur for the Holidays will be much appreciated even if it’s another overly used motivational quote from Tony Robbins or Tim Ferriss. From everyone at The EL, we wish you a safe and Happy Holidays!

45,5 Characteristics of A Great Leader,17/12/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-characteristics-of-a-great-leader/,"
What are the characteristics of a great leader?
Exceptional leaders should have exceptional qualities because ordinary traits are not going to help them achieve greatness in one way or the other. You can easily find many competent leaders, but only few of them eventually qualify as exceptional leaders. Of course, there are leaders who seem to have great ideas, but when you ask them to execute them in real life, they fail miserably. One might look like a great leader in ordinary circumstances, but once you get them out of their comfort zone, you will get to see who they really are. When the going gets tough, when the money is tight or the stakes are high, it is only the great leaders that live up to the expectation; ordinary people just quit it.  
So, if you want to separate great leaders from ordinary leaders, you need to have a detailed understanding of the qualities that a great leader possesses. 
GREAT COMMUNICATION
Sometimes, it just happens that we have great ideas in our head, but when we try to communicate those ideas to the people who are going to implement them, we face the inconvenient truth that they are not getting it. Most leaders met with a blank expression from people when they try to communicate their ideas.
The ideas may seem great on paper, but making people act on it depends much on how you are communicating it. So, if you wish to be a great leader, you need to have great communication skill. There is no way around it. 
How on earth the team is going to achieve its goal if the leader fails to communicate his ideas in plain and simple English.  
GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR
A great leader should encourage fun at workplace because nobody wants to work in a dull and boring environment. It is important to keep your head high even when things are going wrong. There will be times when things will go horribly wrong like the funds may run dry, the client may stop responding or the company may incur heavy loss; but you need to take them as challenges without pressing the panic button.
As a leader, you have to accept the challenges as they come along; try to use humor to inspire other people to face the challenges. People make mistakes, but rather than crying a river over those mistakes, you need to face them with a smile in your face. This will create a positive vibe in the workplace and all you have to do is to encourage it. 
HONESTY
Honesty is certainly one of the main characteristics of a great leader. Since everybody around you follows your order blindly, you need to be honest and straightforward. A leader needs to accept his faults if there are any; blaming others for your fault can demoralize people working with your team. Moreover, you will lose all the love and respect of employees working with your team. You should not do anything that can make people doubt your integrity. 
COMMITMENT
If you want every member of your team to work really hard, you need to set an example first. Preach what you practice. You simply can’t expect people, working under you, to arrive at the office early if you are a late comer on a regular basis. There is nothing in the world that motivates the workers than seeing their leader working hard alongside. By showing your commitment towards the company, you will be able to earn the respect of the team members and also will be able to encourage them to deliver their best. 
CREATIVITY
Sometimes, you will have  to deal with problems that demand a different kind of solution. No, not the usual approach is not going to help here anymore. You will need to take some drastically different decisions to deal with those problems. This is exactly where the importance of creative decision making comes into play. A great leader needs to think outside the box, otherwise he will never be able to offer cool and creative solutions to complex problems.

46,5 Lessons Every Entrepreneur Can Learn From Simon Sinek,15/12/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-every-entrepreneur-can-learn-simon-sinek/,"
Who is Simon Sinek and what can entrepreneurs learn from him?
Simon Sinek is one of the nation’s top motivational speakers. He is also the author of two popular books, Start With Why and Leaders Eat Last, and is very active in the world of non-profit ventures. Most notably Simon Sinek is a TED speaker where he motivates others in regards to leadership and is also a professor at Columbia University.
His books pertain to teaching leaders how they can motivate others to inspiration. Innovation is about building the future, but not just building it. It is also about solving the problems that are in the present. Simon Sinek helps us to learn this. The main gist of the leadership courses is to teach leaders how to inspire and take action. Mr. Sinek also has a 30-minute course available that teaches the art of these subjects. There are many ideas that one can take from the books and courses he gives. Some of these are listed here with brief explanations. 
1. When entering a locale, do not speak out of nerves when you enter.
 When people enter on a stage or in a room and start speaking immediately, it is most often done out of fear, or insecurity. Rather, walk in quietly, gather your thoughts and take a deep breath before beginning. This will show your group or audience that you are confident and in charge. 
2. Do not be a taker, be a giver instead.
 Most people will lose interest when they feel they are being sold on something. When they lose interest, you lose. When you give people something of value, you gain their attention. When you have their attention, teach them something unique, something valuable and something that will inspire them. The audience gives a gift of thanks when they applaud for you, give them the thanks they deserve by thanking them first.
3. Although, most often you as a speaker are on a stage, find a way to make eye contact.
 Eye contact is key to trust and understanding. Spanning the audience visually is obvious to that audience. Take the time to look each person in the eyes, or as many as possible. By doing so, you will see a look of confusion, or the look of understanding. Either way, you play off that. If further explanation is needed, do so. If not, move on. When giving a speech or a lecture, speak slowly and enunciate each word. This will give your audience members a clear understanding and clear communication builds trust and value. When a person is nervous, their speech pattern picks up and you speak faster, the faster your heart races. When you speak slowly, you capture the attention of your audience.
4. Turn nervousness into excitement.
 Telling yourself that you are excited, and not nervous this will build that excitement higher, in turn transferring that excitement to your audience. When you are a great leader you inspire greatness in others. By being the leader that others look to, you build value in the company and the employees. When you articulate everything about why you do what you do, will you succeed at inspiring others to do what they do.
5. Your passion will diminish if you allow it to.
 Keep the motivation and inspiration happening. Beginning with why will teach all what it is. A person needs to set goals in all areas of their lives, not just in business. These goals should include discipline, clarity and consistency in all areas. No action should be changed even one time for any reason. A good leader will lead by example and listen to his followers. Give some service to those who serve your purpose.
All successful leaders know that there is a method to what they do and how they do these things. They teach, they listen, they follow and they believe with all their being that the business is right and it is successful. They are willing to do what it takes, while setting the limits on themselves to prevent over-doing many things. Good leaders make their followers feel safe and secure. 
Begin with innovation. Innovation is not just the dream of a person; it is the action one takes to achieve the dream and the goals. In order to achieve the future, one must solve the problems of the present. One must figure out another way to achieve success if the original idea does not work or function as intended. 
Simon Sinek teaches his attendees that leaders must be grateful for his followers. They must give back, which is innovation in its purest form. When you have the positive in your speeches, in your actions, you will also have the ones that do not believe, that do not understand. In order to stay confident, focus on the positive reactions. The people who are shaking their heads in the affirmative, who nod in agreement and who are visibly engaged, these are the ones who want to succeed.

47,5 Lessons Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Peter Thiel,10/12/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-lessons-entrepreneurs-can-learn-peter-thiel/,"
Who is Peter Thiel? What success lessons can every entrepreneur can learn from him?
Starting any business is time consuming and lengthy, but doing it right from the beginning is a lesson no one ever really learns. There is no formula for “doing it right” and there is no “right answer” to every question. The really successful business owners everyone wants to be like are the ones who work maybe one day a year and the rest of the time is theirs to do with as they wish. The best way to get to that place is to listen to these successful business owners and learn from what they have done.
One such business man is Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and investor in Facebook. His book Zero to One has been a smash hit and has a great amount of knowledge to share with readers. After learning more about Peter Thiel from Blake Masters, there are five really great and simple ideas found in their book. As a matter of fact these ideas are so simple one generally over looks them expecting some profound and life altering concept to pop out at them in the next chapter. 
Five success lessons every entrepreneur can learn from Peter Thiel for beginning to lay the ground work for a new business followed with a basic definition of each: 
1. Don’t try to recreate Google, it is already there.
Basically think outside the box. There are plenty of search engines and email accounts go for something different. Be unique in the search for your industry brain storm. Replicating other people’s ideas just causes market saturation, which drives down demand and then ultimately causes business to begin the downward spiral of the toilet. This is why, in Peter Thiel’s opinion, businesses fail. Make the business of your dreams truly unique and you can never fail. 
2. Be original.
Sounds the same as above but is completely different. One can be original and still be in the same market as the coffee shop next door. Bring something truly different to the table though. A personality is a nice place to start. Ever notice that the large chain coffee shops have barristers with personality and great attitudes? Yeah they do! Well that was a niche filled right there. Find the niche that needs filling and make a good fit. Make the originality seep from every pore of the business, play to your strengths and make sure that no one else has ever done it before.
3. Do everything you can to become a Monopoly.
That dreaded “M” word should not be dreaded. Monopoly +unique ideas=Money. That is truly what everyone is after in the business world money. It is what makes the world go round, and what pays the bills by the way. Answer some difficult question in the world, cater to some need which has been over looked too long and then run with it. Don’t open a restaurant in a city with six already you are not going to succeed. Don’t open a restaurant at all. Find a unique problem to solve in that town, find the answer to a question no one can answer open that instead. Work the business to grow quickly and be sustainable. This should be easy because you will be the only on in the market, right. So make it everything it should be from the beginning and success is just around the corner for you. OK so the plan you have isn’t very good and well you have no idea how it will work out and there are a ton of other excuses you can come up with. OK, quite but before you do tell someone else about the plan. They can do it then. Mr. Thiel believes that a bad plan is better than no plan, because a bad plan can be changed and evolve with the idea, no plan is instant death. Run with the bad plan until a better one shows itself. Then run with it. You are making a Monopoly; no one said it was going to be easy.
4. Work on something no one else understands or is working on.
So no one understands what you are doing and no one else has ever worked on it before, awesome! That is the plan you want then. Back to number three for a moment, if no one else gets it then you are truly creating a Monopoly everyone will want in on in the future. Work it and take it to the next level. Create a plan good, bad, or otherwise and roll with it. Make it your baby and make it something that you can hang on to forever. Pass it down to children, grandchildren whichever but make it sustainable. 
5. Remember the future.
Always remember the future. Well isn’t that supposed to be” remember the past”? Sure if you want to fail. If you want to succeed remember the future. The future is what you are planning for; the future is what you should be looking too. Don’t spend too much time of the short term plan. Look at your long term goals 1 year, 5 years, 10 years and so forth.
Following these five rules can save a lot of time and headaches. Remember your goal is to work one day a year, this is only possible by listening to those who already do that.

49,5 Things to Look For In Great Book Reviews,3/12/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-things-to-look-for-in-great-book-reviews/,"
5 Things to Look For In Great Book Reviews
What makes a great book review? Well, for starters, it needs to be written by someone who has actually read and understood the book! But how do you know that? Be it a work of fiction or non-fiction, great book reviews will have certain characteristics. 
Here are 5 of the best things to look for in great book reviews:
1. It offers a gist of the book. What is the book about? Is it a love story between a vampire and a werewolf? Or, is it a detailed analysis of the missing link? It is essential that a review gives a summary of what the book is about. 
The review also needs to offer certain details – such as the main characters if it is a novel or the basic premise if it is a scientific treatise. For a fiction, it doesn’t mean it reveals the plot twists or the end – that will spoil it for the other readers! 
2. It offers a detailed analysis of the positives and the negatives. A book review is subjective; its nature makes it so. And to illustrate this, it needs to have the details of what the reviewer liked and disliked about the book in question. 
Whether it is something to do with the format or layout or some other technical issue or it is about the content or the language, a good review will be an in-depth study of what works and what doesn’t to add to the reader’s experience. 
3. It offers a comment on the author’s perspective. When an author writes about something, he/she does so with a specific point of view. It isn’t necessary for the reviewer to agree to it. But it is necessary for them to acknowledge this unique perspective. 
You may agree with the author’s perspective, or you may not, but you have to throw in a word about it (and may be why you agree or disagree with it) in the review. This comment needs to reflect the reviewer’s point of view. 
4. It offers a few of the interesting quotes from the book. Some lines always stand out from the rest. Some go on to become famous and stay on forever while others fade away. A review needs to mention at least a few of these standout lines from the book. 
“Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ’em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.” – This quote from To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee has stayed on forever. Imagine how a review will feel if it missed to mention this one. It will be incomplete. 
5. It offers an observation on what to expect from it. Who is it aimed at? What can you expect from it? Will it do to read it alone or do you need to read its prequels or sequels too? A great review will answer all of these questions and more. 
May be it will all be at the end of the review where the reviewer mentions that it is meant for young readers who wish for a happy story or for older readers who pine for a serious read. And whether it needs associated materials to be read too! 
Great book reviews are ones that urge you to read an amazing book; and enjoy it too!

50,10 Bad Habits That Successful People Avoid,1/12/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/10-bad-habits-that-successful-people-avoid/,"
10 Bad Habits That Successful People Avoid
We all know those successful people in our lives. Our bosses, our friends, or even clients who come in, they are all successful and you may wonder how they do it. You know they must be hard working, determined and goal oriented to have made it to where they are today. These are all traits that we can admire and look up, and hopefully take a lesson from. There are a lot of bad habits that get us off on the wrong track and away from success, but successful people know what bad habits to avoid and deter from so they stay on the path to success!
In order to be very successful here is a look at some bad habits that successful people avoid:
1. Waiting for opportunity
One of the worst habits that people have is waiting for success to land in your lap or looking for quick and easy schemes that never really work. Successful people know that you have to work hard for what you get, and you have to work even harder when you have a goal in mind. Waiting for opportunity to arise causes you to often lose sight of the end goal, and can often leave you questioning your choices when other opportunities have passed you by while you waited for one to land in your lap. Don’t sit around and wait, get up and go get it!
2. Letting other people get in the way
Not setting priorities or setting yours below someone else’s is one of the worst habits that successful people will avoid. They don’t let someone else’s set priorities interfere with their own. Successful people know what matters to them (promotions, projects, financial plans, goals) and they know that by letting other people’s priorities (be it values, promotions, etc.) get in their way, they are setting themselves up to fail. Of course, they know that giving a help hand isn’t a bad thing, but they don’t let anyone else’s pace slow them down!
3. Reluctant to change
One of the biggest downfalls of success that prosperous people avoid is resistance to change. The way the world grows and the technology in it and the process by which people get things done, it is always changing. Those who resist that change are often doomed to failure or to falling behind. Successful people know that change is a good thing and the growth potential that comes with it is huge! By allowing change to happen, grasping it and moving forward with it, you are advancing yourself and your goals.
4. Afraid to speak up
Successful people are those who are not powerless. They are strong-willed, willing to stand for what is right, and aren’t afraid to speak up with their opinions. By letting others dictate the way things go, you are not being successful. However, by giving good input, dictating the way you want things to go, and giving and articulate strong point of view, you are showing others a new way of seeing or doing something, and that is huge potential for your success. 
5. Thinking negatively
Those who are successful are not pessimists who see the worst in the world. They take the world (and the people, places, and situations in it), see it for what it is, and set out on a path to make it better. They find the good in situations and if there is none, they create it. They push forward in tough times, showing that there is strength in leadership. A good outlook and a strong sense of willpower and well-being will set you on the right path to success and often will make others follow.
6. Being jealous
Being jealous of others successes will only hold you back in the long run. Being jealous often leads to endless self-doubt, questioning many decisions, and often making you stray from the successful path. Successful people are happy that others are succeeding and will praise them. They will listen to others successes in hopes that they can learn something new that will further their own achievements and get them closer to their goals. Being glad for someone else’s achievements eases the mind and heart, giving you an overall feeling of well-being, which will boost your internal go getter side!
7. Creating gossip
Those who are on the path to success do not talk down about others or gossip. Not only does gossiping lead to lies, mistruths, and twisted versions of things that have happened, but it makes you look less successful. To stand on the rumors of someone else makes you appear to be climbing the backs of those around you just so you get to the top. Successful people don’t gossip, they praise the works of others and give good impressions of others characters.
8. No planning or goal setting
Those who are successful have goals in mind. They know what they want and have made a plan to get there (and maybe have even made a few back up plans in case something doesn’t work out with their initial plan). They realize that there are no wrong turns, just more opportunities to learn something new, to see things in a different light, and to push yourself to get to that goal when things do get tough. Those who want it, will get it!
9. Being cocky 
One of the best qualities about a successful person is their humility. They don’t tout their successes from the rooftops or make others feel beneath them because they haven’t reached the same success. Those with humility will appreciate the gratitude, but will also share in the success. Those who have succeeded will rejoice with others and thank them for their help in assisting the successful person of making their goals happen. It always takes more than one person to reach your goals, no matter how independent you are.
10. Calling it quits
When success has been reached, successful people don’t just stop trying. They don’t say, I have made it and have nothing more to do! No, they take the day for what it is, and then wake up anew with a fresh goal in mind. They don’t stop, they don’t pass by new opportunities. They know the keys to success and how to reach those steps and goals. With a path and goal in mind, and a determination in your heart and mind, you can be as successful as you want to be!

51,7 Signs That You Have What It Takes To Be An Entrepreneur,24/11/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/what-it-takes-to-be-an-entrepreneur/,"
Do you have what it takes to be an entrepreneur?
Realizing the answer to this question is often a difficult task. And often, it takes a series of hurdles for you to identify this trait in your personality. But how do you know whether it is right for you to quit your day job and start on a venture of your own? Well, there is no easy answer to this. 
The good thing is that most entrepreneurs share certain characteristics. If you can identify with these, chances are high that you may have that entrepreneurial spirit in you. But don’t despair if you don’t fit them all. 
Let’s take a look at some ways to tell if you have what it takes to be an entrepreneur:
You have a passion to do something. Passion for what they do is what drives the successful entrepreneurs. Edison tried and failed 10,000 times before he could design the light bulb. We may have had to do with candles still if he had given up. But he had the passion that drove him to success. Do you have the same? 
You have a seriously poor employment history. Have you quit more jobs than you can remember? Not because you were not good but because you felt you were stuck – maybe even at the top when even success gets stale. If so, the next best thing is to start on an endeavor of your own where you can effectively and efficiently manage yourself.

You have the nerve to take risks. Fred Smith nearly failed his business management course when he developed a business model that focused on express delivery service. But this did not deter him from putting his thoughts into action. And FedEx was born. All entrepreneurs aren’t overnight successes. But they have the courage to follow their dreams. 
You think outside the box. When the worst financial crisis hits the world, many entrepreneurs cowered in front of it. But Sarah Lavely saw an opportunity. She offered people the opportunity to vent out their frustration and relieve stress in an amazing way – throwing stuff at a wall after you buy it. 
You have a broader perspective of security. For some, a secured job is a good enough thing. For others, there is no security at a job that depends on others. You never know when a silly or spiteful decision of a boss or a mess-up of the board of directors will screw it. For such souls, security is only in a job where you yourself are responsible for everything. 
You have the determination to get back on your feet even after a bad fall. If you mope after every little failure, it’s best to avoid entrepreneurship. Successful entrepreneurs get back on their feet immediately after they face failure. Take Bill Gates for example – his initial Traf-O-Data was a super failure. But he moved on and became a success. 
You have the support of people close to you. No entrepreneur is a success on his/her own. They need the support of their family and friends to make it through the tough times – and there sure are enough of those! Also, successful entrepreneurs never surround themselves with “yes-men”; instead, they depend on truthful advisors who can tell all at their face. 
It doesn’t take a superhuman to succeed in business. But it does require the right traits to be happy and successful at it. 
If you fit all these seven signs, then you have the most of what it takes to be an entrepreneur. If you don’t, no worries! There are no sure formulas to success and you may turn out to be an amazing entrepreneur even if you had a successful career as an employee. In the end passion and motivation are the key aggregators of a true entrepreneur.

52,5 Personal Wealth Management Tips For Financial Stability,12/11/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-personal-wealth-management-tips-financial-stability/,"
5 Personal Wealth Management Tips For Financial Stability
Many dream of having a big house, a luxury car, and a gorgeous lifestyle. And they think that hard work and sincerity can help them achieve their dream. What they fail to realize is that even with all the hard work and sincerity, they may not be able to achieve it – unless they pay attention to one of the essentials – personal wealth management. 
What is wealth management? And why is it important? Personal wealth management involves taking the right steps at the right time to ensure you are on the path to financial stability. And it is important to focus on it right NOW if you want to have a secure future in regards to your finances. 
Here are the five most important personal wealth management tips to help you secure a financially stable future. 
Tip 1: Plan your income and expenditure. But even before you sit and chalk out your budget, so some extensive research to make sure that what you get paid is what you are worth. Being underpaid, by even a few hundreds of dollars can affect your finances a great deal. 
Next, focus on what you earn on a monthly basis. Add to it income from any other sources. Now, determine your chief monthly expenses and try to find out where you can make a cut. Remember – a penny saved is a penny earned!
Tip 2: Pay attention to savings. After you have your budget in place, it is time to focus on the savings. Property, jewelry and such other items are good; but you also need to have cash savings (it is the one that will come in handy in any emergency).
The easiest way to manage savings is to automate the process. Just make sure a certain percentage of your income is deposited in a separate account once you get paid. Interest-bearing savings accounts are great choices. 
Tip 3: Play the credit hand only when you are confident. Don’t mistake; credit isn’t always bad. It becomes so only when you are incapable of paying it back on time. Be it mortgage, unsecured loan or even credit card loan, you just need to handle it with tact. 
What’s even better is that if your credit history shows timely repayments, it is easier to establish a favorable impression before a lender. The only problem is that if you let it accumulate, it will soon become a huge hurdle to overcome. 
Tip 4: Place achievable financial goals. Take wealth management one step at a time. When you plan to buy your favorite car, you need to save for sometime before you can indulge in your desire. The same is applicable for proper wealth management.
Don’t misunderstand; it is important to focus on small achievable goals for the near future. But you also need to make sure that the small ones form a continuous chain of progression to your ultimate long-term goal of financial stability. 
Tip 5: Put together a retirement plan. This is what your long-term financial plan should aim for – a stable financial position after you retire. Consider how to ensure a continuous cash flow even after your retirement so that you can enjoy the period at peace. 
Many workplaces have retirement plans. If you aren’t contributing to one yet, start asking about it at your place of work. If there isn’t one there, look up the options you have. Consider your requirements and preferences before you make a choice. 
Wealth management isn’t as difficult as it seems. But you need to focus on it immediately. It isn’t difficult to manage your wealth to secure your financial future. You just need to take it one step at a time, and aim for what you deem is your goal.

53,7 Steps To Improve Networking Skills For Entrepreneurs,10/11/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-steps-improve-networking-skills-entrepreneurs/,"
7 Steps To Improve Networking Skills For Entrepreneurs
Underestimating the power of networking is sure to be disadvantageous for an entrepreneur. But why do many entrepreneurs care less about this? It is their idea of networking that adds to the trouble. If you think that it is simply about meeting new people and collecting business cards, you are mistaken. 
Business networking skills are something every entrepreneur needs to acquire and improve on. And it doesn’t imply collecting business cards only – it requires much more than that. It is about building and nurturing meaningful relationships in the entrepreneurial world that will aid your success as an entrepreneur. 
How can an entrepreneur improve networking skills? Let’s outline the steps to become successful at it:  
Step 1: Identify opportunities. Which events do you attend? Well, every industry event is a big opportunity to make new relationships. Be it a trade show, a conference or a workshop, if it is a relevant place with the relevant people, attend it. Also, check the calendar of events at your local chamber of commerce; their events present good opportunities to network with other business-minded people. 
Step 2: Plan ahead. Who do you want to meet? How do you approach them when you meet? What do you want to come up as a result of a meeting? Determine the answers to these questions before you take a step. Set smaller attainable goals – such as ‘I will meet 3 new individuals at this week’s events’ instead of ‘I will sign three deals with my contacts.’ 
Step 3: Pay attention to appearance and manners. Just as you prepare your pitch before a meeting, focus on what to wear and how to behave too. A first impression of an entrepreneur matters. So, dress appropriately for the do. And don’t make your pitch all about hard-selling – it won’t work for your first attempt at networking. 
Step 4: Step out of your comfort zone. It is easy to keep talking to the people you know at an event where you don’t know the majority. But if you did this, you fail the purpose. The focus needs to be on how to create new contacts. And while you are at it, don’t waste your time on forming a hundred casual contacts; instead, focus on a few solid ones. 
Step 5: Make it a two-way thing. A meeting is essentially a conversation. And it won’t be so if you monopolize it. Talk, but listen too. Ask questions, understand answers and keep a note. Make it about how you can be of help to the other; not the other way around. Don’t let one monopolize your time; and don’t do it to others either. 
Step 6: Get the right mix. Exchanging business cards is alright; just don’t put them somewhere and forget all about them. Feed the details into your mobile device. Initiate conversations with the right contacts – both in the real world (you can meet them for a coffee) and on social media (you can email them a helpful resource). 
Step 7: Most importantly, stay in touch. The basic idea of networking is simple – you create and nurture relationships with the right people to boost your business. And you need to maintain this to serve its purpose. This doesn’t mean you have to pester them with emails every day, just keep it meaningful – so they know you haven’t forgotten them.  
Networking skills can help an entrepreneur land new business. It can also help you avoid a tunnel vision of meeting and keeping in touch with the people in your industry alone. Just don’t treat it like work. You don’t do it when you converse with your personal contacts; don’t do it for your business contacts either. 
The real person behind the business is what matters most when it comes to networking.

54,7 Productivity Tools For Entrepreneurs To Make Life Easier,5/11/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-productivity-tools-for-entrepreneurs-make-life-easier/,"
7 Productivity Tools For Entrepreneurs To Make Life Easier
What is the one thing that every entrepreneur wishes for? Well, you may get different sets of wishes, but one thing that is for sure is entrepreneurs need more time. When you start a new business, you have to handle numerous and tedious responsibilities on a daily basis. 
Every entrepreneur needs more time in the day so that it becomes easier to manage everything and stay on top. But is it possible? It is when you add automation and handy apps to your bag of entrepreneurial tricks. 
Here’s a basic list of productivity tools for entrepreneurs that will make it possible to maximize your workday: 
Yast: When your focus is on saving time, you need to have a tool like this for tracking time first. Be it tracking how many hours you spend on a particular task or how much work has been put into a project, this tool makes it easy and simple. 
It’s free for personal use; and available at a reasonable cost for business use. 
Evernote: You never know when a “lightbulb” moment comes. This tool makes it easy to store and track spontaneous thoughts, ideas, perceptions, etc. It also helps you create a proper environment to get things done on time. 
Good news – it is available for free for Android, iOS, and Web versions.
Trello: Project management often becomes a nightmare for startups. This is where this tool comes to help. With it, you can create project boards, almost same as Pinterest, and add and manage individuals and resources on them, similar to Basecamp HQ. 
Whatever the size of your team, you can use this tool for free. 
Dropbox: Storing and sharing documents was never this easy! The beauty of this tool lies in its simplicity. And you can access it from anywhere, anytime, and from any device. You need not worry about damaging or deleting your files too, as it keeps them secure. 
You can get loads of benefits from the free version; you can upgrade to Pro or Business too. 
LastPass: Cyber criminals are becoming more of a threat to our businesses and to prevent ourselves from becoming prey we need strong, secure passwords for the ungodly amount of online accounts we have. The problem is having to remember them all. LastPass saves you from having to reset your stupid password everytime and stores them with one secure login. 
You can get the benefits for free; but you need to upgrade for mobile integration (which I suggest). 
Bitrix24: A central program that offers a host of CRM tools for easy management of data, this one also comes with a social intranet system. Whether you are tracking contacts, messaging, managing the sales funnel, planning activities, this tool can be of immense help. 
You can use it for free for teams of up to 12 people; and upgrade if your team’s larger. 
HipChat: When it comes to internal communications, this is perhaps the best tool to manage it. Create chat rooms, invite specific users, message and share files – you can do it all from this. It saves both time and money and helps organize things. It is far more reliable than the other IM apps out there.
The fee for using this chat tool is quite reasonable; so, it fits the expense budget rather well. 
Getting more done in 24 hours may be a challenge for a new entrepreneur, but it does not need to be if you know how to do it right. All you need to do is find the right tools for extra help, and you’ll get more work done, and even have time to spare (yeah right!).
If you are like me you can never have enough tools, so here are some books that are packed with more productivity tools for entrepreneurs:
Work Smarter by Nick Loper | Listen to Nick give a deep dive here
How To Succeed in 12 Months by Serena Star-Leonard | Listen to Serena give a deep dive here

55,5 Reasons Why Your Marketing Sucks,3/11/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-reasons-marketing-sucks/,"
5 Reasons Why Your Marketing Sucks
Marketing a business isn’t everybody’s cup of tea; and even if you are great at other things, it is quite possible that you are doing it all wrong when it comes to marketing. And that could mean the end of the road in a few years time. 
If your business, albeit being a potential success, isn’t quite hitting the mark, you need to find out whether your marketing sucks! How do you differentiate between a marketing plan that works and one that doesn’t? It’s simple – just take a look at the points below. 
Reason 1 – No plan: Where is your marketing heading towards? Which marketing steps work and which don’t? What do you do to replace the ones that don’t? If you don’t have a proper plan, you won’t have answers to any of these questions. 
A marketing plan needs to work to achieve a set of goals, have ample research at its back, identify and use the strategies that work, have means to measure the results, and add and alter as and when necessary. Do you have such a plan?
Reason 2 – No budget: You need to determine how much you want to spend on your marketing even before you take the first step. Don’t treat it as a series of requirements – it will only lead to waste of money. 
And don’t opt for the cheapest option – usually you get what you pay for. So, even if you don’t need to pay your nephew to design your business logo, its best to get a professional to do it. Remember, it’s not just a logo; it is the first step in your brand building efforts. 
Reason 3 – No cohesion: A black and white logo and a multicolored website or an edgy website and a tacky business card – exactly what impression are you trying to convey? Every element in your marketing plan needs to work together to create a uniform whole. 
Disparity in fonts, colors, style and any such element can confuse your target market. What image do you wish for your business – corporate, edgy, contemporary, or something else? Make sure every piece of marketing reflects this core concept. 
Reason 4 – No social media: If you aren’t on any social media platform, you are losing out. Your target base is out there. And so is your competition. Failing to mix new age marketing methods using Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and so on is sure to lead to loss. 
Create a Facebook business page, a Twitter account, a LinkedIn profile, claim your Google+ page, and do whatever it takes. Make sure you update to them regularly. And remember, while Pinterest may work for a jewelry lineup, YouTube works better for a tech service. 
Reason 5 – No metrics: Yes, you may think that your marketing efforts are paying off, but unless you are capable of measuring it, how do you know it for sure? Also, you have no idea which of your strategies work and which don’t. 
Analyze and evaluate every step to make sure it is of any advantage. Do A/B testing to identify marketing efforts that do well and the ones that don’t. Use the metrics tools available to determine whether your efforts are paying off. 
It is easy to sit back and be smug about how good you are at marketing. But it won’t be so easy once you are aware of why it sucks. But don’t despair; rectifying a mistake becomes easier when you have identified it. Take your time, and get your marketing back on track.

57,5 Ways Entrepreneurs Can Overcome Business Failure,28/10/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-ways-entrepreneurs-can-overcome-business-failure/,"
5 Ways Entrepreneurs Can Overcome Business Failure
Now that you have started a new business, brace yourself for failure. Sounds a little pessimistic – doesn’t it? Well, every entrepreneur needs to be prepared for the worst. Even super successful individuals such as Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Colonel Sanders, or Henry Ford didn’t succeed at their first attempt. 
In fact, it took most successful entrepreneurs and leaders multiple attempts to reach their goals. What was the likely key to their ultra success? It’s their approach that differentiated them. As Edison summed it up – “I haven’t failed; I’ve found 10,000 ways that don’t work”. 
But the question is – why do startups fail often? The reason is simple – you just don’t have the necessary experience to run a business. This leads you to make many mistakes, and soon they start to make a significant impact on your day. No planning, forgetting taxes, emotional pricing, wasting money on unnecessary details, and so on lead to trouble. 
And if you don’t identify your mistakes and rectify them on time, you end up as a failure. But if you think it is the end of the road, you are seriously on your path to a letdown in your life. It is at this time that you need to think and act and turn your failure into success. 
How do you do it? Here’s how I’ve learned that top entrepreneurs overcome business failure: 
Switch to a positive mode
No, it doesn’t mean you try to fake a smile and look happy even when you feel down in the dumps. It implies that you treat your failure as a life lesson. Don’t fight it; embrace it. Only then you will be able to understand what an experience it was. Create a spreadsheet and write down what you did right and what you didn’t. 
Appraise your assets
Be it an office space that you have leased or great relationships that you have created – don’t ignore their potential. Consider what worked splendidly for your startup – was it your employees, or, your certain client relations, or, your intellectual property? Draw up a chart to understand and evaluate your best assets. 
Sell off whatever you can
Whether you want to give away your business or sell it, you need to get in touch with the right people. If you think that it may still work, keep a percentage in it. If not, just give it away to a new entrepreneur. If you decide to sell, don’t be shy; contact everyone you know to see who you can sell it off to. 
Read up
Akio Morita began Sony selling a rice cooker. But it burned the rice. Yet, Sony is one of the best success stories of today. Fred Smith almost failed his business management course with his business idea. It later developed into FedEx. And good old Edison actually failed more than 9000 times before he made the light bulb. 
Most importantly, start again
Now that you have failed, you have two choices – you can leave it and go back to where you were before you tried entrepreneurship. Or, you can get up, brush off the dust from your fall and tread along towards your next venture. And when you choose the second option, you will have the lesson you learned to guide you. 
Success in business, quite similar to success in life, is not dependent on whether you make it at the first jump. It relies on whether you have the courage to get up and get going and make your failure just a stepping stone on your journey to success.

58,How to Become an Effective Communicator in the Business World,21/10/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/become-an-effective-communicator-business-world/,"
How to Become an Effective Communicator in the Business World
Why is communication so important in the business world? Be it a face-to-face meeting with a supplier or an online conversation on a social media platform, if you aren’t adept at the art of communication, you are at a risk of failure.  
But if you think that effective communication just implies smooth talk, you are in big trouble. Effective communication involves talking, listening and understanding. And it is no different in the business world. 
How do you become an effective communicator? Here are the steps to achieve success. 
Step 1
Be prepared. Whether you are trying to have a talk with your boss about a raise or with a client about a possible contract, it is important to prepare for it. If you don’t, you may not be able to put your points through when you get the opportunity. 
It’s important to make sure that the time they invest in listening to you is not wasted on your ramblings. No need to memorize a pitch, just make a note of the points you want to focus on during the conversation. And things become easier. 
Step 2
Begin on the right note. When you broach a conversation, the things that interest your audience are – what do you have to say, how much of their time would you take, and what outcome you expect from the interview. 
Therefore, it’s just easier to state the objective of your conversation and the time it will take for you to discuss it when you open a conversation. It puts the individual at the other end at ease as they become immediately aware of the significant points. 
Step 3
Pay attention to body language and tone. Communication doesn’t involve the words alone; body language and tone of voice matter too. Try conversing about a serious matter in a frivolous tone, and nobody will take it the way you want them to. 
When someone asks a question, crossing arms signifies defense while putting them in the pocket implies concealment. Learn the basics of how the mind interprets body language and facial expressions. Also, practice smiling while talking to instill a nicety to your tone. 
Step 4
Choose your words carefully. Next is the question of word selection. You need to learn how to put your point across in a clear and precise manner. Brevity is an admired quality in a businessman. But it isn’t helpful if it stands in the way of clarity. 
Also, keep in mind to tailor your speech to suit the individual you converse with. Suppose you sell software. While you may have to tell the basics of it to a non-technical individual, you don’t need to do so when you talk to the IT department. 
Step 5
Learn to listen (this is the most important). It is important to focus on what you say, how you say it, and how much time you take. But even more important is to ascertain that you pause and listen to the other person. 
Consider whether they understand what you say. Ask the right questions. And listen to their answers, analyze and understand them. This is important, whether you are trying to convince your boss to give you that raise or encourage your client to sign that contract. 
Effective communication, like many prominent skills, takes practice. And it is best to apply your knowledge of how to do it right in your personal and professional space. Once you have mastered this art, it will pave your way to success in both.
Are you interested in becoming an even more effective communicator to help grow yourself?
If so here are some books that I recommend you take a look at:

59,5 Advantages of Creating A Mobile App For Your Business,14/10/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-advantages-creating-mobile-app-business/,"
5 Advantages of Creating a Mobile App for Your Business 
Do you really need a mobile app for your business? Whether you have a small, medium or big business, going mobile is the only way nowadays. People, especially the younger crowd, are constantly using their mobile devices to browse the World Wide Web and if you aren’t there, you are missing out on the opportunities. 
But isn’t having a mobile site enough? Not anymore. 
With a mobile app, you can achieve results you simply cannot with just a mobile-friendly website. For starters, the app, once downloaded, stays on in the device, while the website doesn’t! Why do you need to create a mobile app for your business? 
Get to understand the real advantages of creating a mobile app for your business and you’ll find the answer. 
It boosts interest: When you develop an app, it gives you an easy way to showcase your products or services to your customers and prospective customers. Whenever they want, they can just use it as a one-stop point to get all the info they need. 
And when you update the content, you give them a glimpse of the new products or services you have on offer. This excites and interests customers and prospects to check out your updates regularly. A good example of this is the Etsy app. 
It enhances engagement: Most shoppers cannot resist the temptation of a good deal or a great discount, especially when one stares at their face. And this is exactly what you can do with your mobile app. 
Engage your customers with offers and incentives in real time. You can use their profile information and location to customize your offers to make them more attractive too. Kraft’s iFood Assistant takes the cake in this matter. 
It aids promotion: Suppose you have an apparel and accessories boutique at a central location. And you know that many prospective customers walk by your store every day. What if you design an app that lures them to your store? 
Create an offer that is simply too irresistible and notify about it through the app. An easy way to promote your business, apparently, but you will soon reap its benefits. Groupon is an example that does this very well. 
It offers support: While it is often a hassle to receive and respond to a customer support request, the same becomes easy when you have an appropriate app to do it. With a mobile app that can offer instructions and how-to’s, you are sure to win approval. 
Develop a mobile app that makes it easy to connect with you, or offers customers the tools to make it easier for them to use your product or service, and you’ll make them happy.
It ensures ease: Users today wish for a fuss-free experience, whether they access your site or your app, and whether they do it from their PC or their Smartphone. With a good plan and a clear vision, it becomes possible to deliver on their expectations. 
When you design the app for your business, first determine what it will be for. Users prefer certain categories of apps – those that make life fun (Angry Birds), those that simplify (wikiHow), those that interest (Yahoo Sports), and those that let them shop (Amazon). 
Before you appoint a professional to create your app, decide what you want it to do. 
And once you are sure of it, get the basics on your own – the images, the content, the logo, and so on. Next, get a professional to design the mobile app for your business. Don’t try to save money here; it won’t do you any good. Also, make sure you have a flow of new content to keep the app fresh and interesting for users.
Are you interested in the advantages of creating a mobile app for your business? Here is my recommended resource from The EL:

60,5 Simple Ways Entrepreneurs Can Attract Customers,8/10/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-simple-ways-entrepreneurs-can-attract-customers/,"
5 Simple Ways Entrepreneurs Can Attract Customers To Their Business
You have a great product or service and yet you seem unable to attract customers to your business and make a sale. Almost every new entrepreneur faces this challenge after they start off a small business.
And the root cause of this problem is often your inability to reach out to your customers.
The lack of advertising and marketing your product or service may be drawing you back from your customers. But for a small business, with limited funds, it is often difficult to allot a substantial amount for advertising and marketing.
In such a circumstance, what do you do? Simple; you just focus on the ways to do it right. Let’s take a look at some simple ways entrepreneurs can attract customers to their business:
Tip 1: Rely on word-of-mouth. This tried-and-tested option never fails! If you can build an army of satisfied customers, it will work much better than a couple of billboards or television ads. They are the best tools of advertisement you may find.
To turn a customers into satisfied customers, you have to work on the three premises:
• Offer a great product/service – the basic necessity for a successful business
• Ensure great customer service – remember, always serve with a smile
• Offer a reward for referral – the bigger the incentive, the better your opportunity
And soon you will have a good number of spokespersons at no added cost!
Tip 2: Involve and engage. When a prospect walks in, make sure you turn them into a customer. How do you do it? Interest them with an offer, give them a free sample, request them to enter a contest, and use any other means you can think of.
People love free stuff. They also love offers and discounts. And when they get something at no cost or maybe low cost, and are happy with it, they are sure to come back and pay for it. And they are sure to talk about your business to their contacts.
Tip 3: Build a website. If you aren’t online yet, you need to be – NOW! A website isn’t a luxury anymore; it’s a necessity. If you aren’t online, you are missing out attracting the prospective customers who stick to their PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets, et al.
You don’t really need to invest thousands of dollars to ensure a web presence. Just make sure someone who knows how to do it right does it. Otherwise, you will be stuck with a site that doesn’t work for your business.
Tip 4: Connect on social media. When Mandie Miller started off her business Got What It Cakes, she built a website. But the business only picked up once her sister put up a Facebook page for it.
Lesson learned: While a website is essential for your business, no business can ignore the reach of social media these days. Create a page on Facebook, get an account on Twitter, or add images on Pinterest and Instagram – do whatever it takes to enhance your reach.
Tip 5: Get involved. While you will always have competitors, and you will always have to keep a lookout for them, you also need to focus on collaboration. Make a list of complementary businesses and promote each other to your respective clientele.
Also, don’t forget about the community; after all, you are a part of it. Give back. Charitable or environment-friendly work never goes unnoticed. And once you are part of something big, you’ll get people interested in what you do.
It is possible to get the attention of customers; you just need to know how to do it right.
Are you looking for some good resources on attracting customers to your business? Here are my top 5 recommendations:

61,5 Financial Mistakes That Devastate Startups,7/10/2014,Wade Danielson,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-financial-mistakes-devastate-startups/,"
You dream of starting a successful business.
You hope to succeed. Who doesn’t?
You want your spouse to be proud of you. Perhaps your children will take over the family business one day.
You are so pumped that you could fly.
Hey you! You want a dose of reality?
Most businesses fail.
Why?
You guessed it. They fail because of money.
More specifically, they fail because of bad financial decisions.
Have you ever wondered what’s the one thing you can’t succeed without? 
It isn’t your business idea. Neither is your passion for your business.
It’s MONEY!
Does this mean that you have to be rich? Of course not, but you have to be smart about your finances. Money doesn’t guarantee you success, but the lack of it guarantees failure.
I am sure you hear people telling others to “Dream Big”.
Dream small my friend. 
Many entrepreneurs think that starting a business is about spending like there is no tomorrow.
Startup entrepreneurs can make poor decisions that will hugely impact the financial health of their startups.
Avoid the following financial mistakes to maximize your chance for success:
1. Fund your business right.
Never finance your business with your retirement savings.
They say “getting old is not for sissies”.
The only thing worse is being old, poor.
Don’t risk your retirement savings for any startup. Think of this as an absolute.
There are other ways to fund your business, here are some of the best:
● Purchase order financing/Factoring accounts receivables – PO financing helps you get required funds directly to the supplier. Factoring is similar to PO financing. It is based on unpaid amounts owed to your business.
● Save money before you start your business – It shows that you are serious about business.
● Use credit cards – Credit cards are easy to get if you have decent credit. Many successful businesses were funded by credit cards.
● What are friends for? – Your friends and family trust you and love you. Why not ask them to take a chance with you?
● Crowdfunding – The most common crowdfunding sites are Kickstarter and Indiegogo.
● Peer-to-peer lending – Prosper and Lendingclub are some of the most popular peer-to-peer lending sites.
● Microloans – Microloans are for usually for under $50,000. They are normally offered by nonprofit community-based organizations.
● Vendor financing – This is a form of lending in which a company lends money to be used by the borrower to buy the vendor’s products.
And a few more financing options as a bonus:
● SBA loan
● Product pre-sales
● Side business – you might have one of your business fund your startup. For example, it is common for startups to finance their business through consulting gigs.
● Angel investors
● Venture capitalists
● Winning contests – There are many business-plan and startup contests.
2. Be smart about long-term contracts.
For most businesses, signing a long-terms lease is almost always a bad idea.
Let’s say you sign a five-year lease for a 2500 square foot office. Business is good. Two years later you have hired more people you have space for.
What do you do now?
The easy solution is to move into a larger space, but you are stuck.
Remember the five year lease you signed? You are stuck for three more years.
You can plead, make threats, or break down in tears.
Your landlord will not let you out of your lease.
You do have options, but none of them are great.
You can lease a second office, but it will increase your operating costs. You have no good options only because you signed a long term lease.
Don’t do it.
If you are smart, you sublease or rent month-to-month.
Do you want to be free?
Avoid long-term contracts.
Sublease or find a place you can rent month-to-month. A great place to find subleases is through Craigslist. There are a bunch of businesses that made the mistake of leasing a larger space they need.
Their loss is your win!
You get to sublease from them month-to-month. In addition, you’ll probably spend less per square foot. If you want to move, in 30-days you are outta there.
In the above example, the growing company was stuck in a cramped office space simply because of a long-term lease.
Entrepreneurs that succeed keep their options open.
Avoid long-terms contracts like the plague.
3. Buy inventory.
Spending money is easy.
Smart entrepreneurs only spend on things that make them money.
Sell it first.
Only buy inventory when you are 100% sure you can sell it.
How do I do that? You might ask.
Take pre-orders.
Some of the most successful businesses have virtually no unsold inventory.
Sell before you invest in inventory.
Selling first helps you two ways:
A. It proves that people want what you have.
B. It proves that you have the right price.
Best of all, selling first will never bankrupt you.
Inventory control can make or break your business.
If you must have an inventory, manage it to perfection.
Having too much or too little can eat up your cash fast.
4. Hire staff too soon.
One of the most exciting time for a startup is when you hire your first employees.
Employees are expensive.
Business is cyclical. You might have a couple of busy months, followed by three slow months.
As a startup you might be better off working with contractors at first. It is easier to scale down with contractors than employees.
Do you want to lower your operational and labor costs?
Outsource and work with contractors.
Working with contractors gives you greater flexibility. Later on when your business is humming along, you can hire full-timers.
The most commonly outsourced business functions are:
● Customer support
● Accounting
● Web design
● Computer programming
● Data entry
● Writing/Content development
● Manufacturing
● Research & Development (R&D)
● Legal services
● Creative Services – PR, Marketing, SEO
5. Quit your job before your business makes money.
It’s liberating to know that you can quit your job.
But, is it the right thing to do?
Are you sure you have enough money to pay the bills until your business turns a profit?
Know how many months you can live on your savings. In business, everything takes longer and costs more than anticipated.
Quitting your job too soon could be one of the worst financial mistakes.
Don’t quit your job if you:
● Have insufficient savings.
● Are pumped up about business, but lack a real plan.
● Have a lot more to learn before you know enough to start your business.
● Hate your job and expect your business to help you love life.
● Are desperate to make money.
Do you want to do it right?
Start your business on the side and phase out your job as you start making money.
A steady paycheck takes a lot of the pressure off. Many successful startup entrepreneurs keep working during the day until they have enough revenue to replace their salaries.
It might take you a year or two to make enough money to feel comfortable about quitting your day job.
It’s the safe way to transition from employee to entrepreneur.
Want to know a secret?
The more financially dumb decisions you make the more likely will you fail.
Minimize your chances for failure and avoid financial mistakes.

Latest Books For Entrepreneurs in October 2014
The Entrepreneurs Library presents the latest books for entrepreneurs in October 2014. These books are brand new to the market and the authors are in line to share their insights with me. Stay tuned this month for the release of the interviews with these great books and the authors.
Scaling Up: How A Few Companies Make It And Why The Rest Don’t by Verne Harnish
In Scaling Up, Harnish and his team share practical tools and techniques for building an industry-dominating business. These approaches have been honed from over three decades of advising tens of thousands of CEOs and executives and helping them navigate the increasing complexities (and weight) that come with scaling up a venture.
Scaling Up is the first major revision of this business classic. The goal of this book is to help you turn what feels like an anchor into wind at your back — creating a company where the team is engaged; the customers are doing your marketing; and everyone is making money. To accomplish this, Scaling Up focuses on the four major decision areas every company must get right: People, Strategy, Execution, and Cash.
“The idea of guiding a company from the small tide pools to the big seas of business can be exhilarating, but also daunting without a detailed set of directions. Scaling Up provides those directions, along with a remarkably detailed map for how to get there safe and happy.” – Robert B. Cialdini, best-selling author of Influence
“Fast-growing companies — not small ones or big ones — create almost all the jobs and innovation in our economy, and Verne has been an invaluable guide to leaders of such companies, like me. Scaling Up helps us put in place the disciplines critical to building a significant business.” – Graham Weston, Chairman and CEO, Rackspace

Take Command by Jake Wood
In this groundbreaking book on high-stakes leadership, Co-founder and CEO of Team Rubicon and former Marine Sniper Jake Wood, shows how to apply hard-learned lessons in leadership and teamwork from the battlefield and disaster zone to your professional life.
While most of our jobs don’t involve leading a tour of Marines through an ambush, or rushing into a relief zone just decimated by a hurricane, in today’s fast-paced, hyper-competitive business environment, we are ALL on the front lines.
And in an entrepreneurially-minded world where technology is constantly reinventing how we work, global competition is fierce, and industries are being disrupted overnight, success requires a new kind of leadership. This book is about how to become the kind of leader who gets results when the stakes are at their highest—how to take command.
“There are leaders everywhere. Parents. Entrepreneurs. Warriors. Executives. And people with big ideas.  Wood relates to all of them with a humility and confidence that its uniquely American. If there is one book on leadership to read, it is this one. From his hometown to the battlefield of Iraq to Haiti and untold other natural disasters, to the boardroom and the factory floor, Wood gets it: the kind of leader you are shapes your outcome.” – Christine Romans, CNN chief business correspondent
“A must read for every aspiring leader. Filled with powerful stories and simple, straightforward guidelines, this is the new roadmap for leadership from the front lines.” – Dave Kerpen, NY Times Bestselling Author, Likeable Social Media, Likeable Business & The Art of People

From Idea To Exit by Jeffrey Weber
From Idea To Exit is an excellent summation of Jeff Weber’s entrepreneurial journey that should be a reference guide book on the bookshelf of all entrepreneurs. It is filled with insights that help organize familiar concepts in a logical way, and can be used again and again through all stages of building a startup. Jeff distills his learnings and catalogs them with the precision of a surgeon in the OR. 
While most small business books cover niche components of the start-up model, From Idea to Exit takes a more comprehensive approach, tackling the entire entrepreneurial journey from the initial seed idea through a well-planned exit strategy. Through a persuasive narrative, the author draws from his own success a practical call to action for those who dream of taking that first big step.

She brings to life iconic entrepreneurs like Walt Disney and Estée Lauder and reveals how companies like MTV, GE, and Burberry found their best successes by breaking the corporate mold and embracing the entrepreneur mind-set. She also introduces us to some of the one thousand entrepreneurs she’s advised, like Leila Velez, who started a hair-care company in her kitchen sink in Rio that now earns $80 million a year. As Linda writes:
“Every day I meet people with a dream. Maybe you’re serving coffee and fantasizing about launching a microbrewery; maybe you’ve skipped college and yearn to start your own design firm; maybe you’re sitting in your cubicle and brainstorming a new idea that can improve your company.”
“Call me crazy, but I think Linda is onto something big here. She delivers powerful insights with her legendary wit and candor to show how everyone can think and act like an entrepreneur.”— Michael Dell, founder and CEO, Dell Inc.
“Crazy is what they call people who don’t fit in. And we need a lot more crazy like Linda is crazy. She is generous, curious, connected and driven to make a difference in the world. And this book captures all of that and more. Buy it, read it, live it.” — Seth Godin, author of Linchpin

63,Who is Napoleon Hill and Everything An Entrepreneur Should Know About Him,30/9/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/napoleon-hill-everything-entrepreneur-know/,"
Who is Napoleon Hill and Everything An Entrepreneur Should Know About Him
Have you ever wondered why some people are so successful when millions out there are breaking their backs to make ends meet? Of course they are not doing anything out of this world nor have they been blessed by the gods. This is one question that many wantrepreneurs and aspiring business people have been asking for years and thankfully, we have Napoleon Hill’s works among us providing the answer.
Who is Napoleon Hill? Well, he is considered by many as one of the most popular motivational authors of all time. Of course, he did not find the “holy grail” of business success and marketing but he did produce some of the most amazing books on business success that have inspired millions of people around the world. 
Born in October 26, 1883, Napoleon Hill is considered as one of the proponents of the new thought movement and probably he is the precursor of the literary genre which is today known as personal success literature. Known and celebrated as one of the most successful writers on success, he has authored the bestselling book of all time – ‘Think and Grow Rich’. Amazing as it might sound, 20 million copies of this book were sold throughout the world before his death. He delved deep into the psychology of successful people and tried to figure out their mental prowess that leads to their immense success in the world of business. Even at some point of his life, he became an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and this shows how influential he was in his days. Throughout his life, he tried to find the elusive formula that he strongly believed can transcend a normal or regular guy into a person with success. 
If you have ever heard these beautiful and powerful words like – “Anything the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve”, you have got an idea of his authority on this particular literary genre. He had interviewed successful people from different walks of life and reached the conclusion that there are certain characteristics that have made these people so successful in their lives. He went on further to say that if common people like you and I can emulate the characteristics of these wealthy persons the chances of successful in life will increase manifolds. 
In his book ‘Think and Grow Rich’, he laid out 13 easy to follow rules that he wants us to believe have the secret sauce of success. Okay, we are not saying that whoever read this book is going to be the next billionaire. Well sadly, the world not such a beautiful place. Rather this book contains some practical advice on how to make money, be a greater leader and to be uber successful. 
The book has an interesting history. Andrew Carnegie was the person who encouraged Napoleon Hill to start his quest for the secret formula of success. Andrew Carnegie a business tycoon in his days steadfastly believed that success could be defined via a single and simple formula. During an interview of him taken by Napoleon Hill, he got so much impressed that he assigned the job to Napoleon. He asked him to take interview of 500 (+) men and women to find the secret of success. Some of the famous people that Napoleon Hill interviewed are – John Wanamaker, Theodore Roosevelt, Charles M. Schwab, Henry Ford, Alexander Graham Bell and more. The result is his magnus opus – ‘Think and Grow Rich’.
Are you interested in learning even more about the lessons and fool-proof advice from one of the greatest business men and authors of all time?
Check out his amazing book and an interview I had with the director of the Napoleon Hill Foundation, Don Green:

64,7 Important Things You Need To Know When Selling Your Business,23/9/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-important-things-need-know-selling-business/,"
7 Important Things You Need To Know When Selling Your Business
Selling your business may be the hardest challenge you have had to deal with as an entrepreneur. It’s lengthy, and troubling, and even infuriating at times. And it gets worse if you think that the issues will be resolved once the deal is done. But this isn’t so. As an entrepreneur, you need to have a clear idea about how you will handle this phase. 
Here are 7 important things you need to know when selling your business
Take your time to make the decision. Whether you are planning to sell your business to spend more time with your family or invest in a bigger venture, you need to think about your decision for a hundred times. Sometimes, the length and complications of the process disgusts the best entrepreneurs and makes them rethink their decision. 
Keep your focus on the reason you want to sell in the first place; and plan ahead. 
Detach from the business. Well, you have put in money, time and effort to make your business grow. But think it from the buyer’s perspective – would you buy a business where the owner needs to invest 20 hours a day to run the daily operations? Or, rather one where the owner has the freedom to take off days and go on holidays? 
Make sure the business runs smoothly; even without you being part of its daily operations. 
Appoint professionals for the task. If you haven’t handled a business sale before, you may have no clue about the process. And if you have, the same may yet be true. It involves legalities, figures, numbers, and an array of documents. And it’s impossible for you to handle it all without specialized knowledge and experience.
Appoint a legal professional as well as an accountant specializing in this particular field. 
Learn how to deal with the stress. Appointing professionals isn’t going to help you with the stress. Your legal team will unearth problems you never knew even existed. Your accountant will ask for figures you never knew anyone required. And dealing with it all will often feel too exhausting. 
Cultivate a positive attitude; always remember that the professionals are for your help. 
Set a realistic value. Every entrepreneur thinks of their endeavor as the best in the market. And this reflects in the price you set when you decide to sell your business. The only problem is – the buyers may not have the same opinion about it. Well, it’s true that they want to buy your business, but they want to do it at a reasonable price. 
If you think you are biased, opt for an objective opinion before you decide on it. 
Be wary of debts and documents. If you have adequate time to plan before you sell your business, you have the window to get rid of any debts you have incurred. Otherwise, it will lower the amount you get after the sale. Also, pay attention to any documents you have signed in the past that adds to your liabilities. 
Discuss every detail with your lawyer and accountant; and get their advice about these. 
Assess your team’s capabilities. If you have put together a winning team, it will prove to be one of your assets when you sell. But if your team comprises of family members, who take their paycheck just because they are family, or of employees who will never find another opportunity, you are in trouble. 
A buyer will evaluate the capabilities of your team; do it beforehand and take measures. 
Selling your business is a big decision; you need to plan from the day you decide to do it. 
Are you planning on selling your business in the near future? If so here are some expert books that I recommend you read:

Final Act of Ownership by Jerry Baltus – Listen to my interview with Jerry here

65,Top Financial Mistakes Entrepreneurs Make When Creating a New Business,16/9/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/top-financial-mistakes-entrepreneurs-make-creating-new-business/,"
Top Financial Mistakes Entrepreneurs Make When Creating a New Business
Managing to keep the cash flowing is one of the biggest concerns for every new entrepreneur. And what makes it even more difficult is their unawareness of the pitfalls along their path. Creating a new business is a big task, and keeping the cash flowing is part of the responsibility. 
Forbes states that “There are almost 28 million small businesses in the US and over 22 million are self employed with no additional payroll or employees (these are called non-employers)”. The question is – how many of them will survive in the long run? 
Even if you have a winning idea, a superb product or an excellent service, you need to pay attention to your finances to transform it into a successful endeavor. And while you have to focus on the dos, you also need to be careful about the don’ts. 
In order to make your transformation flawless, let’s take a look at the top financial mistakes entrepreneurs make at the start. 
Mistake 1: Biting off more than you can chew. You need to dream big when you start out as an entrepreneur. But if your dreams don’t fit your budget, you are in for some big trouble. Keep your head in the clouds and your feet on the ground. 
Suppose you sell handmade gifts online. Do you really need to have a physical store? No. Yes, it can add to your business. But if you are hard pressed for money (that you invariably are at the start), isn’t it a better idea to make it a home-based business initially?
Mistake 2: Underestimate expenses. Just like a business plan, you need to have a financial plan at the beginning. But it’s a little different. While you need to stick to your business plan, you need to tweak your financial plan a little. 
What do you need to do? Just double whatever you have set as expenses! Many businesses fail because they underestimate just how much they will need to keep things running. Doubling the figures gives you a cushion to fall back on even at the last minute. 
Mistake 3: Falling prey to the allure of new. A new office furnished with modern pieces and showcasing the latest gadgets may look and feel nice. But unless you need to meet clients at your office regularly, it’s just a waste. 
As a new entrepreneur, you need to focus on how you can save money. Instead, of new furniture, opt for used ones. They will be good, and come cheap too. If possible, let go the idea of an office entirely or maybe get an office suite instead of the entire deal. 
Mistake 4: Employing individuals. Everyone feels high and mighty when they are in a position to employ others. But consider your decision a hundred times before you do it. It is one of most expensive choices you may make, and it can quickly become a cause of concern. 
Instead of full-time employees, opt for contractual professionals for your business. They may have a higher hourly rate, but you won’t be burdened with them once the contract runs out. And as they are experts, you save time and money on training and supervision too. 
Mistake 5: Not having an exit plan. A new entrepreneur needs to aim for success and prepare for failure. While you need to put in every ounce of your time, money and effort into your endeavor, make sure you have a safety net in case anything goes wrong. 
It’s best to keep aside an emergency fund that will come in useful if your business doesn’t break even in the time frame you have set. It’s imperative that you don’t break into this fund to try to save your failing business. This will see you through until your next venture. 
Be wary of these top financial mistakes entrepreneurs make and you will be able to better manage your finances, right from the start.

66,5 Mistakes Entrepreneurs Make With Marketing and Branding,9/9/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-mistakes-entrepreneurs-make-with-marketing-and-branding/,"
5 Mistakes Entrepreneurs Make With Marketing and Branding
Marketing, when done correctly, is considered as an investment to a business. Since entrepreneurs can’t splurge huge amounts of money on the promotion of their products and services like larger brands, they need to be very particular about their marketing plan to ensure that not a single marketing dollar gets wasted. A great marketing plan can bolster the market reputation of a business and can help it win the trust of its targeted audience eventually, whereas a bad marketing plan can hurt its business prospect in more than one way. 
Building a brand image is never easy. It takes years to build a solid brand but it takes just a few seconds to ruin it. Don’t believe us? Well then, try posting something nasty via your company’s social profile and you will see how the reputation of your company comes crumbling down [safety notice – don’t try this at home/office]. 
The thing is that most entrepreneurs have no idea about promoting their brand and for that reason, they try different things only to find themselves in deep trouble at the end. Sometimes they prioritize product development over marketing and branding and sometimes, they just ignore the concept of branding altogether. Here are some 5 mistakes entrepreneurs make with marketing and branding: 
You Have no Idea About Your Targeted Audience
Imagine a scenario that you are selling anti-aging products and you are targeting mainly teenage boys. The probable outcome of this bizarre marketing initiative is easy to predict – a big Disaster. You need to realize the truth that you simply can’t target everybody around. You need to identify your targeted audience first before even thinking about marketing products. Culture, age, sex, geographical locations etc all play pivotal role while choosing your targeted audience.  
You Don’t Care About What People Are Saying About Your Brand
Some business owners tend to remain oblivious to the fact that people might be discussing about their brand right now on different social media sites. You may never know that an irate customer might be venting his anger by spitting venom about your brand on Facebook or Twitter and if you don’t intervene right now or don’t redress his problem, things might go out of your hand. You need to keep a hawk eye on different social media channels otherwise a small issue can get snowballed into a major crisis. 
You Are Trying to Be Everywhere 
Some business owners are of the opinion that they should be active on social media channels. Now, there are over hundreds of social networking sites available and that means, there is no way you can be active on all of them. Try to identify those platforms that draw large number of your targeted audience and be active on those platforms. Limit the number of official social account to 4 or 5. 
You are Trying to Do Everything By Yourself 
Some business owners try to do everything all by themselves. It is good to keep eyes on everything but it will drain all your energy at the end of the day. Moreover, sometimes it is good to appoint a professional rather than doing all by yourself and messing things up miserably. 
Your Business Does not Have a Website
You gotta be kidding, right? Why would a business not have an official website in the digital world today? To boost the brand presence of your business on the web, your business needs to have a website. There is no way around it. You need to invest some marketing dollars on design, hosting and content. Make the website live as soon as possible otherwise all your attempts to bolster the brand presence of your business will fall flat on the ground.
If you are looking for some great books that provide insights into marketing and branding, I recommend the following 5 reads:

Overfished Ocean Strategy by Nadya Zhexembayeva

She fills the book with examples of companies that are already successfully navigating the overfished ocean, from established corporations such as BMW, Microsoft, and Puma to newcomers such as Lush, FLOOW2, and Sourcemap.
The linear, throwaway economy of today—in which we extract resources at one end, create products, and throw them away at the other—is rapidly coming to an end. In every industry, creative minds are learning how to make money by taking this line and turning it into a circle. Nadya Zhexembayeva shows how you can join them and avoid being left high and dry.

You’ll find out how to prepare yourself and your company for sale, understand your asset and how it benefits prospective buyers, and identify and remediate any issues that could prevent a sale or drive down sale price.

Uncover and make the most of your company’s competitive advantage
Create a sales strategy that highlights your company’s value to potential buyers

Hello, My Name Is Awesome by Alexandra Watkins
Every year, 6 million companies and more than 100,000 products are launched. They all need an awesome name, but many (such as Xobni, Svbtle, and Doostang) look like the results of a drunken Scrabble game.
In this entertaining and engaging book, ace naming consultant Alexandra Watkins explains how anyone—even non-creative types—can create memorable and buzz-worthy brand names. No degree in linguistics required. The heart of the book is Watkins’s proven SMILE and SCRATCH Test—two acronyms for what makes or breaks a name.
She also provides up-to-date advice, like how to make sure that Siri spells your name correctly and how to nab an available domain name. And you’ll see dozens of examples—the good, the bad, and the “so bad she gave them an award.” Alexandra Watkins is not afraid to name names.
Naming a business or product has always been challenging—and sometimes costly— for entrepreneurs and inventors, but it’s one of the most important decisions they have to make. Alexandra Watkins presents a foolproof model that anyone can use to create and evaluate brand names like a pro. 
“Zappos.com originally started out as ShoeSite.com, but that limited our potential future growth. A company’s name can be vital to its success. Reading the tips in this book can help anyone avoid the pitfalls.” —Tony Hsieh, New York Times bestselling author of Delivering Happiness and CEO, Zappos.com, Inc.

69,5 Important Things That Every Entrepreneur Needs To Know About Starting a New Business,20/8/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-important-things-every-entrepreneur-needs-know-starting-new-business/,"
5 Important Things That Every Entrepreneur Needs To Know About Starting a New Business
Starting a new business can prove to be advantageous. Along with the opportunity to do what you love, it also gives you the chance to have a flexible schedule and make money from it. Nonetheless, all of this will only become a reality if you are aware of the basic and important things that matter. 
Every entrepreneur needs to start right to achieve success. And to do it, you need to have the right knowledge and clear ideas. This will help you chart out the course of action you need to take to achieve success as an entrepreneur. 
Let’s take a look at the important things that every new entrepreneur needs to know about starting a new business: 
Legal Requirements
Well, the Internal Revenue Service needs you to get your Tax Identification Number. But that may not be all. Depending on where you decide to open your new business, there may be few, or many, more legal requirements. Check with your local small business association or you can go online to the US Small Business Administration for help.
You may need to fill out forms, submit documents and get licenses and permits to start a new business. It is best to talk to a business consultant to get a clear idea about what you need to do to ensure that the legal requirements are met.
Finances
It is important to plan your budget before you take any step in this direction. Work out how much you will be able to invest initially, what expenses do you need to meet immediately and how much do you need to make to break even. 
Also, don’t forget your own finances. You’ll still have to pay your rent, health insurance, and other bills. If necessary, take up a part-time job for the first year or so. It will be hectic, but you need to have a certain amount of cash to fall back on, if anything goes wrong. 
Liability
In most cases, a sole proprietor has the entire liability for the losses incurred. This may mean that your personal assets may be at risk if it fails. The advantage is that you get to enjoy all profits. But it’s best to be sure about liability in advance. 
Get in touch with a business attorney to understand the different forms of business you can start. And discuss about the liability of each category. Once you are aware of the matter, you can make an informed decision about it. For an affordable solution in getting started with an attorney we recommend LegalZoom to get you started in the right direction.
Business Planning
You cannot be successful without a properly put together business plan. In reality it is a summary of how you want to organize your entrepreneurial endeavor and chart out the activities to make it successful. 
Talk to seasoned advisers and successful entrepreneurs, analyze examples and read up as much as you can before you make your business plan. You can also outsource it; but it won’t be of any use if you aren’t clear about each point of the plan. 
Understanding the Target Market
When you decide to start a new business, the first thing you need to identify is who will you sell your product or service to. This decided, you need to find out the way in which your product or service will be of use to them. 
Ample research and detailed understanding of the target market are essential before you begin. This will help you come up with a business plan that works. And will also help you to decide the marketing strategies you need to put in place to attract them. 
Starting a new business is a huge task; and you need to put in 110% of your effort to achieve real success. 
The perks and benefits of owning and operating your own business are quite attractive. However the flexibility to work on your own time will only arrive if you are willing to put in a good 60-80 hours per week until you are ready to hire help.
For an insightful and inspiring book on starting a new business I recommend the following:

70,7 Reasons Why Your Sales Skills Suck,14/8/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-reasons-why-your-sales-skills-suck/,"
7 Reasons Why Your Sales Skills Suck
Every business needs to sell. And to do it, every entrepreneur needs to possess specific sales skills. You may be quite good at every other aspect of managing a business, but if you suck at sales, you won’t be as successful as you wish for. 
How do you know whether your sales skills are good enough? To do it, you have to identify the signs that spell otherwise. With this knowledge, you can get rid of the negative sales behavior and focus on the positive points. 
Let’s take a look at the 7 reason why your sales skills suck: 
Failure to identify prospects: Are you still stuck with cold calling your prospects? The sales world has come a long way since then, and if you cannot keep up with the changes, you are in for failure. 
Newer avenues of prospecting have come up; requesting for referrals, speaking at events, writing a blog, participating in an association, collaborating with a complementary business, and many others make it much easier to land new prospects.   
No track of sales activities: Another sure sign of deficiency of sales skill is when you don’t keep track of whatever’s happening in this area. And just periodic updates of your sales activities aren’t adequate. 
Continuous tracking of sales activities keeps you on top of the numbers and figures. It ensures that you are capable of identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the sales team. Also, it helps you spot any problematic areas in the sales cycles. 
Improper communication: Asking the right questions is important; asking something such as ‘what’s your budget?’ won’t really engage a potential customer. A suitable alternative will be to focus on how much the challenges are costing the prospect. 
Communication is a two-way thing – if you just talk, and never listen, it will be of no use. Only when you pay attention to what a prospect says, will you be able to tailor your approach to match their needs and demands. 
Too much focus on quantity: Do you focus more on the number of prospects you contact or on whether you can get most of them to close the sale? If you have the former approach, it won’t be the best thing to do. 
Consider this – will you like it better if you can call up 100 prospects in a day even if most won’t even listen to you? Or will it be better if you can focus on 25 prospects and tailor your approach so that most of them lead to sales? The answer’s pretty obvious. 
Zero presentation skills: Preparation is the key to good sales presentations. If you spend less than 10-20 minutes on each prospect, you won’t have appropriate and adequate idea about the approach to take. 
Instead of preparing a general presentation for every prospect, focus on customizing your approach to fit the prospect in front of you. Take your time to understand the challenges of the prospect and focus on how your solution helps them overcome it. 
Emphasis on wrong prospects: Sometimes, a prospect remains a prospect – forever. Even if it’s a really lucrative prospect, it won’t do your business any good for the simple reason that it will never end up as a sale. 
How do you identify a wrong prospect? If the delays become incessant, and the closure doesn’t come even after a considerable time (this depends on your business type), it is perhaps best to move on to the next potential customer. 
Improper handling of objections: It’s not always smooth sailing when it comes to sales. But you have to learn how to handle the hurdles in a smooth manner too. Prospects will have objections; and you need to learn how to handle them.
Before you offer a solution, ask for permission to do it. If you aren’t sure, clarify it beforehand. And always be understanding and respectful. You aren’t supposed to be impartial, but don’t be too biased either. 
Slowly Getting rid of these 7 reasons why your sales skills suck overtime will help you strengthen your ability to close.
Are you looking for some awesome books on fresh sales tips, tactics, and takeaways?
I recommend you to take a listen to my episodes on the following books:
1) Pitching and Closing by Alex Taub

71,Latest Books For Entrepreneurs in August 2014,4/8/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/latest-books-entrepreneurs-august-2014/,"
Latest Books For Entrepreneurs in August 2014
The Entrepreneurs Library presents the latest books for entrepreneurs in August 2014. These books are brand new to the market and the authors are in line to share their insights with me. Stay tuned this month for the release of the interviews with these great books and the authors.
The Art of Shouting Quietly: A Guide to Self-Promotion for Introverts and Other Quiet Souls by Pete Mosley
The Art Of Shouting Quietly is about helping people name the beasts that hold them back – and to systematically engage with and overcome them.
This book illustrates how this can be done – with insights into what the blocks actually are, how to take responsibility for them, and how to stop blaming others for your own lack of progress. Every reader, I’m sure, will find something in the content that they will relate strongly to in respect of the obstacles and challenges in their own life.
With a solid foundation beneath it, however, confidence becomes significantly harder to rock and easier to recover when it is shaken. These foundations have many components – many more than I list here – but here are the most important ones.
    Belief in yourself.
    Understanding your place in the world – and what you were put on the planet to do.
    Being true to yourself and your values.
    Knowing that you have the power and freedom to shape your own sense of what is (and is not) possible.
    Having a strong sense of plan and purpose.
    Knowing where your support lies.
    Developing the skill of asking for help in a structured way and understanding that this is not a sign of weakness.
    Knowing how to show up and share your gift in a way that sits comfortably with your values and mindset.

Traction: A Startup Guide to Getting Customers by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares
The number one traction mistake founders and employees make is not dedicating as much time to developing traction as they do developing product. This shortsighted approach has startups eventually trying random tactics — some ads, a blog post or two — in an unstructured way that will most likely fail.
We developed our traction framework called Bullseye with the help of the founders behind several of the biggest companies and organizations in the world like Jimmy Wales (Wikipedia), Alexis Ohanian (Reddit), Paul English (Kayak.com) and Alex Pachikov (Evernote). We interviewed over forty successful founders and researched countless more traction stories — pulling out the repeatable tactics and strategies they used to get traction.

That’s what Ben Arment does in his transformative coaching class, which has helped hundreds of people reinvent their lives to enjoy greater enthusiasm and fulfillment while also making a living.
Now he’s sharing his best insights, advice, and inspiring true stories in Dream Year. You’ll find out how people just like you are discovering (or rediscovering) what they were truly born to do, then following a proven process to make it real. And you’ll meet men and women such as . . .
Chuck Templeton, who created an online reservation system, OpenTable, that now serves more than thirty thousand restaurants worldwide.
Katie Strandlund, who launched her own event-planning business and developed a full and deeply gratifying client list.
Fabien Riggall, who combined his love for film and theater into a unique experience called Secret Cinema, which has reached 120,000 people.
Hilary Barnett, who started a social media company that now employs several team members and creates content for national brands.
There’s no dream too big to be beyond the power of the Dream Year process.
“The employee mind-set is disappearing like the factories where it was born. We’ll all expire if we wait for some force outside ourselves—business or government—to bring us jobs or teach us who we are or how we ought to live. Ben Arment’s Dream Year is a powerful launching pad for that mental reboot. Start here.” —Steven Pressfield, author of The War of Art, Do the Work, and The Legend of Bagger Vance

72,The Secret History of Entrepreneurs 20 Years Ago To Now,30/7/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/secret-history-entrepreneurs-20-years-ago-now/,"
The Secret History of Entrepreneurs 20 Years Ago To Now
Let’s imagine for a second that Time Travel is possible [theoretically it is possible though] and it is possible to travel back to 1994. What world are you going to behold? The idea seems very tempting but the million dollar question is what differences as an entrepreneur are you going to observe? Forget about searching in Google because in 1994, the idea of Internet was in its infancy. Only the fortunate few had the opportunity to take a sneak peek of the virtual world. Let’s go back in time to take a peak at the secret history of entrepreneurs. 
Promoting a product or service 20 years back was a different ball game altogether. There were no such tools like UserTesting in those days and that means getting direct and impartial feedback from your targeted audience was out of question. In simple English, you would have found yourself stuck in the middle of nowhere and the only way you would have been able to promote your products or service was by approaching the targeted customers directly. 
It feels so strange that 20 years ago entrepreneurs had to face so many different hurdles in their day-to-day activities and still they managed to meet deadlines and expand their business. Thankfully, we can manage and overcome those hurdles easily by tapping into some productivity apps already installed on our iPhone. Even phone connectivity was not wide spread on those days. You literally had to meet people in person, talk to them and try to convince them that your service/product is going to help them fix things. Yup, in those days, you had to do it all by yourself. Posters, leaflets, business cards used to do wonder in those days. You might find it amusing but customers used to call companies in order to gather more information about the products in those days. 
Solo entrepreneurs were experimenting with new ideas, bringing in new products, and exploring new opportunities. During the last leg of the 20th century, we have seen entrepreneurs with remarkably amazing visions coming out of their closets. We have seen the birth of Google [currently the world’s most popular search engine], we have also seen the rise of the Amazon group and we have witnessed growth of space age entrepreneurs like Peter Diamandis of Planetary Resources. In short, we have seen it all. 
Some of them are immensely successful whereas some of them failed to make it big, but one thing is certain that entrepreneurs have shaped the way we see the world today. However, there is a fundamental difference between today’s entrepreneurship with that of entrepreneurship of yesteryear.
Ten or twenty years ago, the concept of research and development was largely limited to big corporate organizations, but things have changed quite rapidly in the past few years.  Nowadays even small companies, thanks to the investment by venture capitalists, can spend more time on research and development which is definitively something positive.  
Entrepreneurial activities in the late 20th century were not that much complicated and they used to focus on short term solutions to ensure long term success because of the lack of tools to gauge the market conditions those days. But thanks to the massive penetration of internet service in the first half of the 21st century, entrepreneurial activities have become less complicated, less time consuming and less intimidating. 
Of course internet and the massive development in the field of technology have leveled the playing fields for new entrants. Previously idea of entrepreneurship was only limited to few influential people who dared to try new things, but things have changed dramatically. Now anyone with a computer and internet connection can start an affiliate business right from the comfort of his home. Is that not remarkable?
So, technically speaking, the style and history of entrepreneurs might have changed over the years, but the spirit has remained the same.

73,The Advantages of Technology in the Life of an Entrepreneur,22/7/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/advantages-technology-life-entrepreneur/,"
The Advantages of Technology in the Life of an Entrepreneur
Entrepreneurs are the driving force that keeps our economy rolling. But the life of an entrepreneur is not that rosy.  They have to take an insane amount of risk, swim against the tide and have to come up with new ideas to emerge as successful entrepreneurs. As evident, managing all these different activities simultaneously is immensely tough. Just like any other human beings, Entrepreneurs are also in need some assistance so that they can do their job in an efficient way. Thanks to the massive advancement in the field of technology in the past few decades, lives of the entrepreneurs have become much easier. Here in this article, let’s take a look at how the advantages of technology can play an important part in entrepreneurship: 
Marketing 
What good is a business if nobody knows about it? Every entrepreneur knows it very well that the message of their business organizations need to be delivered to their targeted audience at any cost. Unless people know about your product or service, you simply can’t expect your business to survive for long. 
Distributing leaflets, participating in events, talking with people on the street etc are definitely effective but it will need lot of manpower and money. Thanks to technology, we don’t have to knock on every door that comes along the way. We can try Mailchimp instead.  It is cool way to send newsletters to your customers. Maybe you should try Google Ads to reach out to customers when they are searching on the web or browsing other websites. 
Market Research
Market research is the best way to understand what your targeted audience actually want and avoid a disaster. Without a proper market study, you will find yourself tasked with the job of selling refrigerator to Eskimos. 
Traditional market research methods are still effective and should never be replaced with online tools. However, going out in the street, meeting people, asking for their opinions, getting them filled out long form etc is really tough these days given the fact that most people are extremely busy these days. 
So, let’s take a short route. You can do some market research online by using Google Global Market Finder.  You can do market research by country or by language. The tool gives you a fair idea about how many people are searching with a term in a specific region. Say for example, if nobody is searching for ‘solar cooker’ in a locality, it means that not many people are interested in it. However, if your product is unique, this tool might not prove this much effective. 
Social Media
Since you are an entrepreneur, you have to stay connected to other influential people on different social media channels. Also you need to keep these channels updated whenever you can. Now, managing all these different social channels is too much to handle for an entrepreneur. Try Ping.fm to manage all your social media accounts instead. It comes loaded with a single control panel. It can be integrated with Facebook and Twitter seamlessly, which is an added advantage. 
Tracking 
Tracking the tasks at hand, meeting deadlines etc are very difficult because of the hectic lifestyle we are leading. You might find yourself lost and may miss out on deadline. Probably, you are in need of Basecamp – a cool project management collaboration tool. This tool has been embraced by both big and small businesses around the world. Basecamp is inarguably affordable, easy to use and intuitive. It helps you keep track on things and also allows other people to collaborate with you. 
So, it would not be off the mark to say that the advantages of technology are shaping the lives of the entrepreneurs and also the way, they used to work. Embrace it and you will be okay.

74,5 Interesting Types of Book Readers,11/7/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-interesting-types-book-readers/,"
5 Interesting Types of Book Readers
Do you spend days and nights with your favorite reads? Or, you cannot finish even the slimmest volume in weeks? Or, perhaps you love listening to stories rather than reading them? Different people have different styles when it comes to reading.
And with the different types of reads available, it isn’t much difficult to lay your hands on the right book. But before you start your search for what to read next, let’s take a look at the styles people have when it comes to reading.
Check out these 5 interesting types of book readers to figure out which one describes you:
The Lover. You have rows of books on the shelves, stacks of them on every available surface, and some lying open on your bed too! You love to visit the bookstore, the library, and any place that have your favorite friends – books.
You love the feel of crisp, fresh pages of the new ones, and the smell of the smudged pages of the hand-me-downs, and every other read you can lay your hands on. And you don’t just hoard them, you read and re-read them too.
What do you read next? Anything you can find; you sure are lucky!
The Critic. You read books, not because you love them, but because you love to criticize them. For you, no art is perfect, and so every volume, and every author, must have one or more loopholes that ordinary readers cannot identify.
You especially love to tear down to pieces the hyped books that come to the market, to prove that they were not really worthy of the hype and the wait. But you do it only in front of people who have that mental caliber to match your intellect.
What do you read next? Well, take up any new, and much-hyped, volume, to censure.

The Expert. You read a lot, but that doesn’t mean it’s for the love of books. It’s for the love of discoursing on your reads that inspires you to do it. You aren’t the cynic who censures, but the connoisseur who discusses, over and over again.
It can be great conversation with like-minded individuals but do keep it within tolerable limit. Otherwise, you are just perceived as a show-off who talks a lot about their love for books but doesn’t really do anything to justify all that talk.
The Exhibitionist. You never read books. You just have a display case, or maybe even a library if you can afford it, full of them because they add to the pleasantness of your interior décor. And they show you off as an aficionado.
Don’t take it to heart; some of you do have the intention to read up at least a few of the books you bought, but never find the opportunity to do it. The solution is easy; just set aside an hour for reading every day. You’ll be surprised at how great books are!
What do you read first? Any slim volume of short stories or novellas is best to begin with.
The Nonconformist. Have you read ‘The Potter’s Eye: Art and Tradition in North Carolina Pottery’ by Mark Hewitt? Or, ‘Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World’ by Margaret MacMillan, Richard Holbrooke (Foreword)? Most wouldn’t even have heard of them!
And these are precisely what this category of book readers love, titles otherwise unknown to the rest of the world. Their interest is diverse, and they take reading seriously. Well, it’s not a bad habit; but you sure are missing on a lot of other stuff too.
What interesting type of book reader are you?

Startup Mixology by Frank Gruber
Startup Mixology is first and foremost a book about turning your ideas into action. From the cofounder of media company Tech Cocktail, a veteran entrepreneur and investor who was named one of the most connected people in tech, this book covers the basic “ingredients” of winning entrepreneurship. No abstract theories here — it shows you how to tackle everything from idea generation to launch to marketing to funding and how to start getting things done.
Once you’ve taken that first step, the journey has only begun. Startup Mixology tells it like it is — and it’s not easy!

76,7 Unique Styles Of Entrepreneurs,3/7/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/7-unique-styles-entrepreneurs/,"
7 Unique Styles Of Entrepreneurs
What makes an entrepreneur? The ability to transform an idea or innovation into a successful enterprise is what distinguishes a style of an entrepreneur. But, unlike what you may think, not all entrepreneurs are created equal. 
Different approaches, different goals, different attitudes make different entrepreneurs. And the differences may not be as pronounced at all times. The question is – do you know which kind of entrepreneur you are? 
Before you find out the answer, let’s take a look at the 7 unique styles of entrepreneurs: 
Wannabes – Well, they always want to get out of their regular work life and make something big. But that is all they do – they theorize. Wannabe entrepreneurs are always full of ideas about how they can make money only if they had some funds or resources.
The basic idea behind their grand schemes is to get out of their life as an employee at an organization. They are lured by the enticement of freedom, choice and success; but without the capabilities and skills, they always remain where they are. 
Survivalists – When it is all about survival, little or no long-term benefits can be achieved. And this is exactly what happens to this category of entrepreneurs. They work just to keep their ventures afloat. 
Be it a shop selling trinkets and accessories or a professional offering plumbing service, if they don’t have any long-term goals, they will just survive on their daily earnings. And never turn their efforts into a successful venture. 
Managers – It’s good to have some experience of working in a startup before you venture out on your own. But if you are stuck in that role, you will never work on your business; you will always work in it instead. 
The focus of managerial entrepreneurs is on the day-to-day work of the entire team. And they fail to pay attention to the other important aspects of it. And that’s why their businesses remain good, but never become great. 
Innovators – If you can think on your feet, you have the ability to face and handle different, and difficult, situations. An innovator can do this. When Edison said “I haven’t failed, I’ve found 10,000 ways that don’t work”, he meant it. 
The attitude is what distinguishes an innovator from a failure. Even Bill Gates failed with his initial venture Traf-O-Data. But he didn’t give up, and went on to become one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all times. 
Revolutionaries – What is your goal as an entrepreneur? It’s good to focus on how you can change the world. But as an entrepreneur, you have to focus on other, and more, urgent issues at hand. 
For an entrepreneur, it is important to pay attention to profits. And then you have all the opportunity to focus on the good to mankind. But if you take the other way round, you are in for some serious trouble. 
Calculators – In a similar fashion, if your sole focus is on the money you make, you’ll soon be swallowed up by the figures. Ending up like Uncle Scrooge thinking about profits won’t be such a nice thing, after all. 
The best idea is to maintain a rational balance. Don’t get it wrong; it’s important to get profits if you wish to succeed as an entrepreneur. But it’s also important to focus on the other points such as innovation in products, betterment of services, and so on. 
Opportunists – It doesn’t sound too good. But it is perhaps the best approach you can take to be a successful entrepreneur. These entrepreneurs think about the chief reason behind their desire – many love the freedom to do what they want. 
They also consider the chances of success of their idea or innovation. And then look for opportunities to make an entrance into the specific industry and the niche. And once they find it, they follow a stepwise process to turn their idea into a successful endeavor. 
Lifestyle entrepreneurs do what they love and love what they do and become successful.

77,3 Advantages of Guerrilla Marketing Every Owner Should Know,26/6/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/3-advantages-guerrilla-marketing-every-owner-know/,"
3 Advantages of Guerrilla Marketing Every Owner Should Know
The competition in the business world is fierce, and it’s hard to come by the profits you aim for. This is especially true for small businesses which don’t have huge resources to invest in marketing at their disposal. That’s why you need to get creative. 
Guerrilla marketing techniques involve low cost campaigns that aim at promoting products or services to a smaller demographic. But the novelty lies in the approach – they use unconventional and surprise methods to do this. 
What good can it do for your business? Let’s identify the real advantages of guerrilla marketing. 
Enhance customer base. Guerrilla marketing aims at three things – attracting new customers, urging old customers to buy again, and making them pay money for more. But they do it in a way that surprises and delights them. 
Suppose you own a café. A good strategy to attain profits will be to offer free cookies with coffee for a customer who comes in with two friends. You will earn three customers at one go, and will benefit from the deal. 
Or, suppose you have a salon. To attract people, offer a free pedicure with a beauty treatment package. It will lure them in, enhance your customer base and add to the profits too. And the cost of the free item service won’t matter when you get more customers. 
Create collaborations. Guerrilla marketing doesn’t always involve freebies. You can think up as many ways as you can to achieve your goals. Try to have collaboration with another business that attracts the same customers as your business does. 
Suppose a florist shop is just around the corner on the same street of that of your café. Why not try to collaborate with them? Offer a discount coupon for your treats for people who buy flowers from them. And in turn, attract their customers to your café. 
Competition exists. And it will always do. But if you can come up with advantageous collaborations and manage to implement your guerrilla marketing tactics to them, every participant can profit from it. Just give free reign to your creativity. 
Best of all – save money! Traditional methods of marketing require ample money, be it a print ad or an online one. The greatest advantage of guerrilla marketing is that the methods are almost always low or even no cost. That means a serious saving. 
Any business can create a Facebook page and promote products or services on it. And you can also circulate your innovative ideas on it. It will be much easier to spread the word about your latest offer and that too at no additional cost. 
Also, most guerrilla marketing tactic isn’t dependent on much for success. Do you really need to have huge money or resources to announce a promotion that anyone wearing pink on a particular day of the week will get a free dessert? No, you don’t!
So, where do you start? Well, do it whenever and wherever you want. 
The basic tenet of guerrilla marketing is to surprise the customers. And whether you dress up or ask them to dress up, whether you arrange a raffle or organize a tasting session, it won’t have too much effect on your monetary resources. 
Just ask your employees to come up with marketing ideas that don’t need to spend much. Engage in brainstorming sessions. You will be surprised at the suggestions you may get. Also, take a cue from businesses that have done it with success. 
And keep in mind, guerrilla marketing isn’t just for small businesses. Any business can use unconventional means to attract customers, new and old. And they can also make profits, not just revenue.
For a great book in reference to the advantages of guerrilla marketing, we recommend “Guerrilla Marketing in 30 Days” by Jay Conrad Levinson and Al Lautenslager.

78,5 Steps to Promote Innovation in the Workplace,19/6/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-steps-to-promote-innovation-in-the-workplace/,"
5 Steps to Promote Innovation in the Workplace
Is innovation essential for your start-up? The answer is short and simple – YES! And it’s not just in the product that you need to innovate; you need to promote innovation in the workplace. And this is only possible if you have the right attitude. 
How do you promote innovation in the workplace? Before you take the steps to attain this goal, you need to understand the basic difference between creativity and innovation. Creativity involves ideas while innovation implies the implementation of these ideas. 
Let’s take a look at the steps you need to take to promote innovation at the workplace. 
Step 1: Cultivate the right attitude. If your employees are just too afraid to speak up in front of you, they won’t bother to share their ideas with you. Cultivate the right attitude; not that of a ‘boss’, but that of a ‘leader’. 
Make sure your employees look up to you, and feel free to discuss whatever innovations they think will do good to the organization. It will open the floodgates of ideas and approaches; and your business will benefit from their endeavors. 
Step 2: Hire the right people. Individuals who love what they do and look forward to work are the best choices. Hire them. Look for passionate, focused people who believe in dreams and have the capability to achieve them too. 
Also, keep in mind that your team members share the same vision about the organization, the product and the service. This will align their goals with yours and the team will work together as a single unit instead of an assortment of individual units. 
Step 3: Re-imagine workplace environment. Today’s workplaces are maddening – what with the continuous emails, calls, conferences. Make sure the work environment is relaxed and cheerful. It will ensure the best from every team member. 
Rethink the conventional pattern; a 9 to 5 routine in an office with whitewashed walls may not be the best place for innovative thoughts. A flexible approach works out to be a better option. Consider how to get the best from your entire team. 
Step 4: Encourage employees. Put together a team of individuals with different capabilities, approaches and backgrounds. And welcome solutions to innovate sectors of the organization. It need not be about the innovation of the product only. 
Allocate time for brainstorming sessions and urge people to be part of them. Training sessions to learn innovation techniques such as mind-mapping or lateral thinking may also prove to be advantageous for the employees at your organization. 
Step 5: Reward innovation. Just persuading people to be innovative won’t do; you need to offer an incentive for them to do it on their own accord. An awards scheme to recognize the innovation in your employees can be an ideal way to do it. 
It is not the reward but the recognition that matters. And also keep in mind that you need to enhance your tolerance levels to put up with mistakes. Give people the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. Don’t put off innovations, even if the ideas don’t always work out. 
With a little effort, you will be able to create a work environment that promotes innovation. 
Successful businesses don’t depend on a handful of people to come up with improvements. Instead, they create an environment conducive to the promotion of innovation. And this results in their success – not only in their products or services, but in every aspect. 
Encouragement and empowerment of employees is important to attain this goal. And you need to have the right approach to make it real. Focus on how your employees can be at their best; and they will do their best for the organization too.
For a great book in reference, we recommend Ken Tencer’s piece entitled “Cause A Disturbance.”

79,5 Personal Qualities That Make Up a Lifestyle Entrepreneur,17/6/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-personal-qualities-make-lifestyle-entrepreneur/,"
5 Personal Qualities That Make Up a Lifestyle Entrepreneur
When you organize a business and assume responsibility for its success or setback, you become an entrepreneur. But what makes someone a lifestyle entrepreneur? It is essentially the basic premise of placing passion before profit. 
One marked distinction between an entrepreneur and a lifestyle entrepreneur lies in their attitude towards money. While an entrepreneur is in pursuit of profits, a lifestyle entrepreneur is satisfied with just ‘enough’ of it. 
A lifestyle entrepreneur loves what they do and do what they love, even if it means a little less money. 
Their focus is more on the lifestyle advantages that working on their own businesses offer – being at home with family, flexible working hours, satisfying creative spirits, working with people they want to, or for other such reasons. 
But not everyone can be a lifestyle entrepreneur. It requires specific personal traits. Along with the urge to make a business out of their passion, they also need to have the right kind of attitude and approach to ensure their success. 
To be a successful lifestyle entrepreneur you need to have the right personal qualities. 
Independent
An independence of spirit is essential to succeed as an entrepreneur. And it is indispensable for a lifestyle entrepreneur. Your will to do something on your own, to put your passion into practice, and earn from it, is your only driving force. 
Take for example the homemaker who bakes cookies as gifts for her family and friends. And she loves it. She will be happy to continue doing it. But with an independence of spirit and a goal to do something, she may very well start a business of handcrafted cookies. 
Flexible
One of the reasons individuals want to have their own businesses is the flexibility they get with regard to working hours. But again, flexibility in approach is another personal characteristic that a lifestyle entrepreneur needs to possess. 
Be it selling a product or providing a service, you need to strategize according to your target market, your industry, and your customer. If you aren’t flexible enough to adjust your tactics to the variable situations, you won’t be able to achieve success. 
Resilient
Lifestyle entrepreneurs aren’t in pursuit of money. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t bothered about it. The only factor is that they are satisfied with just enough for their efforts. But again, they aren’t broken down by their failures. 
Resilience of character is an essential trait of such an individual. They are equally capable of handling a success (which don’t go to their heads) as well as a failure (which doesn’t crush them). They treat them as stepping stones on their path to do what they want to. 
Committed
When you decide to become a lifestyle entrepreneur, don’t just proceed without a plan. Focus on being the best in whatever you plan to do. And plan it well before you even take the first step. 
Your first task is to decide what you want to do. Make a note of what points you will want in your new venture. After you identify the right business, do your research about the industry and the target market. Look for opportunities and make use of them. 
Realistic
Not every one of your wishes will be fulfilled. You need to understand this. If you think that you will achieve success in six or twelve months, it is just a plan for disappointment. A successful lifestyle entrepreneur is one who is realistic. 
It is a good idea to set goals. But extend the bigger ones over a span of time. And you will be able to achieve them. Set unachievable goals and you are bound to be let down. Lifestyle entrepreneurs know this, and maintain a realistic approach to attain success.
For a great book in reference, we recommend Jesse Krieger’s piece entitled “Lifestyle Entrepreneur: Live Your Dreams, Ignite Your Passions and Run Your Business From Anywhere in The World.”

80,5 Reasons Why Every Entrepreneur Should Read Books,9/6/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/5-reasons-every-entrepreneur-read-books/,"
5 Reasons Why Every Entrepreneur Should Read Books
Be it a children’s fable, a book of poems for the hopeless romantics, or a how-to guide, a book is one companion you cannot do without, whatever stage of life you are in. But is it any good for an entrepreneur? The simple answer is – yes. 
Whether you are planning to start a new business or are already managing one, reading can be a great habit. If you haven’t inculcated it yet, it’s high time to do so. Also, don’t let time constraints hinder you from reading. It will only do you good. 
Why is reading a good habit for entrepreneurs? Here are 5 reasons for this. 
Reason 1: It enhances conversational skills: Well, Dale Carnegie’s ‘How to Win Friends & Influence People’ remains a bestseller still today! Whether it’s in the personal or professional space, communication is of paramount importance for success. 
And when it comes to entrepreneurship, a little communication error can lead to big trouble. 
‘Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High’ by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler is another good example of how a book can enhance your conversational skills and help you win over challenging situations. 
Reason 2: It helps understand leadership: Are leaders born? Or, are they made? What makes a great leader? What differentiates a good leader from a great one? A book can give you the answers you seek. And help you identify and hone our leadership capabilities. 
‘Strengths Based Leadership’ by Tom Rath is an excellent choice in this regard. 
Based on a broad survey of great leaders and their followers, this book is quite an eye-opener. Another good read is ‘Leaders Eat Last’ by Simon Sinek. Here he takes up the question of the way leaders achieve what they seek. 
Reason 3: It offers business insights: Whether you need to craft an organizational blueprint, guide the people in your team or handle the numbers, the right books can help you attain the knowledge you want to effectively manage every aspect of your business. 
A good example is the bestseller ‘Good to Great’ by Jim Collins. 
In it, he elucidates what distinguishes a good company from a great one. And how a good one can become great by following the right methods such as identifying their best qualities, confronting harsh business realities, building and maintaining pace. 
Reason 4: It facilitates work-life balance: When you start a business on your own, your entire focus is on it. And often your personal life suffers. This imbalance created by the pressures of work and life compelled Arianna Huffington to write ‘Thrive’. 
In it, she redefines success, with the third metric of well-being, along with power and money.
Co-founder and President of Huffington Post, Arianna Huffington was the epitome of success, if you consider it from the perspectives of power and wealth. But her physical and mental self were suffering. That’s when she discovered the third metric of success – well-being. 
Reason 5: It keeps you on track: ‘The E-Myth Revisited’ by Michael E. Gerber is a soul-stirrer for entrepreneurs. In it, he identifies the biggest myth of entrepreneurship – that it is something heroic, a superhuman effort to overcome obstacles and attain success. 
It’s a reality check; it takes you through the stages of a business, from its birth to success. 
Another superb book is ‘The 4-Hour Workweek’ by Tim Ferriss. If you don’t take the title quite literally, you can sure gain knowledge about how to work smart instead of how to work hard. And achieve success with this method too. 
Just take your pick and learn from the people who have been there, done that.

81,How To Find The Right Book For You,10/5/2014,Cody Faldyn,https://www.theelpodcast.com/how-to-find-the-right-book-for-you/,"
How To Find The Right Book For You
You may have been a bookworm when you were at school or college, but with the mounting pressures of work and life, this habit may wane. And it is even more probable if you had to manage your own business. But it isn’t the right thing to do. 
Don’t give up on the habit of reading. And to help you find the right book, here is a guide. 
Step 1: Understand your personality.
Some individuals are born leaders. Some hone their skills and inculcate these qualities to become leaders. The books you read need to match your personality. The question is – do you know your personality type? 
If you are the ‘mechanic’, you will love to learn about new things and how things work. But if you are the ‘visionary’, you need to find books that offer an insight into creative minds, original ideas and innovative thoughts. 
‘The Art of the Start’ by Guy Kawasaki is a good choice for the former, while ‘The Art of Innovation’ by Tom Kelley with Jonathan Littman is a more appropriate option for people with the second personality type. 
Step 2: Identify your preference. 
If you are in for some light reading, you may find some business books to be a tad monotonous. Opt for something else, something that comes with lighthearted anecdotes or real life stories. 
A good example is ‘The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future’ by Chris Guillebeau. With case studies and anecdotes, this book excites and entertains, and educates too!
Again, if you want some serious study, opt for ‘Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap…and Others Don’t’ by Jim Collins. The approach you have needs to match the approach of your read. 
Step 3: Learn about the author. 
Now, what makes a great author? Someone who has been there done that can be a great choice. A good example is Harvey B. Mackay. At age 26, he bought a failing envelope company. And turned it into a multimillion dollar corporation! 
When you learn about his successes, you sure want to reach out and grab his book ‘Swim with the Sharks without Being Eaten Alive’. If you want to learn how to succeed at anything, this sure is the book to go to. 
Another good idea is to check out the books written by renowned names. A good example is ‘The E-Myth Revisited’ by Michael E. Gerber. With years of experience as a small business consultant and author, his ideas can be quite an eye-opener for many. 
Step 4: Check reader reviews. 
Well, this is perhaps the easiest thing to do. Just log in to Google, and get a look at what people think about a book you plan to read. But remember, likes and dislikes are subjective. 
While a person may love the approach a specific author has, another person may not. And while it is a good idea to get a glimpse of what others think about a book before you read it, it may not be the best thing to do. 
Why do it then? For the simple reason, you are already hard pressed for time. If you take up a book that you don’t like, it will mean a waste of time. Again, if you were aware of the negative reader reviews, you may never pick it up to read. 
Step 5: Take your pick. 
Once you have understood your personality and your preference, and checked the options available, it is time to choose one. Don’t fret; pick the book that seems appropriate. And start reading!
