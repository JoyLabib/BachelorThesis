0,Indifferent overhead,"April 28, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/indifferent-overhead/,"Every business and individual has overhead. The bills we have to pay and the costs we incur that aren’t directly related to our income. You pay them whether or not you’re busy. But there are two kinds of overhead, worth differentiating: Different overhead … the investments that help you and your product or service become better for your customers. When you pay rent in a neighborhood that makes it easier for people to get to you, that rent increases your appeal. Indifferent overhead is just as it sounds–the money you’re spending that isn’t noticed by the people you serve. A direct way to create the freedom you need to do the work you want to do is to make your indifferent overhead as low as you possibly can. If the customers don’t care, perhaps we shouldn’t either. "
1,"Manipulation, indoctrination and addiction","April 27, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/manipulation-indoctrination-and-addiction/,"They’re often related. It’s not unusual for someone to have more experience or knowledge than we do. If they use that knowledge to their benefit, not ours, they might be manipulating us. If we knew what they knew, we wouldn’t have gone along. This is the difference between a generous teacher and a hustler. Indoctrination is the repeated effort to get people to believe something, often something that’s not useful or correct. It starts early, it’s repeated and it’s built into the culture. When peer pressure is added to manipulation, we often end up with indoctrination into systems of belief that aren’t helpful. Learning to thrive in a resilient culture is essential. Being indoctrinated into a rigid and fragile mindset is not. And addiction is often sold to us. It’s a shortcut to profit and power for many. Ingrained habits that fuel businesses or movements are designed to be sticky manipulations. Better for them than for you. The easiest way to deal with any of the three is to avoid them. The hard part is that once they begin, they create the conditions where it’s ever more difficult to stop. Call it out when you see it. Ask who benefits. Go slow. If it’s still a good idea tomorrow, it’ll still be a good idea tomorrow. "
2,Books don’t sell,"April 26, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/books-dont-sell/,"That’s not true, actually. Books sell, but book doesn’t. The odds of a particular book selling a lot of copies are close to zero. The truth of the long tail is that most titles are way out on the fringe. Now that book publishing is unleashed from retail distribution, the math is hard to avoid. There were more than 450,000 new titles issued last year according to Bookscan. A title is a book in a specific format–so the audio counts as separate from the hardcover, etc. To be conservative, you can triple the sales numbers here, to account for digital and audio formats of the same title. If we narrow that down to the 45,000 books published by the largest publishers—books that by every definition are not self-published, and that required a team to create—we get this chart (click to enlarge): Only 163 books sold more than 100,000 copies. That’s fewer than one out of every 250 titles published.  That’s a pretty low bar: 100,000 is the population of Roanoke, Virginia. If we halve that goal, we only add another 320 books. This means that every time the smartest minds in book publishing spend time, money and effort to publish 900 books, one of them approaches the status of a hit.  (And in this case, a hit is simply one book for every person in Pocatello, Idaho.) You could open a bookstore that carries every current hit in every format and you’d only need a few bookcases. On the other end of the scale, we see that 85% of all traditional books published last year sold fewer than 5,000 copies each in their format. Those are extraordinarily bad odds. Books matter. Making them is a combination of craft and insight. Publishing them is a generous act of faith. Adding to the corpus of shared knowledge is important. Books change the culture when people act on them, even if they don’t sell many copies. And sometimes the backlist surprises the accountants. But the economics of new books have nothing to do with any of these benefits. Scarcity made the book publishing world work as a business, and scarcity is gone. Write a book because you can and because it might make a difference. But don’t listen to your publisher’s suggestions simply to sell more copies. You probably won’t. "
3,Bottom of the funnel,"April 25, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/bottom-of-the-funnel/,"It’s easy to get focused on the public-facing mouth of the funnel. More followers. More impressions. More buzz, hype, promotion. Get the word out. Just about all the time people who call themselves “marketers” spend is on this. Don’t worry about what happens later, just pour more attention into the top. But the math is simple: Most of the people at the top leave long before they engage, buy or spread the word. Which means that doubling your conversion is exactly the same as doubling the number of people who are aware of you. It means that by the time you get to 20 people (out of 1,000) who are ready to become committed fans, each of these people is worth fifty times as much effort as you’d put into getting one new stranger to be aware of what you do. Don’t send a poorly-written mail merge to your best prospects. Send them a handwritten note. It’s not the bottom of the funnel. It’s the foundation for your future. "
4,“What’s the catch?”,"April 24, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/whats-the-catch/,"It’s an important question. Lots of opportunities come with one, and going in with your eyes open helps avoid problems later. Two challenges: Sometimes, a really good opportunity doesn’t actually have a catch. And spending a lot of time looking for one keeps us from the work we ought to be doing. And sometimes, a really exciting opportunity is so exciting we forget to look. And we should. "
5,Generational shifts in punditry,"April 23, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/generational-shifts-in-punditry/,"In 1970, when Walter Cronkite was narrating current events for the United States, he was 54 years old. Hitchcock made his last film when he was 77. When there’s a limited number of slots for narrators to fill, they can stick around for a long time. One of the overlooked cultural shifts of our time is that by dramatically expanding the number of slots (and removing the gatekeepers) we skipped twenty or thirty years. Now, there are writers, pundits, video stars and producers who aren’t being asked to wait two decades to have a voice. Existing media (like traditional book publishing or network TV) will hold on to proven voices for as long as it can, but new media (which now captures far more attention) has no mechanism for that. If it seems like it’s happening all at once, compared to history, it is. PS the big finale of the GOODBIDS auction launch week is ready. Get two Taylor Swift tickets (in Amsterdam in July) plus a travel budget. To benefit charity: water. The details are right here… "
6,What happened vs. what we do about it,"April 22, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/what-happened-vs-what-we-do-about-it/,"It’s possible to have a useful conversation about what to do about something that’s broken or needs improvement. But first, we must acknowledge that it happened. It’s not controversial to understand the facts, the data and the shifts that are happening in the world we live in. In fact, the only way to have a useful conversation about what to do about it is to understand and accept the reality of what’s here. Movements that deny reality choose to do this because they don’t have a better plan, and stalling is their best option. Which is no option at all. Today is Earth Day, which like Mother’s Day, shouldn’t be a day at all, more like an all-year-round celebration. Two years ago, hundreds of volunteers from 90 countries came together and produced an Almanac. Since then, the book has been translated into languages around the world (recently with a free edition in Spanish), been a bestseller from China to Italy to the Netherlands, and remained in the top 100 in its category in the US. And yet, it’s possible that you haven’t seen it yet, that your kids aren’t using it in school, that it’s not being handed out at community meetings or required reading at organizations large and small. Today would be a great day to share a copy. Here’s a talk from a year ago: Isn’t it better to know? "
7,Other people’s problems,"April 21, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/other-peoples-problems/,"It’s surprisingly easy to be generous and find solutions to our friend’s problems. Much easier than it is to do it for ourselves. Why? There are two useful reasons, I think. FIRST, because we’re unaware of all the real and imaginary boundaries our friends have set up. If it were easy to solve the problem, they probably would have. But they’re making it hard because they have decided that there are people or systems that aren’t worth challenging. Loosening the constraints always makes a problem easier to solve. And SECOND, because resistance is real. Solving the problem means moving ahead, confronting new, even scarier problems. It might be easier to simply stay where we are, marinating in our stuck. When we care enough to solve our own problem, we’ll loosen the unloosenable constraints and embrace the new challenges to come. "
8,ChatGPT is dumber than it looks,"April 20, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/chatgpt-is-dumber-than-it-looks/,"That’s not true for a screwdriver. Or a table saw or even a spatula. These are useful tools, but they don’t pretend to be well-informed or wise. They’re dumb, and they look dumb too. That’s one reason that tools are effective. We use them to leverage our effort, but we don’t trust them to do things that they’re not good at. The reason AI language models are dumb is that they don’t actually know anything, the model is simply calculating probabilities. Not about the unknown, but about everything. Each word, each sentence, is a statistical guess. I’ve switched mostly to claude.ai because it’s more effective and less arrogant, but it’s still guessing. If a guess is good enough, you’re set. If it’s not, plan accordingly. In my experience, the most useful approaches to AI are: Don’t ignore AI because it’s dumb. Figure out how to create patterns and processes where you can use it as the useful tool it’s becoming. "
9,The grid of inquiry,"April 19, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/the-grid-of-inquiry/,"Expertise and firmly held beliefs don’t always go together.  Here’s a simple XY grid to help us choose where to sit at whatever table we’re invited to: Plenty of well-trained professionals have earned the right to have strongly held beliefs. These convictions save them time and error, particularly if the world is stable. Surgeons, jugglers and historians make countless decisions, and they rarely have the time or resources to reconsider each underlying factor. This makes them efficient, but can also cause a field to get stuck. Fortunately, there are innovators. These are individuals with plenty of experience and training who have chosen to be flexible, to repeatedly ask ‘what if’ and ‘why’. When an innovator suggests a counter-intuitive or even nutty concept, it might pay to listen carefully. For most of us, most of the time, we have the chance to be curious. We don’t have a lot of domain knowledge, but we’re able to ask intelligent questions and to listen carefully to the answers. The hallmark of a curious person with goodwill is that they’re eager to change their minds. Alas, social media has elevated the foolish. People possessing little in the way of expertise, and generally unwilling to change their assertions or goals. Where do you sit? "
10,"Dreams, plans and contradictions","April 18, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/dreams-plans-and-contradictions/,"Dreams are fine. And dreams involve contradictions. We want this AND that, but both can’t happen. That’s what keeps them from being plans. Plans embrace boundaries and reality, they don’t ignore them. Plans thrive on scarcity and constraints. Plans are open for inspection, and a successful planner looks forward to altering the plans to make them more likely to become real. "
11,The blank page,"April 17, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/the-blank-page/,"Sometimes, we’re so afraid of creation that we don’t even leave blank pages around. If your workspace has a hole exactly the size of a creative idea in it, you’re more likely to fill the hole. When we decrease the number of steps to begin creating, and increase the expectation that something is going to arrive, it’s far more likely to happen. Book a recording studio. Leave the laptop open. Schedule a blog post. Make sure the whiteboard can be seen. Buy more blank canvasses than you need.  Blank pages beg to be filled, and it helps to have them around.

12,Refusing the salon of the refused,"April 16, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/refusing-the-salon-of-the-refused/,"This week is the 150th anniversary of the most important failed art exhibit of all time. It was organized by and featured artists who weren’t even among those that had a slot at the runner’s up exhibit for artists who weren’t featured in the real Salon in Paris. Manet didn’t have the guts to join them, so he participated in the ‘Refused’ exhibit. The others understood that a real change was possible. Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Degas, Berthe Morisot, Pissarro, Béliard, Guillaumin, Lepic, Levert, and Rourt all participated. They not only put their art in the show, they organized and paid for it.  A few lessons worth taking away: The first exhibit was a financial and critical failure. The show received fewer than 1% of the number of visitors that the mainstream salon benefitted from, and there were few reviews, most of them negative. They knew someone who had a building, and the empty space he offered them was enough of an instigator that it turned some maybes into yesses. Use it or lose it. One of the most positive things to come from the exhibit was a scathing satirical piece, the one that gave the impressionists their name. The insecure critics came to regret their inability to see what was possible. And yet, the artists persisted. Year after year, eight times, gaining momentum each time, they returned, working their way from outsiders to become the dominant form of artistic expression of their time. But most of all, so much easier today than in Paris 150 years ago, these individual painters did two things: They picked themselves and they did it together. Everyone wants to be picked, but no one wants to organize the collective ‘we’. It’s the ‘we’ that creates a school of thought, a movement, a network, a culture. Curate, connect, organize and lead. Who better than you? PS launched yesterday, a GOODBIDS auction for a very rare signed first edition of a nationwide bestseller.  A rare signed first edition of Remarkably Bright Creatures. A beloved bestseller, this one is signed by the author with a doodle of the novel’s star. And new auctions coming later today. "
13,Market pressure,"April 15, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/market-pressure/,"Every competitor faces pressure, and it varies by industry, consumer/investor segment and geography. This applies to services, products, ideas, organizations, jobs… whenever there’s a choice and a market. The pressure might push you to be: But it’s also possible to choose a marketplace that rewards: A real challenge is in trying to bring the desires of one segment to the other. That’s difficult indeed. Choose your customers, choose your future. "
14,Getting the word out,"April 14, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/getting-the-word-out-3/,"“How do you get the word out?” I’ve heard this from presidential candidates, from small business leaders and nonprofits as well. It’s easy to believe that the goal of marketing is to shout, hype, hustle and otherwise promote. It’s tempting to focus on your story as the top of the pyramid, and decide that your work is to share that story to everyone downstream, downwind or near you. Hire a PR firm, run some ads, post more on social media and hype and hustle. After all, it’s important. But that’s not how the world works, and it hasn’t worked that way since network TV started to fade a few decades ago. Ideas that spread win. Horizontally, not from the rooftops. When we build something that our users want to talk about, remarkable happens. Remarkable means worth making a remark about. This is the engine that GOODBIDS is built for. A nonprofit uses the permission asset they’ve built with their existing donors to let them know about an auction. That’s anticipated, personal and relevant, and backers are delighted to hear about it. And then what happens? If the auction is interesting to friends or colleagues, the supporters happily tell the others about it. They do it to earn free bids, or they do it to help a cause they care about, or they do it because spreading the word about something interesting, worthwhile or fun feels good. In the last four days, GOODBIDS users have shared our initial auctions with tens of thousands of people… not because someone made them do it, but because they wanted to. Today’s auctions: An official NASA Apollo 11 shoulder patch, identical to the one that Armstrong wore on the moon. It comes with a signed, limited edition of David Meerman Scott‘s brilliant book on the marketing of the race to the moon.  It also comes with a letter of authenticity. The patch is untouched, unflown and uncut. It will make your heart race and remind you of just how much we’re capable of when we work together with focus. Meeting Neil years ago made me cry, and I hope you’ll check this one out. A chance to have Simon Sinek and me on your podcast. We might not set any records, but we keep the crowd alert. And a hand-signed New York Giants helmet. It is difficult to ignore and something a fan would love to own. "
15,The digital barback,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/the-digital-barback/,"A barback supports the bartending staff. There are always clean glasses and fresh ingredients, ready to go. Having someone else do your mise en place can dramatically improve your productivity. And now, with a bit of effort, you can train an AI and a few systems to do it for you. If you won’t, your competition will. "
16,The perils of doing it live,"April 13, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/the-perils-of-doing-it-live/,"[Relevant aside: If you get this blog by email, apologies for the glitches of the last few days caused by my provider. If you ever see a broken link or something that doesn’t render, you can visit the blog. It always has the latest version, typos fixed. It’s much easier to fix the blog over time than it is to re-send an email due to an error. The irony of ‘live’ in this post is not lost on me. Thanks for your patience.] Charity auctions are an odd hybrid. They take a lot of focus, and when done live, a lot of logistical support. It’s all of the charity’s best “customers” in a room, at the same time. Not just in a room, but at something that’s supposed to be a party, an event that’s not only supposed to be fun and demonstrate hospitality, but one that might involve our feelings around status, insufficiency and perfection. As a result, months are spent making sure everything is just right. Date certain has baggage. Sign up to host live events with care. That’s time and effort the nonprofit could be putting into engaging with donors directly. Or even in connecting donors to one another in a way that’s generative and useful. If something goes wrong, plenty of people are triggered. And the responses have to happen with urgency.  GOODBIDS positive auctions can bring some of the real-time energy and urgency of a fundraising event, but without the emotional or labor overhead. Yes, the auction is happening right here and right now. Bidders can’t snooze or they miss out. The clock is ticking, but not at the expense of the hardworking folks at the nonprofit. It’s working for them instead. “What’s it for” is a question that’s worth asking, again and again. Today, three superfun auctions join the list: Claire Saffitz teaches you to bake. Also, this Bob Dylan Slow Train Coming official tour jacket. It’s hanging in my office, and has been for a month or so. It’s magical and I’ll miss it. Thanks, Greg. The first rule of GOODBIDS is that we create the conditions to talk about GOODBIDS. Ed Norton donated a signed Fight Club movie poster… "
17,Them or us?,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/what-kind-of-culture-will-you-build/,"What kind of culture will we build? At work, in our community, online? Each of us builds culture every time we interact with anyone else. Opting out isn’t possible, all we can do is decide what sort of impact and contribution we’re each going to make. It’s tempting to say, “they” build culture, and to see that some have far more leverage than others. But it’s actually a “we” thing. "
18,The challenge of nonprofit fundraising,"April 12, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/the-challenge-of-fundraising/,"When someone starts a business, they spend a bunch of time with a business plan, working to raise funds and get it off the ground. After that, though, the purpose of the business is completely aligned with the idea of not running out of money. We run a business to make money, not to spend it. If done well, there’s no more fundraising after a startup period. On the other hand, nonprofits sign up to do at least two things. They’re here to solve a problem, to address trauma, to enrich the culture, to do the difficult work that we’re not always able to do on our own. And yet, at the same time, we require them to raise money. Not just for a little while, but all the time. The more successful they become, the more money they need to raise. Along the way, it’s not unusual for a nonprofit to spend 50% of the money they raise on the expense of raising more money. That’s not because they’re inefficient, it’s because we are. We demand a gala, or an emergency, or artfully written fundraising letters. Donors want personal attention from the folks who are ostensibly doing the front line or strategic work of the nonprofit, and treat regular donations as an exception, not the standard. When the internet arrived, it dramatically lowered the transactional costs in a wide variety of industries. You can buy an airline ticket yourself faster and with less intervention than through a travel agent. You can buy stocks for transaction fees that are a tiny fraction of what a broker used to charge. But creative and effective nonprofit fundraising has been stuck in a cycle of risk, galas and uncertainty. GOODBIDS is making it easier for a nonprofit to create an event that might capture the attention of regular donors as well as new ones. It still requires some effort to secure the prizes, but our tool significantly leverages the work of the nonprofit and the fee we charge the nonprofit is a tiny fraction of what it usually costs to do fundraising. Today’s new auctions are rare collectibles donated by special friends: I hope you’ll check out how positive auctions are working for charities you care about. PS bonus tip: Each Goodbids auction has an end date and time, but the auction is automatically extended when someone bids near the end of the window. That means that there’s no benefit to waiting until the last minute, because there isn’t a last minute–the auction keeps running until the bidding is done. "
19,Updating our stuck interactions,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/updating-our-stuck-interactions/,"There are few sitcoms, thrillers or plays where the plot can tolerate the addition of a cell phone. Once the characters have the ability to connect and clear up misunderstandings at will, a lot of tension disappears. If Juliet had had a smartphone, she and Romeo would have ended up married, living in a house in the suburbs. And the ubiquitous meeting-in-person has a similarly long history. And yet they still happen with very few changes, with power getting the head of the table, traditionally privileged voices being the loudest and no accommodations for new information or asynchronous interactions. Political debates are largely unchanged since Lincoln’s day. Yes, we have microphones now, but it hasn’t occurred to the organizers to use a timer and simply turn off the mic when time’s up, not to mention including real time fact checking. We still reward bullying, bloviating and dances of dominance. Email, once the most modern form of interaction, hasn’t changed much at all since I got my first address in 1976. There are a hundred ways it could be dramatically more effective and efficient, but it’s stuck. Weddings, high school graduations and funerals also remain similar to the way they’ve always been. One reason these formats stick around is that they are connection devices, and we often believe that we have to stick with the status quo, because getting everyone involved to agree on a new method is too difficult. And yet, new methods do arise… but sometimes we stick with the old ones without wondering why. Humans have been communicating and coordinating since the beginning. But in the last fifty years, we’ve transformed the tech–now we need to think hard about whether we’re sticking with something because it works, or because we always have done it that way. "
20,Why tell the others?,"April 11, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/why-tell-the-others/,"Every internet success works because the network effect kicked in. There’s no other way for an idea to reliably and economically reach a big enough audience to be sustained. That’s why Super Bowl ads make so little sense in 2024. Ideas that spread win. I wrote a bestseller about this 20 years ago, and I still take the insight to heart.  One challenge with fundraising is that it’s awkward to share. Perhaps your friend isn’t ready to donate, or isn’t interested in the non profit… It simply doesn’t feel as easy or as fun as sharing a silly video or meme. Also, if you’re in an auction, you probably don’t want to share it with others, because they might outbid you. That’s where the second innovation of GOODBIDS comes in. Every registered user gets a unique referral link. If you share that link and someone bids, you get a free bid. In any auction you like. The free bid can be for any amount. And if you get the reward with that free bid, it costs you nothing (and it doesn’t cost the charity anything either). Here’s a simple example: Today, we’re launching three cool auctions: 1-on-1 office or Zoom meeting with Nicole Walters (to benefit WalkGoodLA) Priceless guitar signed by Bob Weir (for the Grateful Guitars Foundation) Autographed jersey from Christian McCaffrey who played in this year’s Super Bowl (for the Million Meal Project) A deadhead cares a lot about this guitar. A business owner would walk across hot coals to spend time with bestselling author Nicole Walters. And unlike the commercials, jerseys are actually worth something to fans. These are worth sharing. If you tell your friends about one of these auctions, post on Reddit or share on social media, and someone bids any amount, even $10, your special link will get a free bid added to your account. You can use that free bid to participate in the Apple Watch auction at $350 or $550. It works because the free bids simply ratchet the auction forward. If you get outbid, the new donor just put in $360. If you don’t, it’s still raising as much as it would have if you hadn’t used your free bid. I’m imagining that some folks will bid early in auctions because they want to support the charity and the work they’re doing, or because they’d like to be part of something. And it’s likely that many people will eagerly spread the idea of GOODBIDS to support a charity they care about. Or because the reward is really cool and worth talking about. Or because they’d like to earn an account filled with free bids. Now it gets fascinating. And fun. "
21,The marketing department,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/the-marketing-department/,"That’s the first part of the confusion. It’s a group of people who can’t decide what the thing they do is supposed to be. Is it: Advertising Publicity Increasing retail distribution Direct and measured response SEO Making the logo pretty Wholesale and trade relationships Maintaining the status quo and not screwing up Keeping the website running Positioning Creating network effects Community engagement Strategy Listening hard to market desires Customer service Customer delight Quality metrics Mass market promotion  Branding (whatever that is) And seven other things we could name and argue about… If people are confused about what they do, perhaps that’s why it’s hard to move forward. What’s this meeting for? How do we know we’re working on the right things? What’s important? Call it what it is. Say what it’s for. Describe what you do.  "
22,Launching GOODBIDS,"April 10, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/launching-goodbids/,"Over the next few days, I’m going to feature a new project we launched today. A small and mighty team has been working on this for a year. I want to share the highlights along with some of the critical design choices we made along the way Each year, charities in the US raise about a billion dollars a day from individuals. That money goes to great use–for the arts, for healthcare, for education, for countless projects that benefit our communities. Because our society hasn’t built in a passive way for these organizations to get funded, they need to actively fundraise. It’s exhausting and frankly, a grind. No one particularly wants to take risks or spend extra time being creative, since it’s a required chore, not the point. In creating GOODBIDS, we set out to create a new way for worthy causes to raise money, something that would be fun, remarkable and generative. The core of the idea is the Positive Auction. While it seems a bit like an eBay auction, there are actually some extraordinary and game-changing twists. The key is this: Every bid is a donation. Today, we launched three auctions, with more to come all week: The bidding starts at $10. It goes up in $10 increments and you can’t skip a step. So, $10, $20, $30, etc. Each bid is actually a non-refundable donation. That means that if you bid $10 and someone outbids you at $20, your donation still goes to the charity. You get an email confirmation of your donation and peace of mind. Someone else is going to get the reward–unless you choose to bid again. The last donation gets the reward. The magic of a Positive Auction is in the math. If the bidding for the session with Jason goes to $1500 (far less than its value), the nonprofit will get up to $112,000 in donations.  We’re going to be launching a range of extraordinary auctions this week, all with donated prizes. I hope you’ll check them out and be sure to tune in tomorrow if you’re a Dead fan. And here’s a sneak peek… "
23,Demanding certainty,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/demanding-certainty/,"The defenders of the status quo often demand certainty when facing decisions about the future.  It sets up the conditions for doing nothing, because certainty never happens until the future arrives. It’s much more useful to look at probabilities. Flipping a fair coin has a 50% chance of coming up heads. That’s a risky bet. On the other hand, there’s more than a 95% chance that the sea levels in Miami will be significantly higher in ten years. Is that a bet you want to take the other side of? As soon as we can begin discussing probabilities, we can sit on the same side of the table and refine our estimates and our risk profiles. But certainty? Certainty is another word for stalling. "
24,The color-coded wires,"April 9, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/the-color-coded-wires/,"Have you ever wondered what the wiring layout behind the control panels at Abbey Road studios was like? Neither have I. The Beatles recorded some of their best work there, and I have no idea if it was a rat’s nest of tangled wires, or if each wire was labeled, coded and perfectly aligned. Just as I have no idea if Eliot Peper writes his novels in Scrivener or Word. Yes, of course, for sure, it helps if your tools are properly arranged and maintained. Yes, it saves time and effort to embrace mise en place and get your workspace right. But making it even more right, alphabetizing the pencils and making sure your servers all have the right names–that’s simply stalling. "
25,Surprise and uncertainty,"April 8, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/surprise-and-uncertainty/,"Until just recently, a solar eclipse wasn’t a tourist event.

26,Analyzing the last move,"April 7, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/analyzing-the-last-move/,"When the deal falls apart, or the team loses the game, or a partnership hits the rocks, it’s easy to focus our energy on what just happened. “What if they had called a different play?” This overlooks the real issue. It’s the first move, or the fifth, that led to this problem, not what happened at the last moment. Creating the conditions for success is a very different project than finding a heroic move that saves the day. "
27,Jevons paradox is not surprising,"April 6, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/jevons-paradox-is-not-surprising/,"When a resource can be used more efficiently, we end up using more of the thing, not less. So, when cars get better gas mileage, people drive more, and consumption can actually go up. When AI learns to write computer code, the demand for programmers goes up, because more efficient code is more attractive, and we want more of it. Household appliances that are designed to save time and trouble end up being used for more than simply maintaining the previous level of tidiness. Because it’s easier, we raise our standards for tidy and use them more as they get easier to use. We rarely consider the fact that human beings have invented 6 billion jobs in my lifetime.  My hunch is that AI is going to produce far more opportunities than it destroys. "
28,Non-fatal errors,"April 5, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/non-fatal-errors/,"Most of our errors are in this category. Yesterday, The New York Times sent this newsletter to a million people or so: I’m sure it wasn’t the best part of the day (or the week) for whoever messed up, but I also know that it had little impact on anything that matters. Being careful is smart. Being perfect is unattainable, and seeking perfection is a trap. "
29,Responsibility and blame,"April 4, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/responsibility-and-blame/,"It’s tempting to hand it to other people. If someone else takes the blame, if they accept the responsibility, then we get satisfaction and we’re off the hook. Alas, this doesn’t work unless the others do the taking and do the accepting. Which is unlikely. We’re giving power to someone who isn’t going to use it to make our day better. It’s far more predictable and reliable to simply take it ourselves. At least that way, we can do something with it. This simple shift gives us power and authority over our narrative. It helps us avoid wasting time on wishes and ever more ornate arguments about our version of things. What can you build now that you have everything under your control? "
30,“This time will be different”,"April 3, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/this-time-will-be-different/,"Why is that? The new diet. The fundraising after a natural disaster. The relationship. The hype cycle of a new technology or the media frenzy around a hot new fad or candidate… It always feels like it will be different this time. It rarely is.

31,Generosity and fear,"April 2, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/generosity-and-fear/,"Fear is self-focused. Day to day, our fear is about us. What will happen if we give that speech, launch that project, get stuck in traffic, are eaten by an alligator… And generosity is about others. “How can I help?” Jumping in the water to save a struggling swimmer stops us from worrying about how we look in our suit or whether the water is cold. And if you’re worried about the customer instead of your quota, making a sales call is easier too. The key scene at the climax of the Wizard of Oz happens when Dorothy intercedes on the scarecrow’s behalf. Once again, she finds the courage to overcome her fear when she’s generously supporting a friend. It’s more than a shift in narrative. It’s a shift in intent. "
32,Kinds of courage,"April 1, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/04/kinds-of-courage/,"Courage is a generous act that involves risk. It’s not courageous to hang out with friends and make a crank phone call.  The risk involved might be actual risk (it took courage to go to the moon) or it might feel risky (raising your hand at a meeting to ask a useful question probably has no real downside but it feels that way). Too often, we get hung up on how risky it feels, and fail to focus enough on how generous the work is. Generosity is a great antidote to fear. "

One way to change the pressure of work is to expand or contract the size of the container that holds it. It’s a trap to embrace a productivity shortcut that isn’t a shortcut at all–simply more time spent. Boyle’s law helps us realize the same thing about any gas in the physical world. The pressure is related to the volume… If you’ve found a way to make a living, the challenge in making a life is to find the guts to think about the size of your work container. That’s not easy. It comes with trade offs. We don’t always succeed. But it’s not called Boyle’s guideline.  "

They are rhetorical, but should give you a place to begin: Is it my job to deal with this? Who sent me here? Will this advance my project? Will it help me get ahead if I take action? If I ignore this, will I fall behind? What are the promises being made? Are they achievable–promises that break the laws of physics or contradict my experience are hard to believe. Why should I trust this person? What are the clues that lead me to want to believe this? What are the clues that lead me to doubt it? –These could include: Design, testimonials, page responsiveness, typos, clarity of language, urgency of presentation, credentials, domain knowledge… How easy is it to take the next step? What will happen if I don’t? And the biggest one, the one that is so easily ignored: What will I tell my boss? "

37,Shields down,"March 27, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/shields-down/,"Michael Lopp helped coin an important term. When you’re a skilled craftsperson with high market value, there may be recruiters knocking on your door. An employee who has ‘shields up’ doesn’t even bother to answer the door. When shields are down, you’re open to at least hearing what’s on offer. In a follow-up post where he offered silkscreened shirts with your shield status as a fundraiser, he said that it might not be a good idea to actually wear the shirt to work. That’s almost as fascinating as the shields up phenomenon. There are good reasons to go shields up. It saves you a lot of filtering time. It increases job satisfaction because you’re not always comparing the reality of today with the imagined perfection of tomorrow somewhere else. And it creates a better relationship with your colleagues, because mutual commitment leads to trust. And there are good reasons to put your shields down. You owe a debt to tomorrow–to use it in the best way you can. Too often, we let Resistance hold us back, instead of taking a hard look at what’s possible. Why not share your status? Tom Peters used to write about leaders who ran resumé sessions for their employees. Skeptics asked why on earth you would encourage your team to understand and demonstrate their value in the job market. He pointed out that it was better to work with people who wanted to stay, when the alternative is working with people who believe they’re stuck where they are. There’s a long-time tension between the factory owner and the worker. The factory owner wants to take the maximum amount of labor in exchange the lowest amount of compensation. The worker often responds by playing defense and not letting the boss disrespect them. Bosses invented employee loyalty, not employees. The fear, if you wear your shields up shirt, is that your boss will ask for more. And that if you wear your shields down shirt, your boss will stop trusting you and start scheming to replace you. Perhaps there’s an alternative: The boss should act as if everyone has shields down. Assume you need to re-earn engagement and loyalty every day by offering respect, significance and interesting opportunities. And the employees could act as if they have shields up, simply because it’s a powerful way to spend your day in flow. You can always change your mind tomorrow. "
38,The drift to normal,"March 26, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/the-drift-to-normal/,"As an organization grows in scale, the idiosyncrasy and distinctiveness that was originally informed by the taste of the founders moves toward the mean. Over time, things get more average. That’s because each new customer, each new supplier and each new employee wants or needs something a little more normal, at least sometimes. The drift to normal can only be countered by persistent effort, usually at the cost of some element of short-term scale. “It might not be for you,” always accompanies, “this is special.” "
39,Explaining yourself,"March 25, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/explaining-yourself/,"The only reason we need to go into detail about our resume, the details of our new idea or the features of a product is to cause action to happen. And action is the result of tension, status or affiliation, and these are based on trust. There are many ways to build that trust, and an instruction manual, a powerpoint deck and a set of bullets aren’t the only ones. "
40,Velocity and possibility,"March 24, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/velocity-and-possibility/,"The art of project management includes the dance between velocity and possibility. If you describe the outcome with specificity and remove as many variables as possible, you’ll get the work done with more speed, higher reliability and less cost. That velocity, though, might encourage us to recognize that all sorts of options are available. There are countless chances to make the project better and to find new opportunities. Exploring the possibilities in moments of high velocity almost certainly ensures that costs will increase, reliability will be impacted and you’ll miss deadlines. That’s because possibility is the art of being willing to be wrong. It’s exploration. It’s far easier to explore on foot than it is on a high-speed train. The best time to explore is before you scale your investments, your commitments and the size of the team. We seek both velocity and possibility, but not at the same time. "
41,The rock star conundrum,"March 23, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/the-rock-star-conundrum/,"Forty years ago, the royalty of rock spent the night in a studio to record one of the fastest-selling singles of all time. The documentary of the event is just okay, but it’s fascinating in how it shows us just how deep imposter syndrome lies. Only a few stars seemed at all comfortable–Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross. On the other hand, Waylon Jennings felt excluded and stormed out halfway through. Huey Lewis said his legs were shaking. Some notable stars were too afraid to come at all. And Bob Dylan, the same guy who won the Nobel Prize, seems profoundly insecure the entire time, and it’s only when Stevie and Quincy Jones give him some reassurance that he’s finally able to sing at all. We’d like to believe that if we only had the adulation, market success, and fan support of superstars like these, then we’d finally be comfortable and able to do our best. In fact, it seems the opposite is true. Imposter syndrome shows up because we are imposters, imposters acting ‘as if’ in search of making something better. Perhaps the best plan is to show up and not walk out. "

43,Purchase decisions,"March 21, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/purchase-decisions/,"All purchases involve a decision. Yes or no, this or that, now or later… But it’s helpful to realize that all decisions involve a purchase. When we decide to spend time or take a risk or make a commitment, our brains act in a way very similar to how we choose to make a purchase. When you talk about a non-profit, introduce a new sort of behavior or invite someone to follow along, you’re actually selling. Finding the empathy to treat it like a purchase is worth the effort. Even if it doesn’t cost money. Especially then. "

45,The worst person on our team,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/the-worst-person-on-your-team/,"A common shortcut to cultural divisiveness is to find the single worst person in a different group and highlight and attack their behavior. By making it clear and obvious that this is what THEY (the plural) want and who THEY are, it’s easy to walk away from a larger we. Their worst troll becomes their mascot. And in a media-fueled culture that thrives on division, this is a convenient shortcut. What happens, though, if we find the worst person on our team and tell them to chill out a bit. That people like us don’t do things like that. That their trollish, extreme behavior is magnifying differences instead of making it more likely we end up with useful cultural cohesion… It’s surprising how much the outlier is willing to listen to the very people they’re counting on for support. And the folks you seek to win over are much more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt if you have a history of discouraging bad behavior. It doesn’t matter if we’re talking about politicians, sports fans, entrepreneurs or activists. More extreme division is unlikely to sell our idea and gain the support we’re looking for. "
46,Out of control,"March 19, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/out-of-control/,"It’s negative when we say that someone is out of control. They’ve lost their self-restraint, and they’re doing things that they’ll regret later. And it’s honest when we acknowledge that just about everything is out of our control. We can work to influence it, we can practice accepting it, but any time we’re engaging with others or with the future, we’re not completely in charge. Control is elusive. If we accept the parts that are out of our hands, we can focus on the elements where we have leverage and influence instead. "
47,Willfully uninformed,"March 18, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/willfully-uninformed/,"Access to information used to be scarce. We ranked college libraries on how many books they had, and time at the microfilm reader was booked in advance. Today, if there’s something I don’t know, it’s almost certainly because I haven’t cared enough to find out. I don’t understand molecular biology, the history of Sardinia or much of agronomy–but that’s my choice. Now that information is widely and freely available, our sense of agency around knowledge needs to change. It pays to acknowledge that this is a choice, and to be responsible for it. What else have we chosen not to know? "
48,In search of incompetence,"March 17, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/in-search-of-incompetence/,"Learning is about becoming incompetent on our way to getting better. If you’re not open to the tension that is caused by knowing you could do better, it’s unlikely you’re willing to do the work to get better. As you’re doing that work, there’s the satisfaction it brings, but also the knowledge that just a moment ago, you weren’t any good. "
49,“For what purposes will it be useful?”,"March 16, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/for-what-purposes-will-it-be-useful/,"In 1840, at the dawn of the information age, the king of Sardinia asked Charles Babbage what nearly instant messaging like the telegraph could possibly be good for. Twenty years later, it was obvious. When I first saw Prodigy in 1986, I saw that the consumer internet would have many possibilities, but I didn’t have the guts to ask what I was missing. “In 40 years, for what purposes will it be useful” would have been a productive way to think about the change that was happening. AI is as big a change as the internet, perhaps more so. And in just a few years, people will wonder why we weren’t wondering better. "
50,Later or now?,"March 15, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/later-or-now/,"When we feel like doing something selfish, indulgent, hurtful or short-term, we can simply decide to do it later.

51,Naming is part of marketing,"March 14, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/naming-is-part-of-marketing/,"A name is a hook for us to hang a story on. We need to begin with empathy and a useful story… useful to the people who want to believe it, spread it, and use it to accomplish their goals. But then, the story needs firm footing and a way to stick with us. Patagonia is a great name because while most people have no idea where the place known as Patagonia is, they’re able to associate it with the story that the company has been telling for a long time. Nike is a great name, even though it’s not obvious how to pronounce it. Genghis Khan had a memorable, unique name–you don’t have to be beloved for the name to be useful. The industry that’s the current world champ at bad naming is AI. ChatGPT is a terrible name. And the trademark office in the US just denied them ownership in GPT, so even if they were a pioneer, that’s gone now. It’s hard to tell the story when you don’t know what to call it. Claude.ai isn’t particularly distinctive (something about the phonemes make me keep forgetting it, and without a bookmark, I’d never find it again), and Gemini walks away from the huge value that Google has invested into the name of their search engine.  Louise wrote the book on it. "
52,Curation (vs the road to junk),"March 13, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/curation-vs-the-road-to-junk/,"The independent bookstore down the street is carefully curated. Each book takes up the spot that a different book could inhabit, so the owner makes sure that there’s a great reason a title is included. Amazon, on the other hand, has no shelf space problem, and the Kindle multiplies it. As a result, the average book on the Kindle is virtually worthless, because once it’s easy to include everything, everything gets included. Amazon doesn’t promise to curate, they insist the purchaser does. Christopher Nolan hasn’t made many movies (and has carefully kept his first student film hidden from view). If he puts his name on it, people pay attention. YouTube has countless (actually countless, because new ones arrive faster than you can count the old ones) videos. And a significant number of them have less than ten views, and they don’t even deserve that many.  YouTube doesn’t curate, they encourage the crowd to do that for them. The long tail is a business model and a way of bringing work to the world. More is better. Curation, on the other hand, offers a different reward for the publisher/creator.  Either your motto is, “we don’t sell anything, we sell everything” or “we put our name on this one.” Lately, there’s pressure to be somewhere in the middle. To be sort of proud of each choice and sort of have a lot of choices. It’s a very difficult path to walk. Economic pressure pushes for more, now. But more now might be stealing from we stand for something. "
53,Holding on for dear life,"March 12, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/holding-on-for-dear-life/,"That’s a cliche from the movies. Dangling from a railroad bridge, only determination and firm grip can save the hero. In our modern world, we often end up holding on to ideas, to grievances or to our view of the world. Ironically, the harder we hold on to the things we’re hiding from, the less dear our life becomes. Perhaps we could let go for dear life instead. "
54,Hiding the ‘aha’,"March 11, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/hiding-the-aha/,"The most effective persuasion happens when we persuade ourselves. The purpose of the memo or the table or the graph or the presentation is to create the conditions for someone to make up their own minds. Because it’s almost impossible to make up their mind for them. The aha is actually a chemical reaction, a rewiring of our brain, the moment when we see what we hadn’t seen before and make a new decision based on what we believe to be new information. Causing an aha requires insight and elegance, and there are three ways we avoid it. Sometimes, we are entranced by our own insight, or impressed with our communication tools. We let facts, formatting and filigree get in the way of a good story. And sometimes, we’re afraid of our power, so we bury the lede too far, letting ourselves off the hook by not influencing someone else. Once in a while, we do the opposite. We say what we mean so clearly and so directly that the story disappears and the facts bounce off the inertia and self esteem of the person encountering them. Persuasion works best when it’s actually self-persuasion. But you already knew that. "
55,Preference and utility,"March 10, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/preference-and-utility/,"Taste varies. That’s why we don’t call it utility. Taste is individual preference, not absolute truth. In team settings, then, it’s much more helpful to say, “I prefer this over that,” instead of, “this is wrong.” Some things are wrong. There are standards that we can all accept when it comes to utility, efficiency and even beauty. Your authority doesn’t lie in your ability to be the sole arbiter of an accepted constant. Instead, we’re listening to hear about your personal preferences. When we try to turn our taste into a universal standard, we shut down the creators around us.  "
56,Default to surrender,"March 9, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/default-to-surrender/,"AI chatbots highlight a challenge that is worth understanding. It applies to customer service, bureaucracies and teachers as well… If you ask an AI a question and it’s not confident in the answer, it should say, “I’m not sure.” That could be followed up with, “do you want me to guess” or “if you could give me more context…” But proudly and confidently bluffing isn’t helpful. It’s really unusual to find this sort of humanity (even with humans), but it’s a great way to build trust. "

Another word for “mediocre.” When an organization gets big enough, by definition, it’s the average. When you have enough customers, they represent the population as a whole. If you find yourself seeking to serve the largest possible number of people, you’ve signed up to be average. Without a doubt, you’re raising the bar compared to the ones who came before, but scale has its costs. If you ship enough products to enough people, average is inevitable.

60,The positive auction,"March 5, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/the-positive-auction/,"[Sorry, I hit publish prematurely. I’ll be updating this and correcting the errors as we go.] In 2023, I developed a new idea that transforms an old way of doing commerce. In traditional auctions, there are rounds of bidding and the high bidder pays to get the prize. The last bid is the amount paid, and no one else is charged anything. This is an interesting ‘game’ in which all participants are able to express their desire for the item in monetary terms. In an efficient auction, the price paid will represent the highest utility among the bidders, with no one feeling remorse–including the seller–because the “market has spoken.” Over time, these sorts of auctions aren’t actually as efficient as they seem. This is why other times of auctions have evolved. These include: The three other common types of auctions are (via Wikipedia): When bidders have an understanding of the nature of the bidders in the room as well as their options, bidding is skewed. For things like spectrum, this can cost the seller billions of dollars. I chose to address the problem of charity auctions. Often run at galas, they depend on a combination of status and alcohol to generate high bids for items that the buyers might not have imagined wanting to purchase before the event began. As a result, the results are often quite disappointing to the seller, often a worthy cause.  The positive auction transforms the dynamics of a charity auction by changing two elements: Most profoundly, every bid is a donation. Bidding begins at $10 and increments by ten dollars per bid. Bidders are not permitted to skip a step. The total raised increases exponentially.  Specifically  S=(n/2)​(2a+(n−1)d) S is the final sum. a is the first number and d is the increment. In practice, then, the bidding results look like this: The organizer of the auction can offer free bids to bidders at no cost to the seller. In fact, free bids can actually increase the amount raised.  The second innovation is incorporating “free bids” into the auction. For example, a free bid could be rewarded to anyone who recruits someone who bids in an auction. When used, the free bid ratchets up the auction, meaning that the next bid will be higher. Even if a free bidder wins the auction, they haven’t decreased the amount of money raised. In practice, a positive auction creates an unstable equilibrium. If we consider an auction with 150 bids, the winner pays only $1,495 but gets an item that might be worth $100,000. It’s difficult to look away from this gap without exploring it. We’re taking the dynamics of positive auctions and building GOODBIDS around it, providing a tool for worthy causes to raise money. Positive auctions paper (via Claude.ai):Abstract:This paper introduces a novel auction format, the positive auction, designed to address the inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes often associated with traditional charity auctions. By incorporating two key innovations—treating every bid as a donation and introducing free bids—the positive auction model aims to increase total funds raised for charitable causes while maintaining an engaging and competitive bidding environment.1. IntroductionCharity auctions play a vital role in generating funds for worthy causes. However, traditional auction formats often fail to maximize the potential for fundraising, as they rely heavily on factors such as status and impulsive bidding behavior. This paper presents the positive auction model, a transformative approach to charity auctions that seeks to address these shortcomings and optimize the fundraising process.2. The Positive Auction Model2.1 Every Bid as a DonationThe core principle of the positive auction is that every bid placed by a participant constitutes a donation to the charitable cause. Bidding commences at a fixed starting price and increases by a predetermined increment with each subsequent bid. Participants are required to follow the incremental bidding sequence, ensuring a structured and transparent process.The total funds raised through a positive auction can be calculated using the following formula:_S_\=(n/2)​(2_a_+(_n_−1)_d_)Where:_S_ = total sum raised_n_ = number of bids_a_ = starting bid amount_d_ = bid incrementThis formula demonstrates the exponential growth potential of the positive auction model, with total funds raised increasing significantly as the number of bids grows.2.2 Free BidsThe positive auction introduces the concept of “free bids” to further enhance the fundraising potential. Free bids are awarded to participants based on predefined criteria, such as recruiting additional bidders to the auction. These free bids serve to increase the overall number of bids placed, driving up the total funds raised without any additional cost to the charitable organization.3. Unstable Equilibrium and IncentivesThe positive auction creates an unstable equilibrium, where the winning bidder may secure an item of substantial value for a relatively low final bid price. This disparity between the item’s perceived value and the winning bid price serves as a powerful incentive for participants to continue bidding, as the potential for securing a high-value item at a bargain price is a compelling prospect.4. Practical Application: GOODBIDSThe positive auction model has been implemented through the development of GOODBIDS, a platform designed to facilitate fundraising for charitable causes. By providing a user-friendly interface and automating the bidding process, GOODBIDS aims to make the positive auction model accessible to a wide range of organizations and individuals seeking to maximize their fundraising efforts.5. ConclusionThe positive auction model represents a significant advancement in the field of charity auctions, offering a novel approach to maximizing fundraising potential while maintaining an engaging and competitive bidding environment. By treating every bid as a donation and introducing the concept of free bids, the positive auction creates an unstable equilibrium that incentivizes participants to continue bidding, ultimately leading to increased funds raised for worthy causes. The development of platforms like GOODBIDS further enhances the practical application of this innovative auction format, promising to revolutionize the landscape of charitable fundraising. "
61,On building a cathedral,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/on-building-a-cathedral/,"If you’re in need of a gathering place, a dry, functional, centrally located facility for your folks to meet, a cathedral is probably way more than you need. It’s far more expensive to build and maintain and not optimal in delivering what’s required. But what if this building needs to fill other functions as well? Perhaps it’s a message to your membership about longevity, status and commitment. Perhaps it’s a signal to the local government that you have real resources and are not to be trifled with. And perhaps it is a beacon designed to attract people who haven’t yet heard about your work. Or maybe it’s something we do simply because we can. In our rush for serviceable, we race to the bottom. The thing we’re working on is a rare chance to contribute something far more than the least we could get away with. You can’t build a cathedral every day, and you can’t do it for cheap. But sometimes we get the chance to create something that really matters. "
62,Headwinds,"March 4, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/headwinds/,"When it’s tough going and it feels fraught, it’s easy to imagine that the headwinds will never end. And yet, when all is going well and the wind is at our back, it’s tempting to imagine that this is the way it’s going to stay. Neither is true. The reason we see them as headwinds is that they shift.

63,Becoming intentional about virtual meetings,"March 3, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/becoming-intentional-about-virtual-meetings/,"A manual I recently read listed the “cons” of having a meeting virtually: To be accurate, every one of these points should have “so far” added. The videogame market is far bigger than the box office of Hollywood films. The people who play video games at home for hours at a time have no problem with engagement, with meaning, with distractions or with body language. That’s because a well-designed videogame solves for all these problems. If, even once, you’ve had a virtual meeting that engaged you and made you feel connected to someone else, then it’s clearly possible. The hard work is deciding to put in the effort to have it happen more often. Lazy simulations of in-person meetings are not a worthy substitute. "
64,The weird math of halfway,"March 2, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/the-weird-math-of-halfway/,"6 times 1/2 doesn’t equal 3. It equals zero. We’re tempted to do a little less than we need to. Perhaps we’re busy, with too many options. Perhaps it’s resistance, pushing us to hold a little bit back. Whatever the reason, when we show up just a little, we get zero credit. The smallest viable audience plus focus and care is additive. Less than 1 is still zero. "
65,The question book,"March 1, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/03/the-question-book/,"In the old days, companies had a suggestion box. It was immortalized in cartoons, but the idea that an employee could anonymously submit a suggestion to make things better is a first step in engagement. Some companies took this much further and paid employees for suggestions that generated profits. Digital communication and more open workplaces have made the necessity for a box like this decrease. But we’re still often hung up on the odd cultural stigma around seeming dumb. So people don’t raise their hands, don’t ask questions and work in frustration and ignorance instead. Something we learn as teenagers. Perhaps we can begin with a teenager-focused solution. When your kid turns 12, give them a blank notebook. “Any time you have a question that’s embarrassing or you’re not sure who to ask, just write it down in this notebook and put it on my bed. I’ll write out an answer and return it the next day.” By taking off some of the interpersonal pressure, this creates a useful channel for questions and answers. And what happens if we bring the same medium to work? "
66,The leap,"February 29, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/the-leap-2/,"In action movies, there’s a lot of leaping. Brave shifts in which the hero gets from here to there, all at once. It’s easy to imagine that sudden leaps are how we make our impact. This is blog post #9000 (give or take). When did the leap happen? It wasn’t an external leap. The first hundred blog posts were read by fewer than a dozen people. It was an internal one. The decision to be a blogger. And then redeciding, each day, not to stop. Every four years, we have a worldwide holiday to celebrate this sort of leap. The leap of choice. Not to suddenly get from here to there, but to choose to go on the journey. It’s only once every 1,460 days, you can do it. Leap today.  Perhaps we begin by visualizing it. In the most concrete terms you can find, write it down. If you took a leap today, what would it look like? Who would benefit? And then, share it with just one other person. Often, the act of physically writing it down is the most difficult part. "
67,By association,"February 28, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/by-association/,"We’re busy, we’re confused and we’re always seeking a shortcut. If a company is hiring, the person who worked at Google or Apple or Disney gets more of the benefit of the doubt. Even if all they did was bring coffee to someone. But, if that person was one of the hundreds laid off yesterday as a result of Apple shuttering their car project, not so much. If you get pitched by someone who worked at Bird or Theranos or General Magic, what pile do they go in? What about someone who was the assistant to an actor who just got nominated for an Academy Award vs. someone who worked for a has-been? It’s not hard to extend this to people who went to a school with a successful football team, or who are part of a group that traditionally is given an advantage due to an accident of birth. These are false proxies. But it’s such a natural instinct that we have to work to intentionally overcome it. Luck isn’t contagious. "
68,(Free) subscription drive,"February 27, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/free-subscription-drive/,"Every four years, give or take, I make a big but cheap ask: Consider subscribing to this blog. If you’re already a subscriber, please ask five colleagues or friends to subscribe. It’s free. You can subscribe by email by putting your email address in the little box. Click below if you’re reading this in an email, then enter your email and then hit the sign up button: Your email is respected, never shared, rented, sold or spammed. Even better, consider RSS. It’s easier than you think, and it saves a ton of time and avoids Google’s evil filters. Over the years, millions of people have subscribed to this blog, and that’s who I write it for. Entropy plus monopoly cause the deliverability to vary over time, so once in a while I ask you to share the blog and subscribe. As long as they’re useful, blogs aren’t dead. It’s appreciated. Thank you. "
69,What are the stakes?,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/what-are-the-stakes/,"How big a swing do we need to make it feel like it matters? At the casino, some folks play with $5 chips, some with $100 chips. Do the high rollers have more fun? Are they more engaged? It’s natural to imagine that bigger swings matter more. That a bigger audience means our standup needs to be better, or a bigger investment is a signal that our business matters more. More and better aren’t the same. There are very few projects that have an impact on every human. Most are more local than that. Winning the regional Math Olympiad can feel just as important as winning the Super Bowl, and entire countries will be unaware of both events. If you need it to feel like life or death for the work to matter, the problem might not be that you don’t get enough near-death opportunities. It might be that you’ve signed up to work in crisis mode. "
70,The close proximity gap,"February 26, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/the-close-proximity-gap/,"One of the unmentioned causes of division in much of our culture happens because of the shift in expectations and rules when we begin to live in close proximity to one another. In a non-crowded setting, the default is independence. The expectation is that you can drive as fast as you like, do whatever you like with your land, say anything that’s on your mind. In a city, proximity raises the stakes for how our behavior influences others. Interdependence becomes a benefit. So don’t tailgate, turn down the stereo in your apartment and realize that your words and behavior impact the folks around you. Both are forms of freedom. The freedom to do what you want and the freedom to live in a connected culture. When we move online, everything and everyone is just a click away. We’re constantly in close proximity to people of different ages, backgrounds and goals. And when the world continues to get smaller and more entwined, close proximity dominates. Buying a dozen bottles of water at the market (even if they’re on sale) costs everyone else. Those bottles are going to go somewhere when you’re done with them, and the world is smaller than ever before. It’s farmers and cowboys, extraction and regeneration. The paradox of the early astronaut training programs was that they recruited hot shots who were used to living in their own lane, and then trained them to be experts at being in close quarters. "
71,The grey goo,"February 25, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/the-grey-goo/,"If we take a big enough dataset… Add to it machine learning and autotune and the race to fit in and reach the masses… We end up with a relentless march toward mediocrity. Mediocre is another word for average. It has always happened as industries matured (whether it’s Motown or blenders). But then, often, a human being shows up with something that ‘everyone’ says isn’t going to work, and the game is reset. Just about all bestsellers are surprise bestsellers. But the forces of mediocrity are now microprocessor-powered, heavily funded, and determined to hold on to the middle of the market. More grey, more goo. It’s hard to make a great sequel. Better to spend our time to make a remarkable original. "
72,A transformative summer,"February 24, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/a-transformative-summer/,"Living indoors, connected to a screen, it’s easy for the months and years to blur together.  The seasons used to matter more. But for young adults, they still do. Transitions are built around the seasons, and the headlong rush to a career is still sometimes interrupted by months where there’s a chance to reset and to grow. If you know someone who’s a few months away from one of these in-between summers, I hope you’ll forward this to them. While it’s tempting to see a summer as a break, simply a chance to rest up and recharge, the ones we end up remembering and treasuring are the foundational ones. The projects that changed us, largely because we helped someone else grow, because we built something or became something or did something worth our effort. I’m helping my friends up north recruit and train a few instructors and staff for the summer. Click here for the details. If you’re not in a position to do that, here’s a starter list of some projects you can do right where you are, without needing to apply. Advance planning helps a lot, though. Pigeonholes are for pigeons. The magic of a summer of contribution is that you get to try on a new hat to see if it fits. We all have more agency than we want to admit. "
73,And it can also do that,"February 23, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/and-it-can-also-do-that/,"If you were around when the Model T was first announced, you could have built the organizations that became Disney, McDonald’s and Holiday Inn, all of which were powered by cheap, plentiful cars. You could have become a major developer of suburbs, mortgage banking and even pop music record labels (car radios changed the way music was consumed). AI is here now, and the pace is astonishing. So far, I haven’t seen many freelancers or small businesspeople choosing to make an impact by understanding what it can do and selling processes and services to bigger organizations in ways that dramatically change how they do business. I asked it for some suggestions. Here are a few: Some of these are parlor tricks, the same way the lava lamp wouldn’t have existed without electricity in the home. But they point to a scalable shift in our infrastructure and a real need for people who write prompts instead of following them. My hunch is that like many technology revolutions before it, this breakthrough is going to create far more jobs than it destroys. But the change is real, and it’s here now. PS what I haven’t seen yet: "
74,Queued,"February 22, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/queued/,"It’s sort of the opposite of “cued.” In addition to being delightful to spell, the idea of work that’s queued up is energizing. The chapter ahead of schedule, the process in place for the next quarter, the continued commitment to learning…  It is locked, loaded and ready to go. It’s work that requires timing and foresight, and it’s an asset. Knowing that it’s ready and waiting gives you the leverage and confidence to work on the next thing. If we spend our time waiting for a signal, an invitation or a cue, we will be doing a lot of waiting. "
75,Spire confusion,"February 21, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/spire-confusion/,"When architects show off their work, or propose a bold new building complex or even ask for a zoning variance, the public sees the external photos. The tall spire, the innovative use of glass, the weird hole in the center of the building. And when a car company shows off a new model at a press conference, it’s the headlights or the door handles that catch our attention. And colleges brag about their football teams… But the thing is, most of the time the building serves its function for the people working inside of it. The owner of the car can’t see the headlights, and almost all the benefits of college have zero to do with what happens for two hours on Saturday. Gimmicks are memorable. But they’re gimmicks. "
76,Easy/lazy tech journalism,"February 20, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/easy-lazy-tech-journalism/,"Choose either one: When a new technology comes out, review it breathlessly. Explain without nuance or caution how it will instantly change the world. Go into the details of this first instantiation of it and assume it will never change, it’s done, here we go. When a new technology comes out, describe the scam that the founders are running. Highlight how it will cost us all our jobs, create untold new problems and definitely not work. In a one hour span, I read two pieces about Apple’s new device in the first category, and a very long piece about cultured meat in the second. Neither is correct. None were particularly difficult to write (or to get the TLDR from). Nuance isn’t easy, but nuance is almost always correct. "
77,Make or buy?,"February 19, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/make-or-buy/,"If you’re a writer, it probably doesn’t pay to chop down trees and make your own paper, or even to set up a little machine shop to make your own pens. That’s pretty obvious. Should the smoothie shop make its own almond milk? It’s pretty clear that Starbucks should have a team of architects, lawyers and graphic artists on staff, but does it pay for them to make their own cups? Ford makes engines but they don’t make tires. The theory of the firm was first written about by Ronald Coase nearly a hundred years ago, and the questions persist. Consider: Is there a reliable way for you to purchase the inputs as a commodity, where you have more power than the suppliers do? Does buying a commodity input free you up to focus on something your customers value instead? In the case of Ford, there are plenty of companies that are in the tire-making business, and the amount of customer-facing innovation in that industry is low. Since Ford can shop around for tires each year, and since customers don’t care very much, it makes little sense for Ford to make tires. On the other hand, Apple discovered that there were very few companies that were competing for their chip business, and customers did indeed care about whether or not a laptop would be faster, cooler and cheaper. Rather than allowing a chip company to dominate their future, they set up their own. If you’re a soloist, you only have a dozen hours a day (tops) to work on your project. How many of those hours are spent replicating something you could buy, the way Ford buys tires? "
78,The illusion of concern,"February 18, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/the-illusion-of-concern/,"When organizations reach scale, digital interactions belie our expectation that someone in charge actually gives a damn. Once there’s math to do, the CFO does the math. It quickly reveals that no, the search engine shouldn’t bother having a customer support team. That UPS or Fedex should simply hang up on you if your package is only a few hours late. They probably never cared, but now it becomes obvious to the customer that they don’t.  Two paths are available if you want to compete with someone who is doing the numbers: Either method can pay for itself. "
79,Problems and the clover,"February 17, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/problems-and-the-clover/,"Systemic and existential problems dance their way through three circles: If it’s not solvable, we’ll pretend it’s not a problem. If the cultural cost of solving the problem is too high, we’ll pretend there’s no solution. People don’t spend a lot of time planning for death because there’s no solution to it and the social costs of bringing it up are scary. It’s easier to not talk about it. On the other hand, while it took a few generations, we figured out how to create cultural norms around things like smoking in public. Systemic problems require systemic solutions, and those solutions hinge on culture. "
80,Trading trust,"February 16, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/trading-trust/,"The Brookings Institution did a fascinating survey series over the last five years. I have two takeways from this: The first is that focused and persistent propaganda is able to shift public opinion about institutions they don’t have direct interaction with.  The more important one is this: Many companies, particularly tech ones, are deliberately trading trust for short-term profits. Amazon and many other companies went from investing heavily in being reliable, trustworthy and fair to taking persistent steps to trade these valuable assets for quarterly results. It’s worth being clear about this–they did this intentionally. They decided that the confidence consumers had placed in them wasn’t worth as much as the shortcuts they could take to increase profits instead. While the survey focuses on widely known, large institutions, the same could be said for the local pizzeria. Once you burn some trust, it’s almost impossible to earn it back. It took Harvard 400 years to become Harvard, Google about twenty to earn its position. This is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for–to become the one that earns the benefit of the doubt. Being the low-trust option is hardly a spot worth fighting for. "
81,Peak infrastructure,"February 15, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/peak-infrastructure/,"Community resources are easy to take for granted. Unevenly distributed, they’re the sort of thing we miss only when they’re gone. Invisible things are easy to ignore. I was stunned to see a sign in Connecticut that listed the names of dozens of highway workers who had been killed in accidents while doing their jobs. Too often, we celebrate the rabble rousers or innovators, without acknowledging our investments and efforts to keep things working. But everything we’ve built has been built on top of our community commitments to infrastructure. I’m lucky to have access to things like: Few people worldwide have as much access to these resources, and one of the unsung stories of the last century has been the spread of civil systems to more and more people. A combination of aging systems, decreased commitment to community spending and the disruptions we’re causing to the climate mean that it’s possible we’ll end up with holes in this infrastructure that we might not be able to easily fix. The next time you see an infrastructure worker, give them a hug. Check out Deb Chachra’s terrific new book on infrastructure. "
82,Customer satisfaction and tipping,"February 14, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/customer-satisfaction-and-tipping/,"In North America, tipping is an unfair system built into the status quo by law. Restaurants aren’t allowed to easily spread tips around, and as a result, they tend to to exacerbate many of the inequities in our culture at the same time that they make it hard to count on a fair wage in one of the largest industries in the world. That said, one reason for the stickiness of tipping is that the act of doing it offers benefits to the customers. The first is ritual. It’s what we grew up doing, and leaving it out feels awkward. The second is control. The person leaving a tip is given a vivid reminder of their power as a customer. “To insure prompt service” might not be the origin of the term, but it can feel that way. It gives the customer a sense of control. Another is status. At fancy restaurants in New York, experiments with eliminating tipping have had little success, and one reason is that regular customers enjoyed the way it allowed them to subtly (not that subtly) demonstrate their status to their guests. A recent one is the labeling and sorting of the internet. Restaurants and resorts that include gratuities in their fees get hammered in search, because they seem more expensive than they are. Part of the persistence of cultural norms comes from our desire for there to be a norm. When two people split a check, it’s not unusual for them to compare how much they’re leaving in a tip. Why? After all, people don’t walk across a restaurant to ask a stranger to be sure they’re in sync. But giving the ‘right’ amount, or perhaps just a bit over or just bit under is part of our desire to establish our place in a hierarchy. How to cut this knot? If tipping is a service (for customers or staff) how to make it more than an afterthought? If the goal is to keep tipping, then we have the chance to create the conditions where the tipper feels really good about the practice. Simple cues, an easy way to find oneself in the hierarchy, a way to know you’re tipping the ‘right amount.’ Or perhaps the sort of signaling that we see in nightclubs when someone orders a really expensive bottle for the table–how do we give customers the chance to put a show about their tipping in a way that benefits the customer as well as the server? On the other hand, if the goal is to eliminate tipping, different stategies can be put to work. Imagine a resort that prides itself on service. Instead of asking for a tip the last day, a note might say, “Thanks for joining us, and supporting our mission in creating a magical place to work and visit. We’ve already charged your card, which includes a hospitality fee. If anyone on the property contributed to the quality of your stay, please let us know and we’ll make sure to celebrate their work.” Service is at the heart of our economy now. Perhaps it’s worth rethinking how we recognize it and pay for it. "
83,The four cohorts of the status quo,"February 13, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/the-four-cohorts-of-the-status-quo/,"The first group cares about the policy. They benefit from it. They’ve organized themselves around it. The second group cares about stability. They have limited bandwidth, and they’re not particularly interested in reconsidering everything, all the time. The third group doesn’t care that much. And the fourth group is harmed by the policy, either directly or indirectly. Change happens slowly because the first three groups have power, inertia and communications on their side. Change happens when the fourth group can create the conditions for the third group to care, and then these two groups move the urgency up the agenda. It makes no sense to argue with the first group. "
84,To be well published,"February 12, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/to-be-well-published/,"Sooner or later, we benefit from being well-published. Publishing has nothing to do with printing. It’s the act of taking risks to bring a new idea to people who want to embrace it. It’s the head of the lab who works behind the scenes to be sure the talented scientist gets a gig at the right conference. Her talk propels the work forward. It’s Bill Graham ‘publishing’ the Grateful Dead on stage at the Fillmore. It’s Jean Feiwel orchestrating the bookstore success of Harry Potter… Being well-published doesn’t guarantee that an idea or an individual will succeed. Instead, it creates the conditions to maximize the chances that the work will spread. It often involves: Generous enthusiasm: In the moments when the marketplace hasn’t yet embraced the work, the publisher is a vital bridge between now and later. Extraordinary logistics: It’s the tech crew that has read the rider, the operations team that makes sure the printing is done right and the strategic insight to prioritize the parts that matter. Insightful provocation: The publisher knows the territory, and can encourage and amplify work that’s in sync with what the market will respond to. A focus on distribution: If the work isn’t in the right place at the right time, it has no chance to thrive. Resilience and investment: Few ideas work the first time they’re exposed to the audience. Resilience is the willingness and ability to try again, and investment represents the resources to do it well. Just because something succeeds doesn’t mean it’s well-published, but well-published work has a better chance to succeed. The people behind a well-published work rarely get the credit they deserve. It’s difficult and requires persistence and care. "

86,Transitions are difficult,"February 10, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/transitions-are-difficult/,"They’re risky (unknown territory leads to unforeseen outcomes) and a very recent phenomenon. A kid dropped off at pre-school, a new boss, a food you’re not familiar with. None of this was common for most of pre-history. When the transition occurs, we’re tempted to direct our anxiety at the details of the new situation. The boss is a close talker, the air in this new place is humid, the appetizers aren’t quite right and our guests are almost here… It’s productive to name the actual cause instead. Time spent on the details won’t do a thing to make the transition easier. Instead, when we address the actual issue, when we name the fact that it’s the transition that’s bothering us, we can get back to the reason we’re transitioning in the first place. "
87,Understanding free software,"February 9, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/understanding-free-software/,"A cup of coffee costs far more than a glass of water.  That’s true even though we can’t live without water. (Most) people can live without coffee. It’s true even though creating the infrastructure to purify and deliver clean water costs billions of dollars. The critical reason for the difference is marginal cost. To deliver one more glass of water costs the town virtually nothing. Less than a penny. To deliver one more cup of coffee, though, requires more beans, more roasting, more electricity, more cups, more oats, more cows, more staff… add it all up, and Starbucks couldn’t possibly profit from selling coffee for a nickel a cup. The first thing to understand about free software is that the marginal cost of one more email, one more download, one more bit is vanishingly low, close to zero. Given the low incremental cost of another user, it’s likely that if that were the only factor, most software wouldn’t be a very good business, because it costs a lot to develop but market forces would keep pushing the price low. The second factor is lock-in. Unlike coffee, software rewards users who stick with it. Over time, the software you use becomes more familiar, it opens the files you created yesterday and it becomes harder and harder to switch. As a result, companies that make software work to create the conditions where people are encouraged to start right now, and only later discover that it’s difficult to switch. But the real miracle of modern software is the network effect. Simply put: the software works better for each user when other people use it too. The network effect dramatically rewards head starts. You want to use the same word processor as your peers, because opening their files is part of your job. You want to be on the same phone system, the same social network, the same protocols. Sometimes, software is built in community, by teams, and often called open source. These projects exist to solve a problem and serve the user. But sometimes, software is a business. A community-built open-source project can thrive on free. But software can also do a lot of good work when the software creates enough value that people will choose to pay for it. And a business-led software project has similar choices to make. And when all three pieces come together, we’re left with two extremes most software businesses face: For a business, then, there’s the path of free or nearly free, with the goal of making money some other way, or the path of expensive, which aligns the company’s decisions with those of its users. And for community-driven software, there’s the magic alignment that comes from open source. There’s not an obvious answer, but there is a clear choice to be made. "
88,Jump in the lake,"February 8, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/jump-in-the-lake/,"The waters of Buck Lake are cool and clear and restorative. All summer, it’s tempting to go for a swim. But it’s also a hassle. You need to change your clothes, find someone to guard, bring a towel and most of all, gasp at the transition when the cold water hits. And yet… no one ever regretted going for a swim in Buck Lake. After a swim, everything is better. There are lakes, large and small, that we avoid because of the transition. Back up your hard drive. Settle a feud. Write a thank you note. Clean your closet. Tell someone you love them. Go jump in the lake. "
89,All customers are the same,"February 7, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/all-customers-are-the-same/,"[and all customers are different.] Customers are why you’re here. They pay the bills and they are the primary driver of your growth. But each adds a different amount of value to your organization and the journey you’re on. The customer who spends 100x as much as the average customer might be worth considerably more attention and care. The customer who has feedback that will help you understand how to serve similar customers might be worth listening to more closely. The customer who has influence and status may very well earn more attention and care than others. It’s okay to treat some customers differently, but first it pays to figure out who you’re dealing with and why you want to re-allocate your resources. "
90,What’s the right size?,"February 6, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/whats-the-right-size/,"There are no city buses with just four seats. And none with 400 seats. We get to leverage the driver’s effort if we put in a few more seats, but add too many and the bus is too big to make a turn–and soon we’d have to add conductors and cleaners and then the bus economics no longer work. Doctors discovered that a solo practice made it hard to care for patients seven days a week, not to mention the benefits of sharing overhead with a few other professionals. On the other hand, a practice of fifty or a hundred doctors often begins to struggle in the face of management and structural issues. Trees can’t grow to four hundred feet because the amount of pressure needed to bring water that high can’t be produced. Most projects have a right size and technology and communication networks have changed the best ‘right size’ for many organizations. If you’re struggling, it might be because you’re fighting the laws of organizational physics. Radically transforming the size of an organization changes more than we would think. We can begin to right size by asking the question. "
91,As slow as possible,"February 5, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/as-slow-as-possible/,"A six-hundred-year-long organ recital is going on, and today marks a change in notes. If you miss it, the next one is in two years. We’re used to the rapid increase in speed in just about everything around us. Absolutely positively overnight is mostly too slow for many industries now. It takes discipline, then, to commit to going in the other direction. To deliberately embrace time instead of racing it. "
92,The pitfall of Big Game thinking,"February 4, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/the-pitfall-of-big-game-thinking/,"In the US, [next Sunday] is a major holiday. The Superb Owl, with nachos, commercials and beer. People who don’t even watch football watch this game, and it’s one of the largest audiences each year on TV. For a certain kind of mass marketer, a Super Bowl ad has been the gold standard for 40 years, ever since Lee Clow and Jay Chiat did the original Mac ad. As a result of advertiser demand, the per-viewer cost of running an ad for this mass audience is actually more than it would cost to run targeted ads at only the people you actually want to reach. To put this clearly: advertisers are paying extra to reach people who don’t care and won’t take action. Because it’s big. Super. Easy. A few brands can actually justify these ads with results. They make beer and chips. For just about everyone else, mass isn’t your friend. Mass means average, and the average person isn’t ready to sign up, talk about it or switch. That’s because change always happens at the edges. The same thinking drives companies to advertise on the biggest podcasts, exhibit at the biggest trade shows and hire at the biggest colleges. Not because it’s effective, but because there’s a crowd. The pitfall of Big Game thinking is our lack of focus. We are distracted by what others are doing, have decided is important or chosen to value, instead of doing the rewarding work of focusing on the change we seek to make. Noise is a generalized function. Messages are specific. PS in a shocking display of my cultural awareness that also reveals how little I care about football, the big game is next week. "
93,Two chicken jokes,"February 3, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/two-chicken-jokes/,"“Why did the chicken cross the road” tells us a bit about jokes. It’s a joke about jokes. The first half is a setup, reminding us that an absurd question creates tension, which is then relieved by the punchline. But the second half undoes this by refusing to release the tension. “To get to the other side” is banal. There’s no point to this Q&A. And so we sit, empty, unsure about what happens next. The absence of a punchline reminds us of how much we care about punchlines. On the other hand, “which came first, the chicken or the egg,” isn’t a joke at all. Instead, it’s a false paradox based on a misunderstanding of Darwinian evolution and taxonomy. The only thing that can be born from a chicken egg is a chicken, whereas something that’s almost a chicken could lay a chicken egg. In fact, that’s how we got chickens in the first place. The egg came first. But that’s not the reason for the question. The question exists to create instability, to cause us tension as we seek to find our footing in the face of an infinite loop. Conversations and interactions become more than rote performance precisely because we can create, seek out and relieve tension.  Instability into stability and back again. "
94,Niching up,"February 2, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/niching-up/,"Along the way, folks have talked about “niching down” as a way to help a project find focus. But that’s backward. When we identify and embrace the smallest viable audience, we’re moving up. Up the quality hierarchy. Up in responsibility. Up in the likelihood that we’ll make an impact. To niche up, identify the smallest group of people that would be enough to sustain the project. That group, the group you get to choose, what do they have in common? What do they want? What would they miss if it disappeared… This puts us on the hook, because if they don’t like it, the work needs to be improved. And it gives us the foundation to kindly recommend alternatives to people who aren’t in our group. Instead of hustling for more, we’re focusing for better. [PS today is one of the calendar’s great universal holidays. Hugs to all groundhogs, of any species.] "
95,What to do with firm footing,"February 1, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/02/what-to-do-with-firm-footing/,"If we’ve got tenure, a lifetime appointment or simply a really secure gig, what should we do with it? One option is to race to the bottom, to chase short-term self-focused outcomes and to see how much we can get away with. (Probably, quite a bit). The other is to take this rare chance to race to the top. To do things simply because they need to be done, not because we have to do them. The thing is, for all of us, our tenures are simultaneously more secure and more fragile than we realize. Might as well act accordingly. "
96,The best possible use,"January 31, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/the-best-possible-use/,"I walked by a psychic’s storefront studio. The window said that this person had been reading palms and predicting the future since 1989. It was a large space on a vibrant New York City corner. The rent must be astronomical. Or else the purveyor owns the building. Given that this retail space is quite coveted and the storefront is almost always empty, is this the best use for the space? Wouldn’t the psychic owner do better by renting it to someone who values it more highly? The metaphor for our use of time is clear. The next few minutes or days or months–sure, you own them, and you can put them to whatever use you choose. But just because you’ve been using your time in a particular way for a long time doesn’t mean you need to keep doing that. "
97,Redundancy has a half-life,"January 30, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/redundancy-has-a-half-life/,"At first, this stop sign sign makes a lot of sense: Lives are at stake. Break the rhythm, turn something ignored into something noticed. The challenge with “highlighting” is that it fades. When everything is in all caps, nothing is. Exclamation points are like salt.  When people are commanded to pay attention, it’s worth reminding ourselves that we’re asking for payment. That attention is scarce. And that we waste it, all the time. When we prioritize our pattern breaks, rotate them and keep them fresh, we’re more likely to get the useful attention we need. Also… In a free market for attention, someone is always racing to the bottom. "
98,Normalizing selfishness,"January 29, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/normalizing-selfishness/,"Shoplifters lurk in the shadows. They realize that they will have an easier time if they quietly steal stuff, because speaking up about it won’t help their cause. Sometimes, though, some people seek to change the culture in a way that celebrates taking. “I own this jetski and I can ride it as long, as loud as I want to. Get out of my way.” It’s clearly in the owner’s interest to take over the lake, but not really in anyone else’s. It’s a short-term dead end, though. Your selfish today will probably be replaced by somebody else’s selfish tomorrow. Culture is what happens when the community insists. "
99,Optimized or maximized?,"January 28, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/optimized-or-maximized-2/,"Engineers can optimize a bridge. There are some bridge designs that satisfy aesthetic, financial, durability, safety and efficiency needs better than others. The work of optimization is finding the best set of tradeoffs. Maximization, on the other hand, seeks the solution that ranks the highest for just one goal. After it peaked, Yahoo sought to maximize short-term stock price (and the needs of its top executives) instead of optimizing for customer experience, innovation, resilience and utility. Over time, social networks fade away for similar reasons. They turn users into the product instead of treating them like customers. Maximizing something is simple and may be satisfying. It doesn’t involve difficult tradeoffs and it’s easy to measure. But that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. "
100,Unaware,"January 27, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/unaware/,"If you don’t realize that you have power, you might not be able to exercise it. The power to speak up, to participate, to invent, to lead, to encourage, to vote, to connect, to organize, to march, to write, to say ‘no’ or to say ‘yes’. It’s tempting to imagine we have less power than we do. It lets us off the hook. For now. "
101,Coercion,"January 26, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/coercion-2/,"One way to look at power is “you get to tell people what to do.” But an alternative is that the most powerful institutions, brands and people are the ones who are in alignment with their audience. Trust and the benefit of the doubt are more powerful and resilient than command and control. It’s more difficult to earn this leadership role, and more valuable once you have it. "
102,"A good idea, well executed","January 25, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/a-good-idea-well-executed/,"Why isn’t this enough? There are plenty of good ideas, easy to learn from and copy. There are countless projects, well executed, with the steps on display. Any entrepreneur could find a local business and bring a version of it from over here to over there. And a social change maker could find a successful non profit and simply follow the playbook. None of this is enough. The scarce piece is the willingness to say, “go.” To sign up and to stick with it. To hope, to dream, to push through the dip and most of all, take responsibility. It’s not as risky as it seems, but it’s difficult. "
103,Direct questions worth answering,"January 24, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/direct-questions-worth-answering/,"For everyone on the team… Do you care enough to do great work? Can we agree on what great work looks like? When the world changes, do we have a process to redefine great work? Do you have the tools you need to reach your goals?  How could we create a system where great work is easier to do? "
104,Communications hygiene (and the demise of texting),"January 23, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/communications-hygiene-and-the-demise-of-texting/,"Attention is scarce. Decisions are difficult. Searching takes effort. For thirty years, texting has been a powerful medium. It’s the thing that vibrates in our pocket. It promises something urgent, and a reply that’s demanded equally urgently. “I’m running ten minutes late,” is a fine text, and “okay” is a great response. Like all digital media that works, it’s sticky and has a powerful network effect. Once someone sends you a text, you need to send one back. Once your colleagues are texting, you need to text as well. It works better when you do it the way others are doing it. And, like all digital media that works, it gets corrupted. Sometimes by evil spammers that send texts pretending to know you, “want to play golf tomorrow?” or “your wife said you were selling your house…”. And sometimes by people who aren’t evil at all, but simply have a different sense of the medium than you do. And so here’s a text in which 15 people are cc’ed. You don’t know most of them, so all you see is their phone numbers. And it requires you to stop what you’re doing and open your calendar and calculate whether that day is free or not. And whether the people you hope to interact with are going or not. And of course, if anyone hits reply, everyone gets the reply. And of course, one of those people then decides to ‘get the word out’ and tell everyone else on the thread about their unrelated garage sale, coming up in just a few days… Pretty soon, your pocket vibrates enough with both kinds of texts often enough that you simply don’t prioritize checking, and then, the next time an urgent text comes along, well, it’s ignored. Texting is first come next served. There’s no nuance to it, no priority list, nothing but ‘I read it’ or ‘I didn’t.’ The asymmetry of the dynamic here sows the seeds of the demise. It’s up to every single person you know to protect your attention, up to each of them to be generous and discreet and not waste your time. And the cost of them simply doing what everyone else is doing is so low that the whole thing begins to degrade. Add to that the ease with which telemarketers and spammers can now weaponize your initial contact (14 notes about one dinner reservation!) and you can see how the path only goes one way. The magic of widespread media like the telephone, email and texts is that it’s an open API. No one is actually in charge of the inputs, but this is also the problem. I’m hopeful that services like texts.com or even the folks in Cupertino will take a deep breath and create a protected tier for useful interactions that actually have permission. The structure of the interface determines the utility of the system. If it’s easy to cc 15 strangers, people will. In 1994, I led a team that invented games you could play by text. It almost turned into a killer idea, and maybe it’ll be back one day. And in 1999, I tried to coordinate the work around buying cheap stamps for email, so that the API might be slowed and focused a bit. Perhaps AI will start being an (imperfect) filter, but the problem is so hard to solve after the fact, I’m not optimistic. The rule is pretty simple: bad noise crowds out good signal in just about any useful communications medium. The opportunity is to design against bad noise and to be vigilant about maintaining the magic that made it useful in the first place. "
105,It’s Mac Day (#40),"January 22, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/its-mac-day-40/,"A lot shifted when the Apple Macintosh was introduced, and it wasn’t about the RAM, the chips or the processor speed. Our world changed forty years ago today. Marketing, technology, commerce, luxury brands, communities, communication and our expectations for how we might spend our future all shifted, and fairly quickly. Guy Kawasaki brought me one to use as a beta tester. I was 23 years old and amazed. What I didn’t realize was that revolutions like this were extremely rare, and here was one, at exactly the right moment for my career and for a new cadre of creators. A big shift the Mac announced was turning the computer from a hobbyist novelty into the center of pop culture, productivity and creative work. The Commodore 64 was a toy. This was a car. The first leap like this since Henry Ford. The device itself didn’t do nearly as much as we hoped it would (yet), but the clear and actionable promises that it brought with it changed what we expected and imagined might be next. Regis McKenna never got enough credit for being the visionary behind so much of the marketing and the ripples it caused. Susan Kare became a minor celebrity–for giving a computer a face and a personality. It was the first time the launch of a new product (other than the Edsel, perhaps) was a media event of this magnitude. The Super Bowl ad (which Jobs didn’t even want to do) marked a shift from ads being about the product to also being about the ads. Once we got the joke, we wanted to tell everyone else. Insiders and outsiders. Early adopters and the mainstream. Evangelists. A pattern that’s been repeated hundreds of times since then. There are few concepts that can’t be explained with an Apple anecdote, and it largely began with the launch of this one device. [I invented two devices to work with the Mac–the first fax board in 1986, and a precursor to Sonos that would pipe your music across the room. It turns out that it’s easier to write about Apple than to work with them…] I’m typing this on perhaps the 20th (okay, 40th) Mac I’ve owned. The pace of innovation has now slowed to a crawl as Apple seeks to take profits instead of following the path that the Mac started down two generations ago–to not just sell a product, but to change the culture. Even if they’ve lost the instinct to make something insanely great, they taught people all over the world to want to do so. The change we make is at the heart of the work we’re able to do. "
106,Stumbling in the dark,"January 21, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/stumbling-in-the-dark/,"Learning is complicated. While we’re doing it, it’s easy to imagine that those around us are completely sure of themselves, moving forward in a well-lit space. In fact, if you visit a growing company, a useful school or anywhere that growth is happening, you’ll quickly see that everyone is stumbling forward in the shadows. That’s part of the deal. "
107,Out to get you,"January 20, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/out-to-get-you/,"It’s easy to believe that in some moments, the world is out to get you. This is unlikely. The world hardly knows you exist. There is injustice and trauma and systems of caste. There are tiny pockets of humanity that hold a grudge. But most of the time, in most situations, what happened happened and our story about it is up to us and us alone. It’s not personal, it’s the system. The system is unaware of where we are, and the system is often visible to us before we begin our journey if we pay attention. When things don’t go the way we hope, one alternative is to look hard at the system that caused the problem. And another productive strategy is to figure out what to do with what we get, instead of seeking to find the villain that’s causing our problem. "
108,Decoding ‘story’,"January 19, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/decoding-story/,"Marketers like to talk about the story we tell. And non-marketers imagine that we’re referring to Goldilocks and other ‘once upon a time’ moments. Because stories are the basic building block of culture, it’s difficult to see the nuance in this simple word. But one or two examples can help. A new saw might have a story. A home woodworker isn’t cutting wood for a living–it’s a hobby. When a new saw from Festool comes out, the thoughtful design plants a seed for the home woodworker. From that moment on, every cut with the old saw feels like a compromise or even an insult. And the SawStop table saw is a story as well… every time a home woodworker is about to cut with their old saw, they visualize life without a finger or two… the story is far more emotional than the specs of the item itself. Bottled water is a story. In countries where the water isn’t regularly safe to drink, there’s the simple, practical story of not getting sick. But in wealthy countries, bottled water is a symbol. It’s a symbol for a lot of things, including status. It’s a statement about a certain kind of healthiness or self-care. And all of that rolls up into a story that is rarely put into words. When you buy bottled water in a restaurant, what are you buying?  When environmental organizations started to tell the story of millions of discarded bottles floating in the ocean, it was pretty easy for many bottled water purchasers to ignore. After all, that’s over there, and this bottle is over here. And after all, those bottles in that ocean aren’t about me or affecting me, so I’m not really aware of them. And of course, don’t blame me, because I put my bottle in a blue bin… A far more powerful story just appeared in a scientific journal. It explains that there are 100 times as many microparticles of plastic in bottled water than had been previously estimated. 100 times as many particles that are small enough get into the bloodstream. Billions of tiny health risks. This is a story that will probably stick with many of the people who didn’t want to hear the other story. Because now, looking at that clear bottle of status and health, it is easy for it to look like a bottle of poison. Stories that resonate are the ones that sit with the stories we already believe and value. "
109,“I didn’t get in”,"January 18, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/i-didnt-get-in/,"There are two ways to process this: The selection committee saw me, understood me, and then decided to reject me. or The selection committee didn’t get what I had to offer. I wasn’t rejected, my application was. It’s not that I didn’t get in, it’s that they didn’t engage with the story I told. We can always do a better job of finding the place where we might thrive. And a better job of living and telling the story that earns us a chance to get to that place. But the chances that you were fully seen and rejected as a person are slight indeed. "
110,Who pays?,"January 17, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/who-pays/,"Supply and demand are always in a dance, with one outpacing the other from time to time. In the last three years, the green tech revolution has accelerated dramatically. Countless companies are being created to change how food is grown, people are transported and energy is created. I’ve been stunned by the pace as well as the passion of many of the people working on these projects. The bet some are making is that greener tech will simultaneously be cheaper, easier and more convenient. And then, of course, everyone will switch, and the investments will pay off. But new tech is rarely cheaper, easier and more convenient. And new tech that involves energy almost never is. And so, we see Hertz losing their nerve and selling off electric cars. “There’s insufficient demand” combined with “it’s not as convenient…” The problem here is one of timing. We’re asking the users of the new tech to do most of the paying, even though we all benefit. We benefit from the experience curve that will ultimately enable the price-performance ratio of these technologies to improve. And most of all, we all benefit by saving money on healthcare, climate remediation and unpredictable disasters. Building a bridge between now and later is often a challenge when we seek to rewire our tech. The internet only arrived because DARPA and others kept it going for more than twenty years before it clicked.  Refocusing on the ‘we’ is a powerful way for us to get from here to there.  "
111,Variety and the long tail,"January 16, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/the-inevitable-long-tail-variety-backlash/,"In a We Are All Weird universe, there are two sorts of cultural disappointments. The first has been around since the dawn of cable: We don’t all watch the same thing. We don’t all talk about it, hits aren’t really hits, not like they used to be. There’s no comparison in the reach of M*A*S*H and the Crown. (In fact, it’s about 25:1). It’s easy to miss the feeling of a monoculture if you grew up with it. Hits gave us something to talk about, adhere to or even work against. There are so many pockets of culture, it can’t help but feel a bit more lonely from a certain angle. But the new one is one I’m hearing for the first time, from younger culture denizens who didn’t grow up in the monoculture. They’re arguing that we’re headed back to a monoculture, where filters, memes and the rapid spread of ideas are making everything the same again. The pressure to be in the short head is great, the desire for variety is shrinking in the face of the monopoly’s algorithms and it’s all becoming mush. Sure, a hipster coffee shop in Tokyo feels a lot like one in Boise. But no, that can’t be compared to the hegemony of the orange-roofed Howard Johnson’s or yellow-arched McDonald’s that made every road trip exactly the same. Yes, Sysco puts the same sugar packets everywhere, but at the same time, there are three Ethiopian restaurants in Cleveland right now. I’m pretty sure that when I was stranded there in 1974, there weren’t any. Consider that they’re now discussing the best bagels in … Seattle. (or the best bread in Paris, the best chocolate in Missouri, ethical spices, or even the best gluten-free cakes in New York). The math is simple: more people are consuming more of everything than ever before, but there are very few hits of real scale. That means that many of us spend our time in niches, not in the center. The number one variety of beer, music, sporting event, sneaker, jeans, religious practice and automobile is: OTHER. Yes, the filters keep pushing to make the hits less interesting, but the long tail stays long. None of the above is going to be here for a while longer. "

113,The generous ask,"January 14, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/the-generous-ask/,"“If you don’t ask, you don’t get.” That’s problematic advice. Taken to an extreme, it turns us into hustlers. The alternative is to realize that the best asks are actually offers. When we offer to help someone get to where they were going, we’re approaching the relationship with generosity, not selfishness.  What work would we need to do to have sufficient skill, insight and reputation to be able to offer someone else a chance to reach their goals? That’s how we get. Not by asking, but by offering. "

115,Looking for a handle,"January 12, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/looking-for-a-handle/,"What if your boots don’t have any straps? Bootstrapping is logically impossible. You can’t pick yourself up into the air by lifting on your boots, no matter how hard you try, because gravity isn’t just a good idea, it’s the law. But it’s significantly more difficult if your boots don’t have straps. The word “purchase” has many meanings, but the most eloquent one describes the foothold we find when we’re trying to climb a wall. If you can’t find a spot to stand, it’s hard to get to where you hope to go. And sometimes, we willingly get stuck. Or we create situations where others do. If we’re afraid or benefitting from feeling trapped, we start to eliminate the handles. We know that taking a course, going for a walk or asking for help might move us forward, so we work hard to avoid those things. If the desire to stay stuck is strong, we’ll do anything we can to avoid offering purchase to ourselves or to anyone else who is trying to help. Don’t worry so much about the end of the journey. The focus at the beginning is simply to make a step possible. "

This is always true, anywhere a leader succeeds.  Creating the conditions is the hard part. "
117,Consequences,"January 10, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/consequences/,"Frederick Lewis Donaldson created a list of seven social sins that was soon popularized by Gandhi. One hundred years later, it’s more relevant and more urgent than ever. Wealth without work.Pleasure without conscience.Knowledge without character.Commerce without morality.Science without humanity.Religion without sacrifice.Politics without principle. When we create these imbalances, we pay for them. "
118,Customer service is a choice,"January 9, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/customer-service-is-a-choice/,"It’s either part of your strategy or you’re paying for your mistake. 800 numbers changed the way large brands dealt with the public. Instantly, and for free, a consumer could contact a company about a product or service and they would work to make it right. It was more than fodder for an infinite number of New Yorker cartoons. Some brands made it a part of their marketing strategy (Zappos, for example) while others saw it as a bottomless expense and did as little as they could (Google, for one.) The successful companies in the no-support group spent the money they saved on user experience, working hard to make it so you’d never need to call them. Both are defensible choices. Great customer service is expensive, but it’s also free. It’s free because delighting a customer who has an issue is the single cheapest way to not only keep that customer, but also have them spread the word. Building a new car company is difficult and expensive. Rivian has adopted the strategy of being the most honest, diligent and responsible car company in history. They answer the phone in one ring, a helpful person actually helps, and they work overtime to make things right. If you meet someone with a Rivian, just ask them. A much smaller company, Discourse, supports their software with a community approach that’s human, interactive and effective. It’s not as expensive as having a car towed away, but it supports customer loyalty and decent margins. Delightfully, great companies like PSAudio are following their lead, using Discourse to help customers become connected and find support. It provides a layer of insulation that other companies struggle to keep up with. On the other hand, Firstbase.io, a new company aiming to service founders of new companies, has completely lost their way. They take as long as five business days to respond to a query, their UX is terrible and they generally don’t care, or at least act like they don’t. Unlike Google, who decided to build a customer-facing product that didn’t need support, Firstbase is simply in cost-cutting mode. It’s broken and they know it. You can’t cost cut your way to greatness. Consumers have been trained to expect that companies will engage. Even if you’re a soloist, the availability of instant communication means that if you choose to do a lousy job on support, you’re going to be judged accordingly. "
119,The opposite of insubordination,"January 8, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/the-opposite-of-insubordination/,"“Do as I say.” That’s industrial management in four words. If you don’t follow the instructions to the letter, you’re insubordinate. Not subordinate.  Complete subordination might have been the goal in an industrial setting. But now, it’s dangerous, expensive and inefficent. Because people close to the work know exactly what needs to be done. The opposite of insubordination is now enrollment. Someone who is enrolled in the journey doesn’t have to be told exactly what to do. Instead, given the goals, the tools and the culture, they will figure it out. "
120,Avoiding technology,"January 7, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/avoiding-technology/,"Robert Caro never learned to type. He pecks out his books two fingers at a time on an electric typewriter. There are two reasons to avoid learning a proven new technology: You know what it can do and how it will change your life and you don’t want it. You don’t know what it can do and you don’t want to find out. Kevin Kelly has pointed out that many Amish communities are in the first camp. They designate a few community members as nerds who can try out a technology and report back on how it changed their families and their focus. The end result is that they often make the intentional choice to avoid something that they deem counter to their goals. On the other hand, social media makes many of the people who use it unhappy. It’s better to know and then to decide. "
121,Trying harder,"January 6, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/trying-harder/,"Or trying better? Fast runners aren’t the same as slow runners, but with more effort.

122,PW 5: Measuring the right thing,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/pw-5-measuring-the-right-thing/,"Last in the series… Most of us were indoctrinated to believe that completing chores is the appropriate measure of productivity. “I did all my homework.” Doing all your homework is a measure for industrial bosses. But what, precisely, did your homework ever do for you? The actual measures of productivity that might be useful range quite a bit: Pick your measurement and the impact of your chores will change. "
123,PW 4: Productivity and tools,"January 5, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/pw-4-productivity-and-tools/,"Adam Smith and Karl Marx both wrote about the pin-making machine. Not too long ago, pins (for hats, to hold shirts in place, etc.) were incredibly expensive. They were a luxury item, and a handmade pin might cost more than buying lunch. The pin-making machine changed this. It transformed the labor of four trained workers from 20 pins a day to 10,000. It’s pretty clear that if you wanted to make pins productively, you’d want to own one of these devices. Industrial productivity progress grows and then ebbs or levels out. The inclined plane. The shovel. The assembly line. The computer chip. Robots… When it’s leveling out, some people insist it will never rise again. And yet it does. The tools that are available to each of us are so powerful, so varied and so complex that even the free ones are ignored or misunderstood. We’re too busy doing work to get much done. And so we end up with the convenient and sexy tools (like the smartphone you might be reading this on) and fail to do the few hours or days of training we might need to transform our productivity with desktop tools or thought-through and optimized AI and workflow improvements. Working harder is rarely a better plan than finding better tools. "
124,Productivity week: Bonus,"January 4, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/productivity-week-bonus/,"In an economy built on skill, knowledge, and attitude, the single most powerful way to improve your productivity is to learn something.  You put in the effort once and it pays off for decades. There are more ways for an adult to learn now than at any time in our history, and all of it is self-driven. When you’re ready to level up, the door is open. My classes on Udemy have been taken by more than 75,000 people and four of them are on sale for 25% off for the next few weeks, which rarely happens. There’s a brand new one, a short course on how to understand the charts and graphs that explain how ideas spread. It’s $30 now. In 45 minutes or so, you’ll have a deeper understanding of the dynamics of cultural change.  The Bootstrapper’s course is the one with the highest ratings to date. A bootstrapper builds a project without outside investment, creating value for customers and growing as she goes. Like all the full-length courses here, it’s $139 this month. The Marketing course is the most complete of all my Udemy courses. It starts with the basics and includes more than fifty lessons. Based on the bestselling book This is Marketing and the original Marketing Seminar, it will give you a chance to rethink how you bring your ideas to the people who need them. And finally, The Freelancer’s course is here for independent creators of all kinds. More than 28,000 students so far. A freelancer isn’t a junior sort of entrepreneur. Instead, it’s a chance to do your best work for clients who need you. This course will change the way you approach your work. If you can teach something, even to one person, I hope you will. And if you can learn something, this is the best time to start. (You can even learn to print with letterpress). "
125,PW 3: Errors and productivity,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/pw-3-errors-and-productivity/,"If productivity is useful work created by time or money, it’s worth thinking about what we mean by ‘useful’. There are areas where reliability is crucial. It turns out that building an airplane that works 95% of the time is incredibly easy compared to building one that never crashes. I think we’re all pleased that the standard for airplanes is ‘never’. On the other hand, a book that’s missing a few Oxford commas can still change lives or even win a Pulitzer. Given enough time and enough money, we can make just about anything as reliable as an airplane. But should we? How much extra is a perfectly round pickleball ball worth? The wrong question is: “Is it perfect?” The right question might be: “Does it meet the spec?” If you’re not happy with the spec, change it. But once there’s a spec, good enough is good enough.  "
126,PW 2: Productivity in community,"January 3, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/pw-2-productivity-in-community/,"We need you. But only if you need us. Purple.space is six months old, and there are about a thousand of us now. It was an experiment, now it’s a useful tool. The initiative hat is often ill-fitting. We rush to take it off and get back to doing chores. And that’s why a community of practice is so powerful. When we belong to a group that sees us, respects and is counting on us, the best sort of peer pressure arises. Not to do the thing for others, but to do the best version we can for ourselves. Because our peers know we can. About half the people who sign up for Purple.space unsubscribe during the first week trial… we even put the unsubscribe instructions right on the sign up page. That’s an essential part of an actual community–eager enrollment in the journey. We need you if you need us. Go organize a peer group on your own. Find three or ten or how many folks who will support you as you support them. Or consider Brainstorm Road or Story Republic. Find the others. The hat will fit better. "
127,PW1: Two hats for productivity,"January 2, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/pw1-two-hats-for-productivity/,"Welcome to 2024. Back to work, here we go. So it’s Productivity Week on the blog. Productivity is the measure of the output (value) we get for the time or money we spend. Two hats for productivity: When I’m clearing my inbox, responding to comments in a doc, cooking lunch–these are chores. Chores are the backbone of industrial productivity. We can check them off, measure them and see them stacked up. Most of the time, most of us do chores. Finding a way to do your chores more productively is quite leveraged, and you can put it to use right away. The other hat, though, looks very different. This is the hat of initiative. Finding a new problem to solve. Looking for new tools. Asking questions when we’re not sure there’s even an answer. Launching a new project that might not work. When staring into the bottomless hole of initiative, chores are tempting. Because they put us back on firm footing. Neil Gaiman has a simple solution for writer’s block: He puts himself into a room where there are absolutely no chores to do. No sites to check, no emails to answer. Nothing productive is available except for initiative. It’s hard to wear two hats at once. "
128,Where does your mind go when it wanders?,"January 1, 2024",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2024/01/where-does-your-mind-go-when-it-wanders/,My friend Jason points out that this might be where your heart is. What would have to change for you to actually follow the wandering and make it real? Or for your mind to choose to wander somewhere else? Somewhere you’re already going. 
129,On choosing a college,"December 31, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/on-choosing-a-college/,"For some fortunate 17 year olds, the end of the year is the day for a momentous decision, one that’s largely out of the comfort zone of a 17 year old. A four-year college education in the US can cost nearly half a million dollars once we count the expenses and foregone opportunities that go with it. It can shift our persona, our learning and most of all, the systems we live in for the rest of our lives… One way to make a complex decision of this magnitude is to relentlessly make it simpler. We can begin by vividly describing the flavors, factors and preferences that go into the choice (I have heard every single one of these from students I’ve coached or spent time with) and then pruning them away: Many of these are matters of short-term taste, and are the sorts of things we bring up when everything else either feels the same or we’re afraid to examine the real issues too closely. In my case, I picked the college I went to partly based on the radio station I heard (or didn’t hear) when I visited the campus. Here’s a different way to look at it, one that we can broaden into an insight about adult decisions about where to work, where to live, who to hang out with. There are two parts: That’s it. It doesn’t matter if the campus is pretty or if the football team is good. It doesn’t matter if it was sunny on the day you visited. Unless… unless those factors are the factors that are attracting and keeping the folks you had in mind in #1. A party school isn’t a party school because there’s a good liquor store on campus. It’s a party school because the combination of #1 and #2 create a self-perpetuating system. Once you answer these two questions, pick the least expensive option that helps you get to where you’re going.  Perhaps this feels like a big decision because it’s about you. But it’s not actually about the you you are right now. It’s about the you you hope to become. "
130,Benign vs. normal,"December 30, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/benign-vs-normal/,"We evolved to be wary of change. Our attention is limited, new things can be a threat and the status quo feels comfortable. As a result, we spend a lot of time and energy being afraid (and arguing about) the upcoming changes in our lives, but almost no time at all thinking about the things we’re used to. A decade from now, people will look back on things we do now and view them as dangerous, foolish or selfish. If they were introduced today, they’d be shunned, not embraced. If someone had just invented the coal mine, it would be a really hard sell. The takeaway isn’t that any particular habit or technology is inherently dangerous. It’s that giving the benefit of the doubt to the established ones might be a mistake. "
131,Which agenda?,"December 29, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/which-agenda/,"Every day matters. It seems like a waste to spend one as a to-do list item on someone else’s agenda. It’s easy to become so focused on checking the boxes that we forget that there are people involved. Peers, colleagues and friends that with something human to offer, if we only cared enough to connect. "
132,Rewrite for humans,"December 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/rewrite-for-humans/,"My building had an elevator problem. The management company sent everyone this note: Please be advised we have been experiencing intermittent issues with the elevator. Our priority is your safety, and we are taking immediate action to address the situation. After a thorough investigation by our electrician, it has been identified that there may be an issue with low voltage affecting the elevator’s performance. The electrician has reported this matter directly to Con Edison and is working collaboratively with them to rectify the situation promptly. Con Edison will not be able to address this issue until sometime next week. Until this matter is resolved, the elevator will be taken out of service. We understand that any disruption in elevator service can be inconvenient, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Your safety is our top priority, and we assure you that we are taking every necessary step to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this time. I asked ChatGPT to rewrite it for humans. It responded with: We’re fixing the intermittent elevator issues to ensure your safety. Our electrician found a potential low voltage problem affecting the elevator. They’ve informed Con Edison and are working together to solve it quickly. However, Con Edison can only start repairs next week. For safety, we’re shutting down the elevator until it’s fixed. We apologize for the inconvenience this causes and are working fast to resolve it. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. I took it one step further: You have probably noticed that the elevator is broken. The electrician is working with ConEd but they don’t expect it to be fixed until next week. We know it’s a hassle, and thank you for being patient. People don’t write like bureaucrats because it’s easy or fun. They do it because of the mistaken belief that it lets them off the hook. "
133,Leverage,"December 27, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/leverage/,"It’s almost impossible to remove a screw with your bare hands, but easy with a screwdriver. The handle might only add a little torque, but it’s more than enough. If someone is succeeding at something you find difficult, it might be because they realized they needed a screwdriver. Looking for the tool is the first step in finding it. "
134,Finding a more useful umwelt,"December 26, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/finding-a-more-useful-umwelt/,"Add up all the senses you use and the things you notice: that’s your umwelt.  It’s pretty obvious that your dog has a different one than you do. They see fewer colors and smell far more intelligently. Sea slugs see a much wider range of colors, and bats can sense vibrations. Among humans, we each have our own umwelt. Paying attention, after all, requires payment. If your default range of inputs is working for you, that’s fabulous. But for most of us, we’re missing something, something we might not even realize. What if we went looking for it? "
135,“Let’s face it”,"December 25, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/lets-face-it/,"In 1959, three years after Columbia Records spent a fortune rolling out stereo recording, a senior A&R executive named Ward Botsman told the New York Times, “Let’s face it, the craze for stereo has not been as intense as expected,” writing off the format that would end up thriving for, as far as I can tell, forever. It’s hard to tell a fad from a trend when you’re in the middle of it. But often, that’s our job. The easiest thing to do in the face of change (which brings fear) is to become cynical and to decide that the change you fear is nothing but a fad, soon to disappear. But it’s also tempting to imagine that every fad is going to instantly and permanently change the systems of our culture. Ward was paying attention to buzz instead of focusing on the structural changes that were moving in the other direction. Cynicism is easy. And sometimes it pretends to be clear-eyed thinking. "
136,Happiness can often be traded for money,"December 24, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/happiness-can-often-buy-you-money/,"Most of us know what enough happiness feels like. But some people are stuck in an endless cycle of seeking more money. That’s a bad trade. Because after a certain threshold, it’s hard for more money to buy you more happiness. And the trap is that trying ends up costing you both. "

One spam phone call a day is an irritation. 1,000 of them destroy the utility of the phone. One photographer undercutting our rates is a threat. 1,000 of them means we can’t make a living at it any longer. We’re facing several 1000x cliffs right now. The most obvious is AI. (Or possibly not). Entire systems are going to be replaced. New careers are developing overnight, and old ones are going away. When an AI can read a standard x-ray 1000 times faster and 1000 times cheaper than a radiologist (and get better results) then something is going to have to change. The more urgent one is the change in the climate. One freakish storm is something many economies and communities have a chance to recover from. But 1,000 days of weird weather is more than we can handle. Systems are networks, and widespread changes compound exponentially. "
139,Drama at work,"December 21, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/drama-at-work/,"A divo (or diva) is an opera singer with skill. Sometimes, though, that skill comes in a package that also includes imperiousness, skittishness and a fair amount of unpredictable drama. It’s tempting to imagine that CEOs, painters or poets that bring the noise must also have skill.  But burning your guitar doesn’t make you Jimi Hendrix. There are some film directors that have meltdowns, go over budget and fuel their creative work with feuds. And then there are the professionals that do great work. That’s it. Simply great work. With few exceptions, we’re better off with just the skill part. The media loves the drama, but your co-workers and customers don’t. I’ve never seen a resume that listed “low drama” under skills, but it might be a useful attribute. "
140,The clamp and the mallet,"December 20, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/the-clamp-and-the-mallet/,"While building a project, I found that a key part was stuck. I tapped it with a mallet, then harder, and eventually whacked at it. No luck. Then I got smart and put three clamps around the part, gently turning each one, increasing the pressure, until it simply popped out. Persistent, gentle pressure almost always outperforms sudden, violent blows. "
141,The problems with flat out,"December 19, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/the-problems-with-flat-out/,"The desire for 11 is proof that we often want to go all the way to ten. While 11 is silly, there is a lot of pressure to give our all. But there are problems. The first is that if you try to sprint an entire marathon, you’ll hurt yourself. Systems can be stressed for short periods, but they burn out much more quickly if we overdo it. The second is that a system running flat out needs constant attention. This attention distracts us from all the alternatives, strategies and shortcuts that present themselves along the way. When we’re at maximum all the time, there’s no acceleration or deceleration, both of which create opportunities for change and growth. The hypervigilance required to go at full speed gives us no room to breathe or even improve. And if we’re at a full sprint, we’ve robbed ourselves of the flexibility to turn it up, right at the moment when it’s most needed. "
142,Focusing attention is a skill,"December 18, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/focusing-attention-is-a-skill/,"Where we choose to direct our gaze determines not only what we learn or believe, but how we choose to see the world. Typing is a skill. Juggling is a skill. So is project management. It’s easy to overlook the fact that we can get better at what we think about, create and consume. If we’re not happy with how external forces are stealing and redirecting our attention, we can change it. "
143,Personal process notation,"December 17, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/personal-process-notation/,"“I’ll remember it later.” I’ll confess, I rarely do. It turns out, it’s easier to remember questions than answers. And tools like Google Docs and photos in the cloud give us a chance to build our own personal search engine. It takes 14 steps to construct the pages in one of my InDesign projects. Inevitably, when I return to the file after a few months, I forget some of them. I wrote myself a one-page manual in a Google Doc, and there it is, with links and screenshots, whenever I need it. When you get a new electronic device, take photos of the manual before you toss it. When a professional is showing you how to do something, take a video of it, label it and put it in the cloud for later. Take pictures of all of your credit cards, IDs and important documents. When you’re having a good day, go for a walk and record a ten minute audio sharing your optimism, confidence and possibility. You’ll want to listen to it again. When a recurring event happens for the first time, put it in your calendar. The dog meds reminder will happen without you prompting it every month. PS I wrote this post to remind me to do this too. "

145,Signal and noise,"December 15, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/signal-and-noise/,"If the signal is very weak and the noise is large, it’s easy to imagine that there’s no signal at all. AI and computers can be used as lenses now, which means we can strip away the noise and see things that we certainly didn’t expect. Dina Katabi at MIT can point a radio antenna at you while you’re sleeping (even from across the room or through drywall) and determine whether you’re dreaming or not. We can see patterns in how people type, surf the web or interact with others. We can sort through huge volumes of data and find connections that others were sure were invisible. Not just in whether we’re dreaming, but in how medicine works, the forces driving our culture and more. Systems work because each element of the system sends a signal to the other elements. Sometimes those signals are obvious and the system works in predictable ways. Other times, we rely on false proxies because we simply can’t tell the signals from the noise. New diagnostics in every field are changing this. Typical consumer AI is a clever trick that makes us think the computer is a pretty good writer. But machine learning aimed at patterns and signals shows us things that we never knew were there. For a long time, we’ve assumed that complex systems (like the brain, or the weather) were a sort of magic. As we are able to decode the signals, though, we have a chance to understand how they work.

147,Valuable contributions,"December 13, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/valuable-contributions/,"We actually don’t really know. Netflix just released their first-ever detailed analysis of how many hours of engagement the top 15,000+ most watched shows on the network received over a six month period. Here’s the file. Who won? That question is actually the lesson here. The fact is, most organizations are pretty clueless about where real value lies. We’re all playing Moneyball, all the time. The obvious answer: more hours watched = more value created is pretty easily dismissed. In fact, a lonely couch potato with no friends who watches for eighty hours a week is probably costing Netflix more than they’re paying. A show that’s popular but easily replaced by another show that could find the good luck to be popular is a shiny trap. Perhaps value is created by the creator of a show that is the one show that gets someone to keep paying their Netflix bill, even if they only watch an hour a week. Perhaps it’s a show that a group finds worth talking about, so each hour of viewing translates into new customers for the network. Maybe it’s a show that earns them a reputation as creator-friendly, so it brings them the next generation of story tellers. Or it might be the show that costs not very much to license from abroad, but generates plenty of impact for a difficult to reach portion of the audience… At the local car rental place, the most valuable employee might be the one who made sure, at the last moment, that the car didn’t smell like cigarettes, or found a defect that might have led to a breakdown. It’s easy to show that saving a good customer is worth far more than pushing for a fancy ad that only attracts some bargain-seeking short-term customers. Whether you’re running a political campaign, a non-profit fundraiser or a network, it’s almost certain that your team is confused about where the value really lies. "

Henry wrote about the Magi, it’s been pretty clear that gifts aren’t about the stuff as much as they are the intent. Holidays where gifts are expected undermine this, because it’s hard to tell where obligation begins and intent fades away. One lightweight and quick alternative to traditional items are digital ones. Here are a bunch of free ebooks for you to share, or consider giving someone a subscription to this blog. There are also countless free ebook and audiobooks out there, as well as thousands of hours of Grateful Dead concerts. Consider spending an hour to teach someone you care about a new skill, or how to understand or streamline their digital day (including RSS, a gift that keeps on giving). If you’re looking for physical items, I just discovered the best water bottle ever made. I contacted the company and volunteered to contribute a collab to support their mission. And of course, you can get one with my logo on it. It also comes with a ridiculous poem I asked chatGPT to write. And in 2023, I published The Song of Significance. I hope you’ll get a chance to read or listen, in whatever form, with people you work with/care about. My complete list of books, calendars and whatnot is right here.

I decided to look at the folks I was walking near. Of those 800 people, not one was as conventionally attractive as a movie star. Few looked like the images I saw on the billboards I passed. Most wouldn’t be cast in a commercial. Perhaps 40 went to a famous college, maybe 10 played competitive sports. All of them were kinder and wiser than the typical TV character, and cared very much about something important. They were older and younger than the average ‘target market’ for most products. Some carried canes, wore glasses, or had hearing aids. A few were in wheelchairs. A bunch could run far faster than I can, and every one of them knew about things I’ve never even thought about. If we zoom out and imagine passing 800 randomly chosen people from around the world, we see even more of what it means to be on this planet. Of those 800, fewer than 300 have ever been on an airplane. Half are smarter than average. 200 speak a little English. 50 make just a few dollars a day. Four or five live in bondage. Very few of them have as big an impact on the climate as you and I, and more than 600 of them are very concerned about what’s happening to the world around us. For a long time, scaled consumer marketing has created status roles where none used to exist, and amplified division and class as a way to create insufficiency and generate sales. But what we see when we look at the media or at a stack of resumes doesn’t accurately represent the world as it is. We are all weird, and that’s okay. "
151,"Wrestling, fighting or dancing?","December 9, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/wrestling-fighting-or-dancing/,"We can wrestle with a challenge or a problem and find energy and possibility while doing it. And we can dance with someone else as we seek a mutual way forward. Fighting tends to be more brutal, final and hurtful than is often productive. You don’t want to spend your days fighting. The words matter. "
152,All species are invasive species,"December 8, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/all-species-are-invasive-species/,"Human beings as we know them have only been around for 70,000 years or so. Honeybees got to North America around the time Columbus did. And the same is true for technologies and companies. Western Union was an interloper, telegrams were the scary new tech that was going to change everything for the worse. It’s easy to be in favor of the status quo, but it’s also true that the status quo used to be a brand-new threat. "
153,Abundance and ideas,"December 7, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/abundance-and-ideas/,"A colleague got an angry note. It concluded with, “you should know better.” The transgression? The sender was offended that my friend had written a post about a concept she’s been developing for nearly a decade. Of course, no idea is unique, and the posted idea sort of rhymed with one that the professor had been working on for a while as well. The note demanded she take down the post. Really? In general, when you think someone is poaching your idea, it’s worth remembering that they probably aren’t, that you probably weren’t first, that the ideas probably don’t overlap as much as you think, and… even if it is precisely what you thought of in the first place, the spreading of an idea is a good thing. I’ve managed to coin dozens of fairly original phrases over the years, and some are based on new concepts I brought forward. I only have time to do this because I don’t spend my days bothering people who write posts that I imagine overlap with my work. There are books by others based on these ideas, and even entire industries. I’m not waiting for royalty checks or even credit lines any time soon. In fact, when people write posts that overlap, that’s a good thing. Ideas that spread, win. No, don’t take credit for an idea that’s not yours. You look smarter and more confident when you give credit where credit is due. Giving credit is generative and raises your status. But there’s no reason to need to persistently expand the taking of credit. It brings a scarcity mindset to the work, when what we need to do is generate connection and possibility instead. If everyone in town comes to your factory and takes a sample, you’re in trouble. But if everyone takes your idea (or an idea that you think is sort of like your idea), you’re onto something. "
154,Hope and expectations,"December 6, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/hope-and-expectations/,"They’re not the same thing. Hope can fuel us. Hope can be refilled. Hope opens the door to possibility. Expectations, on the other hand, are a trap. They make us brittle and lead to disappointment. When we raise our hopes and lower our expectations, we establish a resilient way forward. "
155,The head of marketing,"December 5, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/the-head-of-marketing/,"It’s easy to be confused about this job, because it’s not one job, it’s at least three. This is why it’s a difficult job to fill, and why turnover is so high–we’re not allocating resources or setting expectations in a way that matches the work to be done. Marketing strategy: This is the work of positioning, story telling, status and affiliation. It’s understanding network effects, the user experience and the change we seek to make. Good marketing strategy overcomes just about everything else. Some of my books are about this. Promotion: This is more tactical. It’s coupons and PR and perhaps advertising. It’s steady permission marketing, a thoughtful content strategy and a team of people who consistently and generously tell your story. This is what many people think of as marketing, but while it needs to be consistent with the strategy, it’s a different set of skills and activities. Sales support: In many organizations, the main role of marketing is to support the work of the sales team. This integrated role feels very different from the typical brand marketer’s job. Project management: Given how much time, money and effort go into the marketing function, it requires consistent and insightful leadership. There are a lot of constituents, moving parts and decisions to be made. Prettiness: Definitely not worth putting in bold. This is logo design, empty phrases about look and feel and endless debates about taste. When the CEO says she’s looking for marketing help, it’s probable that what seems to be missing is promotion. But without the other two elements, not much is going to happen. "
156,Wild Hope Now: The power of books for causes,"December 4, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/wild-hope-now-the-power-of-books-for-causes/,"Non-profits and charities depend on the emotional and financial support of their backers. And that support is always based on a story. A story of possibility, of justice, of community. They serve to right wrongs, to fix problems, to shine a light and to make things better. I’ve discovered that a book is a powerful tool for sharing this story. This week, Afya is launching a book by my friend Danielle Butin. It’s only available on their site.  Wild Hope Now is the story of one person who saw a problem and refused to turn away. And it’s the story of how she began in her backyard, organizing one person, then ten, then entire institutions. Afya is now saving lives around the world. Books like Wild Hope Now and the ones I’ve listed below humanize the magic of these causes. While a video can go viral, a book can make it easy to not only share the story with others, but actually make an impact. Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson The Blue Sweater by Jacqueline Novogratz Walk in Their Shoes by Jim Ziolkowski Manifesto for a Moral Revolution by Jacqueline Novogratz Thirst by Scott Harrison Creating Room to Read by John Wood The ideas in these books and books like these really resonate with me. I find myself hearing the authors’ voices as I go about my day, a reminder that better is not only urgent, but it’s possible. Possible here and possible now. Sharing books like these is a triple gift. You learn something. The person you buy a copy for feels seen and respected and learns something as well. And the growth in support for the cause makes a difference for the long haul. "
157,The sixty-day staircase,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/the-sixty-day-staircase/,"In the moment, it’s really difficult. l’esprit de l’escalier means, “the spirit of the staircase.” That thing you wished you had a said just a moment ago, the bon mot or the clever riposte. It only comes to us as we’re walking away. But this sort of quick comment is good for the movies, not so much for the work we seek to do. When we’re in the middle of it, when the speed bump or emergency arises, perhaps it pays to write a blog post about the incident that will go live in two months. Or to simply think about what you will remember about this moment then. Two months ago, that thing that happened, could you handle it better now? We’re able to build the habit of finding that staircase. "
158,True/useful,"December 3, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/true-useful/,"Here’s a simple grid that might change the way you think about internal stories: When we believe in something that’s useful but not true, it can serve a helpful purpose. The tooth fairy, perhaps. When we act on something that’s useful and also true, we’ve found a resilient path forward. That’s because the truth doesn’t vary based on whether or not others choose to acknowledge it. In the top left is the cynical corner of focusing on things that while true, aren’t particularly useful. Thinking about the fact that a critic hated your last film isn’t going to help you with your next film, especially if the work wasn’t designed to please the critic in the first place. And in the bottom left is the common trap of believing things that aren’t true, and that aren’t helpful either. These beliefs lead to ennui, to frustration and to division. "
159,When was the last time you used a compass?,"December 2, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/when-was-the-last-time-you-used-a-compass/,"How about an astrolabe? Or even a watch? Technology advances, and sooner or later, the old stuff gets left behind. It’s easy to romanticize some of the classic devices that we built civilization on, and it’s worth remembering that the tech we’re wrestling with now will soon be faded away, with some folks nostalgic for the good old days. Everything doesn’t always move toward better, but everything moves. "
160,When the committee decides,"December 1, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/12/when-the-committee-decides/,"They’re almost always conservative. Whether it’s a governmental body, the strategy group at a big company or the membership panel at the local country club, we can learn a lot by seeing what they approve and when they stall. Of course, each of us know a lot about our offering, the change we seek to make and why it’s better. It’s easy to believe that, “If I were you I’d pick this obvious, rational choice…” and pitch accordingly. But they’re not you. They’re the committee. And the committee almost never makes what outsiders might say is the ‘right’ decision, instead they choose what’s right for them, now. And that is usually a combination of: Persistence. A new idea is almost never embraced right away. It might take years. It’s easier to wait to see who will be there tomorrow than to grab what’s here today. Urgency. Advance planning is clearly the smart move, but with fear, risk avoidance, and competing priorities, it’s the urgent that is often put on the agenda. Affiliation. “What will our peers say?” is an unspoken but powerful force. Everyone else, or the appearance of everyone else has a huge impact. WIFM. Not a radio station, but the truth that each person choosing begins with concern about what’s in it for them. It might be status, affiliation, avoidance of fear or a simple desire (or a complex one). Compromise. It’s a committee, after all. Group acceptance of a small benefit might be seen as better than a bigger benefit that’s divisive. Status. There are the status roles within the committee (who suggested this, who will benefit the most from this) and the status roles the committee sees within the organization and across organizations. Moving up (or not falling behind) is at the forefront of many decisions. A better idea has little chance in the face of these forces. "
161,The thing about Hobson,"November 30, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-thing-about-hobson/,"People talk about Hobson’s choice as if it’s always a bad thing. A liveryman in pre-industrial London, he rented horses. And every customer was allowed to take the horse closest to the door. Hobson’s choice is no choice at all. Of course, this system meant that the horses were rotated, and the fanciest ones weren’t overworked. It meant that you didn’t get to insist on a selection that was sub-optimal for the ridership as a whole. It’s tempting to imagine that when each person chooses, we all come out ahead. But sometimes, Hobson has a point. "
162,The art of estimation,"November 29, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-art-of-estimation/,"If you’re a freelancer or a contractor of any kind, it’s typical to be asked for an estimate or a quote. And if you’ve been doing business for a while, it’s likely that you’ve heard about price more than just about any other factor in losing an opportunity. So the pressure is on to sharpen your pencil, find the lowest price and do the best work you can under the circumstances. This leads to a grind and an endless race to the bottom. The glitch lies in how we interpret the objection about price. What the client is actually saying is, “All things being equal, the other alternative is cheaper, so we went with them.” But all things don’t have to be equal. There are plenty of clients who don’t actually want the cheapest choice. They want the best one, and a powerful estimate is the clue they use to choose. If your estimate: …then you’ve restated the problem. You’ve brought the client along on the journey with you, and established that they’re not spending more for the same thing, they’re spending more for a better, safer, higher status, more reliable thing. What’s the best proposal/estimate you’ve ever seen? In your industry or any other? Do you have a standard for this that’s as high as the standard for the craft you do? Of course, you don’t have the time to do this sort of estimate for every prospect. Which is the second half of the art. Politely declining to do estimates for people who are simply seeking the lowest price. Eagerly and happily send them to the people who used to be your competition.

163,Study groups,"November 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/study-groups/,"If I had to choose one metric that would determine how well someone would do in law school, it wouldn’t be the LSAT or another test. It would be whether or not they formed a study group, and who else was in it. Of course, the same is true for your project, or any sort of adult learning. It’s easier than ever to organize a group like this… in fact, we almost have to work hard to avoid it. The speed of our forward motion is directly related to the velocity of the people around us.  "
164,The hard part first,"November 27, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-hard-part-first/,"If you’re trying to reduce risk, do the hard part first. That way, if it fails, you’ll have minimized your time and effort. On the other hand, if you’re looking for buy-in and commitment so you can get through the hard part, do it last. People are terrible at ignoring sunk costs, and the early wins and identity shifts that come from the easy successes at the beginning will give you momentum as you go. "
165,The long-range forecast keeps shifting,"November 26, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-long-range-forecast-keeps-shifting/,"Exactly. That’s why it’s a forecast, not an accurate account of what’s going to happen in the future. This seems axiomatic, but our desire for certainty keeps letting us down. The shifting of forecasts is evidence that they’re merely forecasts. "
166,After the meteorite,"November 25, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/after-the-meteorite/,"When it slams into your house and destroys it, we’re likely to pursue one of two lines of thinking: –How did I cause this? What choices did I make, what mistakes did I permit, why did I deserve to have this damage, or who can I blame? –Well, that happened, now what should I do? Looking for reasons, blaming others, or worse, blaming ourselves is a waste. It’s self-defeating. It creates shame and second-guessing, separates us from our community and distracts us from the work at hand. Sometimes there’s a lesson to be learned, but when actual bad luck leads to a significant bolt of lightning and all the pain it causes, there is no lesson. There’s simply what happened. Now what? "
167,The network scam,"November 24, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-network-scam/,"Lana Swartz coined this term in her breakthrough paper on crypto. A scam always involves a transaction. In the traditional fraud, the scammer tells a lie and the buyer, either with or without diligence, believes it and loses everything. You buy the magic beans, but they don’t grow. But modern scams have a network component to them. Either there are conditions present where the scams are far more likely to occur (because of the magnification media and other forces can offer to the scammer) or, in this case, because the gullible buyer has a hunch it’s a Ponzi scheme, but plays along because he believes he can then pass the buck to the next sucker and come out ahead. If someone bought an NFT in the belief it was going to go up, without regard for its actual utility, they are participating in a network scam. Without a society of others sharing the same belief, it wouldn’t work. Perhaps climate denial is also a kind of network scam. If you can pump oil or sell cheap disposable fashion or benefit from subsidized cheap beef, it’s only because other people are joining you in sharing a short-term outlook on the world. Sooner or later (probably sooner), the delusion fades, and people (all of us) are left holding the bag. In a well-lit and rational world, we could see network scams for what they are, and do something about them before they spiral out of control. Alas, the alternative is something Swartz quotes a hustler as saying: “If it’s a Ponzi, get in early.” PS Black Friday is a network scam. "
168,Generosity and gratitude,"November 23, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/generosity-and-gratitude/,"A gift doesn’t diminish the giver. Sharing creates connection, possibility and energy. And the magic of gratitude is that it improves everything it touches, especially the person who offered it in the first place. So, what holds us back? Fear. Fear of connection, of change, of seeing what is possible. It might feel safer to focus on scarcity. Generosity and gratitude often go together. They light a path on the way to better. "
169,Long form AI,"November 22, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/long-form-ai/,"The new version of Claude can read a document of up to 400 pages in about three minutes. You can then ask it for criticism, summaries or other insights. I wouldn’t use it on a piece of literature, but if you’re reading for work (aren’t we all), it will dramatically increase how much you can survey before diving deep. And it’s very talented at reading something you wrote and telling you where you might have gone astray. Simply say, “please summarize and critique this, looking for strategic errors and inconsistencies: ” and then paste your document. If it doesn’t understand what you meant to say, there’s a good chance the reader won’t as well. "
170,Three sheet metaphors,"November 21, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/three-sheet-metaphors/,"Here’s a large blue bedsheet, queen sized. If we’re going to pull it taut, it will take the coordinated effort of eight people, each pulling just the right amount, from each corner and edge. If we’re going to billow it up and down, like a parachute, we’re going to need those people to work in sync, pulling and pushing in just the right rhythm, or it will merely flutter. And if we want it to stay clean, we have to all work to avoid even a single drop of dye from landing on its surface. Because it only takes a drop to divert all attention from its original state to the defect. "
171,Nice bike,"November 20, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/nice-bike/,"A well-designed bicycle is efficient, inexpensive and delightful. If you use your bike on the right paths, with appropriate goals, it can deliver exactly what you need, while also allowing you to go at your own pace, see what’s going on around you and feel grounded. Until, of course, you get jealous. If you start trying to ride your bike on the freeway, or insist on adding extra seats, electric drivetrains and bright lights, sooner or later, you’re going to end up with a vehicle that’s not good at being a bike or a car.  Better, of course, to simply get rid of the bike and get the kind of car you need. Until, of course, you get jealous. A car is not a rocket. It can’t do rocket things. It can’t even do bus things or tractor things. It’s simply good at being a car. Read any business news, and you’ll find stories of unicorns, venture funding and IPOs. Stories of powerful CEOs who are out to change the world. They rarely got there on a bicycle.  That’s okay.  The challenge arises when we take our eyes off of what we set out to build in the first place. "
172,The perfect conditions,"November 19, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-perfect-conditions/,"Somewhere, there is the ideal soil for growing mangoes. Or the best possible wave for surfing. Or the most romantic sunset for a proposal. But it’s not right here and it’s not right now. Our success has a lot to do with how we dance with conditions that aren’t quite perfect. "
173,Working with problems,"November 18, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/working-with-problems/,"They’re everywhere we look. Here are a few thoughts on the ones that won’t go away: First, is it a problem or a situation? Problems, by definition, have solutions. You might not like the cost of the solution, the trade-offs it leads to, or the time and effort it takes, but problems have solutions. On the other hand, situations don’t. Situations are simply things we need to live with. Once we realize that a problem we have isn’t a problem at all, but actually a situation, it’s easier to do our best to move on and thrive. Focusing on a situation is usually a source of stress, not a way forward. Second, has anyone else ever solved a problem like this one in a useful way? If not, it might be a situation. See question one. Third, if the problem has been around for a while, it might not be an easy problem. Those tend to get solved right away. It’s probably a problem that involves more effort or trade-offs than you were hoping for. Resetting our expectations for what it might take to solve gives us the chance to recalibrate it as a situation we’re willing to live with, simply because the cost of the solution is too high. And finally, some problems get better if we’re willing to talk about them. Some situations, on the other hand, simply get worse when we focus our energy and community on them. "
174,Who’s got the camera?,"November 17, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/whos-got-the-camera/,"For years, I’ve been using this picture of Neil Armstrong when I tell the story of meeting him and hearing his talk at one of his last public appearances: I wasn’t there when this photo was taken, so I relied on a Google image search to find it: I compounded Google’s error. Sorry, Buzz. Neil had the camera. The photos of him on the moon were taken by a long selfie stick on the LEM. All the iconic shots show a very very tiny image of Neil reflecting in Buzz Aldrin’s visor (so technically, I guess he is in those photos). We need people to hold the metaphorical camera. But when they do, they’re often not in the shot. That doesn’t mean they’re not doing important work. "
175,The second mistake,"November 16, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-second-mistake/,"That’s the avoidable one and the one that usually causes the real trouble. When the first mistake flusters us, breaks our rhythm or messes with our confidence, we’re far more likely to make the second one. It’s almost impossible to avoid making a mistake. But avoiding the second mistake (or, just as likely, the cover-up) is a learnable skill. "
176,Turtleneck confusion,"November 15, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/turtleneck-confusion/,"Apple didn’t succeed because of the way Steve Jobs dressed. Just like SBF’s hair didn’t put him in jail. We can look at the outré behavior of various Silicon Valley overlords and come to the conclusion that it’s not only a necessary part of the job but actually the cause of their project’s success. That’s like saying that all the rigamarole some baseball players do before stepping up to the plate leads to home runs, or that an author’s special pencil is the secret to their writing style. You don’t have to scream and yell to run a great restaurant. The rapid rise of tech and the power of the network effect is mysterious to many. Add to that the proven but non-obvious foundations of successful marketing, and it seems like the easiest way forward is to simply copy some antics we see in the media. It’s tempting to look for clues as to the magic. But co-incident events aren’t always causes. No need to be part of the circus. If you can find a problem and solve it, you can skip the clown car. "

They’re not thriving and they might not even be around any more. The reason that our attention has been strip-mined is that the system that evolved seems to reward short-term players that take the direct, easy, and lazy way out. While it seems like we have no choice, in fact, we have a very obvious one. It turns out that finding, connecting and respecting a small group of supporters and customers always outperforms the hustle for more. And that if you can create a remarkable story that’s worth spreading, it’ll spread. Not because you need it to, but because your customers do. Reluctant or not, spam is still spam. If you can’t imagine wanting to receive it, don’t send it. "

That works fine when it’s a bright moon and an open field, but not so well for the moths if the light was set up as a bug trap. Processionary caterpillars follow the one in front until their destination, even if they’re arranged in a circle, leading them to march until exhaustion. It might be that you have built a system for your success that works much of the time, but there’s a glitch in it that lets you down. Or it might be that we live in a culture that creates wealth and possibility, but glitches when it fails to provide opportunity to others or leaves a mess in our front yards. The thrill-seeking behavior that allows someone to become a rock star might not be the method they need to keep their career going and to live a resilient and generative life… Humans can do something moths can’t: when we find the glitch, we can work to do something about it.

182,The amateur presenter,"November 10, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-amateur-presenter/,"Not “amateur” as in the unprepared professional. Amateur as in the passionate individual, untrained but with something to say. If you’re called on to give a talk or presentation, the biggest trap to avoid is the most common: Decide that you need to be just like a professional presenter, but not quite as good. Being a 7 out of 10 at professional presenting is a mistake. Better to stay home and send a memo. Don’t set yourself up for a ‘fail.’ Instead, here’s a chance to actually share your light and your vision. No, the opportunity is to refuse to become a slightly prepared wannabe professional presenter. Just like it doesn’t pay to slightly practice the violin or sort of get ready to play in the NHL. Sure, you might land a few well-timed punchlines or have a clever slide design. And sure, your violin might be in tune or your slap shot might work… But it probably won’t. The alternative is to eagerly become an amateur presenter. Here are some thoughts to get you started: Do you have something to say? If you don’t, stay home and send a memo. But if there’s a story you want to tell, a change you want to make, an impact you want to have, be really clear about what it might be. Simply getting through your presentation relatively unscathed probably isn’t a worthy goal. Don’t apologize. Don’t apologize for being nervous, for caring, for not having 200 practice runs under your belt. The audience is offering you a tiny slice of time and attention. You cared enough to show up, here we go. Find just one person. This is repeated often enough to be hackneyed, but it’s still ignored. I mean it. You have a microphone. There’s a room with some people in it. One of them, just one, is the sort of person you can tell your story to. So tell it to them. Ignore every other person. Don’t project your voice to fill the room, don’t pace around like Zig Ziglar or choreograph your slides, or tell jokes. You don’t do that in real life. Well, this is real life. Find one person and tell them your story. If other folks want to listen in, that’s fine. Don’t memorize and don’t read. Very talented actors, recently returned from their strike, can read and make it sound like they’re not reading. A few podcasters I know can do this as well. Almost no one else can. Instead, amateurs understand that they’ve been telling stories their whole lives, and given the chance, they can tell a story again. Without reading it. This isn’t a performance. Professionals perform. It’s their job. This is you sharing the change you’d like to make with one person sitting a few feet away from you. Think about the most important interactions you’ve had. The ones with partners, doctors, strangers and friends. None of them were professional speeches. Not one. Instead, a human interacted with you and made a change happen. Not because they had a script and a director, but because they cared. The challenge isn’t in becoming a sort of pretty good professional presenter. The challenge is becoming you. Of course, it’s scary. But the response to the fear isn’t to soothe ourselves with memorization and insulation. It’s to simply show up. "
183,The paradigm flip,"November 9, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-paradigm-flip/,"Paradigm shifts are appealing but rarely well executed. A paradigm is our mental model of the world. We’re surrounded by people who share a similar model, and as long as the model is working, we live our lives without thinking much about it. If you lived in a space station, the absence of gravity would be something you’d notice at all times… until one day, you didn’t. Technology and culture conspire to change the rules. When that happens, there are huge opportunities for those bold enough to imagine a different system, a mental model that isn’t simply adjusted, but rebuilt. Network TV was based on the paradigm of mass markets and the battle for the last few percentage points of share. Cable TV shifted that (a bit) because niche networks could find plenty of viewers to make a profit, and suddenly, the smallest viable audience was a useful new way to build a media asset. MTV and ESPN couldn’t have worked in a three-channel world, but did fine in one with forty channels. The real flip, though, comes from YouTube. Now, it’s not about trying hard to add a few channels. It’s about embracing the idea that there’s an infinite number of channels. That a scarcity of spectrum isn’t normal or useful. And no one from the world of network or cable TV understood this or did anything about it. They were focused on shifting, not flipping. Many of my colleagues and friends in the traditional publishing business are still wrestling with the print version of this. They have assets, reputation and a bit of momentum, but instead of flipping to a new system, they’re inching around a shift. In medicine, millions of lives have been saved by flipping paradigms. Germ theory, for example, and hand washing. Or more recently, beta-blockers for heart disease, or seeing the role of bacteria in ulcers. In this video, my friend Jonathan Sackner Bernstein talks about his breakthrough work in reconsidering how Parkinson’s actually works: Not all paradigms flip. Often, humanity is stuck with a culturally-entrenched system that’s difficult to change. But when we see an opportunity to contribute, the hard work is being willing to walk away from our reliance on how things were instead of simply trying to make a small shift happen. "
184,“We used to do that”,"November 8, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/we-used-to-do-that/,"When electricity came along, there was a swath of industries that were trapped in an old way of thinking. The only ones that thrived were able to walk away from what they used to do and eagerly embrace something new. When the internet was young, the major book publishers had everything they needed to create a dominant search engine. After all, they were in the business of organizing the world’s information. With just one exception, they didn’t even consider it. That’s because they believed that their job was to sell books to bookstores. This is even more urgent for individuals. What you were trained to do, what you did yesterday… that’s a gift from your past, not an obligation. Beginning the analysis with, “what I used to do was…” is a great way to open the door to what you’re going to do tomorrow. "
185,Project resistance,"November 7, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/project-resistance/,"In Steven Pressfield’s classic The War of Art, he introduces the idea of Resistance. It’s the internal force that keeps us from doing our most important creative work. If an instinct, a habit or a feeling gets in the way of the work, it’s Pressfield’s Resistance. Things we would never choose to add to the flow of our days, but there they are. It’s easy to imagine that Resistance is for screenwriters or novelists. Writer’s block and procrastination. But anyone leading a project of any kind–a business, a non-profit, a campaign–confronts it as well. We could do something, we might do something, but we don’t. And so the work doesn’t ship, or it doesn’t meet its potential. I’m not alone in facing Resistance. It happens everywhere we look. Some of the symptoms of Resistance seem contradictory, but if we go back to the definition, that makes sense. Here are a few: It’s tempting to imagine that Resistance is a moral failing, but it’s more like stubbing your toe or burning the toast. We don’t have to blame ourselves for where we are, but if we can see it and name it, we can learn to dance with it. These behaviors may seem as though they happen to us, but ultimately, they’re a choice. A skill we can learn, a habit we can unlearn. We can be kind to ourselves, focus on the goal and get back to the project. There are two confusions and one fear: The first confusion is that we might not realize that these are choices. The second confusion is that we might not have learned better tactics, tools and choices, but we can. And the fear? It’s of change. The change of it might not work, or the chance that it will. When Resistance arises, and it always does, we can see it, name it, and gently move on. "
186,The first nine minutes,"November 6, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-first-nine-minutes/,"Mixing up a batch of homemade vegan marshmallow Fluff® is an exercise in patience. For the first nine minutes of the ten minutes it takes in the mixer, not much happens. And then, it transforms into something fluffy and delightful. Without the recipe, it’s unlikely that most folks would make it to minute five, never mind ten. Knowing it can be done makes it far more likely we’re going to stick it out and do it again. "

We offer them dignity and a chance to grow. We are offering them trust. But if we become attached to those expectations, if the expectation unmet leads us to distress or unhappiness, then that attachment undermines the very reason we created the expectation in the first place.

189,The community orchestra,"November 3, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/the-community-orchestra/,"There are people who get paid to play the flute or bassoon. There are far more people who volunteer to participate in a community orchestra. For many, rehearsals or performances are the high points of their day. The metaphor is powerful, because it teaches us that we all benefit from having a community orchestra in our lives. The 1900 people who worked together on The Carbon Almanac were all volunteers, showing up when they could, working together to build something important. Digital connection makes it much easier to find your orchestra. And easier still to start one. "
190,Commonplace technology,"November 2, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/11/commonplace-technology/,"Not all tech is new tech. The ballpoint pen was a revelation, and a bit controversial. Now, it’s disposable and obvious. Different industries go through tech spurts. My desk is covered with items I use every day (a mouse, headphones, a solid-state drive, transparent tape, and even a Star Trek communicator) that were risky breakthroughs, and now they are simply commonplace (though we now call the communicator a phone). When tech is coming at us too quickly, it’s tempting to simply wait. It’s risky to be an early adopter. But once the pace slows down a bit, once our peers and competitors are benefitting from a productivity breakthrough, our aversion should be more intentional than that. Perhaps it’s time to reconsider the tech we once said we were too busy to bother learning. We get to choose our tools, and the tools we choose alter the work we do. "

192,Confronting consciousness,"October 31, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/confronting-consciousness/,"Everyone knows what it is to be conscious, and we imagine that other people are also aware. That we have a voice in our heads, apparent agency and free will, a little person inside who is commenting, making decisions and in charge. We’re not sure if dogs have this, and we’re pretty sure that sunflowers aren’t having deep philosophical misgivings about this year’s harvest. We’re very sure we have it, though. But other than a few philosophers, we mostly avoid considering the nature of the most vivid part of our days. The noise in our heads that can narrate joy and prolong and amplify stress. AI is here now. And AI requires us to get clear about what’s actually going on in my head (and yours).  Dennett’s work on the Intentional Stance is worth considering: Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do. It’s easier to win a game of chess if you imagine that the person you’re playing against is playing a game of chess. The rook doesn’t ‘want’ anything, but if we imagine the person who moved it does, we can play with more ease. We give the driver of a car in the other lane or the person in a negotiation the consciousness we imagine that we have. It’s a powerful shortcut to survival, and might even be the way we ended up deciding we were conscious. Because we might not be. There’s plenty of fascinating work on the fact that free will is an illusion, and that the voice in our head happens after we’ve already made a decision. It’s clear to most people who have used AI that it can’t possibly have consciousness, but it’s also human to imagine that it does. I can’t use chatgpt for more than three minutes without imagining that there’s a weird little person inside. I know what it’s doing, but that doesn’t help me interact with it. It has no free will. It’s not conscious. There are turtles all the way down. My guess is that we’ll revert to our habits and take an intentional stance with AI. Perhaps, though, this might be a moment to think hard (whatever that means in a world without active consciousness) about the fact that we might be exactly like an AI… that we’re nothing but wet electricity, and the intentional stance is an evolutionary hack, the product of living in a complicated world, not the cause of it. If our brains are embeddings plus probabilities… if what we are doing is processing inputs and creating outputs, that might be all there is. And that could be fine. If it helps us find peace of mind and acceptance of our situation, it could end up being a net positive. It could be that when we drop the story and simply focus on what is in front of us, we’re able to make the impact we seek. The noise in our heads might just be noise. "
193,The 2 x 4 lessons,"October 30, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/the-2-x-4-lessons/,"You’ll need two 8-foot boards and six five-gallon buckets. Each board is a standard 2 x 4, about two inches by four inches in size. And the bucket is about two feet deep. The first lesson is simple: Put the board on the floor and have a colleague walk from one end to the other. Now, put it across three buckets and try again. It should be clear that the fear is all imagined. We don’t typically have trouble walking on a board that’s nearly four inches wide. But the buckets change our narrative about risk. The second lesson: Put the first board back on the floor and place another board alongside it, about 30 inches apart. Now, have a second colleague walk on one board while the first takes a walk on their board. It’s do-able, but awkward. Try it again, but with them supporting each other as they walk. Hand to hand, headed in the same direction. And then try it with the buckets. We get much further together. "
194,Three things about innovation,"October 29, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/three-things-about-innovation/,"New approaches will never be embraced by everyone at first. If you need unanimous consent, you’re not going to move forward. And it’s not convenient. If it were, someone would have done it already. Finally, it’s not sure to work. If you need any or all three of these things for your project to move forward, you probably should pick a different project. "
195,Big science,"October 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/big-science/,"To win a Nobel prize a hundred years ago, you might only need a legal pad and a few pencils. Today, it takes millions of dollars, scores of people and many years of effort. That’s because the most straightforward problems have been solved. One side effect of this inevitable shift is that many parts of science have become bureaucratic and industrialized. Most people who work in most organizations that do science simply do their jobs. That’s a good thing, because it can lead to coordinated, stepwise progress at scale. But it’s also a problem, because it puts a premium on being right, and creates a fear of being wrong. But innovation–in the arts, in science, in business–is all about being willing to be wrong, because innovation requires missteps. They’re not a bug, they’re a feature. Open systems, loosely coordinated networks and laptops are changing this. Now, it’s possible for tiny teams to have significant impacts on the entrenched power structures. As a result, the incentives shift. Now, a tiny team has little benefit in being just a cheap cog in a big system, and a huge upside for challenging conventional wisdom with new insights. "
196,"Small groups, well organized","October 27, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/small-groups-well-organized/,"And those are the two challenges of anyone seeking to make an impact. First, we get distracted by the inclination to make the group as big as we can imagine. After all, the change is essential, the idea is a good one. It’s for everyone. Except that’s a trap. Because a group that’s too large cannot be coherent or organized. Or perhaps, we blink and settle for a group that’s too small. Change requires tension, and if our group is so small that it’s comfortable at all times, we are probably avoiding making an impact. And well organized? That’s the persistent, generous work of creating the conditions for deep connection.  When in doubt, focus on how to organize the folks you already have. Find a way to give them the tools for them to tell the others. Build a resilient loop, one that gets more organized and powerful as you grow. The right-sized group and ceaseless peer-to-peer organization are the foundation of culture change. "
197,What’s new at purple.space?,"October 26, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/whats-new-at-purple-space/,"There are now 1,000 of us in this online community that’s not a social network. Proudly a millionth the size of some other online experiences. It includes the original Creative’s Workshop, with hundreds of people working through it, side by side.

Around the world and around the clock, people who are eager to contribute and create. Some people try it for free for a week and then unsubscribe, because they’re hoping for something that is convenient and runs on autopilot.

198,Trouble in the grey zone,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/trouble-in-the-grey-zone/,"In many creative industries, there’s a similar pattern. When the stakes are very low, most creators produce things that are fairly banal and ordinary. Part of that is the law of large numbers, but it’s mostly our personal cultural resistance to leaning too far into weird stuff. And so the vast majority of YouTube videos, Spotify tracks, potluck dinner contributions and craft fair items are copycats. When more time or money is required, we actually see the percentage of creative work go up. I think this might be because the effort and risk separates the vast sea of hobbyists from the committed creator. This is where we find the solo chef with a strip mall restaurant, the indy record label, the art school movie project or the avant-garde composer who hires a small group to perform. Netflix demonstrates this small-budget magic on a good day. But then we enter the grey zone. This is where the rents for the big restaurant are high, the budget for the film is in the tens (or hundreds) of millions and the record label has decided to really push on a particular artist. This is the moment when more creativity is the only appropriate economic plan. Why? Because if your goal was to go straight down the middle, you didn’t need to risk all that money.  Instead, cultural, financial and corporate pressure all conspire to push the creator to do precisely the wrong thing. The dotted line is where we should be, but we often ride the boring road all the way down. If you’re going to go big, don’t stay home. The “money at risk” is always relative, not absolute. If it feels like you’re entering the grey zone, you are. "
199,The seduction of “why”,"October 25, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/the-seduction-of-why/,"It’s classic linkbait. Headlines that explain why something is happening. Questions to AI about why something happens. Even kids, asking their parents. Why is easy to sell. Why is hard to deliver. Consultants make a good living explaining the why. And media companies try to. But most of the time, the why they promise isn’t a why at all. It’s simply a rehash of what. A “because I said so,” not a useful understanding. Yes, we need to know what happened. But why is about understanding, predicting and knowing. It’s rare indeed. Be careful of folks who have a what trying to sell you a why. "
200,Scaffolds and talent,"October 24, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/scaffolds-and-talent/,"Kindergarten teachers matter more than you think. Chess isn’t a talent, it’s a learned practice. We’re sorting for head starts, not growth. And that’s just the first chapter. I think Hidden Potential is the most important book in Adam Grant’s career. The indoctrination around test scores and prodigies runs so deep, that most of us believe it to our core. Not just about others, but our kids and ourselves as well. Soft skills are real, and attitudes are skills. They can be learned, and we can help others learn them as well.  The data is clear, but embracing it takes guts and mutual support. In many ways, we become what we allow the system to cause us to become. But we can change this. It helps if we talk about it. "

202,Late-stage technocrats,"October 23, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/late-stage-technocrats/,"Water flows downhill, and tech solves the easy problems first. After the launch of Amazon and Google, when smartphones reached critical mass, an easy problem to solve involved bridging information with stuff. So you could use your phone to summon a car, a case of beer, a dog sitter or just about anything that someone with resources might want to get, with convenience. It took little in the way of insight, leadership or extraordinary effort for these things to unfold. If you didn’t build that app, someone else was going to. The business model existed, the funding was available and the pattern was there to be matched. And it’s tempting to defend the easy shortcuts that technology exposes. “It’s too expensive for us to moderate…” or “the market will sort itself out” or “We need to hire the obvious person to do this work…” Sometimes, though, humans show up to bend the curve of technology. They push against the conventional wisdom, avoid the obvious paths, and take responsibility for the impact of their work.  Kheyti is an example of this. Patient capital might not be as seductive as the next obvious step in tech’s evolution, but it matters. This leads to an often under-asked question: What is technology for? If we’re simply conduits for the evolution of tech in all its forms, bystanders and witnesses who might profit if we’re standing in the right place at the right time, that path is well-lit. People with capital and influence can make pronouncements about the utility of this approach, and how humans should merely step aside and applaud… Or perhaps we can show up to bend the curve. We can decide that technology exists to create opportunity, to help people find resilience, meaning and connection. We can realize that technology changes the status quo, and that change is up to us. Perhaps the tech industry can eagerly accept boundaries, responsibilities and obligations that match the leverage at their disposal. Peter Parker’s Uncle Ben was right. It’s possible to use this moment of power to eagerly seek out responsibility. "
203,Emotional labor and its consequences,"October 22, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/emotional-labor-and-its-consequences/,"Forty years ago, Arlie Russell Hochschild wrote about emotional labor. The work that frontline employees had to do (especially women) in managing and expressing emotions as part of their job. She talked about how exhausting it was for flight attendants to show up with a smile, even when they didn’t feel like it. Emotional labor is the opposite of the industrial economy’s task-based, measured output. Even if we don’t dig ditches, the offer for a certain kind of work was: Process this pile of papers and we don’t care whether you like (or pretend to like) your job. The labor is the easily measured stuff. But AI and mechanization have turned this sort of task work into a race to the bottom. If you don’t bring emotional labor to the task, it’s probable that you’re engaged in a race to the bottom. The piecework and easily measured ‘real’ skills are soon automated or outsourced or diminished in value. Emotional labor has become a competitive advantage. Our commitment to showing up as a human, even (especially) when we don’t feel like it is precisely how we create value. And it’s this human work that helps us feel seen and valued as well. "
204,Complex or complicated?,"October 21, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/complex-or-complicated/,"Complicated problems have a solution, and the solution can often be found by breaking the complicated portions into smaller pieces.  And complicated problems often have an emotional component, because there are parts of the problem we don’t want to look at closely, or deal with personally. If you’re lucky enough to be handed a complicated problem, know that effort and guts can often get you where you’re going. If it’s not a problem, it might be a situation. A complicated situation has no clear solution, no win-win, no easy way forward. It’s simply a situation to be dealt with. But this is very different from a complex problem. Complex problems aren’t actually problems at all. They are non-determinate systems, systems that change based on how we engage with them. Push on one part of a complex problem and a different part will change the system. Healthcare, climate and technology systems are all complex problems. When facing a complex problem, it helps to embrace the fact that we’re dealing with a system that shifts over time. One where the rules and the solutions evolve in non-predictable ways. Some ways to dance with the complex: "
205,The shifting status of more data,"October 20, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/the-irony-of-more-data/,"How do we know if we’re doing a good job? In some fields, it’s always been pretty easy to tell. Either the building falls down or it doesn’t. Either the car starts after you charge the battery or it’s still dead. We can ask easy questions about how long it took or how much it cost. But endeavors with crisp measurements often don’t attract people looking for a different sort of work. At many schools, more folks sign up for humanities than engineering. Lately, more data is showing up in fields where it was elusive. Not just the efficacy of medical approaches, but the user satisfaction or time spent on creative endeavors or the stickiness and yield of educational approaches. And closer to home for many, public health. We can actually tell with a great deal of granularity the impact of things like hand washing or placebos. The irony? When data shows up in a field where we’re not expecting it, a common response is to either ignore or challenge the data. Not because it’s not helpful, but because it is not what we’re used to. "

After twenty more minutes of searching, there it was, right on the cookbook shelf. But the spine was much more subtle than the cover, and it hadn’t been what I was looking for or expecting. We spend a lot of time on our (metaphorical) book covers. That first impression, the way we tell our story or introduce ourselves or earn the sale. But the real win is often later, when someone finds us when they’re looking for us. This isn’t SEO. That’s what happens when we try to win a search for a generic category. SEO is coming up first in the search for ‘plumber’. This is human search. Being there when someone is looking for you. The first step is being the sort of resource that people care enough to look for. And the second is being findable. "

While the work may be fun, the uphill grind of this sort of project is exhausting. If it’s something that lots of people can do and that customers don’t value that much, it might not be worth your time. Taking pictures, singing songs or playing the flute are fine hobbies, but hard to turn into paying jobs. On the other hand, in the top right quadrant, there’s endless opportunity and plenty of work for people who can do difficult (unpopular) work that is highly valued by customers who are ready to pay to solve their problems. A forensic accountant gets more paid gigs than a bagpipe player. When you choose to take on a real problem that involves difficult work, but you’re serving a customer base that has few resources, thank you. Your quest is going to be a long one, but if you believe in the impact you’re creating, this can be a useful way forward.

The Dip is real. "
209,Judgment,"October 16, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/judgment/,"AI pushes us to do what we actually get paid to do: make decisions. Craft used to drive our hours or even days. Get the pen lines just right. Source the Letraset. Get your instrument in tune. Sweat the details, because the details are everything. Now, I can choose from 1,000 typefaces, and they’re all optically correct. Autotune has transformed commercial music, and the new AI grammar tools make it trivially easy to make edits or find errors. The part of us that’s focused on getting it done so we can move on to the next thing accepts the defaults and settles for what the algorithm offers. That ignores the real work. Taking ownership of the decision. This or that. The system tees them up. We decide (or answer with “none of the above.”) Reclaiming agency pushes us away from, “I’m just doing my job,” and into, “I made that.” PS I made this art in a few moments with AI, but I’d like to be clear that every word I publish, in every book or blog post, is written from scratch, by me. No team, no AI. If that changes, I’ll let you know. "
210,What are the defaults?,"October 16, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/what-are-the-defaults/,"Perhaps they were chosen a very long time ago. Or with very little thought. It could be that the constraints that led to the default are long gone. They might be perpetuating bad choices, injustice or sub-optimal outputs. The best way to fix something is to look at what we assume is the ‘right’ starting spot. In persistent systems, it might be difficult to change the default setting, but knowing what it is and how it got there is a great place to begin. PS on this topic, in two weeks people are going to give out a bazillion dollars worth of cheap chocolate for Halloween. Please don’t buy cheap chocolate. "
211,Different kinds of people,"October 15, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/different-kinds-of-people/,"It’s a tempting shortcut. Different kinds of people prefer pop tarts to pizza, or prefer expensive wine to beer, or prefer amusement parks to bowling. Except everyone is the same and everyone is different. What’s actually useful is to realize that in this moment, under these conditions, this person and people who have this person’s preferences, will often choose a certain path. When groups of people with a shared preference or attitude choose to do something, we see markets and cultural trends. But these people aren’t different kinds. They’re simply people responding or reacting to what’s on offer. This means that people can have different responses based on different offers and different conditions. We’re not stuck forever, simply grooved into certain patterns. "
212,The Pizza Principle,"October 14, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/the-pizza-principle/,"Good pizza is rare, even though the method to create it is well known. Any efforts to make it more convenient, cheaper or easier will almost always make it worse. If you think this post is about pizza, I’m afraid that we’re already stuck. "

214,It could have easily gone the other way,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/it-could-have-easily-gone-the-other-way/,"It could have been way better. It could have been far worse. It’s easy to imagine that outcomes are inevitable, but they’re not. Was it your fault, or was it luck (good or bad)? If our story of the past is filled with second guesses, shame or blame, it can carry forward. Or perhaps we’ve over-sold ourselves on just how talented, hardworking and insightful we are, when in fact, we sort of got lucky. When we rewrite our narrative of the past, we end up creating a different future. We have more control over that narrative than we give ourselves credit for. "
215,Jargon comes and goes,"October 12, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/jargon-comes-and-goes/,"Forty years ago in engineering class, it wasn’t unusual to talk about GIGO or FUBAR. These weren’t technical terms, they were mild complaints that signaled insider status and cultural cohesion. In a closed profession, like airplane pilots, the insider jargon lasts for generations.  Now, though, everyone in the world is no more than a handshake away from a computer. You either have one in your pocket or know someone who does. Everyone has access to a recording studio, grammar checker, drawing easel, publishing platform, typesetting tool, stats engine and AI front-end as a result. A TikTok production team doesn’t have a key grip. The jargon that was a symbol of insider-ness evolves far faster when becoming an insider only takes a bit of effort. The original members of a circle find themselves missing the jargon. It’s hard to have insiders when there are no longer outsiders.  "
216,Writing your book,"October 11, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/writing-your-book/,"I spent time this week with two authors who are showing up to share their lives, their insights, and their generosity in the form of books. A good book will change the reader, but it makes an even bigger impact on the author. Here’s a classic episode of Akimbo. Book publishing has changed more in the last ten years than in the previous 500, and we’re living in a moment where the benefits of writing a book are huge and the costs are surprisingly low.  Here are two posts to get you started.  Advice for authors and, the sequel, with the same name. Also, a reminder that the AI bot on this site has plenty of answers if you have questions… "
217,Input choice is easily taken for granted,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/input-choice-is-easily-overlooked/,"We can give instructions to a fellow human by: Most people develop voiceboxes and limbs and facial expressions that make any of these usable. Computers, over the decades, have had to have them engineered. In 1983, Dan Lovy built a parser for the adventure games I was marketing at Spinnaker. Suddenly, you could type instructions into the game instead of relying on the more emotional but crude joystick for input. So, “pick up the dragon’s pearl” was something the game could understand. There’s a restaurant in the Bronx where the waiter asks, “what do you want?” There’s no menu. If you imagine something in a certain range, they’ll make it. This is stressful, because we’re used to the paradigm of multiple choice in this setting. A smart doctor doesn’t ask, “what’s wrong?” Instead, she takes a few minutes to notice, converse and connect, because our fear of mortality gets in the way of a truthful analysis. As the worlds of tech and humanity merge, it’s worth thinking hard about the right way to engage with a device. When a car invites you to talk with it, the car designer is betting our lives that the car will actually respond to the vagaries of speech in a specific way. Perhaps a steering wheel is a better user interface. (And it’s not just a car–sometimes we fail to communicate with each other in a useful and specific way that matches the work to be done…) "
218,No thank you,"October 10, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/no-thank-you/,"Failing to acknowledge a favor or a courtesy is a triple mistake, and it’s becoming more common. ChatGPT is now promoting the idea that it can write a thank you note for you, and a text is a lot easier than a handwritten note, and yet, the level of ‘thank you’ seems to be falling. It’s not that people don’t have the time to offer an honest ‘thank you’. It’s that they don’t want to acknowledge the obligation or connection. Minimizing a favor is an easy way to stay focused on the noise in our own heads, as opposed to realizing that we’re surrounded by other people.  Hustle culture has discovered that ‘asking for a favor’ often triggers a positive response. This effort on the part of the other person happens because the favor-giver is seeking connection. When the recipient minimizes the favor or fails to say thank you, they create distance, not connection.  The fact that an expression of gratitude requires so little effort makes it even more striking.  To pick a tiny example, if someone lets you into the flow of traffic, a small nod or hand wave costs nothing. But sometimes it feels easier to assert that it was yours to take, as opposed to a kind gesture that you received. Our failure to take a moment to acknowledge the favor also makes it harder for the next person. If connection isn’t on offer, why not be selfish?  Civility fades in the face of entitlement. The magic of an honest expression of gratitude is that the person saying thank you might benefit from it as much as the recipient. "
219,Possibility and opportunity,"October 9, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/possibility-and-opportunity/,"We have the chance to build something that creates connection and generates value. On the other hand, a system that diminishes agency and dignity is inherently unstable.  When we seek to create scarcity and control and optimize output at the expense of our humanity, it may pay off for a while, but it’s brittle and will ultimately fail. As it falters, it’s easy to see how the forces seeking control can double down and simply make the situation even worse. The alternative is to realize that finding opportunities and seeking connection is the path worth following. It takes compassion and confidence to offer resilience, responsibility and agency instead of insisting on power and control.  "
220,Getting it right the first time,"October 8, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/getting-it-right-the-first-time/,"How unlikely is this? The artist who paints a masterpiece, from scratch, without hesitation. The playwright who doesn’t need a workshop or a reading. The architect who designs a food hall that has a layout and vibe that works without one alteration… Evolution is powerful. It gives us the chance to revise, edit and do what works while removing what doesn’t. Once we realize that there is almost no chance we’ll get it right the first time, we can embrace the opportunity to sign up for better instead of perfect. Get it wrong the first time. Then make it better. "
221,Password stupidity is no longer viable,"October 7, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/password-stupidity-is-no-longer-viable/,"[Of course, it’s not stupidity. It’s fear and superstition, which often go together. First, the rant.] It’s 2023. Major corporations should not be posting rules like this: This is not just security theatre. It’s a waste of time, the math makes no sense and it leads people to create worse passwords, not better ones. If the person who maintains your office sprayed water on the front walk just before the temperature dropped to freezing, you’d never stand for that. If the folks who filed your taxes simply made up numbers that felt like they made sense, you’d switch accountants.  If a company can’t get this simple system right, how can we trust them to make a refrigerator? There is plenty of insightful, effective thinking about online security. Your organization embarrasses itself when it hassles customers to engage in silliness like this. Stupidity is easier to spot and fix than ever before. PS if this is broken but looks fine to the boss, what else in your organization is similarly grounded in superstition or the status quo? [The challenge with tech is that the person doing the work often has a boss who doesn’t understand the work and isn’t willing to put in the time to do so.  Twenty years ago, I ranted about the forms that have a pull-down for US citizens challenging them to choose which of fifty states they live in, and country pull-downs that begin with Andorra and put two of the biggest ecommerce countries in the world at the end of a list of more than a hundred. There’s no good technical reason for this. It’s simply the way someone created a template at the end of the last century, and it’s easier to simply go along. Now that AI is about to rewrite just about every rule of our culture, perhaps it’s a good time for the boss to commit to understanding it.] "
222,Getting better at bucket management,"October 6, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/how-big-is-the-vessel/,"If you throw a bucket of water on a small campfire, you’ll succeed in putting it out. Pour a bucketful of sake into one of those little glasses and you’ll waste most of it and ruin the table setting. And try to use a bucket to refill a dried-out lake and not much will happen. Relativity is everywhere we look. If you put in eight hours on a ten-hour project, you’ll fail. Put that much effort into a smaller, six-hour project and the client will be delighted. The Grateful Dead remain one of the greatest bands in memory, partly because they relentlessly overfilled what was expected from a band. Those that seek to be the next Grateful Dead inevitably fail, because the standard has been reset. On the other hand, a tech company that raises a lot of money to ‘change the world’ but merely delivers a really useful tool is seen as a failure. The promise we make defines the quality that is expected. Market pressure and our own insecurity drive us to make ever bigger promises, but when the promise doesn’t match the deliverable, everyone forgets the effort and workmanship that was delivered. The two challenges are: Pick the right size bucket for the problem you’re trying to solve. Make sure you have the resources to fill it all the way to the top. Choose your bucket, choose your future. "
223,Nothing to ad,"October 5, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/nothing-to-ad/,"A recent discussion about the challenges of direct-to-consumer marketing of a skincare product ended with one participant describing the hard part with, “nothing to ad.” She was referring to how much the thread had covered, but the pun wasn’t lost on us. Social media offered an irresistible promise to many folks who are looking to do “marketing”: Of course, this is a really good deal for the social media sites. They do very little and keep almost all the profit. But competitive pressures make the really good deal into one that it’s hard for a company to live with. Now, instead of $40 to get a click, it costs $50 or $60 or $80. DTC companies end up raising baskets of money and spending just about all of it on social media and online ads, payments to influencers, etc, losing money on every customer. Once committed, they’re open to trying just about anything. They listen to wise (but actually making-stuff-up) sales reps and consultants about what time to post, whether to use photos, color photos, testimonials, paid influencers, free samples and more. “Oh, you tried to scale your buy too fast, the algorithm can tell…” and all sorts of black box thinking that, from a distance, surely gives away the con of separating a hardworking brand manager from the money they control. We’ve seen this before, many times, and it almost never ends well. There’s not much to ad. That’s because the fundamental strategy cannot thrive in a competitive environment. Someone will always be willing to outbid you for attention. Someone will always be willing to lose just a bit more money than you. The path forward is very different.  Your (current) customers need to bring you your (new) customers. It’s not ironic but it is edifying to realize that this is EXACTLY how every one of the media companies you’re paying ad money to grew. They grew with word of mouth, not the sorts of ads they’re selling. Facebook or that influencer–they didn’t grow by running ads and selling subscriptions. They grew when their users felt that it was in their own selfish interests to bring them new users. As long as your project is built around the misguided myth of “getting the word out” and promoting itself to strangers, you will struggle. Someone always wins the spend-money-on-DTC-promo game, but it probably won’t be you. It’s simply a lottery where one of the spenders hits a magical level of critical mass and becomes buzzy. For the rest of us, there’s only the glorious work of creating a product and a situation that people think is worth talking about. It’s hard, it has dead ends, but it’s the work. The formulaic attraction of category + money + media consultant = home run is a problem precisely because it’s a formula. People don’t talk about your product or service because you have a gimmick or hype or because they care about you or even because a thoughtful analysis shows that it has the best features and price performance. They talk about it because they believe it’s good for their status, their affiliation with people they care about or their frame of mind. [I wrote about this twenty years ago in Purple Cow, but people still look for the shortcut of ads, which is rarely a shortcut. And the conversation that inspired this post happened in the Purple Space.] "
224,Evenly distributed,"October 4, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/evenly-distributed/,"For the first time, the only time, everyone on Earth was in the same boat at the same time. We’ve long been divided by privilege, by caste, by accidents of birth or by organized hierarchies. Sure, there have been events that struck us all at once. Landing on the moon caused us all to gasp simultaneously. But this time was different. Regardless of class or age or nationality, the situation was right there, in front of our face. And it didn’t go away in a few news cycles. But the responses, of course, were not the same. Some profiteered and hoarded, cutting the line and seeking a profit, regardless of the cost to others. Some embraced panic while others sought to fan it. Some showed up asking for help while others decided to see who needed help. And that’s the first lesson of our pandemic. While events might be evenly distributed, responses and reactions rarely are. We are able to choose to see possibility. We are able to lead. We’re able to see beyond a day or a week into the future. Not simply a few of us. Any of us. That choice wasn’t dictated by class or station or race. It was a new decision, made each day, by people who chose to care. Volunteer firemen who showed up for the next alarm. Parents who sat with a kid instead of parking them in front of a device. Doctors who quieted their fears in order to save others. This leads to the second lesson, which is the choice that is in front of each of us. Just as the pandemic created the opportunity to lead and to contribute, the future is knocking on our doors asking us to make a new decision. For millennia, we’ve been using our resources to insulate ourselves from the weather. Some are luckier than others in their ability to find a safe haven. We learned the hard way that our fragile industrial ecosystem isn’t quite as resilient as we hoped. We discovered that we aren’t actually as insulated from nature (and each other) as we might have expected. And we learned (perhaps) that compared to the alternative, preparation is quite cheap. There will be other flu pandemics, and each time, if history is a guide, we’ll be better at fighting them. But fighting a virus is very different than fighting the weather. The weather, the inexorable rise of the sea, is going to get harder and harder to ignore. The effects are unevenly distributed now, often exposing the most vulnerable, but as we saw with a global pandemic, we won’t be able to buy ourselves peace of mind for long. The fork in the road is plain to see. Who will lead? Who will see possibility and opportunity and decide to show up now, when we can, to do something about tomorrow? And who will decide to push to go back to business as usual? Just as air travel and cruise ships spread the virus, our industrial might has planted the seeds of our destruction. At the same time, the modern world has created a system with enough leverage to save itself. While the system has leverage, the system is not resilient and the system doesn’t lead itself. The best time to begin is now. Start where you are. Don’t wait for authority or a manual. Change will come, as it always does, from us. Each of us. If we care enough to lead. The opportunity to care is evenly distributed. "
225,Fooling ourselves,"October 3, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/fooling-ourselves/,"It’s tempting to believe that we’re not easy to fool. Not by a magician, a politician or a banker. Other folks might be easily duped by a spammer or a hustler, but not us. And yet, no one fools you more than you. When you look in the mirror, do you see what others see, or is it possible you see someone far less (or far more) attractive than others do? Do we assume that our work is so good and so useful that anyone who doesn’t see that is confused or misguided? Perhaps we feel like an impostor, a fraud or an unseen genius… These are all forms of self-deception. A useful way forward might be to ask, “is it working?” If the marketplace of ideas, of commerce or of relationships sees something of value, perhaps they’re right. And if they don’t, perhaps we might develop the empathy to understand what’s missing in our narrative about what we do or how we do it. Marketing to others begins with marketing to ourselves. If it turns out that our self-deception is a reliable source of fuel for us to achieve our goals, it might be worth living with. But at some point, our ability to fool ourselves becomes toxic. It blocks our ability to create generous and useful work, and it eats away at our confidence and peace of mind. It’s not easy to see ourselves as others do. But perhaps they’re onto something. "
226,But it matters a lot to them…,"October 2, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/but-it-matters-a-lot-to-them/,"To get to the Kebab House Cafe, you’ll need to drive past a dozen fast food restaurants, restaurants you can find off just about any interstate. It’s certainly less convenient to go a few blocks off the beaten path, but the food and service and vibe might be worth it. The thing is, it matters even more to them. The folks that work there, the ones who are building something they’re proud of. It matters to the unique ones, to the ones that are trying harder than the others, to the folks who create interesting and memorable experiences. And it’s not just one cafe. When a musician, a playwright or an entrepreneur takes a risk, they’re betting someone will care enough to hear them and engage with them. They do the work because they care, not because someone handed them a manual. The best part is that when it matters to them, it might matter even more to us. If we want to have the option of choosing something that isn’t in the ordinary course of convenient and cheap, we need to show up for the people who bring it to us. Working with people who want to work with us is a privilege and a delight. We get what we support. "
227,Learning from the Amazon gift card snafu,"October 1, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/learning-from-the-amazon-gift-card-snafu/,"Millions of people got this email last night: It’s legitimate, but it’s a mistake. A mistake because: We can learn a lot about what not to do from this. First, if you make a mistake by email, fix it. Fix it by email AND fix it on your site. Let everyone who got the wrong note know, even if it’s embarrassing. Second, if your company is built on email, establish a consistent look and feel, an approval process and most of all, definitely, a way to confirm that you actually sent it. For example, if you ever get an email from me, it will also be here on this blog. If it’s not, it’s a scam. Now that Amazon has messed up both parts of this process (they got thousands and thousands of complaints last night, overwhelming their hard-working frontline support workers) they’ve opened the door for countless spammers and scammers who lack imagination but are good at following a trail. While it may seem unrelated, part of the problem is the fear that people have in writing clearly. Here’s a sign I saw at Avis yesterday: I’m pretty sure that the person who cared enough to make this sign doesn’t actually speak this way. Perhaps if it had said, “We don’t have a car wash here, but the insides of our cars have been cleaned regularly. If you’d like to get a car wash, we’re delighted to pay you back up to $15 per rental. Thanks for understanding.” The Amazon email was simultaneously overwritten and under-edited. It didn’t say what it meant, and the formatting simply made it worse. And then the bureaucracy refused to quickly take responsibility and make it clear to millions of people. As a result of error and fog and denial, trust disappears. "
228,Confusion and certainty,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/10/confusion-and-certainty/,"When facing a complex problem, it’s easy to become confused. Lately, it’s become socially acceptable to express your confusion with certainty. Untrained in the field, make a pronouncement that makes it clear that you have not just an understanding of what’s going on, but also that you’ve figured out the causes and the next steps. The thing is, confusion shared often leads to the learning we need to become productive as we move forward. “I don’t understand this part,” is a great thing to say before someone helps you understand it. On the other hand, certainty is almost guaranteed to maintain your confusion, particularly when the thing you were sure was going to work, doesn’t. "
229,Solving invented problems,"September 30, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/solving-invented-problems/,"Some problems, when well solved, lead to making things better. Some problems give us a chance to get back on course. And some problems are opportunities to be generous. But many of the problems that we seek to solve are actually invented, and maybe we could benefit by simply walking away.  There are two interesting kinds of invented problems:  First, it might be a situation, not a problem. You’re stuck on an elevator. The repair people have been called. They will come when they come. There’s no way for you to make anything better… there’s no available solution to your current predicament–it’s a situation and the only thing to do is wait. The second kind is a problem that’s so trivial that solving it will have little impact. We feel it looming and lend it our anxiety and focus simply to keep our mind off the other problems, the ones that matter. "

One has a 4.5 rating and is reliably busy. The other has an astonishingly low 1.5 out of 5 rating. The physical plant is virtually identical, and the marketing and promo are the same. The only difference is the owner running the second shop. Tomorrow, he gets yet another chance to make yet another decision about what sort of attitude to bring to his day.

231,A small shopping list (floss and more),"September 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/a-small-shopping-list-floss-and-more/,"Here are some books and household items that I wanted to share. I’m mostly into audiobooks these days–a good narrator combined with a good author is pretty rare and wonderful… It turns out that a breakthrough rice cooker is a bargain, even if it seems expensive at first. The Cuckoo is an extraordinary device. It comes in many shapes and colors, most of them will not be to your taste, but persist until you find one. Nasty, Brutish and Short, is the most accessible and fun book on philosophy you’ll encounter this year. King: A Life, is a clear and direct biography of one of our greatest citizens. My friend Nicole has written a provocative, funny and honest memoir. Nothing Is Missing: A Memoir of Living Boldly. I’ll be interviewing her in NYC on October 9. Unsurprisingly, the best gluten-free pasta in the world comes from Italy. Herbie Hancock’s autobiography is worthwhile even if you’re not a jazz fan. An honest look at a creative’s journey. No, I’m not an expert on dental floss, but not only is this biodegradable (most competitors are made of plastic) but it actually seems to work a lot better. Dan Ariely’s book Misbelief is a must-listen for anyone trying to understand how social dynamics are changing the way some people see the world. There are two kinds of kitchens: happy ones with air fryers, and the holdouts that have let their skepticism get in the way. I hardly ever use my oven anymore. I’m not sure it matters which brand you buy. Years later, Kafka on the Shore remains one of my favorite all-time audiobooks. It’s an extraordinary story, beautifully told. The Song of Significance has led to more heartfelt emails to me than any book I’ve ever written. And my calendar pre-sold so well they’ve just asked me to write a new edition. None of this would be possible without you. Thanks to everyone who supports the work of authors and musicians and creators… "
232,Thoughts on the manual,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/thoughts-on-the-manual/,"We have more ways to offer instructions than ever before, but it’s not obvious that we’re getting better at it. Not just the operator’s manual, but every way we have to teach and offer instructions… Some (uncategorized) things to consider: The first manual I created, in 1983, was for eight year old kids. I was an amateur. You can learn by doing. "
233,The Jenga situation,"September 27, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/the-jenga-situation/,"When an organization first sets out to have an impact, it discovers that it has no customers, no clients, no constituents. So it shows up, it makes an offer and it listens. The early days are exciting. Customers are seen and heard and served. Variations are created and value is produced as problems are solved. In the early days, the most celebrated employees are the ones who figure out what someone needs and then determines a way to fill that need. Once the organization gains traction, it’s possible that a short-term profit maximizer will join the team. They push to treat the customers as replaceable flanges, almost identical, income opportunities to be processed. And the employees? They are expenses, not part of a team. Kids play a game called Jenga. In it, identical wooden sticks are built into a tower, and you win the game by removing sticks without having the tower fall over. It can seem like the fastest way for a stable business to increase profits is simply to remove some sticks. Process more flanges with fewer expenses. Lower overhead, measure the easy stuff, do it faster. A simple service business example to prove the point: Labcorp had a valuable idea: blood tests at scale, well-priced and convenient for doctors and patients. A nationwide chain meant that doctors didn’t have to wonder about instructions being understood. Offices in medical parks meant that patients didn’t have to go to the hospital for something that hardly needed a hospital. A large number of patients would mean that the organization would have the resources to build better calendaring and reporting software. And then what? Take out some Jenga pieces. Why bother with a receptionist when you can staff the entire facility with just one tech? If people have to wait an hour or two, no big deal. Don’t worry so much about turnover–simply give people too much to do, and if they quit, hire someone else. Customer service? Well, you can put up forms and offer surveys, but there’s no need to actually read them… The Jenga situation is contagious. Once a competitor starts doing it, there’s pressure from short-term shareholders for you to do it as well. The profits that motivated growth become the entire point, a race to the bottom with no winners. But then, often when one-too-many Jenga pieces are removed, or when technology shifts, the tower gets too shaky and someone else builds a competitor that starts the process all over again. The biggest challenge a marketer at a big company faces is the specter of industrial short-term thinking. Going along with the bean counters might be the worst marketing mistake you can make. Beans aren’t the point of the organization, they’re a side effect. We spend too much time dealing with shaky towers. The resilience of people connecting, of organizations evolving, of service and clarity and generative work is far too important to be threatened by a few hustlers who insist on measuring the wrong thing. "
234,Toward stickiness,"September 26, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/toward-stickiness/,"Getting the word out is easy to measure and exciting as well. Focusing on this misses the point. You might be able to get a song played on the radio, but will the song motivate listeners to show up at the concert? The math is simple: You can’t build a freelance career or a restaurant or a medical practice on one-time interactions. Charities that fundraise a few dollars at a time, door to door, pitching strangers… they have a rough road. The hype and the tension and the promo work for a while, but they aren’t sustainable. Which means, “this might not be for you,” isn’t a problem, it’s a feature.  We’re not looking for everyone, we’re looking for someone. Purple.space launched about two weeks ago. The sign up page is really clear about what it is and what it’s for, and it’s thrilling to see that only a third of the people who signed up dropped out. A third? That’s thrilling? Yes. Because when only 35% of the people trying something in good faith say, “it’s not for me,” you are on your way to finding the people it is for. People who would miss what you do if you stopped offering it. People who seek connection or possibility or whatever change it is you bring to the world. Stickiness isn’t a hack. It’s a sign of enrollment. People who want to go where you’d like to take them.  Opening weekend box office and the ratings of your first episode are interesting, but only because they create the possibility that next week, some folks might be back. "
235,More vs. better,"September 25, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/more-vs-better/,"If every building in the shopping district in a big city was owned by one landlord, rents would go up. So would the prices of everything sold. The landlord would keep a significant percentage of each store’s profits and innovation would suffer as well. Google’s monopoly is real.  They pay Apple more than a million dollars an hour to be the default search engine on phones. It’s more profitable for Apple to threaten to build a search engine than it is for them to actually run one. Google overpays for the default status because their hegemony gives advertisers fewer options. And by controlling the flow of attention across the web, they can dictate how websites work and what our experience is online. Ever since Adam Smith began writing about capitalism, it’s been understood that monopolies are a defect in the structure of free markets. Locking in an advantage gives the monopolist the power to ignore its customers and we all suffer as a result. A company grows by getting ever better at serving its customers, its vendors and its employees. A company becomes a monopoly by becoming ever better at becoming a monopoly. Few companies have done a better job of marketing the benefits of their monopoly than Google. They rarely charge their users, but offer free software and engaging stories instead. But they have relentlessly grabbed more and more of our attention, and used it to create a sinecure that costs all of us. It’s not just ecosia, duckduckgo and kagi that are paying for this monopoly. When a company can shift the rules and focus on more instead of better, we all pay. "
236,While standing on one foot,"September 24, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/while-standing-on-one-foot/,"Make it easy! they insist. One of the longest-running direct response ads of all time was for a piano playing course. For more than forty years, people mailed in money for a simple, fast way to impress their friends by playing the piano. They sold a lot of manuals, but I’m guessing not many people actually learned to play. And every year, there are new electronic devices, pills and procedures that promise to help people lose weight or get fit without trying very hard. Of course, the one-foot shortcut fails. Almost every time. Not only don’t we learn anything, but we waste the time and the money we spent standing impatiently on one foot. A fundamental reason that high-overhead educational settings like med school succeed is that sunk costs and commitment dramatically increase our willingness to stick it out. If the easy thing worked, you would have done it already. The most successful students insist that the teacher make it difficult. So difficult that we’re tempted to quit (but don’t). Commitment gets us through the frustration, and frustration is the partner of learning. "
237,High fidelity,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/high-fidelity/,"It might be the high fidelity of a good LP on a great turntable. It sounds just like the original recording. It might be the high fidelity of loyalty. No shopping around for a momentarily better deal. It might be the high fidelity of genre. This is just what you hoped it would be. And it might be the high fidelity of a simulation, which is sort of a combination of the previous three. Sometimes, authenticity is overrated. When we make a promise and keep it, we’re creating a fidelity that people are drawn to. "
238,Two sides of “a big deal”,"September 23, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/two-sides-of-a-big-deal/,"Many businesses thrive by helping people deal with projects that feel like they have high stakes. A kid’s first haircut, the offsite storage of data backup, an upcoming family reunion, a medical procedure or the inscription on a sentimental piece of jewelry or watch. But, if the inevitable glitch or failure arises, we’re inclined to remind the customer that in the scheme of things, it’s not such a big deal. Of course it is. You reminded them of that over and over when you were making the sale. When things don’t work, it’s not helpful to try to minimize the impact. In fact, you’re far more likely to make progress if you remind the customer just how much it mattered to you to get it right, and how you feel about letting them down. Empathy is a first step toward connection. "
239,Getting to no,"September 22, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/getting-to-no/,"“Yes” is magical. It brings possibility and forward motion. But it’s almost impossible without “no” and no can be just as frightening. First, there’s the no of “I can’t go for that.” The no of refusing to race to the bottom, the no of avoiding the selfish hustle, the no of walking away from instincts or shortcuts that strip others of dignity and possibility. This is the no that creates our standards. And then, there’s the no of “I need to be a meaningful specific, not a wandering generality.” What Zig meant by this phrase was that the guts of focus and specialization are useful when we put ourselves on the hook and do something that matters instead of simply pleasing whoever is sitting right in front of us right now. When we offer a generous “no” to someone we care about, we honor our work and their role in it. We care enough to offer them insight about the change we seek to make–and to tell them the truth about what we can’t do at the same time that we’re celebrating what we can do. Getting to no requires caring enough to make a difference and being brave enough to tell the truth. "
240,A protest or a project?,"September 21, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/a-protest-or-a-project/,"Protests let off steam. They organize people who might not show up by creating a moment in time where there’s enough opportunity and social pressure that they participate. A protest sends a message. But almost every time, the very things that made a protest appealing mean that it fails to change much. That’s because protests are momentary, temporary and urgent. The status quo is good at surviving protests. That’s why it’s still the status quo. The alternative is a project. A project begins with a protest that ends with, “we’ll be back tomorrow, and we’re bringing our friends.” A project is impatiently persistent. It plays a longer game, one that can outlast the status quo. A project identifies the system and brings a systematic approach to changing that system. Projects can seem boring when seen with a stopwatch, but they’re powerful when measured with a calendar. "
241,ChatGPT for you,"September 20, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/chatgpt-for-you/,"AI is a mystery. To many, it’s a threat. It turns out that understanding a mystery not only makes it feel less like a threat, it gives us the confidence to make it into something better. I use ChatGPT4 just about every day, and I’m often surprised at how frequently it surprises me, good and bad. There’s really no good reason not to play with it, put it to work and get smart about what’s happening. [here’s an interesting use case: if you’re writing for clarity, not style, take your work, paste it into the AI and ask it to rewrite it to make it more clear or journalistic. It’s pretty astonishing.] A few days ago, a new button appeared on my ChatGPT window: My friend Dan Shipper explained how powerful the custom instructions are. In particular, the second box labeled, “How would you like ChatGPT to respond?” Here’s a sample block of text you can paste into that field. You’ll notice a difference immediately: I’m sure you can think of specific, leveraged and powerful instructions you’d like it to keep in mind every time you interact. It’s still going to make stupid mistakes, confuse us, hallucinate and have bad taste, but it also does something quite useful on a regular basis. Give it a try. {Clarification: I write every word of every post and every book myself. Unaided. The day I stop doing that, I promise to let you know.} "
242,Convenience and scams,"September 19, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/convenience-and-scams/,"The scam era is upon us. Aided by AI, borderless currency and the internet of things, there are more people than ever before making a living hustling to steal, impersonate, defraud and otherwise violate our trust. When the world was inconvenient, this was difficult. The banker met with you in person, so did the charitable fundraiser and your second cousin. The very convenience we’ve leaned into–digital interactions, quick logins, caller ID–are now being used against us. Here’s a quick checklist to keep in mind: –if someone calls you from an institution, don’t assume they’re calling from that institution. Call them back on the main switchboard. Caller ID isn’t real anymore, not when it matters. –if someone emails you about something urgent, get their phone number and call them. Don’t hesitate to ask questions and don’t send money. The ‘sender’ field isn’t real anymore either.  –it’s now cheap and easy to impersonate someone’s voice and to create digital photographs and videos that seem real. –don’t use Paypal’s friends and family button to buy things online. –Don’t buy gift cards (period) but especially… don’t buy gift cards for someone who reaches out to you. Of course, this all leads to a degradation of trust. When we began to trade for convenience, we also threw away some of our community and our humanness as well. "
243,Just looking,"September 18, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/just-looking-2/,"Lots of people go to the beach but very few get in the water. 3,000 students go to the football game to watch 20 of their peers play. And we go to a conference to meet people and connect, and then spend most of our time hoping someone else will see us and care enough to meet us and connect. A friend just got to college and is a bit concerned that there’s not a lot to do at night. This opens the door to the question, “why not organize the other people who don’t have anything to do at night and give them something to do?” There are millions of years of evolution that encourage us to avoid strangers and new experiences. And decades of school and indoctrination that train us to stay in our lane, wait for instructions and keep our head down. And yet plenty of people go to the conference… The next time, walk up to the first unattached person you see and ask a few generous questions, the kind of questions you wish someone would ask you. When you join an online community, lurking is unlikely to get you what you seek. Find a non-lurker and contribute to their thread. Generosity is not the same as hustle. Instead of waiting to make the varsity team, start an intramural league, even if it’s for just an afternoon. If you’re just looking, stay home. Plenty to see from your couch. For people seeking to make a difference, it begins with helping other people make a difference. "
244,It goes without saying,"September 17, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/it-goes-without-saying/,"A phrase that’s been showing up recently is, “no pressure.” It usually comes in a pitch letter of some sort, written by someone who isn’t in a position to exert any pressure. So why say it? It’s a bit like, “while supplies last.” And “to be honest…” which is perhaps the most self-negating of the three. It’s throat-clearing, a word salad designed to somehow establish a connection or at least the appearance of empathy or clear thought. Semiotics is the science of signs and symbols. A stop sign isn’t a stop sign unless it looks like a stop sign, and that song they sing on your birthday means something really different if people whisper it quietly. It’s tempting to simply focus our attention on the text itself. That we should say what we mean and mean what we say. But messages merely begin with the text. The rhythm, presentation, source, and context deliver most of what we take away from a message. Watching a video with the sound off communicates far more than we realize.  And one way to develop a style of writing is to skip the salad. Simply say what you mean. "
245,I’ve been doing it wrong all along,"September 16, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/ive-been-doing-it-wrong-all-along/,"This is one of the great benefits of learning. It’s also a common challenge. When we get better at something, it is preceded by a moment of incompetence. In that moment, we’re not exactly sure how to do it better, but we realize that the way we’d been doing it wasn’t nearly as useful. It can be something prosaic–I learned last week that I’d been preheating my dosa pan for too long, and that’s why (paradoxically) they weren’t becoming crispy. Years of consistent behavior overturned in one moment. Or it can be something more profound, changing our perceptions of others and ourselves. If you need to be proven right, learning is a challenge. If you’re eager to be proven wrong, learning is delightful. "
246,Tricked (again),"September 15, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/tricked-again/,"If you knew then what you know now, would you have made the same decision? In the last fifty years, more than 25,000,000 Americans have died prematurely due to cigarette smoking. Worldwide, it’s significantly higher. That’s fifty times as many U.S. citizens as died in World War II. How did cigarette marketers manage to keep selling their product for decades once the danger was known? And are we able to see how many industries use this playbook to sell us on actions that are against our interests? The key drivers of widespread marketing impact are status and affiliation. The status of doing what James Dean or another movie star did in a movie. The status of a rock star or a spy. Women didn’t smoke much in public until a well-publicized stunt had society women causing a scandal by smoking while walking in the Easter Day parade on Fifth Ave. in New York. It shouldn’t work, but it does. Status cues. And affiliation? Peer pressure, the freedom of the Marlboro Man, the social requirements created by the high-status folks who required it… No teenager wants to be left behind by their peers. The same thing happened with the seemingly less fatal but also expensive meme of a diamond engagement ring. Using similar tactics, DeBeers created status expectations and cultural standards that pushed people to spend billions of dollars on small rocks. And, surprisingly, again with gas stoves. I got tricked by this, as did millions of others. Walking away from the affiliation of what our parents did (those spiral electric heating elements) to the power and status of a gas stove that seemed right out of Prometheus. Of course, traditional diamond mining is brutal, dangerous and dirty. And we now know, and have known for a long time, that gas stoves in a kitchen or apartment are needlessly dangerous, particularly to children and others that breathe. And yet we resist! We don’t want to give up that thing that is part of our identity, that we grew up with or aspire to acquire. It doesn’t really matter that there are elegant and beautiful alternatives to the stones, or that an induction cooktop works even better than gas. It’s the story and the way it was sold to us (they hustled Bob Hope’s writers to give him jokes where the punchline was “now we’re cooking with gas”). The status quo is resilient. Almost everyone in the jewelry business or the appliance business will do fine (perhaps even better) if we switch. Unless you own a diamond mine or a pipeline company, switching to a more resilient, safer and kinder alternative is probably good for business. But the stories persist. The stories about status, about affiliation and the risk of the new. More: Gas, Diamonds, The Easter Parade "
247,Finding the others,"September 14, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/finding-the-others/,"Consider purple.space a new community for professionals to connect without hustle. Peer-to-peer support, brainstorming, community workshops, coaching, dailies and more. Distributed work doesn’t have to be disconnected work. Freelancing, creating, and leading can feel solitary, even lonely, but they don’t need to be. And most of all, we can get better. Better together. Our best work is far more likely to happen when we have peers. You’re likely to become the average of the people you spend professional time, so choosing your cohort is best not left to chance. More people are working away from the office than ever before, but we all miss the best moments of solidarity and connection that can happen around the mythical water cooler. Finding your people and leading together can change everything. There are 500 of us now, in a community of practice. It’s an evolving, focused community of professionals. Around the world and around the clock, people who care about their work and about each other. We’re only enrolling 1,000 people this week. It costs $20 a week and the first week is free if you use the code TOGETHER. I hope you can check it out. "
248,The MVP and fear,"September 13, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/the-mvp-and-fear/,"The minimum viable product is a powerful way to find out if your solution is going to find a market. Bean-to-bar chocolate in the US didn’t happen because someone raised millions of dollars, built a factory and got shelf space at the A&P. It happened because John Scharffenberger made a small batch of chocolate by hand and brought it to a farmer’s market. That was enough to discover if people wanted what he had in mind. In This is Marketing, I talk about its cousin, the smallest viable audience. This isn’t a ‘target’, because we’re not hunting. Instead, this is a segment that you’ve chosen to delight. To delight so much that they’ll return and perhaps spread the word. The fear comes in several forms: Both the MVP and the SVA are scary constructs, on purpose. The goal is to learn something, quickly, as opposed to wasting time by hiding out. "
249,Practical philosophy,"September 12, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/practical-philosophy/,"Engineering is the powerful practice of being able to deliver artifacts that do what they’re supposed to. Bridges that don’t fall down, software that runs, IV lines that don’t get infected. But if we want to create something, it helps to know what it’s for. That simple question, “what’s it for?” is essential to ask and easy to avoid. If you’re about to spend time and money and effort to create something, how will you know if it worked? What needs to happen to make it worth it? And of course, not just bridges. Meetings. Memos. A family gathering. And yes, marketing. Who’s it for? What’s it for? "
250,Widespread resistance,"September 11, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/widespread-resistance/,"Steve Pressfield defines Resistance as the inertia, stories and excuses we manage to create to avoid powerful or creative work. Writer’s block, procrastination, overconfidence, or a belief in un-delivered talent are all symptoms of resistance. Knowing that it has a name helps us dance with it. We can’t make it go away (the more important and useful our contribution, the more likely it is to appear) but we can learn to use it as a compass. In the last few years, though, resistance has been spreading as a cultural norm. Ennui, eco-anxiety, marketplace exhaustion and justified frustration with systems of caste and injustice have all amplified resistance. It feels like culture and tech have both hit a cul de sac, and it’s easier to simply chill out. This serves the defenders of the status quo, but distracts us from the journey. If history is any guide, this is precisely the moment we need the urge to create. To imagine something better, to ship work that matters, and to lead. "
251,Digital shortcuts and cognitive load,"September 10, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/digital-shortcuts-and-cognitive-load/,"I used to drive 200 miles to Boston once a week or so. After a few trips on the highway, my subconscious figured out that getting behind a few trucks for the entire ride enabled me to spend four hours without using much conscious effort on driving.  Every day, we make decisions. These require effort, and there’s probably a finite amount of energy available for these focused choices. That’s why our digital habits matter. Not to save us five or ten minutes a day, but to save us from a few hundred unimportant decisions that break our flow. For example, if instead of trying to come up with a unique and original password every time you use a new service, you use a password manager, your load just got lighter. If you adopt a file naming system (each version gets a number, from 1 to X, so the latest file always has the highest number before its name) then you won’t hassle with trying to figure out which is the most recent version. If you use the sidebar in your file finder to put shortcuts to the folders you use often, you won’t burn energy finding your way through nests of folders, again and again. When I worked at Yahoo, they were embarrassed to share the fact that the most clicked-on button on the entire site was the Yahoo logo (which did nothing on the home page) and the most searched-for term in their search box was also “Yahoo.” People hadn’t figured out what bookmarks were yet, or decided to simply keep clicking around until something worked. Ten minutes today will save you from 30 decisions every day forever. "
252,The Santa problem,"September 9, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/the-santa-problem/,"An echo chamber is created by a marketer to assemble a group of people who are insulated from conventional discourse. It can happen to sports and music fans, to investors, to companies that have confidence in their view of the world, or to social or political gatherings. We support an echo chamber when we can gain status or find tribal affiliation by adhering to its rules. The resilience of the cultural norm happens as a result of insulation from reasoned discourse and is amplified by threats to status or affiliation. The tooth fairy myth is a fairly benign myth, but, like Santa, it’s mostly reserved for kids. When leaders seek to gain power and profit by organizing and maintaining an echo chamber, it begins to have negative side effects. You’ll know you’re in one when: The reason Santa is a problem is that sooner or later, reality arrives.  "

It’s powerful, effective and personal. It runs worldwide, in Zoom, and it’s completely interactive–every participant participates. This will be the third session… the first two got rave reviews, and some folks even returned to do it again.

254,No lunging,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/no-lunging/,"I’ve been working hard on my juggling (actual juggling, not metaphorical juggling). The secret, as I wrote about in The Practice is the throwing, not the catching. If you get the throws right, the catches are easy. The way to focus on the throws is simple but culturally difficult: Errant throws don’t earn a lunge. Let them drop. Simply stand there and watch them drop. Realize that the problem isn’t that you didn’t lunge. The problem was that your throws were off. It’s hard to do this at work (here’s the metaphor part). There are lots of rewards for heroic saves at work. But heroic saves undermine the desire to build better systems. If it’s worth having a better system, it might be worth shutting down the entire plant when the system breaks. "
255,The paradox of insular language,"September 7, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/the-paradox-of-insular-language/,"We often develop slang or codewords to keep the others from understanding what we’re saying. Here’s an example (thanks BK) of the lengths that some are going to be able to talk about Chinese politics.  Of course, if you come up with a concealed enough code, the people you’re talking to won’t have a clue what you mean. If it’s in the language, it must be shared. This was the problem with the Cone of Silence, used by Maxwell Smart to have top secret conversations with the Chief. It worked so well, the Chief couldn’t hear him. Language only works when other people know what you’re saying, but once they know, it’s likely that the others can figure it out. So why bother? It turns out that vernacular elevates those that are using it as much as it isolates the ones who don’t understand it. When we speak as insiders, we become insiders.  A practical way to create tribal affiliation is to amplify insular language. "
256,The Big-O conundrum,"September 6, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/the-big-o-conundrum/,"In computer science, Big-O notation is a way of talking about what happens to a solution method when the inputs start to increase. For example, sorting numbers is an easy problem when there are only five or six, but when you have to sort 5,000, a totally different algorithm is needed. Business models have this baked in. Running a podcast app doesn’t get more difficult if you list more podcasts or have more users. But running a food bank gets exponentially more difficult when your inputs and outputs increase. If you’re running a conference where you expect one or two people to arrive every few minutes, hiring someone to check them in is a pretty obvious move. But if you expect five or six people at a time, you’ll need to hire at least that many people or it all backs up. But what about the big convention where thousands of people might arrive at once? In that case, your Big O problem requires you to do away with the check-in altogether and have people do their check-in online, in advance. Mom-and-pop businesses work because there’s mom and there’s pop. But when the inputs start to go up, when the business begins to scale, it’s really hard to simply hire another mom. Pushing the old algorithm too far ends up with a crisis–we need to invest in process before we need it, not when the emergency strikes. There are Big-O problems in marketing, in sales, in customer service, in finance, in production and in compliance. There’s nothing wrong with winging it–until there is. "

And May Day has been around about as long. Around here, it’s become mostly a seasonal marker, but it was founded to devote just a day to something that deserves much more… to commemorate and celebrate the workers who sacrifice and toil to build. Everyone needs to work, but now, more people than ever have the privilege to choose which sort of work they’re going to do. You have to work somewhere, but it doesn’t have to be here. And I think it’s fair to say that just about every person reading this blog has a job that would be unrecognizable to someone working when Labor Day was first celebrated. In fact, many of these jobs are now unrecognizable to people from just 15 years ago. Only 9% of the office workers in Manhattan go to their office five days a week now. Add AI to the mix and we’re seeing another shift, one that’s happening faster than any that came before. At the same time, many of the jobs that people get paid for have analogues where people do these jobs for fun. Amateur violin players, volunteer editors at Wikipedia, people who volunteer to help build houses or feed the hungry. Is it labor if we get to choose? Far too many people are being left behind as the market for our effort bifurcates. Too many people are indentured or stuck, under-appreciated and underpaid. If we’re lucky enough to have a choice, perhaps we should choose wisely. PS the significance bee mug sold out instantly the last time I posted about it. Amanda has made 90 more, they’re now available here. "
259,Informed consent (rarely is),"September 3, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/informed-consent-rarely-is/,"Adults make choices and live with the consequences. No one else should tell us what flavor of ice cream we prefer, or what career to choose. We’re good at knowing what we want. In practice, this works really well for certain kinds of decisions. But when we add the network effect, profit-seeking industrial entities, statistics, long-term impact and side effects, it often falls apart. Few people with terminal lung cancer made a fully informed decision when they started smoking cigarettes decades ago. Millions of teens who got hooked on a Juul certainly didn’t. We’re tempted to take the “free” case of bottled water that the local market is offering, without considering what’s going to happen to those bottles when we’re done with them. And while it’s easy to overregulate the testing and distribution of pharmaceuticals, it’s even easier to underregulate them. There’s no right answer, there’s simply a spectrum.  Ideally, we’d each be able to make smart, long-term decisions with accurate information. I consider myself pretty rational, but, like most people, I don’t do a longitudinal study before taking a pill or buying a new product. We use buzz, hype and status to make decisions without statistics or peer-review. Society might not know the ideal answer about where to draw the line between individual choice and community standards, but it’s worth asking the questions. Are people likely to be misled, confused or tricked into taking actions that hurt themselves and others? Are there incentives in place for consent to be skipped, or  profits to be made when people are not fully informed? Are there bugs in our human decision-making processes that are likely to be hacked by organizations that have a different goal than we do? Are there public health implications that have more impact than the benefits to an individual? Like microeconomics, classic marketing theory happens in a vacuum, not the real world. To put it into widescale practice, we need to think hard about the impact of millions of decisions, often made without clarity or perspective. "
260,The empathy of useful feedback,"September 2, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/the-empathy-of-useful-feedback/,"When a friend shows you work in progress, your best contribution is to imagine the point of view and preferences of the person it is being created for. “I don’t like it,” isn’t useful, because it’s not for you. “I could imagine that someone who wants x, y or z would be looking for…” is much more helpful. You don’t have to be three years old to be a toy designer, and you don’t have to be three to give useful feedback on a new design. On the other hand, when a friend shows you something that’s finished, the most important thing you can do is find two or three truthful and positive things to say. When someone trusts you to share their work, and cares enough about the world to bring the work forward, that’s already two things worth applauding. "
261,Are you doing what you said you wanted to do?,"September 1, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/09/are-you-doing-what-you-said-you-wanted-to-do/,"If you want to be a poet, write poetry. Every day. Show us your work. If you want to do improv, start a troupe. Don’t wait to get picked. If you want to help animals, don’t wait for vet school. Volunteer at an animal shelter right now. If you want to write a screenplay, write a screenplay. If you want to do marketing, find a good cause and spread the idea. Don’t ask first. If you’d like to be more strategic or human or caring at your job, don’t wait for the boss to ask. Once we leave out the “and” (as in, I want to do this and be well paid, invited, approved of and always successful) then it’s way easier to do what we said we wanted to do. "
262,Summarize this…,"August 31, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/summarize-this/,"A great use of ChatGPT and other AI is to paste relevant text into the chat box and ask for a summary. I did this with 300 suggestions that came via a Google form and it did the work better, faster and with more clarity (and less bias) than a person would. Often, we’re clouded by early or vivid data, instead of being patient enough to work our way through it. Or consider taking the transcript from a Zoom call… if you send the AI summary to all participants, you’re probably more likely to get responses that include useful congruence on what was actually said. "
263,The nuanced challenge of “The Regular Kind”,"August 30, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/the-nuanced-challenge-of-the-regular-kind/,"In a breakthrough study by Alex Berke at MIT, she and her team showed that labeling a menu item as vegan significantly decreased how many people would order it. In similar conditions, it turns out that more people choose exactly the same item if it doesn’t carry that label. One conclusion people might take away from this study is that the brand name “vegan” carries a lot of baggage. We see that people generally like food without meat, but when it’s labeled as a particular sub-category, they avoid it. Consider that in other studies, researchers have shown that when food without meat is listed as the default option, far more people will choose it. Simply shifting the choice from “on request” to the convenient, regular kind, dramatically increases selection. But the real insight is that if a marketer wants to reach the masses, the regular kind becomes worth understanding. When Italian food was considered novel and was stocked in the ethnic aisle, marketers had to run commercials simply to persuade people that it was okay to serve spaghetti for dinner on Wednesdays. It didn’t really matter which kind, simply that it was normal. An alternative is to seek the smallest viable audience instead, to create connected communities that change the status quo. The tiny symbols on many packaged goods that indicate kosher status are ignored by most people, but often closely inspected by enough small groups that use it as a certification of what they’re buying. When you can encourage a small group to look for something that the larger group doesn’t even see, it can shift how large producers (corporations, politicians, employers) treat the entire population. While organizing a few is helpful to those seeking to create change, it also creates a risk for a brand that is comfortable with its position as a market dominator. They’re no longer leaders, because leaders make change happen and embrace opportunity. Instead, a brand that sees itself as the regular kind is relentless in seeking to serve everyone and offend no one. Which, inevitably, they will fail to do. And so the creative destruction occurs that leads to a shift. A shift in what’s only available on request, on what’s stocked on eye level, and on what’s safe to serve at the big gathering.  "
264,The absence of proof,"August 29, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/the-absence-of-proof/,"Belief makes us human. Belief is our tool to dance with a possible future, confront our fears, and build community. Our personal taste and our preferences belong to us as well, helping us believe in ourselves. For millennia, belief thrived in most parts of our lives. We didn’t need belief to know that fire was hot (it always is), but it certainly gave us hope and solace in the face of the unknown. And the unknown is where belief thrives But resistance to knowing isn’t a useful habit. When Ignaz Semmelweis used statistics to prove that hand washing by doctors would save the lives of mothers giving birth, doctors who believed they knew better ignored it, causing countless deaths. When researchers showed that many ulcers are caused by bacteria, doctors who practiced with long-earned belief resisted the data for decades. And when experts in any field fight against research that might undermine their status, they’re doing their belief and those who trust them a disservice. There’s more proof in the world than ever before, not less. It’s no longer, “I’ll believe it when I see it,” but instead, “I am confident enough to change my mind and informed enough to do the math and understand the concepts.” We have proof about mathematics, about black holes and about the efficacy of vaccines. We have statistical proof of what people click on and how humans respond in a double-blind test. This doesn’t make belief less important. In fact, as proof shows up in one area, it simply gives us the opportunity to bring belief somewhere else, somewhere we can put it to good use. Personal taste, placebos and the way we dance with the unknown future are powerful ways to connect, to express ourselves and to find solace. But the time we spend arguing about proof that we’re not prepared to accept is simply wasted. Belief needs proof the way a fish needs a bicycle. "
265,The convenience fee,"August 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/the-convenience-fee/,"Sometimes it’s obvious, like the $1 that you get charged for using an ATM or a credit card, and it’s simply not worth the hassle to walk a few blocks. And sometimes it’s not, like the cost we all pay for the conveniently wrapped fruits or vegetables at the market–wrapped in plastic that will not degrade in our lifetimes. The convenience fee might be the time you spend at the drive-through at Starbucks, instead of walking inside, or, heaven forbid, brewing your own coffee at home. Or choosing media to consume because it’s right there, not a few clicks away… But the convenience fees, whether metaphorical or actual, keep rising. It turns out that a life lived conveniently isn’t always a better one. The cost of convenience ends up being too high. "
266,Create value,"August 27, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/create-value/,"If your job feels like a dead end, it might be because you’ve traded agency and responsibility for the feeling of security. But real security lies in creating value. Creating value isn’t easy, but it’s resilient and generous and often profitable. “How do I create more value?” is a much more useful question than, “how do I find a better job?” "
267,The maverick and the status quo,"August 26, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/the-maverick-and-the-status-quo/,"The future isn’t the same as the past. Technology develops, systems change and most of all, someone cares enough to make things better. The maverick isn’t the selfish gunslinger of myth. In fact, she’s focused on resilient, useful interactions that change what we expect, pushing back against the inertia of gobbledygook and bureaucracy. Some principles to keep in mind: The world is topsy turvy and yet, this is as normal as it’s ever going to be again. We need your leadership. "
268,The length trick,"August 25, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/the-length-trick/,It’s possible that the memo or video is simply too long. A 14 minute video explaining how to have a 10 minute brainstorming meeting might benefit from some editing. But it might be that your instruction manual would benefit from some more photos and better in depth explanation. Matching the complexity of the problem to the method of solving it can really pay off. 
269,Speaking up,"August 24, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/speaking-up/,"For many, the imagined cost of speaking up is almost always higher than the actual cost. And we live with the cost in our imagination daily, dying a little bit over time as we keep our insights to ourselves. Speaking up is a skill, and we can only improve it with practice. "
270,Belief is contagious,"August 23, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/belief-is-contagious/,"Placebos work and placebos spread. We’re wired to believe something, but the specifics of what we believe often come from other people. When there were a limited number of channels, mainstream ideas were the focus of our conversations, because the mainstream was all that was widely amplified. Someone might believe that the world was flat, or that the moon landings were faked, but that lived on the fringe. Pockets of odd beliefs. One of the reasons that Mehmet Oz’s snake oil nostrums were so disturbing was that he took his mainstream reputation, added mass TV and legitimized fringe placebos to make a profit. Now, thanks to the billion-channel universe, the mainstream has gone out with the tide and every belief can feel mainstream if you immerse yourself in it. You can surround yourself with people who are sure that birds aren’t real, or find a community to reinforce that the patent medicine you’re taking works. And that will increase its positive placebo effect. Belief increases the efficacy of our practice, but touting an idea can also generate a profit for the touter. Sometimes those two things align, but often, the profit motive pushes them to where they are out of sync. Our choice of media and cultural inputs matter, now more than ever. When we choose what to see and who to hang out with, we’re actually choosing our future. "
271,Childish or childlike?,"August 22, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/childish-or-childlike/,"Childlike involves wonder. It’s the ability to see the world with fresh eyes and create magic. Childish, on the other hand, is living as if there are no consequences. Over time, we’ve gotten very good at measuring the long and short-term consequences of our actions. And good at ignoring them. Adults do well when they seek to be childlike, and that’s possible without being childish. "
272,Now in Spanish,"August 21, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/now-in-spanish/,"The Carbon Almanac is now available in Spanish. For free. Free to download, free to share and free to print a copy at home. While the book has been traditionally published around the world (in Italian, Czech, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Dutch), no Spanish-language publisher was willing to do the work. So we purchased the rights from our publisher and did it ourselves. It joins about twenty international editions of the free Generation Carbon, a Carbon Almanac book for Kids. Together, they’ve been downloaded and shared millions of times. A worldwide network of volunteers managed to create a foundational text for the urgent conversation around our climate. It’s not too late, but we need to begin, and that can only happen if we talk about it and understand what’s really happening. You can find the award-winning English edition here. Special thanks to the indefatigable Anna Kohler Smith and her team of volunteers who led the Spanish translation at every step of the way, from ideation to rights to publication. "
273,For customers vs to customers,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/decoding-dark-patterns-and-cognitive-load/,"In the life of every enterprise, the moment arises when a choice has to be made: Are you here for your customers, to give them what they seek, or are you trying to do something to your customers, to squeeze out extra income? This doesn’t mean that the only path is to keep lowering your prices. It’s entirely possible your customers want to pay a lot but get more than they paid for. What it does mean is that you use your brand and your interface and your software and your network effect to come up with ways to serve people that they would miss if you were gone. It’s not surprising that many companies are putting software and dark patterns and AI to work on things that improve their profit. But I’m not seeing as many instances of them doing the same thing to improve the experience and delight that their customers experience. Amazon is testing a different way to show reviews on the products they sell. It looks like this: instead of like this: It’s subtle, but it can make a very big impact on merchants, on their profits, and on what we buy. In the new format, your brain sees the image of a star, but then it has to do the mental math of turning the number 4.6 into something with weight and emotional heft–a bunch of stars.  In the old format, that work was done already. Our brains are much better at drawing emotional conclusions from this more concrete visualization. If you look at the two illustrations above, it certainly seems at first glance as though the second one is higher rated. This new format means that higher-rated items won’t have as much of an advantage–which will push other vendors to buy ads and run coupons (which Amazon makes a profit on) instead of either gaming the reviews or actually making a better product. When a company makes it hard to unsubscribe, or pushes needless options (“362 people are currently signing up for the insurance…”) or hustles people, they’ve forgotten the lesson that got them here in the first place. Eventually, organizations that serve themselves lose the ability to continue serving others. "
274,On the dot,"August 20, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/on-the-dot/,"Hardy came home from school and proudly showed his mom the cheap plastic trinkets he had earned that day. “I stood quietly on the dot and so I got some tickets. And if I stand on the dot quietly tomorrow, I can get some more prizes!” First grade! That’s one way to indoctrinate kids in both obedience and consumption. It’s rare we see it so brazenly and vividly executed. Is standing on a dot the thing we need to train kids to do? Has each of us spent too much time standing on dots already? "

New research shows that computers and robots are now better at solving CAPTCHA puzzles than humans. This was inevitable. The interesting question is, “how long before they go away?” First, someone has to decide that it’s their job to worry about this. Then they have to assemble a quorum to approve the radical shift away from something that was always there and didn’t seem broken. Then they have to take responsibility for what happens next. Then they have to manage a tech intervention with others that find it easier to leave things as they are as they worry about other priorities… It’s easier to be a bystander than to be a leader. "
276,The unsurprising confusion about ‘per capita’,"August 18, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/the-unsurprising-confusion-about-per-capita/,"A car cut me off on the highway the other day. The car was going nearly 100 mph. Was the car a new Porsche 911 GT3 or a used Toyota Camry? The thing is, there are more than 1,000 times as many Camrys on the road. But our instinct is to pick the vivid and distinctive answer. The per capita crime rate in rural areas is often dramatically (sometimes five or ten times) higher than it is in most cities. On the other hand, Alaska has far more millionaires per capita than most people would guess. That’s because we underestimate the population, not because there’s a particularly large number of millionaires. More people might lead to more instances, but what matters isn’t the absolute number, it’s the percentage. New York is an incredibly safe place to live. We’re simply not naturally attuned to dividing what we notice by the chances we’ll see it… stories resonate without regard for the denominator. Flying across the country is dramatically safer than driving there, but intuitively, it feels like the opposite must be true. And peer-reviewed medicine is far more likely to cure an illness than an anecdote will. The average TikTok or Facebook post is seen by just a few people, even though it feels like the ones we’re seeing are seen by a lot of people. Reality is lumpy, and taking a moment to think about the source of our story helps us get clear about what’s actually happening. "
277,Defending the apostrophe,"August 17, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/defending-the-apostrophe/,"Does it need defending? The sign on some bushes near a park in my town says, Beware: Bee’s. A local merchant adds a note to some receipts that says, Your awesome. It’s tempting to speak up and point out that the sky comma is showing up where it shouldn’t. And missing when it might be helpful. But language shifts, changing over time, and as we become ever more post-literate, it’s not hard to imagine that the apostrophe’s assigned role is ending. Greengrocers and others with pens have taken possession. Sometimes, people throw in an extra apostrophe to sound smart. And sometimes, they simply give up because it’s not worth the trouble to figure out when or when not to use one. Pedants will always pedant and try to defend the language, but the language changes whether we want it to or not. This cycle of the informal becoming formal, then a badge of honor and then fading away has always been with us. It’s only going to accelerate, one more shift due to technology. PS so far, it seems like AI is really good with apostrophes. "

279,The (very) long tail,"August 15, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/the-very-long-tail/,"The average YouTube video gets five new views every day. Let’s parse that for a second. 5 billion YouTube plays a day, spread over about a billion videos means that while some videos live in the short head and get millions of views, there are a huge number of videos that get fewer than a single view each day. At some point, the long tail is so long it ceases to exist. This makes it hard indeed to rely on persistence alone to find your audience. The buffet line is far too long and the plates aren’t getting any bigger. PS! Chip Conley and I are doing a live online event today (8/15) at 4 pm NY time. (here it is)… Chip is a bestselling author, a wise soul and a good friend. We were also co-authors of our very first book… in 1986.  37 years is a very long run in the world of book publishing, one that would be hard to imagine beginning today in the era of such a long tail. The number of books published each year has increased 50x, and when we add in social media, blogs and podcasts, the amount of content clamoring for our attention is perhaps up by a factor of a thousand. No wonder it feels noisy. One approach is to make something worth talking about. Another is to connect and lead a community. Chip does both, with generosity. "

In this post, I want to take a moment to explain the attraction and risk of unstable equilibrium, and there’s also a fun contest at the end… If you drop a marble into a metal bowl, it will roll to the bottom and stay there. Every time. This is reliable, predictable and stable. We know what to expect from systems that find one spot of equilibrium. But sometimes, there isn’t just one state. A situation could go this way or that. A brilliant jazz quartet, a well-matched game of soccer and a canoe in a river are all examples of an unstable equilibrium. There’s tension. We’re fascinated and are drawn to how it unfolds. Goodbids.org is a project I’ve worked on for a few months with some friends. And we simply can’t predict how it’s going to turn out, so it’s time to test it in the real world. Our goal is to re-imagine the charity auction. Most of the time, bidders in these auctions are looking for a bargain, which is out of sync with what the charity wants. The end result is often lackluster. In Goodbids, every bid is also a donation. That means that the winner takes home a great prize, and all the other bidders get the satisfaction of knowing they made a useful and non-refundable donation directly to a charity that’s doing good work. The unstable part? The nature of the auction means that the items being auctioned off will almost always go for a price much lower than they’re worth. The charity gets more, the winner pays less. And here’s the contest: Until 4 pm NY time today, August 14, we’re inviting you to guess how much the final bidding will reach on the two items that are up for bid in our test run. The person with the best guess will get a collectible significance bee mug and some other loot. Thanks for caring and being generous. "

In fact, the effective ones rarely are. When you hand someone a release, a royalty agreement or even a partnership document, it pays to point out the gnarly parts, the controversial bits and the ones that are worth paying attention to. After all, the very best time to understand an agreement is when you sign it, not later.

It involves risk and effort and emotional labor. We’re here to make a change happen, and we’re giving something to make that happen. So it’s a vote. A vote for the customer we seek to serve. A vote for the boss and the owners of the institution where we do our work. A vote for our co-workers. If they haven’t earned it, if we can’t trust them, support them and root for them, we should do it somewhere else. Don’t volunteer to work for a partner who won’t work for you.

The candidate coming out of nowhere offers hope. We can’t know but we can imagine. Kickstarter offers hope. No reviews, no tests, simply a promise of what might be. Book publishers buy hope, so do venture capitalists. On the other hand, the typical commercial investor simply wants a repeat of what already was. Some pharmaceuticals offer specific outcomes with known statistics…  Simple example: Early in my career as a producer and creator of non-fiction books, my proposals included finished layouts. It turned out that whatever I could have offered at this stage could never be as good as the publisher imagined could be created once I had their input… better to offer a blank page than the page we would actually produce. On the other hand, I couldn’t simply assert that the contents would be worth publishing–we had to offer examples and a track record. The thing is, there’s never just truth, because we’re talking about the future. So we base our hope on what has come before. And there’s never just hope. The hope is based on something that came before, some clue or hint or track record that makes us believe. The hard work for the marketer is in choosing when we’ve established enough of a track record–but not too much. And for the voter/consumer/investor, we get to choose what we seek, and what we offer. Confusing truth and hope doesn’t make it more likely we’ll succeed. "

If someone is driving close behind you and pressuring you to turn when you don’t feel safe, are you more likely to go for it? We can do our work as fast as makes sense, but no faster. Regardless of external pressure. Sometimes, we establish false limits so we can leave room for when we need to hurry up.

289,The gratuitous use of plastic,"August 5, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/the-gratuitous-use-of-plastic/,"At the dawn of the plastic age, it was a cheap substitute. The word “plasticky” is not a compliment. Over time, the plastics industry developed new finishes, colors and most of all, cultural impact, and extra (wasted) plastic packaging was seen first as convenient, then as a sign of status. I just got a lovely digital recorder in the mail. The thoughtfully-designed and well-constructed device weighs 6 ounces. The box it came in, on the other hand, is difficult to open and hard to re-use. It weighs 11 ounces. The plastic in this box, and in so many other over-wrought packages, will never go away. It cannot be recycled. It will either end up burned or in the ocean or a landfill, where it will remain for more than a million years. Gratuitous used to mean, “freely bestowed.” By overinvesting in something that’s not required, a marketer demonstrates confidence, status and power. But now, gratuitous means inefficient, grating and wasteful. Marketers seek to tell a story of better. But better changes. Better might be more convenient, cheaper, efficiently designed, higher utility, more exclusive, mainstream, or simply fun. But better is no longer associated with wasteful. There are a few questions where the answer is ‘plastic.’ But we’re all discovering that it comes at a real cost. Instead of raising the status of the companies that use it in marketing, it is now a lazy, shameful shortcut. With surprisingly little effort, we can raise the bar on better. "

And others live on Feynman’s expanding frontier of ignorance, where each closed door leads to several newly opened ones. That’s a fundamental choice in our work.

A plumber is smart, they know how to do a skilled and effective job on the task at hand. Intellectualism isn’t about practical results, it’s a passion for exploring what others have said, though this approach is sometimes misused to make others feel uninformed or to stall.  If you want to know what the scholars have written, ask an intellectual. And if you’ve got a problem worth solving, it might pay to ask a smart person. And yet, if the GPS is broken and we need directions, sometimes we hesitate to ask a local. And if your computer isn’t working, swearing at it might be less effective than asking an IT pro. There are a couple of reasons we might resist help from someone who is smart: –It exposes us to change and all the emotions that come from that. If we insulate ourselves from useful insight, we can stay put, stuck, with no changes required. –It can make us seem dumb in comparison. It might be better to live with the problem than be seen as someone who didn’t know about it. Access to smart is easier than ever before. But we need to seek it out. "
293,Choose your customers,"August 1, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/08/choose-your-customers/,"…choose your future. It’s an odd way to think about your project, your job, your startup, but there’s little that matters more. There are two key elements: At one extreme is the first few years of Google’s growth. The salesforce didn’t matter–the customers showed up on their own, and the revenue engine was so powerful that they were easily replaced. Beyond that, the needs of the customers were aligned with Google’s vision. Compare this to a landscaper who sets up a new business on a small island. Getting customers is a challenge, because all the residents who want a landscaper already have one–you’ll need to do some hard work to get people to switch. And then, the customers you get might want something impossible, and are hoping to pay as little as possible for it. And worse, they may get satisfaction (inappropriately) out of mistreating a vendor they feel power over. The goal is to have a business where the customers you have enable you to build the organization you want to build. To look forward to finding and serving new customers. And to create a tailwind so that early customer success earns you a chance for more customer success. The first thing to do when thinking about starting a project, before you invest in systems design, infrastructure or fancy tools, is to practice getting some customers. And the second thing to do is to find out what it’s like to delight or disappoint those customers. Customer traction is just about the only thing all successful organizations have in common.

294,Should we assume rational goodwill?,"July 31, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/should-we-assume-rational-goodwill/,"There’s often a choice between following the cultural dictates of a given group or seeking out demonstrable facts and the scientific method. Which do you expect most people would choose? Which would you choose? When we revert to a testable analysis of what works, we’re relying on the one thing that all humans share: reality. But cultural connection, peer pressure and the power of affiliation and status often short-circuit that analysis. This happens so often that arguing about facts might not be the best way to make your point. “Rational goodwill” is shorthand for, “If the analysis is testable, are you prepared to change your mind and accept the alternative that works?” And yet, more often than we might expect, NASA engineers, doctors, political leaders and households would have to honestly answer that with a ‘no’. It might be that culture isn’t something we awkwardly laid atop rational analysis. It might be the other way around. "
295,Pavlonian coincidence,"July 30, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/pavlonian-coincidence/,"There are two kinds of coincidences. The first is the one that we often talk about. It’s the make-believe magic of two things occurring that we didn’t expect to occur. When you and your long-lost college roommate end up randomly sharing adjacent bowling lanes when you’re 72–that’s a coincidence. When the world expert on the obscure Discs of Tron videogame finds a pristine example abandoned at the end of a driveway near his mom’s house… We invent all sorts of reasons for these events, but they’re simply random. The other kind matters far more. This is when we get two unrelated incidents confused because they happened nearby in time. If you were drinking your first ever kombucha when you heard that your cat died, it might be that in the future, seeing a can of kombucha prompts you to be sad. The events are co-incident. As our lives speed up and the number of inputs increases, it’s easier than ever to have events in proximity prompt instincts or expectations that are unrelated to what they actually created. That’s one reason why marketers work so hard to have their products or ads show up in times of our lives when we’re likely to associate them with feelings that lead to consumption. It’s not a random coincidence, it’s simply an incident that was planned in advance. Ring a bell? "
296,The social media lottery,"July 29, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/the-social-media-lottery/,"Someone is going to end up with 10,000,000 followers. Someone is going to post the next viral TikTok. Someone is going to build a meme that spreads around the world. But it probably won’t be me and it probably won’t be you. Buying lottery tickets might be fun, but they’re a lousy investment. "
297,It’s simple (it’s complicated),"July 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/its-simple-its-complicated/,"It’s simple: This surgery will fix your problem and you’ll be better. It’s complicated: Changes in lifestyle, diet and attitude will, over time, help you feel better. Or… Our enemies are bad, and we’re good. Vote for me. The world is a big place that is filled with nuance, shifting alliances and constant change. It’s worth taking a minute to look for what works. Vote for me. Perhaps… Search is simple. Type what you want in the box and click the first match. Information is vast. Look over our taxonomy of the world’s information and start to winnow the results in search of what you’re looking for. The easiest thing to sell is a simple solution to a problem someone knows they have. It’s a lot more difficult to bring nuance, understanding and resilience to a complex situation. More difficult but honest. "
298,Good businesses solve real problems,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/good-businesses-solve-real-problems/,"But not all real problems lead to good businesses. There are problems all around us. People need housing, health care and food. They want delight, belonging and status.  When a company shows up in the marketplace with a product or service that people eagerly choose to buy, it’s possible to make a profit. If there are assets and other ways to offer something at a premium, a business can actually thrive. But sometimes, a problem doesn’t lend itself to a private solution. Or, a private solution might simply be a low-cost commodity, something we need, but because it’s available from many sources, it might not actually be a good business for any given entity. We are unlikely to run out of problems. And finding a business that solves a problem is a great first step. But it also helps (a lot) if it’s also a good business. "
299,Product and process,"July 27, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/product-and-process/,"What do we get in exchange for our work? There’s pay, of course, and the satisfaction of a job well done. There’s stress and human interaction, learning and physical exertion. We get the drama of what might happen next and the delight of actually pulling it off. And mostly we get the day to day.  I haven’t seen any data that says that working in accounting for a candy company is more fun or more satisfying than working in accounting for an insurance company. And even circus clowns get bored at work. It’s easy to be excited about what the company seems to do… to choose our path based on the public’s perception of the output. But once the company has more than one person in it, most of our day is about satisfying the customer, meeting supplier requirements and dancing with the tension of doing our jobs. Often, we use the product we make as a reason to tolerate the process we don’t enjoy. Perhaps it makes sense to outline the sort of process you’d like to fill your days with instead of being drawn to the product that caught your eye in the first place.  "
300,But what if we’re wrong?,"July 26, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/but-what-if-were-wrong/,"Of course, we think we’re right. That’s why we’re sharing our opinion. But when there’s a disagreement, or we’re predicting the future, it’s likely that someone will turn out to be incorrect. Sometimes, being wrong is a minor embarrassment, with very little real cost. And sometimes, it leads to significant cost, a one-way choice we can’t undo. It turns out that considering the downside of confidence might be a worthwhile investment. Resilience is an asset. "
301,The early adopter (and the dilettante),"July 25, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/the-early-adopter-and-the-dilettante/,"The early adopter bought an iPhone in 2008 and never looked back. They played a few games of pickleball and then joined a club and bought the equipment. They picked up a new magazine on the newsstand and then subscribed, and they bought the new bestseller and then read the author’s other works. The dilettante shows up early and often, but then moves on. The early adopter and the dilettante both try out the new tech, but only one sticks around through the dip, learning from the hard parts. The dilettante seeks out new experiences, but the early adopter adopts. Culture needs both. Marketers need to be aware of the different personas, and plan accordingly. If you push for trial but don’t create the conditions for subscription and persistence, don’t be surprised if only the dilettantes show up. That might be enough, but we need to choose the audience we seek. "

304,Closed/open,"July 22, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/closed-open/,"I’m told that the hardest part of being a teaching golf pro isn’t helping adult golfers develop a good swing. It’s getting them to stop using a bad one. Our position feels so fragile, we hold on very tightly. Competence, status and connection are fleeting yet hard-won. We can often feel like an impostor and one way to find peace of mind is to fortify the foundation of what we believe got us here. And so we close up. Alas, it’s almost impossible to pick up something when your hand is in a tight fist. This is why emotional enrollment is the key to learning. No toddler learned to walk by insisting, again and again, that crawling was good enough. Or by trying to walk by simply crawling harder. Teachers (leaders/organizers/coaches) have two jobs. The first is to earn enrollment, the second is to teach. If the student is unwilling to become open, afraid to let go of what they’re holding on to, then better is going to be elusive. Resistance is wily. It will come up with a thousand reasons to remain closed, narratives about entitlement, security or cultural dynamics. Whatever it takes to stay still. Extinguish one and another will replace it. Let’s get real or let’s not play. "
305,The Beatles and Taylor Swift,"July 21, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/the-beatles-and-taylor-swift/,"When we’re in the middle of a cultural swirl, it’s normal to believe that everyone else is too. That’s part of the magic of a cultural swirl–it’s our friends, our work, our world. Most of these moments are actually tiny pockets. An episode of the much-talked-about TV show Succession was seen by about 3,000,000 people when it aired, compared to an episode of Gilligan’s Island or the Monkees, which reached fifteen times as many people in the US with each episode. And the US, of course, is about 5% of the world. The size of the swirl doesn’t have to change the way it makes us feel if we’re in the middle of it. If you were one of the half a million people at Woodstock, or the 7,000 who saw the Dead play in Binghamton, that moment belongs to you and the people there. But that doesn’t mean it’s universal. It might be important to the people there precisely because it isn’t. Over time, the Beatles sold more than a billion dollars in albums. They made movies, transformed hairstyles, clothing and attitudes about generational shift. Their work connected people worldwide in a way that few cultural forces before them had and few have since. And it probably felt just as exciting to see them live as it did to go to a Taylor Swift show. It’s true that no Taylor Swift album has outsold the hit albums by Hootie & The Blowfish or Metallica. But the long tail has transformed the record business since its peak. And the long tail keeps getting longer. The singular cultural touchstones of a generation or two ago are unlikely to be repeated. Our experiences with worldwide events or local performances are now much less likely to be uniform. We all tuned into the same channels. Then we didn’t. "
306,Confusion and delay,"July 20, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/confusion-and-delay/,"Marketing is generally about action. Marketers seek to create the conditions for a change to happen, for people to accomplish their goals and to satisfy their needs. But since 1950, some marketers have worked in a different direction. To sow confusion and doubt, and most of all, to seek delay. In 1954, facing the real threat of peer-reviewed and clear evidence that smoking caused lung cancer, the cigarette industry startled pundits by acknowledging the research and then calling for more research. “More research” is a brilliant (if evil) tactic. It resonates with people who embrace science (since it calls for more) and it also works for people who want the status quo to remain untouched (because it calls for later). We’ve seen this playbook used again and again. In the face of reality, big companies simply stall. And they’ve discovered that when the problem is chronic, nuanced and complex, they can stall for a very long time. Because we choose to not understand. We’d prefer to pretend that we can wait. We accept that maybe, more research will pleasantly surprise us. As long as people don’t understand, the stalling works. Spending more than a year working as a volunteer with hundreds of other people on The Carbon Almanac gave me a chance to really understand what is happening to our climate. Not just to the weather (10 days in a row over 119 degrees in Phoenix)… to the climate. To see that the best time to act was thirty years ago, but now is all we have left. It’s easy to be confused, but it’s not that difficult to understand. It’s all in the almanac. The new CEO of Shell just announced that the company is redoubling its efforts to produce ever more fossil fuels. Because there’s money to be made in the short-run. And because the public doesn’t see. Until we understand, it’s difficult to make change happen. The good news is that understanding is within our reach.  "
307,Goals and expectations,"July 19, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/goals-and-expectations/,"[a note to a frustrated friend, just starting out on a long career] There are three reasons that our goals might not be achieved. In order of palatability, they are: Perhaps the goals are too lofty, too based on chance, unlikely for anyone to achieve, surrounded by barriers that are rooted in class or caste, or simply unrealistic.  If that’s the case, change expectations and/or pick different goals. Or, perhaps the goals are useful, but we need more persistence, more time and some hard-earned lucky breaks along the way. If so, be persistently patient. Alas, if it’s not these two, the most likely reason is that we need to walk away from our expectations and our insistence that we’re already doing the work perfectly. It could be that we need to expend more effort than we hoped, develop new skills, find and embrace new strategies and develop a taste for the emotional labor that’s required to get from here to there.  Empathy, a cycle of skills improvement, developing new attitudes and showing up in service often accompanies the careers of people who get from here to there. Ambition is insufficient. "
308,Appropriate tension,"July 18, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/appropriate-tension/,"Growth usually feels risky. The feeling is a protection mechanism, a way to avoid failure or even the fear of failure. Of course, risk also feels risky (or at least it should). Differentiating between the two is difficult, which is why finding institutions, methods or coaches that have experience in the difference is valuable. When we create the conditions for supported tension–the feeling of ‘this might not work’–we give people the chance to grow. "
309,“I don’t like it”,"July 17, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/it-doesnt-work-for-me/,"Everyone is entitled to their own taste. But this isn’t the helpful answer to the question, “is this good?” Whether it suits your taste might be irrelevant. “It doesn’t resonate with me” is not the same as “No one will like this.” The professional understands that they need empathy to do their job. You don’t have to be a toddler to work at Fisher Price, and you don’t have to be a cancer survivor to be an oncologist. If you can imagine that the audience that is going to be served would appreciate and talk about the thing that’s being made, then it’s in good taste for them. It doesn’t matter much whether you’d buy it yourself. "
310,(Without the bad parts),"July 16, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/without-the-bad-parts/,"That makes it easy. “I’m in favor of unfiltered online commentary (without the misogyny, racism and mob manipulation.)” “I’d like to run a marathon (without getting tired).” “I’m in favor of strict copyright law (except for the endless © trolls and with just the right amount of fair use when it serves my agenda).” “I’d like convenience (without a loss of quality or an increase in waste.)” “I’m in favor of strong, certain authority (without the demagogues, unfairness and lack of resilience.)” “I’m in favor of unbridled free markets (without the side effects, monopolies and market failures.)” “I’d like to create important work (without getting nervous or feeling like an imposter.)” “I’m in favor of everyone having a car (without the sprawl, pollution and injuries.)” “I’m in favor of meetings where everyone has a voice (without endless meetings).” Sometimes, it’s possible to reduce the bad parts. But that takes considerable focus, effort and commitment. It’s not free. You can’t expect them to go away on their own. It might not seem like a feature to you, but the bad parts are often the flip side that allows the other part to exist. And sometimes, the bad parts are built into the system itself. In which case, you can’t be in favor of the good parts without accepting the reality of the bad. "
311,The good news,"July 15, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/the-good-news/,"What if there were a pipeline into your day, a series of emails or posts or feeds that had nothing but nice things, positive feedback and encouragement coming your way? Amazingly, you could build something like that in just a few minutes and have it forever. If the bad news (comments, drama and controversy) is simply manipulating you into a certain state without productive effects, consider turning it off. There’s no obligation to help someone else’s business model. No requirement that the device in your pocket change your mental state for the worse. And no upside to allowing media companies to make a profit by dumping trash on your front yard. There’s a growing body of data that shows that the growth of smartphones has also led to a significant decrease in optimism and life satisfaction, particularly among young people. But it’s not the phone that’s the problem, it’s the way attention is manipulated by the companies that create the apps on our phones. "
312,Raising the bar,"July 14, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/raising-the-bar/,"That’s not the same as raising the average. With the advent of the high jump, the idiom raising the bar became well understood: If you can’t jump over the bar that the current leader cleared, you don’t win. But most of the innovations that change our culture don’t actually increase the simple linear measurements of the bar. They’re more likely to raise the average, to increase the performance of accepted mediocre output. McDonald’s didn’t raise the bar in terms of the best food it was possible to be served in a restaurant, but they made roadside dining faster, cheaper and more reliable. AI doesn’t raise the bar for illustration, copywriting or coding. But it certainly increases the average quality of a high school essay or the cheapest photo retouching or programming services. Autotune can’t compete with Eva Cassidy, but it turned millions of singers into slightly more palatable recording artists. Two traps worth avoiding: The endless cycle of improvement means that every innovation that raises the average creates the conditions for a new sort of excellence. Using these tools, a new standard setter can find a different way forward and create a different way to raise the bar, one that seems obvious after the fact.  "
313,Remarkable pronouncements,"July 13, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/remarkable-pronouncements/,"The scientific rule of thumb is simple: When you make a bold claim, you need significant research to back it up. Telling us that eating vegetables is healthy can be justified by a fairly simple high school science paper. But if you want to claim that the moon is made of celery and Elmer’s Glue, we’re going to need more than your back-of-the-envelope calculations. Lately, we’re seeing two things begin to take the place of good research when making outrageous claims: Lots of online celebrity. Particularly bold and noxious claims. Being angry or a famous podcaster (or both) doesn’t excuse you from the burden of proof. "
314,My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"July 12, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/my-big-fat-greek-wedding/,"Among the top 500 grossing Hollywood movies of all time, this movie is the most profitable in return on investment. And among all Hollywood movies in the top 1,500 at the box office, Paranormal Activity is far and away the highest return, outperforming almost any investment the stock market has ever offered. The return on investment was over a million percent. The lesson is simple, but ignored by most investors and entrepreneurs: The goal might not be to be the biggest. The goal might be to achieve your goals. "
315,Sanding off all the edges,"July 11, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/sanding-off-all-the-edges/,"It’s easier than ever. Solvents, power tools, market research, AI, committee meetings, online reviews and ennui are all aligned in one direction. To fit all the way in.  Of course, once you sand off all the edges, it’s hard to get traction. Hard to find the texture or anything worth talking about. Smooth might not be the goal. "

317,Discernment in creativity,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/discernment-in-creativity/,"The hard part isn’t good ideas. It never has been. The hard part is choosing. Ask GPT for ten subtitles for your book, or sixteen ways to hold a surprise party, and you’ll be delighted at how useful they are. Ask Dreamstudio or Kittl for some logo designs, same thing. There is creativity in discernment. AI and templates have made it easier than ever to find pretty good ideas. It doesn’t matter so much. The hard parts have always been the guts to choose and the will to put in the effort to bring your choice to the people who need it. “I don’t have any good ideas,” is a cop out. "
318,Is it a skill?,"July 9, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/is-it-a-skill/,"If so, it might be worth learning. If so, it might pay to let someone who has learned it take care of it. Coding is a skill. But it’s not clear that the person who knows how to code should be doing your design. Teaching is a skill. But simply because someone is good at a craft doesn’t mean that they know how to teach it. Copywriting is a skill. Having access to the Mailchimp password doesn’t make you a skilled copywriter. Selling is a skill. The person who owns the organization or cares about the charity might not be the best person to go on the sales call. Proximity is not the same as skill. "
319,Sufficient resolution,"July 8, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/sufficient-resolution/,"Robert Johnson is known as the king of the Delta blues. One reason is that his small output was brilliant. The other, bigger reason is that the recordings that remain of his short life are among the earliest that sound good… most audio recordings from before 1936 sound antique and scratchy. The Wizard of Oz is one of our great movies, and one of the oldest that people regularly watch today. One reason is that the production values of 1939 were just good enough to still feel professional today. The movies from just a few years earlier are jumpy, faded relics. People can happily read a first-edition Agatha Christie mystery, but a book from 1700 is rarely read in the same way. No one wants to see websites that were built in Geocities or pages from Prodigy today. But a blog like this one is still readable and fresh, even though it has a design that’s nearly a decade old. When a medium hits sufficient resolution, future advances are nice, but they’re not essential. And once an industry realizes this, future investments in resolution begin to slow down. Of course, it’s difficult to tell if the resolution is sufficient until after the fact. Right here, right now, we’re discovering a wide range of content that has a resolution that is crossing the line to sufficient. That’s going to lock in new forms of interaction and culture for a long time to come. "
320,Small doses,"July 7, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/small-doses/,"If you go to a health food store and buy some pills with selenium, colloidal silver or other mysterious substances in them, it’s possible that they’ll make you feel a bit better. On the other hand, if you take a large dose, you’ll get sick or possibly die. In very small doses, all you’re getting is the placebo. The way the story makes you feel. When there’s a substantial amount of cellular material, though, toxicity can result. Small doses magnify powerful placebo effects. Lowering your prices by 25% might make your customers happier. But spending 4% of your revenue on training, recruitment and giving your staff the freedom to act with humanity might make them far happier. The brute force technique makes engineers happy. But giving humans a chance to tell themselves a positive story makes people happy. "
321,Customer traction is the hard part,"July 6, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/customer-traction-is-the-hard-part/,"A new business is complicated. It involves weaving together suppliers, partners, customers, processes, technology, leases, employees, logos, capital and more. Along the way, it’s easy to get distracted, but focusing on the hard parts is a useful way to move forward. You could work hard on the logo, or double your supplier roster or, as I did once, spend time with your corporate lawyers brainstorming the way to make your terms of service more interesting. There are endless tasks to be done in starting a new venture. But most of the tasks are necessary but insufficient. You can’t begin without them, but by themselves, they won’t create enough impact for your work to make a change happen. And every new project must create change, or else it fails. We spend our time focusing on the tasks because the tasks are known and do-able. It’s a form of hiding. Worth noting: The hard part isn’t the thing that costs you the most money. If you can outsource the work to an expert and get that work done effectively, it’s not hard. It’s just expensive. You don’t need to build your own email server, you can rent one. And if you want to become a book publisher, it turns out that printing, typesetting, copyediting, legal work and the rest aren’t actually hard. There are people who are eager to do that for you. The hard part involves customer traction. Can you find enough customers who will pay you a fair price and also choose to spread the word? Because if customers bring you customers, and those customers all generate more income than expenses, you have a useful project.  Every minute the founder spends not working on this question might be misallocated. "
322,Throwing shade or throwing light?,"July 5, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/throwing-shade-or-throwing-light/,"One takes a little more effort than the other. While throwing shade might be more fun, it eventually runs out of energy. It’s designed to end conversations, not start them, to intimidate, not encourage. Turning on lights helps everyone. "
323,Are we cannibals?,"July 4, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/we-are-cannibals/,"Part of the challenge of hanging out with cannibals is that it’s very difficult to get a good night’s sleep. The math of finding a group of people that cares about community is pretty compelling. While individual selfish choices might feel productive in the moment, if they undermine the health of the community, they’re ultimately self-defeating. Culture is the antidote. The way things are around here. The focus on a longer-term connection, with mutual benefits. As our world has gotten more crowded and more connected, it’s easier than ever to step on someone’s toes. Culture gives us the chance to create the conditions for people to embrace a longer-term view. And sleep better too. Everyone is downstream from someone else. "

Everything is imported, and they spend a lot of time and money earning the premium they charge for an authentic Italian shopping experience. And then a lazy brand manager decided to plaster “Sale-A-Bration” signs all over their windows. Is there anything less Italian than that? Or perhaps it’s the front desk person who can’t be bothered to bring the extra energy that the architect, real estate professionals and builders brought to the hotel you just opened. Or the paralyzed UI group in the software department who undermined the work of the new car’s designers. Or the fearful security people at the bank who belie the hard work you’re doing on customer service by creating herculean barriers between your customers and the transactions they seek to execute. In every case, people are just doing what the boss permits/encourages. Ultimately, the brand is the story we tell, and sooner or later, it’s up to the person who did something that touched the customer. "
326,Actionable feedback,"July 1, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/07/actionable-feedback/,"“Do you want to know what I think?” The best answer might be, “no.” Because this person is not very good at offering useful feedback. Because you didn’t create this product or service or performance to please this person. They’re not the customer. Because you’re not going to revise this any time soon. The movie is made, and specific feedback isn’t going to get the movie remade. Just because criticism is on offer doesn’t mean you have to seek it out or even listen to it. "
327,“And” fatigue,"June 30, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/and-fatigue/,"Digital abundance creates a new problem. Most of our lives are filled with “or” decisions. You can have this or that. You can save money for the big party or you can go out for lunch. You can have exactly one thing for dessert–cake or fruit. But the war for our attention has given us more than a million things to watch on YouTube, another million songs to listen to on Qobuz, and unlimited bingeing (which didn’t even use to be a word) on dozens of streaming channels. No or. Simply and. This means that choices have fewer consequences. It means that time counts for less, it simply fades away. And it turns the sharp relief of choice into the borderless fatigue of ‘whatever’. Even when it’s possible to avoid a choice, it may make sense to make one. "
328,The seduction of grad school,"June 29, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/the-seduction-of-grad-school/,"For a certain cohort of high-performing students at famous colleges, graduate school feels irresistible. If you’re good at school, the challenge and offer of law school, med school or a famous business school means you get to do more of what you’re good at. You’re offered a high-status badge, a path to a well-paid job and several years of more school instead of the scary freedom of choice of what happens next. And so, literate and passionate young people talk about their dreams of helping people, running for office, fighting injustice or exploring their passions as entrepreneurs. And grad school is supposed to be the path. The problem is that these graduate schools aren’t optimized for any of those things. Leaving medical school with a pile of debt and your twenties mostly gone pushes you to sign up for the doctor track, which is increasingly about systems and forms, not actually engaging with patients. Law students who came in with dreams of social justice often postpone these dreams for decades as they work for big money at big firms for long hours… You get the idea. If you want to sit with someone and help them, a career as an occupational or physical therapist is certainly more hands on and direct. If you want to make a difference by writing or arguing, three years of law school and a bar exam aren’t the most leveraged ways to do that. And entrepreneurs need to know a lot, but not what they teach in a typical MBA program. The stratified work of big name investment banks, consultants, law firms and fancy doctoring is increasingly veering away from the actual contributions of people who have an impact that they can measure and be proud of. If that sort of work is for you, go for it. But do it with intent. If not, then perhaps it makes sense to start on the work right this minute. Not with a full certification or permit, but simply creating the sort of change you seek to make, in small steps, right now. "
329,Portfolio theory,"June 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/portfolio-theory/,"One show can make Netflix’s year. One stock can make the numbers for an investor. One player can drive a team to victory. The key is, “I’m not sure which one it’s going to be, but it’s going to be one of these.” The challenge with falling in love with the potential of just one egg is that we often end up making the entire basket the same. That’s no longer a portfolio, it’s one bet over and over again. The best portfolios have elements you’re pretty sure are wrong. They often end up being right. "
330,Reality as reassurance,"June 27, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/reality-as-reassurance/,"Culture makes it tempting (and easy) to insulate ourselves from reality. Credit card debt is an invisible burden, until it’s not. Ignoring the changes in our climate makes our days easier, but not our years. We can avoid the bank balance, not work on the annual budget and ignore the results of that ad we just ran. It’s tempting because the reality we create for ourselves can provide a sort of shock absorber, allowing us to focus on how we’d like things to be, as opposed to how they are. The reporter of symptoms isn’t the cause of the symptoms, and avoiding the report doesn’t improve your status. This is one of many reasons why entrepreneurs are drawn to the magical thinking that often goes with external funding. After all, if you’re focused on a story that gets you an investment, you can avoid the reality of a P&L, at least for now. The problem with this avoidance is that we’re always concerned about reality butting in when we least expect it. The Ponzi scheme operator is constantly wondering when the plan will go bust. Reality is your enemy. On the other hand, a cash-flow, profitable business doesn’t need to worry about what private investors think. If your blood pressure is okay, you don’t have to avoid going to the doctor to have it checked. "
331,Crispiness,"June 26, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/crispiness/,"Crisp faces many opponents: entropy, laziness, time, compromise and false shortcuts. And fear. Most of all, fear. Things rarely become crispy on their own. Instead, it requires care and effort. An ume shiso hand roll begins with a crisp piece of nori, but within a minute or two, though the ingredients are the same, it becomes soggy instead of tasty. Uniforms, service, linens, insights–they can all be crisp if we care enough. "
332,A finite ordered set of interesting objects,"June 25, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/a-finite-ordered-set-of-interesting-objects/,"The alphabet is one. 26 letters, no more. One order, that’s it. The Beatles are another. John, Paul, George and then Ringo. The Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, The Supremes. The astrological zodiac gets us to twelve, but I’m having a really difficult time finding a memorable set with more than that. When we start talking about trees or stars or even colors, the list isn’t clearly finite. Anatomy or species don’t work either. There’s always one or a hundred more to add. And human lists like saints or countries are hard to put in a memorable order, same with the US states. The Great Lakes are five, the planets are eight. I wonder where we find a list of 30 to 100 items. And no fair picking something in Latin or involving multiple dimensions of advanced math. There must be some sort of human or cultural limit that makes the alphabet a natural exception to our desire for this sort of knowable set. I know this has nothing to do with our regular programming, but I’d love your best riff on this. Here’s a simple form. I’ll publish some of the winners. UPDATE! Here’s what I learned from your generous and thoughtful responses: Thanks all. "

335,The right marketing question,"June 23, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/the-right-marketing-question/,"The wrong question is, “our project isn’t catching on, how do we promote it better?” The right question is a little more nuanced and far more important, “We’re seeking to make a change in part of the world. How do we find the right people and tell them the right (true) story that helps them get to where they’re going–and that they’ll tell to their peers?” It’s worth breaking this down and understanding the components: make a change: Any project that seeks to maintain the status quo is difficult to grow. You’re here to make a change, and being clear about what that is is the first step. the right people: Nothing worth spreading is built to appeal to everyone. So who is your someone? What do they want, fear and believe? How do you shift from being mediocre to being specific? the right (true) story: Marketing is never about the full experience of all the facts, specifications and impacts of your product or service. It’s the story we tell ourselves about it. A story of status, affiliation, of change and fear. If that story is true, then you can continue to build on it over time, and users won’t end up disappointed. that helps them get to where they’re going: It’s very difficult to prove a prospect or customer wrong. Hard to get them to want something they don’t want. The opportunity lies in helping them get what they wanted all along. and finally… that they’ll tell to their peers: Not to everyone, but to people who trust them. Why would they do that? They won’t do it for you, they’ll do it because it raises their status, increases connection or gives them some other form of satisfaction. Promotion might make sense after you’ve got all of this figured out. "
336,Peer support,"June 22, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/peer-support/,"Treasure it when you find it. Offer it when you can. One of the greatest joys of being an author is the other authors. The game theory would indicate that authors are competitors–there are a scarce number of publishers, of bookshelf slots, of readers. But, being the only author in the world wouldn’t just be lonely, it wouldn’t work very well. Books actually sell best next to other books, not in the supermarket. But more than that, peer support comes when people are part of something bigger than themselves. When they see their work as a craft, and a chance to turn on a light or raise a standard. In every field, our best work can feel lonely, because we don’t have a guarantee, a map to follow or a crowd of people sure that it’s going to work. That’s when peer support means the most. And when it contributes to the evolution and forward motion of a field. “Peer” is a job title, and it’s earned. One way to earn it is by finding the others, connecting them and leading them. We spend our lives looking for peers to accept us, but in fact, we have the chance to establish the foundation for our peers to find each other. While most people say that when they’re a stranger in a room, they’d like to be warmly greeted, it’s also true that we hesitate to be the greeter when a new voice arrives. That’s a natural instinct, and worth pushing back against. Organizing your peers feels awkward. Who are you to invite three or four others to a weekly mastermind check in? Who are you to speak up about a new idea that isn’t obvious or easily defended (yet?). Well, if not you, who? Thank you Steve, for the shout out, and more than that, for decades for showing us how it’s done.  "
337,Project management,"June 21, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/project-management/,"A project is a promise. It’s about coordinating unknowable future events to deliver something of value. Showing up on time for a meeting is a project (airlines! traffic! weather!) and so is building a skyscraper. That next podcast you’re going to publish is a project, and so is cooking dinner for guests. There’s always uncertainty because we’re dancing with the future, with random events and often, with other people. And there’s a need for management because left to its own devices, a project isn’t likely to get done on its own. The unpredictable nature of future events means that there will often be unexpected speed bumps. No project manager has a perfect record, because the cost of being completely perfect in the face of unknown is too high. And yet, there’s a huge gap between great project management and simply providing earnest effort. If unexpected events happen to you more than the average expected rate, if you’re often better at finding excuses than a way to avoid needing an excuse, it’s a sign that your next project could benefit from a more intentional approach to shipping great work on time. It’s not a surprise that we’re all pretty unsophisticated at project management. We’re pushed to begin with our very first assignments and creations in first grade, and we make projects, with increasingly higher stakes, all through school. And yet, no one ever teaches us that this is a skill that can be learned and delivered with strategy and technique. The hallmarks of earnest amateurism are: The professional, on the other hand, invests heavily to be sure that none of these three exciting things happen. And when surprises happen, they expect them, accept them and simply shift to the other route. The most exciting thing about professional project management is that it trades away excitement for systems thinking and intentional action. We make heroes out of people who show up with the last-minute save, but the real work is in not needing the last minute.  And it’s helpful to realize that it’s a skill, a choice, a set of tools to be learned, not something we’re born with. Very few successful organizations feel as though they’ve underinvested in project management. By the time a project is worth doing, it’s worth doing with intent. "
338,Which team?,"June 20, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/none-of-the-above-3/,"Culture seeks shortcuts. The oldest shortcut is: “Friend or foe?” If we know the answer to that, a whole bunch of time gets saved, and fear is reduced as well. The labeling goes beyond which team, cadre, tribe or village someone is part of. It extends to the ways we demonstrate which box we’ve chosen–fashion, pro sports, even the tech we use or how we speak. The search for safe shortcuts becomes an end to itself. And then it can get toxic. When we start dividing people by race or identity, by background or caste, we end up losing dignity and nuance for the false shortcut of putting someone into a box. But in our quest to put everyone in a box, we leave a lot behind. We ignore the chance to interact with someone who can teach us something. We sacrifice the benefit of the doubt in exchange for what feels like security. And we take away the humanity of people who don’t make it easy for us to find a niche for them. Pigeonholes are best for pigeons. PS my new LinkedIn course is free this week. "
339,Can’t wait,"June 19, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/cant-wait/,"The urgent problem might actually benefit from a short cooling-off period. But important challenges can’t wait. Today is a good day to remember that better is possible, and that we shouldn’t wait for the problem to become easy or fade away.  Better begins with each of us, but it evaporates when we settle for less. Settling is rarely intentional, instead, it happens when we focus on other things. "
340,Finding agency,"June 18, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/finding-agency/,"The first few moves of a chess game give the player almost unlimited freedom. There are countless legal moves, and nothing to constrain the choices that a player makes among them. But as we add leverage to our culture and our organizations, the choices aren’t as easy. Jerry Garcia couldn’t easily change the Grateful Dead’s touring regime, even if he wanted to. With a payroll of nearly 100 people, the organization needed to be on the road, playing ever bigger venues, to keep the machine moving. The same feels true for countless situations involving countries, organizations (big and small) and even individuals in a system. The high school principal might be in charge of the school, but their degrees of freedom aren’t unlimited. And one reason is that freedom and agency aren’t the same thing. Freedom of choice implies that the repercussions of any given choice are mild. Freedom without responsibility feels like the goal. But in fact, agency with leverage only works because it’s so difficult and comes with so much responsibility. The struggling small business owner can shut down a division, sell an asset or part ways with a partner. It’s not easy, it feels painful and fraught, but it’s still possible. The easiest option is to imagine that we have no difficult options. We often do. "
341,Living in hyperbole,"June 17, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/living-in-hyperbole/,"In the pre-media world, we bumped into fables, or news from across the village, but mostly, our role models and experiences were based on reality. Now, when it’s not unusual to spend eight hours a day surrounded by media fueled by greatest hits (worst offender, breaking news, richest investor, evillest husband, funniest line of all the movies ever made) we start to imagine that only hyperbole matters. Greatest hits, by their nature, are unusual. And if the media you’re absorbing is selected from a billion possible clips, don’t be surprised if you start to believe that the unusual is normal. It’s not. "
342,The lens or the problem?,"June 16, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/the-lens-or-the-problem/,"We often see problems through the lens that we’re used to using. The banker sees a solution around money, the activist might see an opportunity for social justice. The technologist figures that a computer and more data might help, and the bureaucrat is looking for a system to put into place. If a lens is working, that’s terrific. If it’s not, perhaps there’s a mismatch between the tool we’re used to and the one that will actually work. Two useful approaches: "
343,The A.R.E. skills matter more than ever,"June 15, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/the-a-r-e-skills-matter-more-than-ever/,"Perhaps this is what your team needs from you: Agreeableness is not the same as agreeing. In fact, they have little in common. Finding someone who’s only job is to agree with everything that is said is easy. On the other hand, agreeableness is the skill of having a contrary position and being pleasant about it. It’s the hard work of bringing professional work to people who expected something else–and have them still be pleased about the changes. Agreeableness is a skill and it’s a choice. Being contrary is a form of Resistance, a way to deal with our fear. Receptivity is our openness to better. We’re here to make change happen, and the path forward can’t possibly be perfectly known before we begin. Receptivity combines curiosity, awareness and a desire for improvement. The receptive person asks good questions and says ‘thank you’ to useful feedback. Enthusiasm connects the two, and it’s contagious. When the auditorium is half empty, with folks sitting in the back row with their laptops open, hesitant to ask questions–do you expect that the professor or speaker is going to do their best work? What happens in the hallways or the Zoom room is often a direct result of how much enthusiasm we choose to bring to the interaction. "
344,This time it’s personal,"June 14, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/this-time-its-personal/,"My new book is urgent and it’s personal. Some readers have told me that it’s also their favorite. It opens the door to a better way to work and to find meaning in how we spend our days. I’ve done dozens of podcasts talking about it, but when I talk about it, it’s not nearly as important as when you talk about it. That’s the only way our culture changes. We spend 90,000 hours of our lives at work. And we’re at a crossroads. A fork in the road created by AI, tech, outsourcing and the brutality of the end of the regime of industrial capitalism. It’s worth talking about. Thanks for leading. "
345,What sort of bicycle?,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/what-sort-of-bicycle/,"While it’s likely that you own a bike, you probably don’t have a front-wheel recumbent bicycle in your garage. Even though it’s more efficient, more comfortable and often faster. How did that happen? In 1933, a twenty-year old speed record was broken by a racer on a recumbent bike. Concerned, the leading manufacturers of upright bikes went to the UCI and persuaded them to ban recumbent bikes from competition. Nearly a hundred years later, the ban continues. Of course, most of us will never race in a sanctioned UCI bicycle race. But, the fastest bicyclists are the ones that spend the most time and money on their bikes. They’re surrounded by a circle of other bicyclists that would like to be the fastest. And they’re surrounded by an even larger circle that is inspired by them. And so the status roles are set, and thus affiliation roles as well. And then systems are built and technology platforms are reinforced and it becomes simpler and easier and more convenient to buy and sell the regular kind. All because of one race 90 years ago. Consider what happens when one person (now lost to the clouds of time) decides to alter an algorithm at YouTube. That simple tweak starts to deliver more profitable results, and so others build around that change, codifying into code something that might not be in the long-term interests of users or creators.  Now that it’s built in, it changes what gets produced and that changes what gets watched. The office that 5,000 people commute to every day is there because forty years ago, someone thought that it would be nice to work near home, and that four-person office is now a megaplex.  We cut the tails off of some dog breeds because thousands of years ago, someone mistakenly thought they prevented disease. But then it became a signal of adherence or status, and the system persists. Little decisions compound and then anchor systems. Our commitment to defending sunk costs keeps those systems long after they’re no longer serving a purpose. Until, one day, we look at our bicycle and wonder, “how did I end up here?” "
346,The seduction of compliance,"June 13, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/the-seduction-of-compliance/,"We can tell from the words. “I’m just doing my job.” “Will this be on the test?” “Don’t blame me.” “It’s what everyone else is wearing.” Keep your head down, do what you’re told, don’t stick your neck out, and most of all, pay attention to what everyone else is doing. All of this comes from somewhere. From individuals and organizations that benefit from our compliance. The alternative isn’t freedom. It’s responsibility. The responsibility to show up, to care a bit more, to raise your hand and to make a difference. Compliance is seductive because it comes with short-term prizes. If you fit in all the way, it might feel a bit less frightening. The center of the herd may in fact be safer, but the view is terrible. We don’t spend nearly enough time celebrating responsibility. Our niche in the hierarchy is actually irrelevant, particularly for those you helped today. What matters is our willingness to see what’s happening and to sign up to do something about it. It begins with figuring out just who is pushing so hard for you to comply. "
347,Inconvenient!,"June 12, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/inconvenient/,"That’s great news. The thing you need, the road ahead, the element that will transform your project–it appears to be inconvenient. That’s terrific, because it means that most other people can’t be bothered. It’s valuable because the very inconvenience of it makes it scarce. The stuff that matters is almost always inconvenient. If it’s not, you might be mistaken about what matters. "
348,Brakes and acceleration,"June 11, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/brakes-and-acceleration/,"Every driver benefits from good brakes. It makes driving safer. Only a few skilled drivers benefit from better acceleration. Our habit is to compare top speed, horsepower, short-term returns and status. In every field, not just cars. But it probably pays to make sure that there good brakes too. "
349,Too much competition,"June 10, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/too-much-competition/,"There are two approaches: Broaden your offerings, make them easier, cheaper and more available. Dumb them down and race to the bottom.

350,The simple word replacement for connection,"June 10, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/the-simple-word-replacement-for-connection/,"What do we say when a customer or colleague says, “thank you”? For a long time, it was “you’re welcome.” This indicates that you put in some effort and you’re willing to do it again on request. Recently “no problem” has become more common. This implies that the effort could have been a huge hassle, but this time, it was okay. For people who are choosing to do the work of hospitality and connection, though, the most accurate answer might be, “my pleasure.” After all, you had a choice, and you chose to do this work precisely so that it could have an impact on someone else. The story we tell ourselves about the work can be fuel for finding ways to do it better. If it’s not a pleasure, and you’re doing things like this all day, it might be a good time to find something else to do. Horst Schulze promoted this idea at the Ritz Carlton, but it works just about everywhere. "
351,Doing presentations virtually,"June 9, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/doing-presentations-virtually/,"A few years ago, I posted about the hardware setup you can use to look better and feel better when working in a distributed organization. Since then, I’ve tried many hacks for how to integrate Keynote presentations into this environment. I used some fancy software that was heartbreakingly disappointing and then figured out a much better solution, from a much more responsive company, using a little-known technique in Ecamm Live. All the details of how it’s done are here. In short: you can create and control a Keynote presentation with a green screen built in so your face shows through–one screen for you and your slides that is easy to control and not awkward the way screen sharing is. (Keynote now also lets you embed your camera in the slides directly, but the quality isn’t as good). Have fun. I hope this helps. Life’s too short for ugly presentations. "
352,The catfight and the construction site,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/the-catfight-and-the-construction-site/,"We’re quick to stop to see the car wreck, the billionaire having a meltdown, or the professional wrestlers pretending to be political leaders. But it often seems more difficult to take a moment to watch people building something that matters instead. We’ll probably spend billions of dollars and millions of hours transfixed by media coverage of one disaster after another this year. What would happen if we watched Bryan Stevenson, Nazanin Ash, or Jim Killoran build something instead? Not just watched, but actually helped? What sells is drama, conflict, and emergencies. So that’s what we get. What if we spent our attention on a different thing? What if we built something better? It’s easy to imagine that culture is immutable and that we have no choice but to pander for attention. But in fact, the culture keeps changing, and when we shift what we make and change what we pay attention to, the culture follows. "
353,Cheaper than that,"June 8, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/cheaper-than-that/,"The race to the bottom has been won. Anything cheaper than what’s on offer is a waste of the customer’s money, because it won’t get the job done. Once we’ve cut every corner, all that’s left is the brutality of less. One slogan is: You’ll pay less than you should have, and waste it all. An alternative is: You’ll pay more than you hoped but get more than you paid for. The problem with the race to the bottom is that you might win. "
354,Bought or sold?,"June 7, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/bought-or-sold/,"Most things that consumers acquire are bought, not sold. We decide we’re interested in something and we go shopping to get it. Potato chips, wedding venues and cars are all purchased by people who set out to get them. Selling is a special sort of marketing. It’s interactive, generous and personal. Selling brings individual attention, connection and tension to each customer. And selling takes time, effort and money. Many companies believe they have a new product that will sell itself from the first day. But that’s unlikely. We shouldn’t disrespect selling by pretending we don’t need it. "
355,Falling behind,"June 6, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/falling-behind/,"We’re not in races very often. Usually, what we’re doing is more like a walkathon, or perhaps, a hike. And yet, we’ve been pushed to believe that the only performance that matters is a scarcity-based victory. They close the parkway near my house on Sundays. As people pedal along, you can see the ripple of anxiety that spreads when a fast biker ends up passing everyone else.  The route is a loop. No one is getting anywhere you’re not getting. They’re just leaving this place faster. "
356,Avoid false proxies,"June 5, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/avoid-false-proxies/,"They’re toxic, wasteful and a tempting trap. It’s one of the most important topics in my new book. (And here’s a new podcast on it). We need proxies. You’re not allowed to read the book before you buy it or taste the ketchup before you leave the store. We rely on labels and cultural cues to give us a hint about what to expect. We do judge a book (and a condiment) by its cover, all the time. And hiring and managing people is far more important and risky than buying ketchup. So we look for proxies that may give us a clue as to how someone will ultimately contribute to our project. False proxies include: Height, race, gender, attractiveness, charisma in meetings, famous college, etc. It’s easy to imagine that we don’t fall prey to these irrelevant signals, but a quick look at the height of elected officials makes it clear that we do–we keep picking the tall ones. When building the Oakland A’s into a championship contender, Billy Beane discovered that every other team was using these sorts of proxies to scout who would be worth drafting. By finding an actual proxy, a useful one, he was able to assemble a skilled team on a budget. Just because someone interviews well, is friendly, or looks like you doesn’t mean that they can do the work that needs to be done. Now that we can measure so many things, we might as well put that to use. Attitude and skill are useful proxies, while the easy-to-measure stuff is simply an expensive and hurtful distraction. "
357,Volition and placebos,"June 4, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/volition-and-placebos/,"If a placebo heals your illness, does that mean it was all in your head in the first place? That you weren’t really sick, or didn’t really want to get better? If expensive wine tastes better to you, but you can’t tell wine apart in a double-blind taste test, does that mean it doesn’t really taste better to you, or that you have shallow tastes? Can luxury goods, spiritual practices or a change in the weather change our situation? Knee surgery works for some people, and those people, apparently, had an actual injury and the surgery fixed it. And yet, sham knee surgery (in which the patient is sedated, cut and stitched, but no internal changes occur) is just as effective as ‘actual’ knee surgery for certain physical ailments. Does that mean that those ailments weren’t real, or that the patient was not trying hard enough to get well? Along the way, we’ve persuaded ourselves and others that our brains don’t matter so much, and that the stories in our lives are not nearly as important as the molecules. And yet, every time we look closely, the opposite appears to be true. Stories are a balm. And our brains are powerful, though not always (or even often) under our conscious control. “It’s all in your head.” Where else would it be? "
358,Productive assets and useful flows,"June 3, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/productive-assets-and-useful-flows/,"Assets are ownable. They are devices, skills, connections or properties that allow us to amplify our effort and do our work with more impact. A drill press is an asset, so is your law degree. The permission you have to talk with your customers, the benefit of the doubt you get from your patients and the freedom to expand into a new territory are all assets. A movie studio owns volcano.com, decades after the movie was made. It’s an asset, a wasting one. The projects we do create flows. We put in time or effort or cash, and something comes back. When the effort and resources we put in are rewarded with at least as much return as we expected, the flow is positive. It was worth the effort. The next steps in figuring out our strategy (whether you’re a freelancer, a spiritual leader or a CEO) are: Make a list of the assets. Put them in order of value to you and value to others. Are there some assets you’re hoarding that are going to waste? Some that might be worth selling or walking away from? Are there assets that will respond well to an investment of money, effort or learning? Get really smart about the flows. Are you defending sunk costs, sticking with projects simply because that’s easier than leaving them behind? Which flows could be improved with focus and effort? Hard choices today often lead to good outcomes later, and while today is real, we spend almost all of our lives living in later. "
359,Consider the WordWindow,"June 2, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/consider-the-wordwindow/,"Computer adventure games were possible in the 1980s because of a bit of code called a ‘parser’. You could type, “pick up the axe” and the computer would understand the phrase and follow your commands. In italics, because it didn’t understand anything, it simply broke your sentences into bits and changed the state of your inventory accordingly. When faced with a parser, even a primitive one, many people did that homunculus thing and decided that the computer could understand every single thing you might type, like, “I’m thinking that having an axe in my inventory would be helpful,” or even, “let me tell you about my cousin…” My first gig, at Spinnaker, was leading the team that built the original generation of illustrated computer adventure games (I got to work with Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury, which is a great story). We discovered early on that the parser was magical but not nearly as powerful as people hoped. Sounds a bit like LLM and ChatGPT, forty years later. The solution was to offer a convenient and simple approach, which is almost always the solution to a problem of confusion. We created the WordWindow™ button. The gratuitous trademark symbol made it more powerful, apparently. When you clicked that button, it gave you a list of the 25 most common or useful things you could type. I think this is going to be a powerful bridge even now. For example, a “Summarize” button is going to lean into ChatGPT’s strengths, but it’s not something people might immediately jump to. Broadening this concept, whenever you find the folks you seek to serve appear to be hesitating or confused, consider offering them a multiple choice option. Menus work. Even when we’re not at a restaurant. "

You can find them all at seths.store. I went to Brooklyn and worked with Dan at the Arm to create a set of five handmade letterpress posters. They’re 12 inches square, available framed or unframed, and all sales directly benefit Newborns in Need. It’s hard to describe just how magical paper and ink can feel in the hands of a pro. They’re each signed on the back, limited to 100 each. Many thanks to my friends at Scribe for making all of the fulfillment possible. Next up are a pair of durable, soft, handmade t-shirts that capture some of the energy of the book. They’ll look better on you, promise. Made by the Cotton Bureau, all profits go to BuildOn. And then there’s the legendary bee mug, made by independent craftspeople working with Bread and Badger in the Pacific Northwest. I can confirm that tea tastes significantly better in these mugs, with or without honey. Book launches are always fraught, but now it’s the book’s job to spark and amplify the conversations that make change happen. Thank you for your support and for caring enough to make a difference.

361,The 77% threshold,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/06/the-77-threshold/,"When the gas car was first introduced, it couldn’t compete with horses. After all, we’d had thousands of years to optimize our systems around horseback, and this new technology was still nascent. Roads were rare, gas stations were scarce and the cars themselves were unreliable. The same thing happened again when electric cars made a comeback a hundred years later. At first, they had limited range, limited space, low acceleration and charging was a hassle. When a new technology arrives, it is almost always at a systemic disadvantage. If we wait until the new thing is better than the old thing, we’re taking a big risk. That’s because we have competitors who will spend the time to learn the new tech, and more importantly, build systems around it. They will gain customers you may have trouble getting back. They have a head start that can last a generation. Herbie Hancock started experimenting with electronic instruments a decade before many of his peers. That enabled him to create not one but two of the most successful jazz singles of all time. If the local landscaping contractor sneers at electric weed whackers and leaf blowers because they’re not quite as cost-effective in the short run, they’ll probably lose some customers, and won’t develop what they need to know when the technology and systems catch up. And the new systems will catch up. The same goes for media companies that are defending a model of expensive content that’s ad-supported, refusing to consider that it might not last. How much longer will Vogue matter?  When there’s an iterative cycle of new technology, the systems can’t help but improve, and the tech is likely to as well.  When a new tech or system is 50% as effective as the old one, it’s our job to learn it and understand it. And when it hits 77%, we ought to consider creating a new division, a new product line or a new approach that adopts it. By the time it catches up, we’re either part of it or we’re too late. "
362,Who cares?,"May 31, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/who-cares-4/,"A question we don’t ask ourselves very often, but a choice we make every day. It’s tempting to not care. If you choose to not care, you’re off the hook. It’s simply to do as little as possible, avoid too much trouble, ask if it will be on the test, try to stay off the hook, so what… On the other hand, caring can lead to heartbreak. Caring is the chance to make a difference, to actually be involved in what happens next. Caring puts us on the hook and caring offers a chance to contribute. When we care, we get to make a difference, and that creates meaning, the path to significance. "
363,The spark,"May 30, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/the-spark/,"No matter how big your backpack is, you can’t carry a bonfire with you when you go on a camping trip. A match is sufficient. Conversations are like that. Conversations are the tools that change our culture. Someone who cares talking with and teaching and learning from someone who was ready to engage. My new book is out today. It’s the most urgent, most personal and most timely book of my career. A few people will raise their hands and go first. They’ll engage in the conversation I’m hoping we’ll have about industrialism, humanity, false proxies, connection, dignity, productivity, connection and imagination.

But it’s unlikely that what you want is what everyone wants. It’s hard to believe that there is only one appropriate standard for value, observance, speed or performance.  The easiest way for us to help you is to not waste time arguing about whether you’ve uncovered a natural law that we’ve been ignoring and instead, let’s simply find out what you want. “I like it when…” is so much more productive than, “everyone wants…” "
365,On reading it in a book,"May 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/on-reading-it-in-a-book/,"Mike Schur, co-creator of Parks and Recreation, said of his career, “This is not stuff you can read in a book,” he said. “This is stuff that you have to experience.” I think it’s also useful to flip it around. There are things you will have trouble experiencing until you read them in a book. A useful non-fiction book is a map, not the territory. It’s a chance to safely experience what might be, to experience it before it happens. And a book makes it easy to talk about what you’re doing. It gives you the structure and the words to explain to someone else why they might want to come along with you on the journey. "

367,Survivor bias and the mistake of stability,"May 26, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/survivor-bias-and-the-mistake-of-stability/,"An asteroid has never destroyed the Earth, therefore an asteroid never will. This brand has been involved in scandals before, and it has always come back stronger, so there’s nothing to worry about. There have been technology changes before, but we’ve always managed to find clients for what we do. Survivor bias is the trap of only considering the successful entries when thinking about risk. For example, if you look at the performance of mutual funds after ten years, most of them seem to do pretty well. But that’s partly because the ones that did really poorly didn’t make it to ten years. We are lucky enough to live on a planet that hasn’t been destroyed by an asteroid. But that doesn’t mean that other planets haven’t had their life forms extinguished–we’re simply unaware of them. Past performance is no guarantee of the future. Sorry. We should plan accordingly. "
368,The first person,"May 25, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/the-first-person/,"“I” is first person. “You” is second person. “She” “They” “It” are all third person. So far, so good. But how can ChatGPT use the word “I”? And when we talk about ChatGPT, is it “he” or “she” or “they” or “it”? Because anything that is an “it” shouldn’t be able to say “I”. We probably need a form of “it” that can be used by ChatGPT when it is talking about itself or on its behalf. Because “I” brings emotional and intellectual weight that confuses or deceives us. As Kevin points out, the regulation to lead to this fix is really simple and easy to implement. When I say “we” I think we know what I mean. But when ChatGPT or other LLMs say “I”, what is being communicated here? When we built the bot for this blog, I insisted that the bot not say “I.” Because it’s not me. It’s a bot. Inventing new rules for how language works is fraught and regularly fails. But it’s only been a few months, and it sure seems like we’re getting comfortable with not distinguishing between text from a person and text from “it.” It might be as simple as IT, with the second t being capitalized. Or ix, which is fun to say and will help my Scrabble game… Just because the computer says “I” doesn’t mean that we’re not interacting with a computer. The uncanny valley is real and perilous. "

371,Stevie and Marvin,"May 23, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/stevie-and-marvin-2/,"When Marvin Gaye joined Motown, he went with his strengths. He wanted to work only in the studio. He hated touring and was sure he lacked the charisma and other gifts that made some musicians great onstage. This didn’t really fit the label’s strengths, and he struggled to find his footing. In 1962, Berry Gordy sent Gaye on tour with other Motown acts. While Gaye wasn’t naturally a performer, he was competitive. The tour managers discovered that if they put Little Stevie Wonder on just before Gaye, something extraordinary happened. Wonder was a crowd pleaser, a magician at getting fans excited. After a few shows, Gaye realized that he had to dramatically raise his on-stage game if he was going to be able to keep his gig. Two days after the tour ended, Gaye was in the studio recording what became his first Top 40 hit. He became known as much for his live performances as his music. His charisma was a skill, not something he was born with. It’s up to us if we want it to be. "
372,Compounding head starts,"May 22, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/compounding-head-starts/,"When a six-year-old kid beats the other kids at tennis, that kid is more likely to be encouraged to play more, or to get a coach, and pretty soon, they’re much better at tennis than the others. When a musical group has a single that gets some buzz on Spotify, they’re more likely to be able to find a producer or even a label. When a candidate polls well early in a race, they’re more likely to get donations, attract consultants, run ads and not be encouraged to drop out… There are clearly scarcity-based competitions in our culture that reward early success. Acknowledging this (however unfair or suboptimal it is as a sorting mechanism) leads us to two very different sets of tactics: One alternative is to dramatically overinvest and overprepare for your debut. If early head starts are rewarded, be sure you have one. This can even involve entering school a year later, or running for dog catcher instead of the senate. The other is to acknowledge that even though head starts are sort of random and often reward the wrong folks, you’re going to ignore them. Make sure you have the resources and resolve to develop your following and your skills regardless of how well you do in the first interactions. Day by day and drip by drip. Most people try to do both, and doing both almost guarantees you’ll burn out. "
373,Which sort of sinecure?,"May 21, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/which-sort-of-sinecure/,"Sooner or later, we find a place to hide. A place of security or sustenance. A place of safety. That sort of foundation can give us peace of mind and open the door to possibility. But, it’s possible that we can turn it into a trap as well. A situation so perfectly created that we’re stuck. Stuck without forward motion, stuck with a narrative of insufficiency or suffering. The places we inhabit are external, for sure, based on how the world treats us. But they’re often internally driven as well, a story that felt comfortable for a while. But if that story has created a stable place of ennui, dread or dissatisfaction, it might pay to find someone who can help us see that it’s possible to move on. "

More joy. The climate movement doesn’t have to be about asking individuals to bear the burden of systemic problems. It’s not about living with less.  It’s about demanding more.  From your employer, your community, your local government, your country.  The more we ask for change at the top, the more we work to change our systems, the more likely we are to get it.   "
375,Our homunculus is showing,"May 19, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/our-homunculus-is-showing/,"The little person at the control panel, the one who sees what the retina produces, the one who decides, the one who speaks up… (This is the dualist solution to the free will problem–yes, I have a physical body, they say, but I also have a little human inside of me that gets to make free decisions separate from that…) Anthropomorphism is a powerful tool. When we encounter something complex, we imagine that, like us, it has a little person at the controls, someone who, if we were at the control panel, would do what we do. A tiger or a lion isn’t a person, but we try to predict their behavior by imagining that they have a little person (perhaps more feline, more wild and less ‘smart’ than us) at the controls. Our experience of life on Earth is a series of narratives about the little people inside of everyone we encounter. Artificial intelligence is a problem, then, because we can see the code and thus proof that there’s no little person inside. So when computers beat us at chess, we said, “that’s not artificial intelligence, that’s simply dumb code that can solve a problem.” And we did the same thing when computers started to “compose” music or “draw” images. The quotes are important, because the computer couldn’t possibly have a little person inside. And now, LLM and things like ChatGPT turn this all upside down. Because it’s essentially impossible, even for AI researchers, to work with these tools without imagining the little person inside. The insight that might be helpful is this: We don’t have a little person inside of us. None of us do. We’re simply code, all the way down, just like ChatGPT. It’s not that we’re now discovering a new sort of magic. It’s that the old sort of magic was always an illusion. "

Three ways to spell the key word: Peak interest can’t get any higher. It never happens at launch. It’s the result of cultural change and an idea moving through the population. Peek interest happens when there’s scarcity of information and we’re offered a glimpse. And piqued interest is the result of tension. Something that isn’t as we expected. Perhaps it’s imminent, overdue or merely curious… You almost never get all three at the same time. That’s okay, as long as we plan for it. "

But if everyone in the community takes an idea, that idea goes up in value. The best marketing advice I have for someone writing a book is simple: Write a book that people want to share with others. And then make it easy for them to do so. That’s such a simple concept, and yet it’s overlooked in one media sector after another. If you want to build a vibrant non-profit, create one where your donors do the fundraising. If you want a hit TV show, write one that your viewers want to talk about with friends. And if you want your software to be effective, embrace the network effect so that it works better for all users when your users bring in new users. The five-pack is one way I’ve discovered to amplify this horizontal spread. My new book comes in a discounted set of five, with 25 free limited-edition booklets included. Each generous leader ends up with 4 extra books and 25 booklets to give away. Of course, not everyone will choose to share an idea. But some people thrive on being nodes in the network, improving the systems that are in close proximity. When they have an efficient, leveraged tool to spread an idea, they’re more likely to do so. People don’t share a concept because it helps the creator of the idea. They do it because it helps them. When they’re surrounded by people listening to the same music, talking about the same issues or doing work in a complementary way, things get better. "

But at work, while they might be essential, they may not be important. At least, not important enough for us to spend a lot of focus on. Chores are: The bills have to get paid. But they might not have to be paid by you. Entrepreneurs, artists and freelancers often spend a lot of time on chores. We justify this because outsourcing chores to others costs money, and in this moment, money is tight. But that’s not the real story. The truth is that if we stop doing chores, we have to do real work instead. The things that aren’t repeatable or proven. The things that are emotionally difficult, creatively challenging or simply requiring exploration and guts to pursue. If we succeed at this work, there will be plenty of money to pay to get the chores done. Doing chores cheerfully and with skill is a fine hobby. But it might not be what you need to do right now. "

Some go to the opera or a blues club or expose themselves to culture that isn’t an easy fit, because they know it makes them more useful, more interesting or simply more alive. I think we’ve long passed the point where an active professional can simply choose to not understand how tech works. You’re a user or you’re being used. Best to know which. "
383,Useful assumptions for teachers,"May 11, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/useful-assumptions-for-teachers/,"Not simply in the classroom, but anywhere we hope to inform, inspire or educate: Assume enrollment. Either someone is committed to learning or they’re not. While many situations place people into a spot where they are compelled to show up (exhibit A: learning arithmetic in grade school), it’s almost impossible to teach well if people don’t care. If folks aren’t enrolled, then the first job is to change that. If you’re worried that they’ll click away or drift off, it’s difficult to do good work.  Assume good intent. This is a cousin of enrollment. If you’re worried that someone is going to use an AI to write an essay, it’s easy to spend all your time building walls instead of bridges. Assume fear. Learning creates change, and change is scary. In addition, we’re briefly incompetent just before we understand… we know that something can be done, but we don’t know how to do it (yet). When in doubt, look for the fear. Assume a lack of context. The reason you ‘know’ something is because you know it. You understand what came before, what’s next to it, how it works, what the language of your field is (both words and concepts). If you’re teaching something new, you can’t be sure that’s true for them. More time on context and less time on tips and bullet points creates the conditions for understanding. Assume connection. Some would like to believe that learning can be done alone, in a tower, with a laptop. But in fact, until we interact with other people or systems, all we’ve done is absorb, we haven’t yet understood. "
384,Skipping the good days,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/skipping-the-good-days/,"Part of the luxury of living near the ocean or the mountains is that you can be picky. If the surf or the powder isn’t great, leave it for the tourists. Good is insufficient, wait for the great moments… When we’re young, or the project is going really well, it’s easy to waste the good days. After all, there will be another one tomorrow. What becomes clear, though, is that good days are precious. When you’re feeling even a little creative, don’t wait. Write it down, roll tape, speak up. When you’re feeling reasonably healthy, go for a walk.  They’re all good days, if we choose. "

If he could keep up with his pacer, he’d finish the run in record time. If you work in an office where people are regularly shipping breakthrough work, it’s likely your work will ship as well. If you’re in an industry or a zip code where entrepreneurs regularly build and fund businesses of scale, it’s more likely you will too. The pacing team isn’t an accident. It’s a choice. Just because it’s slow (or too fast, or too brutal, or too senseless) around here doesn’t mean it has to stay that way. Or that you have to stay around here. "
386,What comes after trust?,"May 9, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/what-comes-after-trust/,"Walk into a bank with a stocking on your head and you’re probably going to get arrested. Civil society as we know it is dependent on identity and responsibility. A person does something and owns the consequences. This requirement of identity leads to the dynamic of the free market that we call trust. Even companies, which aren’t people but lately have been given many of their privileges, occasionally have to pay the price for abusing our trust. But what happens when the email, the essay, the voice, the interactions–aren’t from a person, but from a swarm of bots? Is that really Donny Osmond singing us Happy Birthday or a clever AI construction? [On the other hand, people are really making good use of the free AI on this blog–and so far, it’s pretty trustworthy.] When the internet began to chip away at our interpersonal relationships, we relied on brand names or clues to figure out what was real. We invented captchas and filters to figure out who or what was truthworthy. A certain kind of trust is no longer useful. Selfish hustlers are going to be one of the first big winners in the AI race, abusing systems that were built on traditional ideas of identity and responsibility.  Then what? This is a fine moment to start taking the question seriously. "
387,The thing about decay,"May 8, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/the-thing-about-decay/,"One reason we have so much trouble fixing chronic degenerative conditions is that we need to remove elements before we can start building new functions. If we simply put effort on top of a shaky foundation, it’ll all be wasted. The best way forward might be to take a few steps back. "
388,In search of chatoyancy,"May 7, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/in-search-of-chatoyancy/,"A cat’s eye is smooth but doesn’t seem to be… there’s a mystery of depth. That illusion is called chatoyancy. The same is true for some sorts of woods (cedar is an exception). The digital age makes it more and more likely we’re experiencing things through a flat screen, and as a result, it’s very easy to file flat experiences away without a thought. But creating something that’s chatoyant–that shifts in the light, that changes as we experience it… that’s a fascinating and useful project. "
389,Nihil hic deest,"May 6, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/nihil-hic-deest/,"This page intentionally left blank has a long history. I thought it was an IBM thing from the 1960s, but I was off by a thousand or more years. There are good reasons for a page to be blank. Folding signatures, printing processes, having chapters start on the right or the left… But there are even better reasons to let people know you did it on purpose. Particularly in a loosely bound book or a technical manual. Knowing that the page isn’t supposed to have something on it removes stress and lets the reader gain confidence that the text is complete. Of course, as we race to fill in every moment with swiping, surfing and clicking, it’s easy to forget that we’re allowed to leave some blank spaces. In fact, not just allowed, but if we want to live well, required. And it gets even easier if we announce (to ourselves and perhaps to others), that we’ve done it on purpose. [HT to Andy for the prompt] [unrelated: Here is a fascinating essay from an insider at Google about the shift in the AI universe. It’s happening very fast. There’s a ton of organizational turbulence, and this might be a moment open source has been waiting for.] "
390,The new way of work,"May 5, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/the-new-way-of-work/,"Amazon is the last one. They are probably the last huge company where hundreds of thousands of people will be surveilled, measured and ordered to follow the rule book. The pandemic didn’t create distributed work, the laptop did. Human interaction is critical, but the office isn’t actually the most effective way to create that. David Risher might be mistaken. The new CEO of Lyft just ordered all the workers at HQ to “come back to work.” Of course, they’ve been at work all along, they just haven’t been at the office. It takes a different set of leadership and management skills to create the conditions for effective distributed work. But it’s incredibly powerful when you get it right. The method is not to count keystrokes or other false proxies of productivity. Instead, the opportunity is to offer significance. "
391,The price of salt,"May 4, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/the-price-of-salt/,"Salt is essentially free. A bag of salted nuts is the same price (or less) as an unsalted one. But salt used to be expensive. Truly expensive, like gold. We keep seeing the deflation of things we were sure would remain expensive. Computer chips, disk storage and now, content. Once computers start illustrating, writing and composing, the opportunity is to have them work for you, not compete with you. [NOTE! Along those lines, check out my new augmented chatbot. It’s a world premiere, but I’m expecting that countless other WordPress blogs will have it one day. While it’s slow, it’s also pretty smart… it can point you to the relevant blog posts and podcasts, and often comes up with a great answer to your questions. You can even ask it, “what is the best kind of chocolate?”] "
392,The house painter and the architect,"May 3, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/the-house-painter-and-the-architect/,"We don’t design a book until after it’s written. Or cast the movie until the screenplay is complete. The house painter has an important job, but it makes no sense to plan for the painting before the house is designed. This makes a lot of sense because some parts of a project have high variability which can lead to very different outcomes. There are more than a billion ways to write a book, but fewer than 100 distinct categories of interior book design. We desperately need house painters, gaffers and book designers. If they don’t deliver on their work, the entire project falls apart. But they don’t go first. The job of the house painter is to amplify the architect’s vision, not vice versa. So there are a few questions worth asking: First, which one of the tasks is the dominant variable, the one where simply doing ‘a pretty good job’ is going to be insufficient (no one talks about the roofer on a Frank Lloyd Wright house–until it leaks). Second, which job do you want? We need both, but we should choose the path that suits our goals. [To be clear, it’s a role, not a job title. There are plenty of designers and painters who act as architects, and some architects that are not the pivot point for the project.] "
393,The list of compromises,"May 2, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/the-list-of-compromises/,"All the no-compromise solutions have failed. If there was a way to solve our problem without giving something up, we would have done that already. So, if a persistent problem is important, the question is not: Should we compromise or not? The question is: Which changes are we going to make first? "
394,On to the next thing,"May 1, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/05/on-to-the-next-thing/,"Vitally important, rarely taught, easily messed up. In order to go onto the next thing, which we all do (unless you’re still wearing pajamas with feet and taking ballet lessons), we need to walk away from the last thing. Wrap it up, learn from it, leave it in good hands. And we also need to have an idea of what the next thing is. But if we spend too much time focusing on the next thing, we’ll neglect the thing we’re currently doing, to ill effect. Trapeze artists spend all of their time focusing on transitions, as they’re a matter of life and death. If we begin by acknowledging that there’s going to be a next thing, perhaps we can learn to develop the skills and focus we need to get there. "
395,An end to pop,"April 30, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/an-end-to-pop/,"Pop culture depends on scarcity. When there are only a few TV stations or a dozen radio stations, it’s likely that many of us watch or hear the same thing at the same time. And so a popular TV show or song from fifty years ago probably reached twenty times as many people as a popular hit today. But the long tail brings other benefits. More choices, more innovation. Not just a long tail of consumption, but also a spectacular decrease in the cost of production. Innovations in computers, cameras and AI mean that people can make content without permission from a gatekeeper. In the latest AI breakthrough, here’s a recent Paul McCartney song ‘updated’ to use the voice of a young Paul McCartney. You can hear a quick snippet here: While this is technically amazing, what it highlights is that within a few weeks, we’re going to see thousands (or millions) of new songs created by AI and available on YouTube and streaming channels. Some of them will be mediocre. Some will be breakthroughs. And a few will be hits. Creating music (or writing) is an inherently human activity, and it doesn’t go away. What does go away, though, is the commercial dynamic of thousands of someones in Nashville or Hollywood hitting it big big big with nothing but a typewriter or a guitar.  The end of pop and the rise of the long tail and AI brings us back a century. Just like it used to be–small circles of people, not mass markets. But this time with endless choice and a business model that is hard to visualize. PS my friend Paige has a new book out. You can read the digital edition for free with password friend. "
396,We probably can’t buy our way out of it,"April 29, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-rare-trifecta/,"That’s what we usually try to do. When technology, comfort, convenience, efficiency and price line up, the market takes care of itself. On the other hand, seatbelts would never have happened if they weren’t required. But pizza grew to dominate our diets with no centralized action. They sell a lot of Tide laundry detergent. Billions of dollars a year, that’s enough pods to reach the moon and back. Even though Tide usually comes in a big plastic container and weighs many pounds, we keep buying it. That’s because it’s convenient, easy to find and not particularly expensive. One of the challenges of changing a culture that’s driven by consumption is that people voluntarily choose what to buy next. And so we get stuck. Stuck with products and systems that we’re not happy with, simply because it’s easier to stick with what we already have. The status quo is the status quo because it’s good at sticking around. And yet, sometimes we get lucky. Consider this simple product for washing your clothes. It’s super convenient, even more so than Tide. It’s almost as cheap. It’s dramatically more sustainable. It has a jillion 5-star reviews. And yet, it has a tiny fraction of Tide’s market share (so far). We can’t buy out way out of the climate crisis, we’ll need to compromise, to invest and to rethink the systems that we depend on. But every once in a while, you can simply change what you buy, and even better, tell someone else when it works. "
397,The magic of placebos,"April 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-magic-of-placebos/,"One of two things is true: A placebo is a force beyond understanding, one that is capable of disappearing when we do the appropriate double-blind tests and has mechanisms that defy our knowledge of the laws of physics. Or… A placebo is a prompt for our subconscious to do the hard work of healing our body, increasing our satisfaction or maximizing our performance. I think the second is way more likely, and ultimately serves us better. When someone says, “that’s just a placebo” they’re undervaluing the magic of culture and the power of our minds to actually influence how our bodies perform. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say, “we’re fortunate that a powerful placebo is available.” Purveyors of fancy sneakers, designer handbags, rare wines, acupuncture and herbal remedies can proudly lean into the work of producing the conditions where placebos have their maximum impact. If it’s not helping us believe, then it’s not properly designed. "
398,The braid out of balance,"April 27, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-braid-out-of-balance/,"There are three strands, present for most everyone: Power (sometimes seen as status, or the appearance of status) Safety (survival and peace of mind) Meaning (hope and the path forward) The changes in our media structure, public health and economy have pushed some people to overdo one or the other and perhaps ignore a third. When a social network finds your button and presses it over and over, it’s hard to resist. New cultural forces catch on because they hit on one or more of these. And politics is understood through this lens as well. See the braid and it’s a lot easier to figure out why we might be stressed. "
399,Explaining it to a kid,"April 26, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/explaining-it-to-a-kid/,"It can be difficult.  Explaining atoms or molecules, or decision making, or what you do at your job… The reason that it’s difficult is that in order to explain something, we need to really understand it first. Not simply be able to do the task or ace the test. But understand. And the reason we avoid it is that we might not want to understand. We might not want to get past “because that’s the way it is” or “do what I say” to actually become comfortable with the underlying forces and axioms that make something work. "
400,The unwritten rules get written,"April 25, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-unwritten-rules-get-written/,…when someone decides to selfishly push. There’s an assumption of civility and fairness in all of our interactions. When a harsh competitor unilaterally breaks unwritten rules (because it’s “not technically against the rules”) the community then writes down a new rule. The best way for a market to be a free market is for the participants to exercise self-restraint. The second best way is for clear and useful rules to be stated and enforced. What doesn’t work are unwritten rules that are often broken by selfish bullies. 
401,The Cliffs Notes paradox,"April 24, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-cliffs-notes-paradox/,"For a decade, Cliffs Notes were the bestselling section of the bookstore. They were a simple way for any high school student to get insight, examples and answers about the books they were assigned and read (or didn’t read). When Cliffs published a list of their thirty bestselling titles, I saw an opportunity and created a book that was the cliffs notes of the Cliffs Notes. Quicklit didn’t sell very well, but it seemed like a good idea at the time. Used as intended, Cliffs Notes and Quicklit were a gold mine of insight. They opened the door for real understanding, and often got to the heart of the literature better than an overworked high school teacher might be able to. The paradox? More availability of notes didn’t lead to more learning. It’s not clear to me that widespread availability of these summaries and guides actually led to much in the way of understanding. And so here comes ChatGPT and its cousins. Here’s ChatPDF, a miracle that instantly reads a PDF, summarizes it and gives us the chance to ask it questions. The results I’ve seen are extraordinary. Here’s a session built around a 48-page uploaded summary of my new book. Except… It doesn’t work until we choose to understand. Part of the magic of an actual book is that the reader ends up understanding. It seeps in, the aha’s are found, not highlighted. TLDR is internet-speak for “Too long, didn’t read.” It’s one of the consequences of too much to choose from, combined with a lazy quest for convenience. It’s a checklist mindset. And all we get after we finish a checklist is a bunch of checked boxes, not real understanding. If you were on a long train ride with the smartest person in the world, what would you ask her? And how long before you went back to scrolling on your phone? It doesn’t matter how much we summarize, at some point, effort is required. More summaries won’t automatically lead to more understanding. "
402,The search tax,"April 23, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-search-tax/,"Amazon took in more than $30 billion in ad revenue last year, money spent to elevate some products over others in the hierarchy of attention. It’s probably true that someone shopping on Amazon is going to either buy something or not… the purpose of the “ads” isn’t to amplify consumption, it’s to shift what someone chooses to buy. It’s a zero sum game–paying for a slot increases market share by stealing sales from the competition. The thing is: all of that spend is paid for by the consumer. Search and discovery would work just fine without the ads. Our satisfaction with what we bought would be at least as good if organic search simply highlighted the best match. This is simply a transfer of money from shoppers like us to one company with a shopping search engine. "
403,“But what if it doesn’t work?”,"April 22, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/but-what-if-it-doesnt-work/,"The best way to win a short-term game is to bet it all on one strategy. Someone is going to get lucky and it might be you. But we rarely thrive in the long run if we persist in playing a series of short-term games. Instead, organizations, individuals and teams do better when they understand the value of resilience. In the last year, we’ve seen well-funded and heavily hyped crypto companies hit the wall and fail. That’s because it was easy for them to get funded and grow fast by making a simple bet, and in a bull market, everyone looks like a genius. But their less flashy competitors are still around. They understood that resilience is expensive and resilience is worth it. "
404,No time to waste,"April 21, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/no-time-to-waste/,Of course there isn’t. Time is all we’ve got. Time is all there is. We can’t waste time because it’s not ours to waste. It’s simply the way we keep track of everything else. 
405,Avoiding food waste confusion,"April 20, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/profiting-from-food-waste-confusion/,"Everybody eats That’s the biggest problem. While plenty of people drive or play pickleball, eating is particularly widespread. Seven billion people multiplies into a big number… Creating the food we eat has significant climate impact. Some of the factors, in unranked order: Even if we wasted no food at all, the impact of all of these activities would be enormous. Clean your plate? But the food production, delivery and consumption chain is filled with waste. The biggest impact happens on farms. Food doesn’t all ripen on the same day. Harvesting it is expensive and time-consuming. Pests (and birds) harm crops. Food is fragile. The economics of putting more time and labor into grabbing one last peach is greater than the economic benefit that peach produces. And, the distance from where something grows to where it is processed or consumed is non-zero. It all adds up, and it’s all out of the control of the typical citizen. Consumer food waste is less than a quarter of the total. Of course we shouldn’t buy more than we need, or simply discard food that can be turned into another meal, or useful compost for a community garden. But climate change is a systems problem, and it requires systemic solutions. When we price carbon accurately, the efficient market will start to pay more attention to harvesting the last peach, or shifting to drip irrigation, vertical farms or simple techniques that have enormous benefits. In the US, restaurants waste nearly as much food as all homes combined–by the time the food is on your plate, most of the damage is already done. We actually have the tools available to make an impact. Insisting on voluntary personal action is a long, difficult road, even if someone tries to build a business around it. There are hungry people all around us, and more efficient supply chains will allocate the food we’re wasting far more efficiently. The cultural dynamic in many places of serving more food than your guests can possibly eat–as a form of status or generosity–is persistent and wasteful. But it’s just a small part of a system that needs fixing. The shift in our industrial systems to climate resilience is a huge opportunity. It creates efficiencies and shifts our focus away from dead-end consumption. But we need to be clear about which systems have the most leverage and work relentlessly on them. More details, references and insights on this are in The Carbon Almanac. The course that dozens of us made on LinkedIn is free this week. "
406,The natural size,"April 19, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-natural-size/,"No matter how many people come over for dinner, you’re only going to be able to engage with a few.  And no matter how big the crowd in the arena, the musicians can only see the faces of a few hundred. An investor can only be engaged and smart about a very small number of companies. And it doesn’t matter how many students are in the class, the teacher is only going to be able to get in sync with a few. Microphones, network connections and other forms of scale are a miracle, but sooner or later, our brains get in the way. "
407,The empathy device,"April 18, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-empathy-device/,"It’s interesting to realize that mirrors weren’t perfected until a few hundred years ago. Human beings spend a lot of time considering our own appearance and our own feelings and most of all, our own needs. The market produces a shift. When it’s a fair and open exchange, the customer gains in power. As a result, the selfish merchant or producer loses market share until they figure out how to build empathy into their work. It’s not for you, it’s for them. And if you do a good job of making it for them, then you get your needs taken care of. Big companies and monopolies and other institutions seek lock-in so they can go back to looking in the mirror instead of paying attention to what their customers and prospects need and want. "
408,Digital prepwork,"April 17, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/digital-prepwork/,"It’s so tempting to simply begin painting a wall. After all, it’s pretty easy to lay down paint. But it turns out that masking and dropcloths, painstakingly put into place, save many hours compared to cleaning up a mess afterward. The same is true for what happens when we have a new hard drive or a blank document. A file organization and backup system takes a few minutes to set up. It saves hundreds of hours in finding files, organizing versions and recovering from an (inevitable) system failure. Using templates, master sheets and structured ways to hold data is far more resilient than simply putting some text and images on the page in a way that looks good. Programmers who comment their code as they go ultimately get the real work done faster. Establishing source control protocols among team members is a tiny price to pay for avoiding duplicated work. If you don’t have time to do it right, how will you find the time to do it over? You can tell if a house painter is any good before the first brushstroke is applied. And you can figure out if your designers, system architects or coders are good in the very same way. "
409,A treaty,"April 16, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/a-treaty/,"Successful treaties calm things down and let us get back to what’s really important. Sometimes, the fight becomes the entire point. Not surprisingly, when we’re busy fighting a war in our head about a previous injustice or slight, we can effectively consummate a treaty without the other person even knowing about it. "
410,The explosion,"April 15, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-explosion/,"We spend much of our worrying time on crises. Our media is filled with warnings, coverage and fear of cataclysms. The big boom, the sudden end, the crash. In fact, rot is far more common. Things decay unless we persistently work to support them. Organizations, reputations, systems, health, investments… even our teeth. For every hockey player who lost a tooth in a game, there are a million people who lost one over time. Fear the rot, the explosions are merely a distraction. "
411,Unfettered,"April 14, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/unfettered/,That’s unlikely. You’re rarely going to get the freedom and resources to do your best work unfettered. The hard part (and the opportunity) is to figure out how to get comfortable with fettered. Because fettered is what’s on offer. Boundaries and scarcity aren’t simply impediments. They’re leverage points and opportunities. 
412,Real and apparent risk,"April 13, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/real-and-apparent-risk/,"Roller coasters are one of the safest ways to travel (they end up where they begin, but that’s a different story). People pay to ride on them because they feel risky, even if they’re not. Air travel is really safe, and the airlines work overtime to reduce the perception of risk as well. That’s why turbulence is so jarring–it’s not actually risky, but it breaks the facade. On the other hand, we regularly engage in activities and behaviors that are risky without perceiving the risk. The cigarette companies worked hard to make smoking feel macho, sophisticated and part of the crowd at the same time that they seduced people into feeling like they weren’t taking a risk with their health. The most resilient path in most activities is to offer perceived risk to people who seek risk, while also creating resilient systems that aren’t actually risky. Because dancing with perceived risk creates growth, connection and emotional resonance, whereas actual risk leads to outcomes we don’t want.  "
413,Design has a language,"April 12, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/design-has-a-language/,"And it changes over time. You and I know what to do when we see a revolving door, or to speak quietly in a library. We have expectations of how the world works and what designers are saying with their work. Here’s a photo of a device with two controls. We’ve been taught our whole lives that the bottom one, the faucet, is designed to control the amount of water flowing through a pipe. And the top one is generally used to divert water from one pipe to another, often used to control the temperature in a shower. Unfortunately, this design has a typo. The bottom faucet was chosen by the designer to control the temperature and the top one turns the shower on and off. There’s no way to control the volume. When you make a typographical error in your design language, you’re either being careless or seeking to lead toward a new way of interpreting the work of anyone in your field. Over time, the meaning of something changes. It used to be that offering plenty of disposable plastic bottles was a way for a designer to communicate surplus, luxury or sanitation. Now, it simply feels wasteful and short-sighted. It used to be that affordances in design for people with less range of motion or other disabilities was seen as grudging and mandatory, but now it communicates awareness, openness and thought… In New York, designing a fancy restaurant to be quiet was a sign of luxury, now, restaurant designers seek to  signal scarcity by making restaurants noisy. Kerning your type is a form of communication through design, and the rise of social media has added new meaning to poorly set type as well. A list of rules isn’t helpful. Looking for and understanding the language as it changes is. "
414,The freedom loop,"April 11, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-freedom-loop/,"We spend almost no time teaching toddlers about freedom. Instead, the lessons we teach (and learn) for our entire lives are about responsibility. It’s easy to teach freedom, but important to teach responsibility. Because if you get the responsibility taken care of, often the freedom will follow. When someone points out a lack of responsibility, it can feel like an affront on freedom, when it’s actually a chance to create more freedom for the rest of the community. You can drive as fast as you want. But you are also responsible for not running over someone in a school zone… The speed limit is not taking away our freedom, it’s reminding us of our responsibility. When we build a culture of people who eagerly seek out and take responsibility, we build a culture that enables a special kind of resilient freedom. "
415,The rear view mirror,"April 10, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-rear-view-mirror/,"It’s almost impossible to safely drive a car while only looking in the rear view mirror. Only seeing where you’ve been is a terrible way to figure out where to go. But it’s really unsafe to go forward with no idea of what came before. AI plods along into the future, using machine learning to closely examine the past. And radical visionaries often slam into unforeseen obstacles precisely because they failed to do the reading. Somewhere in between is a useful set of tactics. "
416,Consider switching sides,"April 9, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/consider-switching-sides/,"One of the spokespeople for the new milk marketing campaign confessed that she doesn’t really like drinking milk. Sales are way down, and an entire generation is drinking other beverages. Other than the people who are paid to sell or lobby for milk sales, few people are concerned. Milk isn’t going away, but it certainly isn’t growing. Marketing isn’t the act of getting people to buy what you’re paid to sell them. Good marketing is the craft of understanding what people want and need and helping them achieve it. There’s no need to sign up for the endless uphill battle of marketing against a positive trend. Sell something you believe in, to people who are eager to believe in it as well. You’ll do your best work on behalf of an audience and a cause that deserves it, appreciates it and applauds it. If it’s just a job, you’ve sacrificed your best energy for a paycheck. Pick your client, pick your future. "
417,New decisions based on new information,"April 8, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/new-decisions-based-on-new-information/,"More than ever, we’re pushed to have certainty. Strong opinions, tightly held and loudly proclaimed. And then, when reality intervenes, it can be stressful. The software stack, business model, career, candidate, policy, or even the social network habits that we had as part of our identity let us down. It’s not easy to say, “I was wrong.” And so people live in stress, sticking with something that used to work longer than they’re comfortable with. Our challenges in shifting perspective keep us stuck in the past. These are sunk costs, decisions we can’t unmake, but they don’t have to be forever commitments. One way forward is to rename this moment and change the story. Instead of “I was wrong,” perhaps it’s useful (if less satisfying to others seeking victory) to say, “It’s time to make a new decision based on new information.” That’s not weakness.

Every good restaurant should have two different salads on the menu. The boring salad is the regular kind. It’s there for people who know that they want a reliable, repeatable, unremarkable salad. It’s the safe part of a safe meal. It might remind them of their childhood or it’s simply the foundation for a nice evening without any tension around the food. The fascinating salad is a chance for the restaurant to bring surprise, delight and care to the person who orders it. It’s remarkable in the way it combines unexpected elements, and even though the ingredients it uses make it accessible to people who have careful diets, it’s still extraordinary, and worth what it costs. A fascinating salad is a marvel. It’s not that hard to create, but it demonstrates the passion of the person who produced it in a memorable, almost emotional way. Too often, freelancers end up offering just a boring salad. It feels safer than getting rejected. Or they pretend to offer a fascinating salad, but at the end, they lose their nerve and simply charge more than they should for a boring salad that’s pretending to be fascinating. "
419,Replacing bad systems with bad systems,"April 6, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/replacing-bad-systems-with-bad-systems/,"A metaphor involving parking meters. Over the years, parking meters in town have evolved into a cumbersome, awkward system. Coins are heavy and you need to have them handy, meters need to be reinforced against theft and breakage, town employees have to empty the coins and securely deliver them to the bank, meter feeding allows local employees to hog spaces that might be used for shoppers… you get the idea. But replacing all the meters is expensive and because it’s inherently a centralized system, involves a lot of lobbying as well as a group of people making a choice with limited expertise, a choice they’ll only have to make once, they can’t learn from their mistakes… Enter Parkmobile, an app that promises everything to everyone. Except it increases the cost by more than 100% by charging fees, it’s awkward, has a silly password policy that makes it cumbersome to use, sends many many emails to users and it doesn’t generate more revenue or flexibility for the town. It charges people double and gives them less. But you can see how they managed to find the budget to do the difficult and expensive work of lobbying one town after another to gain monopoly status. The network effect is sticky and hard to overcome, and as we move the internet of things from our phones to just about everything we touch, it’s worth thinking about resilience, flexibility and the reason we need something in the first place. Often, we end up compromising about our compromises, maximizing for the wrong outcomes and getting hooked on a new system that forgot what the original system was even for. In this case, the first principles begin with why the meters exist in the first place. There are two goals: At first, having people put a nickel in a meter made sense. It’s just enough of a hassle and just enough of a cost that it all balances out. Thanks to the portable id that a smart phone offers, one simple solution is to have people scan a code that automatically gets them a period of time to park at a spot for free. The dashboard for enforcement is easy to build, and in a typical small town, the revenue loss is pretty small–a few more shoppers more than makes up for the cost of lost meters. If one still wanted to maximize revenue, it wouldn’t be difficult to hook that scanning tool up to any number of online payment services (like Venmo or Paypal) and simply cut out the middleman.  Once we see we have cars, spots, drivers and phones, all in a dance, we can make new decisions based on what we want, not what simply polishes what we had. One could also easily sell parking passes, give local discounts, senior discounts or even give merchants codes they could use for employees in certain spots. You could make it so that the first ten minutes are free for fast in and out trips, or have it so local employees pay less in long-term spots, or that shoppers can easily get their parking cost rebated if they make a purchase. Or you could even rethink why cars are taking up so much space in our villages and towns and reconfigure the entire flow of humanity and traffic. But all of this is difficult because of the many constituencies involved and the stakes required in making UX choices in public. Design thinking is simple to describe in two questions: Who’s it for? What’s it for? In the case of a system replacing a previous system, these questions often get replaced with: What’s the easiest way to polish what we compromised on last time? Part of the magic of WordPress and its success is that the open nature and decentralized user experience they offer allows the individuals and organizations using it to embrace their first purposes instead of backward engineering from a centralized monopoly and a bagful of money. And a key benefit of distributed systems is that they improve over time. When you see something that can be made better, make it better. When a system is new, few are watching, so a handful of people with intent can design it and optimize it. As it gains in scale and impact, it calcifies at the same time that new tech arrives to codify the decisions that were made when the conditions were very different. The next time you pose for a photo, keep in mind that we pose for photos because the speed of an exposure used to be so long that if you didn’t pose, the photo was blurred. We changed the tech, but baked in the cultural expectation. Sometimes, we need to take a deep breath and go for better instead of more. "
420,In and out,"April 5, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/in-and-out-2/,"Lots of organizations (and individuals) have plans and processes for getting the word out. In fact, we spend trillions of dollars doing so. Do you have a plan for getting the word in? Is it simply random chance that some ideas get to you and your team, that cultural and technical awareness just happens? How do the people who know share their knowledge with the people who don’t? If knowing what’s happening is important, it probably pays to focus on how (and when) we discover the new stuff. "
421,Leverage is brittle,"April 4, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/leverage-is-brittle/,"Debt is a financial miracle. If you buy a property for 20% down, with the bank financing the rest, and it goes up in value by just 10%, your profit is 50%. (I’ll wait while you do the math.) If you have a factory and can buy a machine that increases productivity, the money you borrow to pay for that machine creates enough profit that you get to do it again. And again. Alas, the ratchet can also go the other way. If that property goes down in value a little bit, you lose everything. If your competitors buy better and more expensive machinery than you have, they can sell for less than you can, and your investment disappears. Farming is difficult. It always has been. But leverage and debt make it a persistent challenge. If the weather is better than anyone expects and the markets are just right, you do really well for a season. But if conditions change, if fertilizer is hard to get, if there’s a glut–well, the bank still does fine, but the farmer can get wiped out. The reason that supply chain issues were so bad is that leveraged organizations needed to figure out how to extract every penny from their cash flow, and having less inventory on hand seemed like a smart way to eke out a bit more leverage. Until a shipment is late and then it all grinds to a halt. And… when a bank or an investor is considering two power plants, and they discover that the coal plant is 1% more profitable in the short run but 100x worse for the community, they go for pennies instead of resilience. Because leverage multiplies the value of a short-term penny so much that they feel as if they have no choice but to choose the fragile, selfish, short-term path. Leverage accelerates everything. Learning to see it is a key step in understanding how to fix it. "
422,On being missed,"April 3, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/on-being-missed/,"Some friends moved away, and the cake at the party read, “We’ll miss you.” Perhaps it would have been more accurate for it to say, “You’ll miss us.” Because, after all, what’s mostly being missed is the community of friends and neighbors. Even when someone moves away, the community remains. When a marketer serves a community, they create the conditions where they’d be missed–because the ideas or products or services they bring are important, not simply tolerated. That’s a worthwhile goal. "
423,Foibles,"April 2, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/foibles/,"Our habits, preferences and idiosyncrasies make perfect sense. We each know that we have great reasons to embrace our ways and stick with them. Other people’s habits, though, show that they are simply picky, weird or too sensitive. The difference between a preference and a foible seems to be mostly where we’re standing. "
424,Fooled,"April 1, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/04/fooled/,"Now it’s a business model. People are regularly fooled by crypto scams, NFT hype, opioid felons, algorithmic spam at scale, health claims, illogical political arguments, fundraising pitches, overnight shortcuts on the road to riches or happiness and MLM hustle. Your account has been locked, click here… When it becomes the tactic of a scalable business, it’s not surprising that the fooling gets more refined and persistent. Buyer beware. Of course. Of course we should check our gullibility at the door. But this overlooks the simple cultural truth: just because it’s a business model doesn’t mean you’re entitled to it. Simply because it might be exploiting a legal loophole doesn’t give someone free reign to spend their days taking advantage of people for their own benefit. Buyer beware puts the onus on the individual who’s getting fooled. But we also have the ability to separate ourselves from those that would seek to profit by fooling us. You can’t work against us and also earn our respect. Culture is a horizontal set of principles that we enforce in service of the community. If your job involves ripping people off, walk away. No one wants to live in hustle-world, it’s not even a good place to visit. Sometimes we get what we hope for. Often, we get what we tolerate. "
425,Tom Peters,"March 31, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/tom-peters/,"Tom announced his retirement today, at 80 years old, after 45 years of Excellence and perhaps 10,000,000 miles flown. I remember a photo of him sleeping on a bench in an airport in Siberia.  I remember him holding my young son just before we went on stage in Florida together twenty-four years ago. I remember being at a small gathering he had in Vermont, where we argued about how many words go on a slide. I remember meeting him after he gave a class at Stanford, in 1983, moments after his first book was gaining traction. And I remember briefly controlling the rights to the computer game version of In Search of Excellence when I was at Spinnaker. Not to mention our delightful but rare duets. So much of my best stuff is inspired, stolen or both from Tom, from Zig, from Roz, from Ben, from Steve and from Pema. Apparently, it helps to have a short first name. Tom made it possible to get on stage and do this new thing, which led to TED talks and conferences and so many other forms of informal education by unauthorized teachers. Even if you were never lucky enough to work with him, or fortunate enough to read his books, without a doubt, Tom Peters has had an impact on your life. He created significance and opened the doors for others to do so as well. And in his words, okay word… Excellence. [Period.] "
426,The 500 ways,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/the-500-ways/,"There are thousands of ways to express encouragement and enthusiasm and support. Few of them require a blood oath or even much inconvenience. “I’m thrilled that you’re contributing.”  “Can’t wait to see how this turns out.” “I know someone who really needs to hear about this.” “Go make a ruckus, it matters.” If we want things to get better, it helps to encourage people who are eager to make things better.

427,Making change happen,"March 30, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/making-change-happen/,One way to do it is to get people to want what you want. The other way is to help them get what they want in a way that gets you what you want. They’re not the same.

Part one of of two on mediocrity and the choices we’re going to need to make. And, a while in the making, an experimental AI chat bot that has been trained on all 5,000,000 words of this blog. You can find it here. Yes, you can trick it, but you can also ask it questions about anything I’ve blogged and it may do a good job of answering. Dave Winer and I pursued the idea in parallel, and I expect he’ll have one soon. And then they’ll be everywhere. "
429,Rethinking the Sports-Industrial Complex,"March 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/rethinking-the-sports-industrial-complex/,"School sports can have some valuable outputs: And yet, many schools act as if all they have is a trophy shortage. They bench kids who might not (yet) have the physical attributes necessary to win, or they build huge stadiums, go on long road trips, berate students that make an error or simply act as if the only point is to win. Fancy uniforms, the magnification of small differences and a cutthroat focus on the outcome is not something that leads to the benefits that most of us would root for. Why not have a small league and swap kids around until the teams are evenly matched? Give every single player the same amount of game time? Reward kids for personal growth, not for being better than someone else who simply started with a bit less than they did? What would happen if the coaches were rewarded for what was actually valued by parents, not for recreating what people see on TV? Perhaps we could begin by asking what school sports are even for. Are they there to entertain the fans? I’d argue the same goes for the local jazz band and the middle school theatre production as well. "

In an inflection error, he said “weasel” when he meant to say “calm sea.” As a result, he was mocked by Sannyrion and then Aristophanes and others. He never worked again. The lesson might be that one innocent slip and you’re doomed. The real lesson might be that in the history of his profession, one in which millions of people have stood up and said billions of words, this is the only time this ever happened. "
432,Flashing on contempt,"March 25, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/flashing-on-contempt/,"It doesn’t have to happen with intent, in fact, it rarely does. Micro-emotions appear on our face and then disappear in less than a second. Blink and you’ll miss them. But sometimes, people don’t blink. We’ve evolved to be hyperware of these tiny displays of emotion. And yet, most of us don’t even realize it’s happening. We don’t realize we’re seeing the signs, or that we’re sending them. Someone who sends tiny flashes of empathy is often seen as charismatic. We’re afraid of a dog that seems, in a fraction of a second, to be angry. And we build friendships around our instincts gained from these flashes (or the absence of them) I had a friend who didn’t realize that when she got nervous, she often winked. As a result, people changed their responses to her, because they misunderstood the tiny signal she was inadvertently sending. Once she realized what was happening, she couldn’t easily extinguish the winks, but at least she knew the cause of the responses and could act accordingly. The same thing happens, but even more so, with other flashes of emotion. When someone is stressed, nervous or fearful, he might send out previously unacknowledged flashes and signals of those feelings. They might be beyond our control, but the reactions people have are real, and understanding what prompts the response is the first step in moving forward to address them. "
433,Delivering good taste,"March 24, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/delivering-good-taste/,"There are lots of books on creating cooking, photography, writing and music. But they can’t possibly help you do better until you see and taste and appreciate what you’re trying to create. If you think what you’re serving is good, but others don’t, more recipes aren’t going to help. That’s why so much type is poorly set, so many self-published books look the way they do, so many restaurants are merely good and so much long-tail music is easily skipped and forgettable. There are two steps to begin: Show us an example of someone else’s work that you believe is good. A book cover that feels professional, a jazz riff that inspires, a pasta dish that’s unforgettable. Then make a version of it. Not a copy, but something that rhymes. If you can’t do that, it’s probably not a matter of technique. It’s about being in sync with what other people aspire to engage with. "
434,They will lose your data,"March 23, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/they-will-lose-your-data/,"The rules are pretty consistent: We’re all creators now. Podcasting, videoing, photographing, spreadsheeting… and we’re building a foundation of valuable data as we go. The software companies that produce the tools we use push their engineers in many ways, but not to create resilient storage systems that are sure to honor the effort and care you put into creating your data. They want you to believe that they will effortlessly and seamlessly maintain all the data you trust to them, but they actually spend most of their time focused on other things that they deem more commercially important. That’s because convenient, viral or flashy are generally more profitable than resilient and reliable. When a conferencing app lost a video I worked really hard to record, I realized that trusting them was my first mistake. If there’s a one in a thousand chance that a file is going to be corrupted or simply lost, storing it in two places or recording it simultaneously in two systems lowers your chances of failure to one in a million. I will never trust them again, and you shouldn’t either. Forewarned should be sufficient. Assume that the software company doesn’t care nearly as much about your work, your memories or your reputation as you do. "
435,How to change the world,"March 22, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/how-to-change-the-world/,"All successful cultural change (books, movies, public health), has a super-simple two-step loop: AWARENESSTENSION–>Loop<– It’s easy to focus on awareness. Get the word out. Hype. Promo. I think that’s a mistake. Because awareness without tension is useless. The tension is like pulling back a rubber band. WHY would someone who becomes aware take action? Is the action to buy the book? To change one’s diet? To vote? And then the third step, so important it’s often ignored, is: Why would the person who became aware and then experienced the tension and release… tell someone else? So, to recap: "
436,The answer to every question,"March 21, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/the-answer-to-every-question/,"If the thing of the moment is the answer to every single question, you might be in a bubble. If, regardless of the problem, the answer is crypto, homeopathy, or the internet, or perhaps GPT, essential oils or decarbonization, it’s possible we’re taking an easy way out. A new technology or approach could be the answer to a bunch of questions, but not all of them. The bubble might be just us, ignoring everything outside our comfort zone or incentive range. Or it could be widespread, the culture carried away with the one thing that changes everything. Everything is going to change, it always does, but nuance matters. Nuance requires patience, insight and awareness of the details. Sometimes it’s easier to just be in a bubble. "
437,The ghost in the machine,"March 20, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/the-ghost-in-the-machine/,"“The computer wants you to click this button.” “It thinks you asked for something else.” “He’s mad at you.” Thousands of generations ago, we evolved our way into a magnificent hack. It turns out that we can more safely navigate the world by imagining that other people have a little voice in their heads just as we have one in ours. By projecting the narrative voice to others, we avoided fights that could be fatal. It’s a powerful shorthand that allows us to use limited brain processing power to interact in complicated cultural situations. It worked so well, we began applying it to dogs, to lizards and even to the weather. It’s a great place to find the origins of bad decisions and superstitions. The truth, of course, is that your cat doesn’t have a voice in her head. But we still act like she does. And that cloud doesn’t really have an angry face in it, a bug we see so often that we even gave it a name. Pareidolia is proof that the mistake is almost universal. And now, AI chat is putting the common sense of this to the test. We know exactly what the code base is, and yet within minutes, most normal humans are happily chatting away, bringing the very emotions to the computer that we’d bring to another person. We rarely do this with elevators or door handles, but once a device gets much more complicated than that, we start to imagine the ghost inside the machine. If it’s working, keep at it. The problems arise when the hack stops working. When we start making up stories about the narrative intent of complex systems. Sooner or later, we end up with conspiracies, misunderstandings about public health and opportunities missed in the financial markets. Emergent behaviors (like the economy and computers and the natural world) aren’t conscious. It’s hard to say, “I know I’m making up a human-centric story to explain systemic phenomena, but it’s a shortcut I use… do you think the shortcut is helpful here?” "
438,Shields up,"March 19, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/shields-up-2/,"Years and years ago, I helped the Weekly World News make a book. While their periodical was weekly, it certainly wasn’t news. They were just four people in a small office in Florida. They gleefully made stuff up every week. They had a few filing cabinets of stock photos, and they invented stories featuring UFOs, aliens, “scientists” (in quotation marks) and various other diversions for folks trapped in the checkout supermarket line. And now, of course, we are all trapped in that line. And now, the algorithms are pushing spineless profit-seekers to bombard us with junk, junk that shows up on the home page of search engines, in our social media feeds and in our email. Adblockers are one of the most popular innovations of the last few years. What I want is a junkblocker. A big button on my browser that says “shields up.” And just imagine if it was set to on by default. No celebrity gossip. No conspiracy theories. No weight loss breakthroughs. It would automatically block fist fights, trolling, urgent but unimportant breaking news, insights about the royal family, discussions of whatever happened to a star from thirty years ago, aliens, UFOs, MLMs, the latest pump-and-dump schemes, things that are true but irrelevant, things that are relevant but didn’t actually happen and stories designed to demean, degrade or intentionally inflict distress with little recourse available. When you put it that way, who doesn’t want a button like that? Somehow, we survived as a culture for centuries without exposing ourselves to thousands of profit-driven manipulations dumped on our living room carpet all day, every day. No wonder we’re exhausted after a day online. "
439,The gap between impossible and normal,"March 18, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/the-gap-between-impossible-and-normal/,"It keeps getting shorter and shorter.

440,Is it possible to care at scale?,"March 17, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/is-it-possible-to-care-at-scale/,"After 25 years, I stopped using a certain credit card for business. It was easily millions of dollars worth of transactions over that period. Did anyone at the company notice? Did anyone care? I still remember losing a client in 1987. Small organizations pay attention and care very much about each and every customer. Verizon and AT&T, on the other hand, don’t even know that you and I exist. Small family farms have significantly higher yields than neighboring farms that are much bigger. That’s because the individual farmer cares about every single stalk and frond, and the person with a lot of land is more focused on what they think of as the big picture. But it’s pretty clear that if you add up enough small things, you get to the big one. Caring at scale can’t be done by the CEO or a VP. But what these folks can do is create a culture that cares. They can hire people who are predisposed to care. They can pay attention to the people who care and measure things that matter instead of chasing the short term. Large organizations have significant structural advantages. But the real impacts happen when they act like small ones. "
441,Your own billboard,"March 16, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/your-own-billboard/,"Large sections of Los Angeles are studded with billboards for minor TV shows. These billboards exist nowhere else, even though there are televisions globally. Obviously, there’s ego at work here, but it’s sort of productive. First, there’s the ego of the producers/networks. They like showing their peers what they’re up to, and it probably makes it easier to recruit the talent that lives nearby. If you’re in the famous business, being more famous, even locally, is a boost. And then there’s the ego of the stars. After all, if they see the billboard, it’s as if everyone sees it. Social media is simply a smaller scale digital example of this very tendency. And getting your billboard right–and doing work that makes it easier to get your billboard right–might be one of the single best side effects of useful social media. But, like billboards in LA, it’s best to not take them too seriously. "
442,Simple techniques for complex projects,"March 15, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/simple-techniques-for-complex-projects/,"Warm up the machines that take a long time first. Stress test the go/no go parts of the project as early as possible. If the cost is low, replace dependent processes with parallel ones. Do the difficult parts when energy is high and the budget hasn’t been depleted. Ship before you run out of time or money. Invest in slack buffers for any critical dependent components. Budgets are a tool, not a weapon. Thrash early, then lock down decisions and don’t change them. Assign each task to the least expensive/least busy people able to get the job done. (This is probably not the project manager). Prioritize feedback from people with taste, skill and influence, not proximity or volume. Identify go/no go points based on irreversible actions or unrecoverable costs. Anticipate the difficult and high-risk moments in advance and reserve resources for the ones you can’t anticipate. Heroism is more fun but less reliable than good planning. "
443,Conspicuous (non) consumption,"March 14, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/conspicuous-non-consumption/,"One way to show status is by demonstrating how many resources you have. A bespoke suit, a huge graduation party, a fancy building…  A bully who physically intimidates or an angry driver who cuts you off in traffic are each working to show their status and strength. But it’s also possible to demonstrate security and confidence by doing precisely the opposite. The billionaire in a t-shirt. The person who holds the door open and lets you go first in line… these are also demonstrations of status. The interesting question isn’t whether someone has status. It’s whether they’re gutsy enough to demonstrate it by making things better for others. "
444,Is it a t-shirt brand?,"March 13, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/is-it-a-t-shirt-brand/,"Not all projects become t-shirt brands, nor should they. The risk is in thinking you’re building one when you’re not. T-shirt worthy brands are a very small subset of the whole. The question is: Would your customers want to wear your logo on a t-shirt? Why? If you’re creating identity, possibility, connection and giving folks status, it’s easy to see how you could build a t-shirt brand in just about any field. Sports teams do it for a living. Google had a t-shirt brand for a long time, and so does Penguin Magic and even Festool. I’m not sure, though, that many people want a t-shirt from BMO bank, Marriott or International Paper. Netflix might be, Roku isn’t. Of course, no t-shirt brand is for everyone, that’s part of the point. If you’re simply providing a good service at a good price, perhaps you don’t need to go to all those meetings and waste so much time and money on “branding.”  Why would someone want to wear your name around town? What’s in it for them? Go build that and the t-shirts will take care of themselves. "
445,Allocating scarcity,"March 12, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/allocating-scarcity/,"If we’re lucky, we invent something that’s going to be in high demand. Reservations at a hot restaurant. Limited edition trading cards. Concert tickets… How to decide who gets them? One attractive option is “first-come-first-served.” It feels fair, after all. The theory is that people who really want what you have will spend time (waste time) in line to show their commitment. But of course, this is a tax, and an uneven one at that, since some people value their time more than others. Another is to simply auction off the scarce items. The good news is that the value of the scarce item won’t be squandered on time wasting, but will go to the company. But this might feel unfair, as it rewards people with more assets, as so many things do. On the other hand, it’s pretty clear that people allocate resources differently than we might expect. The third method, the fairest of all, is to have a lottery. Invite your best customers, or charge a commitment fee, and then randomly allocate the loot. The good news is that you won’t alienate customers who feel as though it’s their fault that they didn’t wait in line long enough, or spend enough. Each decision has effects. And it’s up to the producer to decide which emotions they want to be responsible for creating. "

The problem with the magical medium of email is that it’s an open API. Anyone with a computer can plug into it, without anyone’s consent. This creates an asymmetric attention problem. The selfish, short-term-thinking sender benefits by emailing as many people as possible, and the recipients suffer. This doesn’t happen with traditional mail, because there’s a cost to sending it. With GPT arriving, expect that spam is going to increase 100x, and that it will be eerily personalized, invasive and persistent. That it will be really difficult to believe that an email isn’t junk, because there’s going to be so much junk, and it’s going to be harder to filter. And yet, email is powerful, and convenient and we’ve been using it for our entire careers. Is it doomed? Some apps are showing up that are trying to create a paywall for email. An unknown sender has to make a donation to charity (the recipient specifies the amount) to reach your inbox. People have tried this off and on for decades, but it’s hard. There are two problems with this being widely adopted. The first is that it creates an attention obligation on the part of the recipient. It’s socially awkward to sell access to your inbox and then ignore the email. The second is that there isn’t much of a network effect, and while a few people might adopt it, the problems with email don’t improve unless it’s widespread and persistent. Here’s an alternative: A simple plugin for gmail (and then, eventually other providers) that tags the email you send and receive. Senders who send more than 50 emails a day need to buy “stamps”, perhaps for a penny each. The money goes into escrow. Recipients can easily mark an email as unwanted. They can also upvote an email, which will send a signal that allows their peers to be sure they don’t ignore what they just got.  If enough people mark your emails as unwanted, you lose your escrow, it goes to a worthy cause. If it’s legit, the escrow remains and you don’t have to buy more stamps. If a sender doesn’t use the system, they’re not going to be able to reach any of the people who do. So not many people have to be early adopters before it becomes widespread–if you want to reach most people (and you don’t know which people have it and which don’t) you’re going to need to turn on the tagging. It’s a tiny cost to pay for attention in a world where attention is scarce. Normal people won’t have to pay anything, and email will get better for them as senders and receivers. And businesses that mean well and do well ought to be happy to pay. If too many senders view the penny stamp as a chance to spam people (and lose the penny) then just increase the cost of the stamp to a nickel, etc. Pretty soon, algorithmic spamming is simply not going to pay off. Giving anonymous people and organizations the chance to steal your attention all day, at scale, seems like a worse idea every day. "
447,Bob Dobalina,"March 10, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/bob-dobalina/,"I considered myself someone with an encyclopedic knowledge of a narrow range of mid-1960s TV and certain strains of pop music as well. I was stunned, then, to hear the song Zilch for the first time recently. Mr. Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina. It’s unforgettable. And it’s from the Monkees. Go figure. We’ve long passed the point where anyone can have an encyclopedic knowledge of anything. Even the encyclopedia doesn’t. The method, then, is simply to expose ourselves to a stream of provocations and interesting problems, and have a hunch on where to look up what we don’t already know. "
448,Dancing for the early adopters,"March 9, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/dancing-for-the-early-adopters/,"The traveling circus didn’t have to appeal to everyone. They rode into town with the elephants, the bearded lady and the Tasmanian Devil, and the people who came, came. Once the folks who wanted excitement were exhausted, the circus left. The problem kicks in when the circus becomes permanent. When the company seeks to scale. When the public markets want the organization to move beyond novelty seekers and reach the masses. Suddenly, the dancing that used to work is the very thing that is a problem. Tesla launched the difficult-to-make and controversial Cybertruck years ago. It was a mammoth error for a public company, ceding the most popular segment of the car market to Rivian and Ford in precisely the moment they could have launched a boring, reliable electric truck that would have created significant and permanent market share. And the company’s overhyped FSD feature is now in wide recall, and half the large advertisers on Twitter are now gone. Public companies aren’t supposed to sacrifice mass for the for early adopters. They’re there to grow horizontally. Dancing for the early adopters is a great strategy, if your scale is right. If you embrace your 1,000 true fans, if you organize and connect and challenge and interest a group of people who can’t wait for the caravan to return, you can build a successful practice. Bob Dylan famously alienated his top 40 hits fans so he could go back to having his own circus. The Grateful Dead’s touring community was dismayed when they had their one and only hit, bringing a new wave of ticket buyers who weren’t part of the tribe. It takes guts to say, “no thank you” to the masses and to go back to having your circus. On the other hand, most tech companies and fashion brands lose their mojo and their masses when they try to be the regular kind. They either make the product stale and dumb, or go back to having a circus, but this time filled with compromises. "
449,Projects and the red zone,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/projects-and-the-red-zone/,"Many projects are never finished. There are countless broken and not-quite-fixed cars in garages. There are crafts projects, massive redevelopments and everything in between. They sit unfinished because of bad planning, lack of resources, and most of all, a lack of resolve and skill in overcoming challenges that might have been surmountable. Often, projects get done, but over budget and with missed deadlines. They hit roadblocks (some foreseeable) due to the difficulty of coordination, supply chains and the status quo, and they get done, eventually. This is the roadwork near my house–it’s been two years of construction, and without a doubt they’ll get there, but it’s slow and expensive going. Normal work, normally done, with plenty of delays and a bit of drama. The sweet spot is a project that is run by someone who has earned the skills to anticipate and deal with all the challenges that come up along the way. This isn’t a project where the deadline was met because of hope or good luck, but because effort and planning were put to good use. We see examples of well-run projects all around us. They show up when they’re supposed to because we organized to make that happen. The last kind of project is one that broke all the records and happened despite the obstacles. Unfortunately, these red zone projects create a lot of scar tissue and negative side effects. You might be able to do them once or twice, but you can’t rely on them. Which kind of project are you running right now? "
450,A deal’s a deal,"March 8, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/a-deals-a-deal/,"A fundamental building block of civilization is the understanding that contracts matter. Regardless of where someone is on the current political spectrum (from Alinksy to Mises), things can be understood to work better if the boss, the vendor, the client and the freelancer all consistently do what they said they would do. Regardless of who has more power or clout, especially then. Hustlers and con artists can try to cloud the discussion by bringing in irrelevant and emotional arguments, but we can come back to a simple understanding: If two independent entities, without coercion, agree to legally transfer effort or assets without harming others, that agreement should be honored. It’s a moral obligation, but it turns out that it’s also the most effective way to have things work in the long haul. Centuries ago (everywhere) and in some places (still), people and organizations with power can simply decide not to honor a contract or agreement. Stealing time, labor or other irretrievable assets is stealing. And theft isn’t a sustainable way to grow a society.  "
451,Creating value as an entrepreneur,"March 7, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/creating-value-as-an-entrepreneur/,"If you’ve borrowed money or sold shares, you’ll need to build something that’s worth more than your labor. Here are some key pillars where value lives: Customer tractionPermissionDistributionThe network effectSmallest viable audience Customer traction is the big one. Every day, are there more people who would miss you if you were gone? More customers who don’t want to switch to save a few dollars? More organizations that are building their future around what you do? Permission is the privilege of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to the people who want to get them. It’s not a legal construct, it’s an emotional one. Who wants to hear from you? Distribution is a practical way to measure brand. How much shelf space do you have? Mental shelf space and physical as well. The network effect is built into your product or service. Does it work better if I tell my friends and use it with them? Is this actually happening or are you simply hoping for it? And the smallest viable audience is the building block of all of this. Have you figured out precisely who it’s for? And do they agree? A startup exists to find and build assets like these. "
452,“I don’t know”,"March 6, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/i-dont-know/,"Particularly when it comes to the future. And perhaps about the past. More often than not, we find ourselves in situations where we don’t know. Where we can’t know. That’s a given. The open question is how often we claim that stance. If it feels uncomfortable or awkward to acknowledge that we don’t know, we’re pretty certain to lose trust, waste confidence and find ourselves in a jam now and then. Not knowing is going to happen. Acknowledging it is a sign of confidence and awareness. Finding leaders who have this skill is worth the effort. "
453,Rituals,"March 5, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/rituals/,"The things we do each day, every day, often arrive without intent. By the time we realize that they’re now habits, these random behaviors have already become part of how we define ourselves and the time we spend. Bringing intent to our rituals gives us the chance to rewire our attitudes. But first we need to see it. "
454,Choosing your problems,"March 4, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/choosing-your-problems/,"Perhaps you only acknowledge and focus on problems where you know and are comfortable with the appropriate response. Denying the existence of the other ones is easier than dealing with them. Or it might be that you only choose to see the problems that are actually situations, that can’t be solved, and that amplify our sense of hopelessness. It could be that you prefer the quick, urgent and easy problems, because solving them is thrilling. Or it may be the long-term, difficult and distant problems that show up on your radar, because after all, how could you be responsible? Problems don’t really care whether we acknowledge them or not. They still exist. What matters is how we choose to direct our energy, because our tomorrow is the direct result of the way we spend our resources today. Pick your problems, pick your future. "
455,The generosity of concealment,"March 3, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/the-generosity-of-concealment/,"Human beings never reveal all of our emotions. We don’t simply blurt out the first thing that pops into our head in a meeting, or insult someone upon meeting them. We’re able to give people the benefit of the doubt (which requires doubt before we can offer the benefit) and to plan for the long haul. And yet we do this essential work without thinking about it or working to get better at it. When we’re engaging with someone, both sides benefit. And a key part of our contribution to the interaction is a willingness to conceal emotions that would undermine the efforts of our partner in this work. There’s a lot to be said for honesty and directness. But concealment can be a generous tool if it helps everyone get to where they need to go. "
456,99 vs 0,"March 2, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/03/99-vs-0/,"If you get a 99% quality haircut or a 99% close-to-perfect meal, it’s better than good.  On the other hand, if the scrub nurse only does a 99% job of disinfecting the tools in the operating room, you’re still going to die of an infection. Some projects respond very well to ordinary effort and 99% perfect. In fact, the last 1% isn’t worth the time, the effort or the focus. Others fail if they’re not fully and completely to spec. Knowing the difference between the two saves everyone a lot of stress and avoids needless cost and avoidable disasters. We come out ahead when we put our energy into the projects that reward our effort and choose to meet spec with the others. "

The details are here. I hope you can make it. It’s possible that I’ve now written more bestselling business titles than any other author. Part of that is simply longevity and showing up, but most of it is your doing. The loyal readers of this blog (more than twenty years and still going) are the foundation of my career as an author, and I never forget it. The realities of the supply chain mean that my publisher needs to make difficult decisions about paper, printing and logistics long before the book ships. Organizing and talking with readers now helps make sure there are enough books in June… and hosting a conversation, QA and celebration always seems like a good idea. Pre-order a book, come hang out online. I hope you can make it. Thank you. "
458,The unaware snoop,"February 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/the-unaware-snoop/,"Here’s a breakthrough that’s about to happen somewhere: A GPT that reads every email that anyone in your organization has ever sent and makes it easy to ask it questions about what the entire organization knows. A person could probably not find the time, bandwidth or privacy constraints to do this. But this accessible but unembarrassed database tool could quickly become a huge asset for any organization that installed it–even a soloist. Tell me who I know or what I know about XYZ… Or consider the power of a network. If my colleagues opt in, I can simply ask the AI, “tell me who in my network is the person who knows someone at this organization, or is really interested in that topic.” Of course, there are huge privacy implications. But your work email has never been private anyway. "
459,Avert your eyes,"February 27, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/avert-your-eyes-2/,"There are things we avoid looking at too closely. If we looked, really saw what was happening, we’d have to change our minds, admit we were mistaken, refactor our priorities or take action. It’s so frightening that we even hesitate to make a list of the things we don’t want to look at. Because the list itself is frightening. If we don’t see it, it feels safer. "
460,The reality of chasing pop,"February 26, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/the-truth-about-pop/,"It’s tempting for a creator. To make a pop hit, a song or a book or a meme that becomes a popular idea and part of the culture. In our lifetimes, it’s become possible to imagine that you could even make a living creating pop. But pop is a harsh mistress, because pop means popular, which is, by definition rare and unfairly distributed. As long as it’s easy to create and rare to have a hit, there will be a huge majority of people who don’t win this lottery. And it is a lottery.  It’s tempting to believe that passion, skill and perhaps talent are sufficient to make a living in pop, but the math says otherwise. It’s available to all of us, but there’s no guarantee that you can make a living at it. "
461,The obligation of “none of the above”,"February 25, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/the-obligation-of-none-of-the-above/,"As we continue to face difficult choices and work to make things better, it’s quite likely that the alternatives being presented aren’t ideal or even appealing. Many organizations and communities are stuck because “none of the above” is the majority’s opinion, or perhaps the desire of those in power, or those with loud voices. But unless you’re willing to acknowledge that you’re simply being difficult, “none of the above” comes with the responsibility to describe a path that’s better. Because forward is the best option. Let’s go with one that makes the most sense–and if you don’t have a better plan, you should be responsible enough to back the one that’s most likely to work, even, especially, if you don’t like it. "

Add more blurbs. Push the press release to irrelevant people. Do one more ad. Use AI to create faux intimacy. Get the word out. Burn trust. Get more attention. In the last forty years, the amount of promotion has gone up exponentially. At the same time, the success of promoted content, products and services hasn’t increased at all. That’s because the secret isn’t to focus on your promo. The secret is to create something that those you serve want to tell others about. When other people do your promo, it’s not promo. It’s passion and sharing and generosity in community. Better is better than louder. "

And going forward, public life is going to be even more rumor-driven than it is now. Any video, any voiceover, any photograph–we can’t be sure. If YouTube or the Wayback Machine shows us that it happened after 2022, bring some doubt. AI and digital tools can produce a perfect voiceover, edit a video, forge a document… There have always been forces at work that prize disrupting our civic systems. But thanks to AI and digital deepfakes, it’s significantly easier to create and spread a story that simply didn’t happen. A speech that was never given, an interview that never occurred. Before mass media, every citizen only had the experiences they saw firsthand–and the rumors. Sometimes they were true, often, not so much. The ease with which someone can invent and spread lies is going to take most of us by surprise. It’s going to require an entirely new posture for understanding the world around us. Every day is April Fools from now on, let’s not get fooled. "

But the weather yesterday was pleasant. Hit songs are hits. But they’re rarely perfect. I’m a big fan of pleasant. And I often like things that are popular. Pleasant and popular are convenient, easy and riskless. The extraordinary, on the other hand, is often difficult. It can create change, challenge our perceptions and feel risky, all at once. Creating things that are beautiful is a choice and a quest, and most of the time, we’re simply seeking pleasant on our way to being popular. If we care enough to make it beautiful, we shouldn’t be willing to settle for pleasant. "

It’s subtle, it can be challenging for a good player, and it creates more magic and opportunity for everyone. Keep it closer: A simple rule change changes the dynamics. If you’re behind in the score, you’re allowed to turn any of your tiles over and play it as a blank instead. This self-corrects as the game advances. Points for bluffing: If you get away with playing a word that’s not in the dictionary, you get 100 bonus points. Now the game has social and risk elements as well. Make it fast: My friend Joanna pioneered a version where you work to place all the tiles as fast as you can. The more you play from the shared pile, the more points you get. There are lots of variations, but you get the idea.  PS I get an enormous amount of pleasure playing this app. By playing against the computer instead of other humans, it’s calming instead of enervating. There’s also a button you can press to see what would have been your best move, which will really help your game going forward. "

The hot rod is a car that is actually pretty safe, precisely because it doesn’t feel that way. You don’t have to drive very fast or take many risks to feel like you’re on the verge. The joy ride is dangerous because you don’t feel like you’re having fun until you push it really hard. And cars that go really slow and feel that way aren’t sports cars at all. When you need to turn something up to 11 and risk your hearing, your bank account or your sanity to actually feel anything, you’re on the road to an unhappy ending. I’m in favor of hot rod projects. You can go all in without risking everything. "

472,"Fidelity, compression and culture","February 14, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/fidelity-compression-and-culture/,"The alphabet is a miracle, one that is compounded by books. And the lessons we learn from this cornerstone of modern culture apply to organizations, meetings, tech, politics and almost everything we do together. Your copy of To Kill a Mockingbird contains every single word that Harper Lee had in the edition she signed off on. Even if the paper, the page count and the typography change, it’s a high-fidelity duplicate of the original.  She wrote the book using the same 26 letters that every author in the English language uses, and when you read it, it will reveal itself in precisely the same format as she intended. The fidelity is high. Every duplicate is the same. And the work isn’t compressed. It unfolds precisely as the creator intended–26 letters, all available to each author. This is different than AM radio or a song copy on a cassette. AM radio is compressed, and by the time it gets to you across the city, it’s also low fidelity. MP3s are compressed, but every copy is a high-fidelity duplicate of the first one. On the other hand, with cassettes, each copy loses something. Eventually the copies become nothing like the original. 800 copies later and you have nothing but static. Lossy compression is forever. Information was intentionally removed. What you hear isn’t what the artist heard in the studio, and all the equipment in the world can’t restore it. On the other hand, math and computers can now often give us reversible compression, but that’s a different discussion. We compress information because smaller files give us a chance for higher fidelity and cheaper networking. High fidelity means that each copy is what we expect. Lossless compression (or no compression) means that we haven’t left anything out in order to get the fidelity or sharing to work. Packaged food companies and makers of cheap chocolate prize the consistency of high fidelity (every bar is the same, if lousy) over the magic of something special. So they blend ingredients and dumb down the recipes so it’s always the same. This compression isn’t done in error, it’s something they work hard on. A Broadway show is high fidelity when you see it, but that disappears if you try to save it. You have to be there live, a reference recording on video isn’t the same. Telling someone about the show is not the same as seeing it. And the script is not lossy compression. In fact, the script is exactly what the playwright intended, but the director and the actors embellish the script in each production and performance. That’s part of their job. Sort of the opposite of compression. Gossip is compressed and low fidelity news of the community, and both get worse as it spreads. One of the miracles of email and the internet was how high the fidelity is (instant perfect copies, forever) and the ability for text and certain forms of other media to be uncompressed as they spread. Of course an MP3 can’t be turned back into the original reel to reel master recording, and a Wikipedia article changes over time. Language translations are lossy and also low fidelity. Nuance disappears as we swap one language for another, which is why a talented translator is so much more valuable than a computer doing the same work. And meetings? Meetings at work are largely low fidelity and ultimately quite compressed. Unlike a memo that can be in and of itself, a meeting is a performance, and then it’s summarized, and summarized again, until it becomes a story that’s a shadow of what the person who started the whole thing had in mind. Nuance disappears. Democracy is probably best served by high resolution and the non-lossy compression of ideas and arguments. Alas, the internet and TV, while adding speed and impact, probably lower the resolution and increase compression at the same time. As Jeff Jarvis points out in response to a great piece by Ted Chiang, GPT and other AI chatbots are essentially lossy compression mechanisms for the web. They read the entire web and compress it on demand into a few paragraphs. Like Cliffs Notes, one of the problems of this convenience is that it can’t be uncompressed. The nuance disappears and is difficult to reconstruct. Our lifetimes have seen this pendulum go back and forth, over and over. From black and white TV to color (this offers way less compression of the original image). From film in the theater to low quality streaming on a phone. From a landline phone conversation to a bad connection on a cell to a few characters in a text message. CDs sounded worse than a good LP, but SACDs and MQA can sound better in the right circumstances. Companies go from handbooks and memos to hallway conversations to Slack checkins. Lossy compression is forever. Fidelity is a powerful delight. Stories spread and resonate, but by their nature compress the truth of what we just encountered. A novel is the author’s complete telling of the story the way they chose to tell it, while history books and journalism always compress what actually happened. If you want to change the culture, or understand a technology in media, or do history, mess with fidelity and look for compression. Robert Caro is a low-compression biographer… And now, AI redefines fidelity altogether, sometimes embellishing what was there before and presenting something that might mistakenly be seen as a high fidelity original. And still, the alphabet is a miracle. High fidelity, low compression, resilient and widely distributed. "
473,With the sound off,"February 13, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/with-the-sound-off/,"If you’re watching a YouTube clip or a talking head, you can probably tell whether or not you disagree with someone even with the sound off. And we judge a book or an article on the layout and appearance long before we’ve read all the words. Human beings invented symbolic logic to make complex arguments based solely on the concepts in evidence. It’s a particularly advanced form of discussion, one that no other species is particularly good at. And we’re not good at it either. Bloviation, genre, anger, cultural identity and the transference of emotion all show up in our brands long before we’ve processed the rational truth of what’s being discussed. This is worth keeping in mind when you’re trying to persuade someone of your point of view. And even more important when someone is trying to persuade you. "

I’m excited to see them in person, but it’s also streaming live. I hope you’re able to come. While his impact on the musical canon is legendary, Ben’s ruckus extends far into how we lead, how we live and how we teach. The book he wrote with Roz Zander is rightly celebrated as a classic among business/motivation books, and I listen to it at least once a year. His TED talk is brilliant and I could go on…  For me, the biggest lessons come from his passion as a teacher. He views his musical practice as a chance to enroll others in a journey, and the volunteers in his orchestras find that this journey–the chance to lean into possibility, to fail, to connect, to hear and to be heard–changes their lives. At the heart of possibility is change. The passion for change is available to everyone: The title of this post comes from one of Ben’s students. Each is asked to write about the music they’re working on, their approach and the change they felt. Of course, any 14 year old could easily use GPT to compose a more professional essay, but these letters are far from the banal homework of a middle school student. Instead, the letters open the door to growth, to learning and to the humanity that we all seek. Possibility is wherever we look for it. "
475,Quietly change it,"February 11, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/quietly-change-it/,"When we think about altering a policy, a setting or even the outfit we usually wear, it’s easy to imagine that everyone is going to notice. In fact, almost no one will. That’s because no one cares about the noise in our head (or the actions we take) nearly as much as we do. You might think it’s going to cause a big commotion when you do something that’s inconsistent, but if it’s generous and useful, it’ll simply happen. We couldn’t noisily change it even if we wanted to. "

And yet, organizations and individuals “cheat at golf” all the time. They put clever clauses in the fine print. Spam a media list. Conceal the long-term impact of short-term decisions. Steal your data and use it behind your back… If they’re willing to do that, what else are they doing? The benefit of the doubt is priceless. And yet people waste it, every day. "
477,The magic of a page a day,"February 9, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/the-magic-of-a-page-a-day/,"In 1979, the page-a-day calendar was born. It’s basically a book on its side, but the user rips off a page each day. My friend Michael Cader took this concept and ran with it, creating calendars that sold millions of copies. Of course, everyone knows what day it is, and if you really need to know the date, well, that’s pretty easy to find as well. So why spend $20 on a block of pulped wood that tells you something you already know? It’s the combination of presence and tension. The presence of holding today’s message in your hand. “Bummer of a birthmark, Hal!” It’s today’s insight, and it’s real, right here and right now. And the tension of not knowing what tomorrow’s will be, and realizing that looking ahead isn’t part of the deal. I’ve always treated this blog as aspiring to a bit of page a day magic. The process of writing it gradually and having people read it that way is part of the appeal. So, when Michael asked me to (finally, forty + years later) make my very own calendar, it was thrilling. And this is the first printed one I know of that includes videos. You can pre-order one today. You’ll get it in plenty of time for January 1. No fair peeking ahead. "

But the people you serve… they might want something else. The few people you need to thrive in your work might want you to write something they’ll remember for a long time, or to take them on a journey that’s thrilling and challenging and unique. Or perhaps these are the people that want to buy something that costs a lot but is worth more than it costs. It’s okay to say, “it’s not for you,” to most people. In fact, that’s the only way to do work that matters. "

Just about any group can be stirred into a frenzy just by playing a few bars: The same goes Rapper’s Delight. And yet… Can you imagine how frightening it must have been to play it live for the first time? What if no one sang back? What if you the singer was out there all alone, with nothing coming back? This might be one reason why anthems are scarce. In just about every sort of community. If you’re not prepared to sing alone, it’s difficult to get to the point where people sing along with you. "

It’s possible to argue for systemic changes to cultural systems while also doing what classical economics posits that people do–which is focus on self-interest. In fact, it’s this very conflict that requires us to argue for systemic change. "
481,And then that happened,"February 6, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/and-then-that-happened/,"The world changes and we have a choice: • Fight hard to keep it the way it was. • Notice what happened and then decide to do something with that insight. Thirty years ago, AOL was my company’s biggest client. They charged users $3 an hour to use their precursor to the internet, and paid content providers a royalty based on time spent on their ‘site.’ We invented a breakthrough game that was played in a chat room. Our testing showed that people (millions of people, probably) would play it for hours at a time. We developed a series of games with AOL that were fun and engaging, and were a few weeks from launch. It was certainly the most profitable project I had worked on to date. And then AOL changed to flat rate monthly pricing. And the royalties went to zero. “Well, that happened.” The sunk costs were real, but the sunk costs didn’t matter. What mattered was that our project was built on a foundation that had disappeared. In less than an hour, we walked away from all of it, which enabled us to build the tools and products we needed. The world is changing faster than ever. Sometimes for the better. Always giving us a choice to react or respond. "
482,“What’s next?”,"February 5, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/whats-next-2/,"The way we think about our priorities makes a huge difference. Leaders of every stripe make one thing more than any other: decisions. In any environment with constraints (which is, actually, any environment), the decisions about time and resources–about what to do next–change everything. How do we decide what’s next? Is it based on urgency, proximity or values? First in/first out is not a strategy, it’s an excuse. Even worse is the one about the squeaky wheels. "
483,“No photos”,"February 4, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/no-photos/,"That’s what it said at the florist shop. I’m guessing because ‘taking’ a photo sometimes feels like a taking. The creativity, skill and effort that goes into making a distinctive arrangement might feel uncompensated when someone simply takes the work and posts it. This misses the real point, though. Once you’ve made something worth photographing, having the idea captured and spread helps you, it doesn’t hurt. More than ever, people are paying for famous, even if it’s as prosaic as a famous bouquet, produced by the originator of the design. The hard part is making something worthy, not protecting it from cameras. "
484,Confusion about performance,"February 3, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/02/confusion-about-performance/,"The thing that your product or service delivers could be called performance, and it’s made of two components: –The story and expectations and cultural impact of what you do (the story). –The deliverables that are objectively measured (the spec). It helps to have both. Many hard-working freelancers are confused about their story. Either they insist that their work is even better than it is, and they’re frustrated when others don’t embrace it, or they undersell the value of their presence, professionalism and effort. And many institutions, particularly those that measure the wrong things, put an enormous effort into what the lab specs show, but forget to invest in a narrative that encourages consumers to give them the benefit of the doubt.

What if it were paid for by congestion pricing, digitally implemented? What if public toilets were safe, beautiful, well-appointed and consistently maintained? What if there were a tax on empty storefronts, payable after three months of vacancy? Shortly after the invention of the car, society made many decisions about how cities should work. These choices led to parking lots, suburbs and a definition of what a normal city was supposed to be like. Robert Moses and others pushed for a specific sort of urban environment. It’s surprising how quickly and inexpensively that could begin to change. Doing the same thing since the dawn of the expressway, year after year, without seeing the pattern, is a little Groundhog’s Dayish. It helps to see it and then to talk about it. "

487,Get/Want/Have To,"January 31, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/get-want-have-to/,"Get to, want to and have to are an endless braid. How much of our time do we spend on each? Have to is often up to someone else. The things we’re required to do by the system or the people in it. Get to is a matter of perspective. Trust and health and leverage and privilege allow us to do certain things that others might not. And want to is a choice, and is often squandered. When our day is drawing to a close and we’ve done everything we have to, the choice of how to spend/invest/waste the next few minutes often ends up with mindless stalling or entertainment. The magic trick begins with realizing that the get to tasks are priceless want to moments if we choose. And, if we’re careful and plan ahead, we can get to the point where the have to agenda is something we can eagerly look forward to. When all three are in sync, things get better. "
488,Population and big innovations,"January 30, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/population-and-big-innovations/,"It’s tempting to embrace the meme that the best way for humans to solve the big problems in front of us is to increase the population, perhaps dramatically. The thinking goes that people are the ones who can solve problems, and more people give us more problem-solvers. This doesn’t hold up to a reductio ad absurdum analysis: clearly, a population of 10 people isn’t as good at solving problems as one with a billion, but at the same time, if there were a trillion people on Earth, that wouldn’t last long. There must be a number that’s optimal, but it’s probably not the biggest number we can possibly create. And reviewing the data on Nobel prizes per capita, or patents per capita, we see that there isn’t a correlation between population density and productive breakthrough innovation. It looks like innovations are more likely the result of a civil society, sufficient resources, enough productivity to enable spending on R&D and a culture of research and engineering. We also see geographic hotbeds of innovation over time (physics in Germany a hundred years ago, or network innovations in Silicon Valley a decade ago) that are the result of information exchange and cultural expectations, not population density. We don’t get these results by stretching the carrying capacity of our one and only planet. We can’t shrink our way to possibility, but we probably can’t get there via exponential expansion either. "
489,The coming ubiquity,"January 29, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/the-coming-ubiquity/,"The fuss about AI might be mis-focused. It’s easy to point to a computer-created essay, song or illustration and find the defects or errors. Given hard work by 1,000 trained people, it’s likely that a human could make something more useful or inspired than a computer could. But the real impact of AI isn’t going to be that it regularly and consistently does far better than the best human effort. The impact will be that it is widespread, cheap and always there. Search for anything and the Wikipedia page will ‘write itself’ just for you. Brainstorm 12 variations of a solution to any problem you’re thinking about. Have a Rogerian therapist and idea coach on call at all times. Press a button on your fridge and see a dozen recipes that use what’s in the produce drawer, and just that. Everywhere, all the time. Ubiquity is the quiet change we rarely see coming. "
490,New ways to codify purpose,"January 28, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/new-ways-to-codify-purpose/,"And then what happens? Many small businesses start with generosity and good intent at their core. But it’s a rough ride, and especially when outside funding is involved, it’s easy to get seduced by the bright lights of Milton Friedman and an obsession with short-term profits. Over time, purpose starts to fade. The urgencies and demands of quarterly results, the opportunities for growth followed by more growth make it ever more difficult to stick with what we set out to do in the first place. This post from Ari Weinzweig highlights a different way to stay on track, adding a level of structure to the good intent. It takes the sometimes mushy language of a B Corp and makes it legally and permanently part of the deal. By codifying the structure from the start, we’re creating organizations that have boundaries. Boundaries aren’t necessarily a defect–they can be a feature. A boundary gives us something to lean against (leverage) and it also communicates to our constituents exactly what we’re here to do. For a long time, we’ve been evolving in only one direction–companies that seek nothing but short-term investor returns, but do a lot of hand-waving along the way.  In a post-industrial business environment where people are more important than machines and where the consequence of our work are more vivid, it makes sense to bring intent to the forefront and keep it there.

491,Hobson’s choice,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/hobsons-choice/,"…is no choice at all. The stable owner gets to pick which horse you get. Take it or leave it. Some people prefer this. It means that we’re off the hook and not responsible. It relieves us of the emotional labor of choice. Let someone else worry about it… And so we give up our agency and our freedom, simply to avoid responsibility. The thing is, there is still a choice: The choice of whether or not to go into the stable in the first place.  Every time we choose a job, cast a ballot (or choose not to), or select a path, we’re making a choice. What happens after that is still our responsibility. "
492,Pay what you want,"January 27, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/pay-what-you-want/,"It’s a fascinating payment model. For digital goods and other transactions where the marginal cost of one more sale approaches zero, “pay what you want” exposes how complicated the story we tell about money can be. When we add in the charity component, it becomes even more layered. The Best of Akimbo (volume 1) is now available as a pay-what-you-want download. 100% of what you pay is a donation that goes directly to charity: water. The details are all here. There are more than five years worth of weekly episodes of my Akimbo podcast now available, and my producer Alex DiPalma and I have put together a five-episode best of. No ads, of course, no QA, just some culture-gazing you can dive into and even share. Other episodes are available wherever you get your podcasts. To date, readers of this blog have helped 34,000 people get a reliable source of clean water, with more than a million dollars donated so far. It’s hard to imagine something more generous, more life-changing or more urgent than bringing water to someone who needs it. Thank you. "
493,Grandiosity as a form of hiding,"January 26, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/grandiosity-as-a-form-of-hiding/,"A business that says its mission is to, “reinvent local commerce to better serve our customers and neighborhoods,” can spend a lot of time doing not much of anything before they realize that they’re not actually creating value. A non-profit that seeks to create “fairness and equity” can also fall into a non-specific trap. Far more useful to say, “we sell a good cup of coffee at a fair price,” and see if you can pull that off first. Google claims they want to organize the world’s information. But they began by simply building a search engine that people would switch to. We need a goal. But the more specific and measurable, the better. "

495,"Culture, care and typography","January 24, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/culture-care-and-typography/,"I’ve been fascinated by the way we set type since I did my first packaging forty years ago. It’s a combination of tech, art, systems, culture and most of all, deciding to put in the effort to get it right. [This is a long post, it would have been a podcast, but it doesn’t really lend itself to audio.] When airplanes first started flying passengers, there was a need for labels. Labels for passengers and pilots. WEAR SEATBELT WHEN SEATED. Why is it in all caps? My guess is that at the dawn of aviation, the machine that made the little metal signs only had the capacity to easily handle 26 letters, and they choose all caps. Certainly, over time the labeling tech got better, but we stuck with all caps because that’s what airplane signs are supposed to be like, even though they’re more difficult to read that way. Typography is a signal not just a way to put letters on a page. Before mechanical type was set by pressmen in the basements of newspapers, type was handwritten by monks. As a result, we see the beautiful kerning of letters, nestling the ‘a’ under the ‘W’. That takes effort and as a result, it simply looks right. It’s not right because your brain demands kerning, it’s right because the signal is something we associate with confidence and care. Once we see the magic of kerning, it becomes impossible to avoid how careless people who don’t use it appear to be… There have been many golden ages of typography, but the 60s and 70s saw a combination of high-stakes mass production (in ads and media) combined with innovations in typesetting that meant that instead of using handmade metal type, marketers could simply spec whatever they imagined. It also meant that instead of one person working on a document, a committee would spend days or weeks agonizing over how an ad looked, or whether the new layout of Time magazine would send the right message to millions of people each week. Pundits were sure that the launch of the Mac would destroy all of this progress. Now that anyone could set type, anyone would. So resumes ended up looking like ransom notes, Comic Sans became a joke that was taken seriously by some, and folks like David Carson set type on fire. Instead, the Mac and the laser printer pushed the best examples of type quality forward. Once again, culture combined with tech to create a new cycle. Now, small teams of people working on small projects could also agonize about type. Now, as beautiful typefaces increased in availability and diversity, it was possible to set more type, more beautifully. If you worked in an industry or segment where the standard demanded careful expression through type, it was possible and it was expected. More good type, a lot more lazy type. And then smart phones arrived. And the type culture changed in response. If you don’t have a mouse or a keyboard, if your screen is the size of a deck of playing cards, you’re probably not being very careful with typography. Whatever is built in is what you use. People create so much content that there’s no time for meetings, for care, for awareness. Speech to text, type with your thumbs, take a picture, hit send. The culture shifts. Now, the appearance of authenticity matters more than ever. And one way to do that is to not put on airs with fonts that remind us of craft, or kerning that reminds us that you took the time to do something more than the automatic minimum. And this won’t last, because the cycles continue. They say you can tell a lot about someone from their handwriting. For my professional life, my handwriting has always involved a keyboard. I know that even if people don’t consciously know that they’re judging the way our words look or sound, they are. "
496,The lonely zone,"January 23, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/the-lonely-zone/,"For many, the goal is to be the deciding vote, the donation that gets a cause over the goal, the person who counts. And often, we enjoy piling on. Once the cause or fashion or tech is clearly working, it’s easy and fun to say “me too.” More rare, more vulnerable and more important is to decide to show up in the lonely zone. When it might not work. When the originator really needs your support. When speaking up, donating or simply showing up feels like a risk or a waste. "
497,Overconfidence and AI,"January 22, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/overconfidence-and-ai/,"Human beings are often more effective when we’re a bit self-effacing. “I think,” “Perhaps,” or “I might be missing something, but…” are fine ways to give our assertions a chance to be considered. The solar-powered LED calculator we used in school did no such thing. 6 x 7 is 42, no ifs, ands or buts. Part of the magic of Google search was that it was not only cocky, it was often correct. The combination of its confidence and its utility made it feel like a miracle. Of course, Google was never completely correct. It rarely found exactly the right page every time. That was left to us. But the aura of omnipotence persisted–in fact, when Google failed, we were supposed to blame evil black-hat SEO hackers, not an imperfect algorithm and a greedy monopolist. And now, ChatGPT shows up with fully articulated assertions about anything we ask it.  I’m not surprised that one of the biggest criticisms we’re hearing, even from insightful pundits, is that it is too confident. That it announces without qualification that biryani is part of a traditional South Indian tiffin, but it’s not. Would it make a difference if every single response began, “I’m just a beta of a program that doesn’t actually understand anything, but human brains jump to the conclusion that I do, so take this with a grain of salt…” In fact, that’s our job. When a simple, convenient bit of data shows up on your computer screen, take it with a grain of salt. Not all email is spam. Not all offers are scams. And not all GPT3 responses are incorrect. But it can’t hurt to insert your own preface before you accept it as true.  Overconfidence isn’t the AI’s problem. There are lots of cultural and economic shifts that it will cause. Our gullibility is one of the things we ought to keep in mind. "

499,Amazon Smile gets a frown,"January 20, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/amazon-smile-gets-a-frown/,"I’m pretty sure how the first meetings went almost a decade ago: “Well, we’re paying our affiliates 5% for referrals. If we pay charities a tenth of that and call it a donation, it’ll be great PR and we’ll also make a profit on every sale because we won’t need to pay a full commission…” Amazon didn’t invent the online affiliate concept, but the company certainly turned it into a significant engine for growth. If a consumer bought a $100 item that someone in their program linked to, they would pay the referrer about $5. That meant they had little chance of actually turning a profit on that sale, but it led to millions of new customers, people who came back again and again. It also usually turned one sale into a few…  The end result is that Amazon has paid many billions of dollars in affiliate fees, and their affiliates (like Wirecutter, CoolTools, and formerly, Squidoo) sometimes built entire businesses around the simple idea that recommending a product and sending someone to the biggest online retailer to buy it could lead to income. Smile turned more than a million non-profit charities into affiliates at a bargain rate. Now, that $100 purchase turned into forty cents sent to the cause of your choice. I used to send you, my esteemed readers, to Smile links, but when I realized how little each donation was, I switched to geni.us, and so our donations went up 10x. To date, Amazon Smile has sent charities more than $500,000,000. That’s not a ‘donation’ of course, it’s simply an allocation of marketing spend. And yet, half a billion dollars makes them a very significant donor in aggregate, one of the biggest corporate donors in the world. So why cancel the program? I have a few guesses: Western industrial culture has had a hard time thinking about charity all the way back to Community Chest and the United Way. If the ‘game’ is to maximize profit, then sending money to good causes seems to undermine that. Some people argue that companies have a corporate social responsibility, that the compact they sign with the community is to not simply take as much profit as possible but to invest for the long-term well-being of the places they work and the people they work with. Or, as may be the case here, it’s simply a marketing tool. "

That opening the door for others makes it more likely that others will open the door for us. What makes it odd is the implication that if we don’t get, it’s hardly worth giving. But what if we separated the two and simply chose generosity because we could? It turns out that happy people are more likely to be generous. (Which implies that generous people are more likely to be happy). Not because they get something measurable in return, but simply because abundance is a choice. And making choices celebrates our agency and potential. What an opportunity to bring justice and care and dignity to the people around us.  Happy birthday. "

The week a book is published is an event, while the creation, publication and lifespan of the ideas in the book are a journey.

506,The platform and the curator,"January 13, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/the-platform-and-the-curator/,"Who has their hand on the dial? Talk with someone who works at Apple, Amazon, Google, Linkedin, Facebook, etc, and they’ll be happy to give you tips on how to work the platform to your advantage. How to get a bit more attention for your podcast or your website or your photos… Unstated in this helpful posture is an unseen bias: They have a platform mindset.  This is the opposite of the thinking at a record label or a book publisher or a newspaper. They understand that their most important job is curation–choosing what goes on the front page. Of course, platforms have long been curators, but they embraced the role instead of denying it. Radio station program directors decided what would be in heavy rotation and bookstore owners figured out what to put in the window or by the cash register. These platform leaders understood that their decision to promote something instead of everything was a key part of their job. The platform mindset is sort of helpless. The algorithm is in charge, they aren’t. The data decides, they don’t. In the short run, this bias feels helpful in a lot of ways. It eliminates gatekeeper errors. Since everything has a chance, being alert as a gatekeeper feels less important. When Decca famously turned down the Beatles, it was a mistake that cost them for decades. A platform executive doesn’t have to worry about this, since they can carry everyone and let the market sort itself out. But there are two problems with this chosen, learned helplessness: The first is that it’s simply not true. The algorithm doesn’t write itself. The rise in hate speech on platforms like Twitter is possible because the algorithm rewards it. The vapid recipes that people build on websites are there because Google’s algorithm rewards them. And yes, the noxious additional fees that airlines charge are there because the travel websites rank flights with hidden charges higher in the results than those that are honest about what it really costs. When platforms grow in scale, they often add hardworking, well-meaning people to engage the public, sort of a buffer between creators and the algorithm, but they’re instructed that the algorithm itself is sacrosanct and off limits. We sell everything, we don’t know how to sell any (particular) thing. Go to some meetings with Apple’s podcast team (the ones who apparently can make or break a podcast by promoting it) and you’ll soon realize that Apple isn’t really in the business of helping its many users find podcasts that will elevate, inspire and educate them. Instead, they’re simply feeding the platform. Netflix, in its best moments, succeeds because they break the platform paradigm and shift into curation. The second is that this platform-first agnostic non-curation ultimately leads to the demise of the platform. The aphorism is: Enough A/B testing will turn any website into a porn site. That’s because the short-term waves of data-driven, algorithmic feedback loops inevitably make platforms banal, then trashy. This is happening to Amazon–their Amazon Go stores in New York are dull. The search result spam on their site is worse. Inevitably, the people they most want to serve get frustrated, bored or bummed out and go somewhere else. What to do about it? Well, if you’re a creator, it helps to realize that you’re probably not going to be treated in a special way by any platform that has a platform mindset. There isn’t a shortcut, there are simply lots of dreary steps and then maybe some luck. And if you’re part of a platform that has scale (or hope to build one), this is the perfect moment to learn from the curation that came before. When we talk about the folks that built the parts of our culture that we’re proud of, we almost never talk about the platforms. We talk about people who had the guts and the taste and the energy to help others discover things that made a difference, all while winnowing out the cruft and the junk. We shouldn’t be here to feed the platform. The platform needs to be here for us. "
507,Three more questions,"January 12, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/three-more-questions/,"Pronouncements are more common than ever. It might be an insurgent announcing a way to change the government, a CEO with a bold new plan or an entrepreneur seeking funds. Or perhaps it’s a pundit or a critic, hard at work. Pronouncements are bold, definitive and dramatic, but they also seem to defy common sense. If you’re actually proposing something thoughtful and practical, perhaps you could answer three questions: It’s entirely possible that this is precisely the change we need and the change that will work. But when the pronouncer refuses to answer the questions, it should give the rest of us pause. "

509,The end of the high school essay,"January 10, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/the-end-of-the-high-school-essay/,"Good riddance. There’s not a lot of evidence that getting good at writing book reports or regurgitated essays under typical high school conditions leads people to success or happiness later in life. When typing became commonplace, handwriting was suddenly no longer a useful clue about the background or sophistication of the writer. Some lamented this, others decided it opened the door for a whole new opportunity for humans to make an impact, regardless of whether they went to a prep school or not. New York City schools are trying to ban GPT3 because it’s so good at writing superficial essays that it undermines the command structure of the essay as a sorting tool. An easy thing to assign (and a hard thing to grade) just became an easy task to hack. High school essays had a huge range of problems, and banning the greatest essay device since Danny Dunn and his Homework Machine is not the answer. In fact, it’s a great opportunity to find a better way forward. The first challenge of the essay was the asymmetrical difficulty in giving useful feedback. 30 essays, 5 minutes each, do the math. It doesn’t scale, and five minutes isn’t even close to enough time to honor the two hours you asked a student to put into the work. As a result, the superficial inspection system led to the second challenge: Students get more points for good typing and clear sentence structure than they did for actually thinking deeply, questioning the status quo or changing their minds. If you grew up in a household with verbally agile family members, you probably did way better on essays than your peers, but not due to much effort on your own. The third challenge was the lack of clarity about why we were even bothering to have kids write essays. Clearly there wasn’t an essay shortage. Ostensibly, it was either to prove that they read what they were supposed to read, or that they were able to create cogent and persuasive arguments and analysis. Essays were a signal that you could read and you could think. Except… They were actually a signal that you could do just enough work to persuade an overwhelmed teacher that you were compliant. So, now that a simple chat interface can write a better-than-mediocre essay on just about any topic for just about any high school student, what should be done? The answer is simple but difficult: Switch to the Sal Khan model. Lectures at home, classes are for homework.  When we’re on our own, our job is to watch the best lecture on the topic, on YouTube or at Khan Academy. And in the magic of the live classroom, we do our homework together.  In a school that’s privileged enough to have decent class sizes and devices in the classroom, challenge the students to actually discuss what they’ve read or learned. In real-time, teach them to not only create arguments but to get confident enough to refute them. Not only can the teacher ask a student questions, but groups of students can ask each other questions. Sure, they can use GPT or other tools to formulate where they begin, but the actual work is in figuring out something better than that. At first, this is harder work for the teacher, but in fact, it’s what teachers actually signed up to do when they become teachers. This is far less cohesive and controllable than the industrial model of straight rows and boring lectures. It will be a difficult transition indeed. But it’s simple to think about: If we want to train people to take initiative, to question the arguments of others, to do the reading and to create, perhaps the best way to do that is to have them do that. We’ll never again need to hire someone to write a pretty good press release, a pretty good medical report or a pretty good investor deck. Those are instant, free and the base level of mediocre. The opportunity going forward remains the same: Bringing insight and guts to interesting problems. [More.] "
510,The myth of luxury goods,"January 9, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/the-myth-of-luxury-goods/,"Luxury goods are items that are worth more (to some) because they cost more. The cost itself is the benefit that is being sold. There used to be a correlation between superior performance and price. In 1900, an Hermes saddle or a Louis Vuitton trunk was arguably better built for the work it was put to. Today, though, a more expensive resort, bottle of wine or article of clothing is likely not the item of highest performance. It is simply a symbol that the purchaser is happy to understand and perhaps show off. Poor performance might even be part of the value proposition. Not only can you afford to pay extra, but you can afford to pay extra and have your feet hurt as well. "
511,Build a new one,"January 8, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/build-a-new-one/,"Entrenched cultural organizations and icons feel more permanent than they are. Network effects, brand power and the status quo can seduce us into believing that we’re stuck with what we have, but things are rarely as permanent as they appear. James Bond is bloated and dated. Idris Elba deserves the role, but that’s unlikely to happen. But Netflix could create a competitor, start with the old playbook but build something new, something more modern. College accreditation leads to bureaucracies and huge costs. But new ways of delivering learning can upend a hundred years of a dominant system.  The Olympics and FIFA are corrupt and built on old models of media and geography. New ways of organizing and amplifying talent could create a powerful force for change. Social networks like Facebook and Twitter seem like they will last forever. Until they don’t. Nothing much changes until someone cares enough to build an alternative. "
512,Just in time,"January 7, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/just-in-time/,"You may have noticed that when you eventually find something, it’s in the last place you looked. Mostly because after that, you stop looking. And when a long-awaited moment finally arrives, the respite comes just in time, when we’re at the end of our rope. That’s largely because if we give up before then, it never arrives, and because we can probably stick things out longer than we’d like to believe. Waiting for the hero to save us just in time isn’t nearly as productive as realizing that we have agency. We have the agency to quit when it makes sense to quit (ignoring sunk costs) and we have the agency to dig in deeper when it really matters (acknowledging that it might not work). When help does arrive, just in time, it’s worth celebrating. "
513,"Patterns, culture and theft","January 6, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/patterns-culture-and-theft/,"AI is here, and it can (or soon will) be able to draw, code, or write with more skill than most of us. It’s tireless, very fast and very cheap. Understandably, some creators are up in arms. They say that if an AI is trained on their photographs, their architectural designs or their cartoons, it’s a form of theft. This doesn’t hold up. If an art student studies all of Picasso’s 10,000 paintings and then creates a new painting that is clearly based on them, we call this the advancement of culture. The same is true if a writer uses a word that was coined by Shakespeare, or if a graffitist is clearly inspired by Shepard Fairey. That’s how culture evolves. Taking an idea isn’t theft. Taking an idea is an oxymoron. Ideas belong to all of us. We couldn’t and wouldn’t have it any other way. There’s no way to bake a cake, drive a car or write a sentence without using what came before. GPT and other AI tools don’t actually know anything. They’re pattern matchers and pattern extenders. And those patterns are called culture. (Aside: There’s a difference between copyright and trademark. Copyright is a small carve out to protect the actual craft of creativity and its specific outputs. Trademark is a way to signal to the world who made something. If someone uses AI to copy an artist’s style and then tries to pass it off as coming from the artist, that is theft. Theft of trademark. Different discussion for another day.) If a computer or a person steals your style, it’s an indication that you’ve made an impact on the culture. And the only response is to dig deeper and make another impact on the culture, not try to carve out your contributions to our shared modes of interaction. The only thing that allows creators to create is the work that came before. When we create, we add to that work so that others can do the same. "

515,Pareto optimality,"January 4, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/pareto-optimality/,"It’s easier to understand than it is to say. The baker and the blacksmith should trade. The baker can make a loaf of bread more easily and efficiently than the blacksmith, and the blacksmith would ruin her productivity if she stopped making rakes and horseshoes in order to put a loaf in the oven. If someone over there can do their particular work efficiently, and you can trade your particular work to them, everyone comes out ahead. It works even if the intermediate step is using cash. Sell your services to one person, use the cash to buy something from someone else. And yet–freelancers have trouble trading. We think we should do every job ourselves. That’s not only non-productive, it reduces the magic we have left for the work that only we can do. "
516,Hustles end badly,"January 3, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/hustles-end-badly/,"“They can always say no” is the mantra of someone who is hustling for attention, promo or a sale. But when you hustle a colleague or a friend, they can tell. They can tell that you’re being selfish, angling for a short-term win and trading something precious for something now. When we ask someone to do something for us that we wouldn’t recommend they do for someone else, an important bond is lost. Hustle belongs in hockey. "
517,Virtually no one,"January 2, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/virtually-no-one/,"Compared to the overall population, virtually no one built Wikipedia, virtually no one voted for that senator and virtually no one starts a business.

518,Arguing for inaction,"January 1, 2023",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2023/01/arguing-for-inaction/,"…is surprisingly easy. “We’ve done all this work and things haven’t gotten better,” so, apparently, we should stop trying and go back to what we were doing. “We’ve done all this work and things are getting better,” so that means that there’s no need to keep trying and we can go back to what we were doing. The status quo might not be ideal, but if we’re afraid of change, if we focus on the costs of doing the work to make things better, it’s tempting to simply stay still. And the real fears of change are that it might work (which is scary) and that it might not work (which is heartbreaking). Easier to do nothing and simply settle. "
519,The world as it is,"December 31, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/the-world-as-it-is/,"No one sees reality. It’s worth repeating: No one accurately sees the world as it is. A person with hearing loss doesn’t experience the world the same way a synesthete does. A rock climber doesn’t see a steep slope the same way an elderly person does. And an optimist and a pessimist rarely experience opportunities in identical ways. And each is correct. Correct in that their experience of the world is their experience of the world. It’s not possible for anyone to actually see the world as it is. But there’s a significant opportunity we can work toward: To experience the world in a useful way. Not correctly, but usefully. If the methods you’ve used to judge other people, to choose projects or to make decisions have been helping you get exactly what you seek, congratulations. For the rest of us, there’s a chance to work on our filters, our habits and our instincts. To engage with the world and our choices in a way that’s useful. Today’s a perfect day to begin a whole new pattern. "
520,Learning in the new year,"December 30, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/learning-in-the-new-year/,"86,000 people have taken my Udemy courses over the last few years, and the first week of January is always a good time to lean in and learn. These are self-paced, video lectures. Udemy is offering the Modern Marketing course at 25% off for the next few weeks. The course for freelancers is my most popular, and is on sale as well. There’s also a short course on presentations. And if you’re thinking of starting a workshop (workshops are interactive, and cohort-based, not linear like these Udemy courses), here’s a link to a course on what I’ve learned in building these over the years. It’s half off for the next few days.  Here’s to a happy and productive new year, filled with possibility and peace of mind. "
521,Logic is a special case,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/the-flaws-in-the-argument/,"We agree on so many things. Productive arguments are scarce, because they depend on shared constructs of reality. And arguments are a luxury, because they allow people to engage around ideas without resorting to external forces or authorities for resolution. An argument might be flawed because it relies on facts that aren’t in evidence. If you’re asserting that X happened and it didn’t, the rest of your argument is hard to deliver. And the argument might be flawed because even if X is true, it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter because in the reality we are in, the logic of this argument doesn’t hold up, X or no X. Or the argument could be weak, because the words are non-specific, and change in meaning as you go. Feelings are real, and they can be shared. By all means, let us know. Feelings aren’t arguments. They are different. Arguments have evidence, specificity and logic that enable us to see how things are and to make them better. Better to share our feelings than to pretend we have an argument to make. "
522,Insightful data is called information,"December 29, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/insightful-data-is-called-information/,"Data is everywhere around us, and most of it is simply noise. The purpose of information is to inform, to help us change our minds. Information has a point of view, it’s useful.  It turns data into actionable truth. Getting more data isn’t the hard part. Turning it into information is.  About a year ago, 300 volunteers came together to create The Carbon Almanac. Yesterday, we won Book of the Year at the Data Literacy Awards. Some of the charts and graphs in the book went through thirty or more iterations. Every one was fact-checked, footnoted and shared with dozens of reviewers before it was included. There are countless ways to present data, but very few of them turn it into information. I’m lucky to have stood next to the insightful, skilled and focused experts who put so much into explaining what’s happening all around us. I hope you can check out the work. And share a copy. Here’s to a new year filled with peace of mind and possibility. "

It simply means that culture works because, for a moment, a group of people share a history, an understanding and a point of view. When a design or a song or a riff fails, it might be because there weren’t enough insiders to get it. "
524,Scale and the small business (freelancer grid),"December 27, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/scale-and-the-small-business-freelancer-grid/,"The industry giants want tonnage. Undifferentiated, commodity-priced, regularly delivered, consistent work for hire. They’re not going out of their way for freelancers that are bespoke, artisanal or even ‘better.’ They simply want to meet spec at the best price. They can keep you very busy, and they might even pay on time. There are a few rare birds, large potential clients that want freelancers who will give them something unique and hard to replicate. They know that what they want is scarce, and pay appropriately. Not many of them out there. If you find one, treasure them. This leaves us with the last two categories: By far the most common is the waste of time. These small businesses want to be (or pretend to be) industrial giants, but simply want commodity pricing, in small volume and with lots of last-minute changes. Obviously, the smart freelancer avoids these folks, no matter how well-meaning they are. This leads us to the sweet spot. The client who wants you, with all your uniqueness, pricing and magic. The one who pays a lot and gets more than they paid for. They will be easier to find if you look for them. And especially if you are actually offering unique magic. "
525,How long is forever?,"December 26, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/how-long-is-forever/,"And how soon is never? Most organizations are fundamentally incapable of planning ten years out. When a company promises to be carbon neutral by 2030, they’re actually saying that they may never be. That’s because almost all the pressures on them are short-term pressures. And it doesn’t help that few people expect to be in the same job or even at the same company then. So it’s easier to simply describe something in the distant future and then “go back to work” where work means obsessing about the short term. Of course, it’s not just companies that do this. Individuals do too, and companies are simply groups of people. Changing our definition of ‘now’ and ‘later’ is a powerful competitive advantage. "
526,Our dreaming opportunity,"December 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/our-dreaming-problem/,"School and work push us to avoid real dreams. Dreamers are dangerous, impatient and unwilling to tolerate the status quo. Existing systems would prefer we simply fit in. The dreams we need to teach are the dreams of self-reliance and generosity. The only way for us to move forward is to encourage and amplify the work of people who are willing to learn, to see and to commit to making things better. It turns out that reading and writing are the cornerstones of this practice, now more than ever. These are the two skills most likely to produce exponential results. The effective writer can see their ideas spread to a hundred people overnight, or perhaps a million. Writing is still the bedrock tool we use to codify and share ideas, and it forces us to organize our thoughts. But we can’t say it until we see it, which requires the commitment to reading and understanding, combined with the guts to dream and to lead. Find the others, see the problem, and then decide to do something about it. "

A statement about how you walk on this planet. What’s a job for? A way to pay the bills. How you spend your day. What you talk about at parties. A sense of purpose. A chance to dream. The people you connect with. Something to be proud of. A statement of self-worth and dignity. The opportunity to make a difference, or a chance to regularly lower your status. What’s a wedding for? A ceremony to memorialize a long-term commitment. A statement of status. An extension of historic male dominance. A chance to make a statement against the patrimony. Playing within the rules and standards of a community. Deliberately challenging those rules. A statement of mutual self-esteem. A party, perhaps the biggest you will ever host. Scarcity, deciding who comes and who doesn’t, and abundance, using resources to extend the boundaries. What’s a house for? A safe place to live. An investment. A transaction with a broker.

528,Protecting the sore spot,"December 23, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/protecting-the-sore-spot/,"Everyone has one. It’s the part of ourselves we won’t look at, acknowledge or risk disturbing. It’s the story or trauma or situation that must be avoided at all costs. People will choose careers, families and opportunities simply to avoid confronting the little tiny voice that is hiding inside. And marketers with low standards will brazenly manipulate us to extract money spent to protect the sore spot. It’s almost impossible to make it go away. But if we’re brave enough to acknowledge it exists, it’s possible to help it take up far less room. "

When your client or your boss turns down a great idea, it’s tempting to focus on the idea and how right you were. It might make more sense to try to find empathy for the fear and status issues that the client has instead. Because those issues probably got in the way of them ever seeing what you had to say. “Okay, that happened.” Now what? Interhuman events are often more complicated than we give them credit for. "
530,Switching gears,"December 21, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/switching-gears/,"When a car is switching gears, the engine is providing no forward power. And it’s more difficult to steer, brake or otherwise control the forward motion of the car as you change it from one gear ratio to another. And yet, the only way to effectively switch gears is to do it while moving. To use your forward momentum to overcome the pause in the engine’s power. If you keep trying to accelerate without switching gears, you’ll blow out your engine. It’s a pretty useful metaphor all around. "

It depends on how much space you have, whether you like this brand, how full your cart is and whether or not you’re sure if the person who sent you to the market wants you to buy two. It’s easy to focus on these sorts of low-value decisions. There are organizations that spend far more time discussing a new logo than analyzing where to place the new office. One is filled with emotion and no economic importance, the other is fuzzy, complicated and incredibly expensive. Perhaps you’ve seen someone spend emotion and focus figuring out a tip to the penny, but impulsively use credit card debt to go on a fancy vacation. Marketers have pushed us to spend as little time as possible thinking about things like long-term debt, the implications of going to a famous college or the lifetime emissions of buying a certain kind of car or house. But we end up spending countless cycles on the trivial choices that make us feel like we have control over the world around us. We may believe that if one takes care of the little things, the big ones won’t matter. Or the opposite. It turns out that staring at an uncomfortable big decision might pay for a thousand of the little ones. "

It seems like the structure we live with and struggle with and sometimes work against is pre-ordained and obvious, but much of it is the result of the origin of the consumer net. Slow modems in particular. When the WELL and AOL and other services began to define how billions of people would eventually connect, the physics were clear: We had incredibly slow connections We had dumb, underpowered computers That meant that a central server was essential, and the person who owned that server was likely to want to make a profit. Which led to: And so we ended up with the following expectations: In 2022, just about everyone online has a connection speed at least 1,000 times faster than the original consumer dial-up modems, and a computer that is as powerful (even if it’s a phone) as those original hosts. If we cared enough, we could imagine a federated internet. One where the control and the power doesn’t lie with a single corporate titan with whims, with lock in and with spam, but with individuals showing up much more like we do in real life, owning our words and our data and our participation.

And then it became widespread, because typing the right things into Google makes it more likely you will find what you’re looking for. (True aside: When I worked at Yahoo, they had a secret list of the 100 most searched-for terms. It was secret because it was filled with juvenile Playboy-level porn requests as well as pretty unsophisticated single-word searches. And the number one search was: “Yahoo”) Now, with GPT and Stable Diffusion and other machine learning AI tools gaining widespread use, there’s a gap between people who are simply stumbling around with silly short prompts and folks who are figuring out how to engineer an excellent prompt. We’re all the boss. Giving better instructions gets better results. "
538,Sooner or later…,"December 14, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/sooner-or-later-3/,Random events are unevenly distributed and rarely arrive on time. Resilience and frequency increase the chances that the break we are hoping for will arrive when we need it. The resilience to keep at it so that we can live with later instead of sooner. And the frequency of interaction and shipping so that we get more chances for the good to happen. 
539,It was only a matter of time,"December 13, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/it-was-only-a-matter-of-time/,"The question, of course, is how long? We’ve been working hard on fusion for sixty years (using ‘we’ to include myself with all of humanity, not because I’m a physicist). The Post writes: “To most of us, this was only a matter of time,” said a senior fusion scientist familiar with the work of the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, where the discovery was made. If fusion arrives in a workable fashion in the next few years, the entire world changes, forever, and for the better. Geopolitics and the axis of colonialism/petrostates will be quickly rewritten. Climate issues will be transformed. Our ability to feed, house and enrich the lives of billions of people will be dramatically amplified. There are lots of things that are inevitable eventually. Betting on the arc of history often turns out okay.  The hard part is figuring out how long eventually is. And then doing what we can to help it arrive. "
540,And what if you can’t tell?,"December 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/and-what-if-you-cant-tell/,"Our stories about brains are all invented. If a stunning surrealistic painting turns out to have been painted by an elephant or a toddler, does that make it less beautiful? If an essay on the nature of reality was written by GPT-3 or a Tufts scholar, does it matter? There are people who have no voice in their heads–they function as ordinary humans, except without the jabbering noise some of us call ‘consciousness’. Are they still human? If a book was written by a ghost writer, or a team of ghost writers, does that make it less of a book? Not worth reading? At some point, these aren’t simply philosophical debates. Given the connected nature of our economy and the advances of AI, these questions are showing up in our lives every single day. All of the intent that we’re busy assuming that other creators have is invented. By us. The stuff we interact with, created by us, by animals and by computers, it is simply the result of synapses firing away. We invent the story of its creation for our own satisfaction and sustenance. "
541,"Attention, trust and GPT3","December 11, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/attention-trust-and-gpt3/,"When AI is smart enough to write an essay, then what happens? GPT3 is back in the news, because, as expected, it’s getting better and better. Using a simple chat interface, you can easily ask it a wide range of questions (write a 1,000 word essay about Clara Barton) that certainly feels like a diligent high school student wrote it. Of course, this changes things, just as the camera, the typewriter and the internet changed things. It means that creating huge amounts of mediocre material is easier than ever before. You can write a bad Seinfeld script in about six minutes. It means that assigning rudimentary essays in school or average copywriting at work is now a waste of time. But mostly it reminds us that attention and trust don’t scale. If your work isn’t more useful or insightful or urgent than GPT can create in 12 seconds, don’t interrupt people with it. Technology begins by making old work easier, but then it requires that new work be better. "
542,Don’t let a story get in the way,"December 10, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/dont-let-a-story-get-in-the-way/,"The thing is that facts almost never get in the way of a good story. Because a good story feels true. A good story resonates. A good story is based on our feelings, long-held and hard-earned. A good story sticks with us, regardless of the facts. If I bring facts to rebut your story, they will fail… unless the facts I bring are the foundation for a new story, a story about doing something smart, based on evidence or simply more effective. But facts alone have little chance in a battle with a good story. Part of the job of making change is working to make sure a bad story doesn’t get in the way of good facts. "
543,The best job you ever had,"December 9, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/the-best-job-you-ever-had/,"Would you fill out this simple, quick and informal survey for me? We spend most of our lives at work. And yet we don’t spend much time talking about it the opportunity to make it worthwhile. Thanks. "
544,“You’re right”,"December 8, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/youre-right-2/,"If a customer, a colleague or a friend is generous enough to share their feelings, those feelings are what they are. We might disagree with the assumptions that led to those feelings. But acknowledging that the feelings are real is a great place to begin a conversation. “You feel this way” is not the same as “Everyone who experienced what you experienced would feel the same way.” "
545,The eggplants before Richard Nixon,"December 7, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/the-eggplants-before-richard-nixon/,"For thousands of years, eggplants have had ‘features’ like this. But once we learned what they resemble, we can’t unsee it. It used to be a weird shape for a vegetable, but now it looks eerily like a former President. Once we find a hook, we can’t forget it. Our job as story tellers is to find one of those hooks. PS a fabulous holiday gift box from Megan Giller (ethical, delicious chocolate) is right here. "
546,The Massie Effect,"December 6, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/the-massie-effect/,"Put this one next to Dunning Kruger, which shows that people of low ability traditionally overrate how talented they are. The Massie Effect is the tendency of people who support good causes to believe they are in the minority. A study at Princeton showed that almost 80% of Americans believe we should take action on the climate, but those people believe that only 37% of their fellow Americans agree with them. Feeling like an overlooked minority can let us off the hook. It can give us a chance to embrace our imagined position as leaders. But mostly, it undermines the confidence we need to actually take action. If you care, it’s likely others do too. "
547,Expertise,"December 5, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/expertise/,"In a competition between someone who knows the most and someone who is willing to learn the most, the edge usually goes to the curious and empathic professional, not the one who is simply protecting what’s already known. "
548,When we look in the mirror,"December 4, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/when-we-look-in-the-mirror/,"When we look in the mirror, who do we see?  [A note I sent to a young friend.] The person we see when we look in the mirror is the person we become, the person we fight to defend and persist with. If you see someone who doesn’t have a lot of friends, then every time a potential friend comes along, you will find a way to distance yourself from the heartache of being rejected, and you’ll continue to not have a lot of friends. If you see someone who isn’t happy with inputs you can’t control, then when new inputs come along, you’ll find something wrong with them and seek more control not less. If you see someone who thrives on challenges, challenges will become a chance to thrive. Each day gives us the best chance in the world to see a different person in the mirror. A chance to change the stories we tell ourselves. Airplanes rarely crash. It doesn’t matter. Turbulence isn’t fatal. It doesn’t matter. If you want to tell yourself a story about air travel, that’s your story and as far as you can take it, it’s true. It’s your story and no one can take it away from you. Perhaps you’re homesick. Home is great. Home is wonderful. Missing home is a sign that you have a home worth missing. Being homesick is a story we tell ourselves about who we are. But who will you become? Who can you become? It turns out that when you’re surrounded by people who care about you, when you have freedom and a chance to lead, you can become a different, more generous, happier, more powerful, more friended version of yourself. If you want to become the kind of person who can teach an 8-year-old how to play basketball, you can start doing that right now. If you want to be the kind of person who leads, you can begin to lead. If you want to. Because you’re smart, you care, you have something to say. Because there are people who love you and care about you. And the best way to honor those people, and honor yourself, is to become the person you were born to be. If you want to. Today is the best day to begin that journey. If you wait, it gets harder. Who do you want to be when you look in the mirror? "
549,Confidence doesn’t help win the lottery,"December 3, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/confidence-doesnt-help-win-the-lottery/,"It doesn’t matter how sure you are that this is a winning ticket, the ticket doesn’t care. And there are lots of lotteries in our lives. I was talking to a fifteen-year old the other day. He’s decided to devote the next decade of his life to getting drafted to play in the NBA. Without a doubt, effort and skill make a huge impact on whether you’ll even make the final 5,000 people who have a shot at making the NBA. But after that, it looks a lot more like a lottery than a meritocracy. The resilient approach is to bring discipline and effort to the work, but to know, deep down, that you better have a plan B. That’s not a lack of faith. That’s simply smart. "
550,Accounting (and small business),"December 2, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/accounting-and-small-business/,"Every small business needs a bookkeeper, but few take appropriate advantage of accounting. Accounting is a way to turn organized books into insight. Particularly: "
551,The reasons search seems to be getting worse,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/the-reasons-search-is-getting-worse/,"Even with the powerful Ecosia engine, but especially with Google and Amazon, it’s getting rarer and rarer that a search feels as though it finds just the right site or product or information on the very first try. There are a few reasons for this: "
552,Books for your solstice,"December 1, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/books-for-your-solstice/,"In the Northern Hemisphere, it gets dark in December. And worldwide, people buy gifts for whatever holidays they celebrate, and a lot of them are around the corner. For both reasons, books! The Carbon Almanac was an Amazon Editor’s choice, a Do Lectures top 100 choice, a bestseller in every country it has been released in and ideal for anyone over the age of ten. Several organizations are buying a copy of the Almanac for their annual gifts, and if enough of us share enough copies, the world will change. It already is. Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow is a magical romp, a heartbreaking love story and a ton of fun. The Flavor Equation is a terrific cookbook and also a useful inquiry into taste. The audiobook was free with my membership, but I confess that the hardcover is a lot more useful and a better gift too. Kafka on the Shore is a mind-bending coming-of-age story, and the audiobook is simply perfect. All the Birds in the Sky is poignant, fun and it will make you think. A lot. The Very Nice Box is a lovely book with a message that will resonate. Whether it’s by candlelight or on a beach, I hope you have a lovely end to the year. "
553,All the marbles (and quick money),,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/12/all-the-marbles-and-quick-money/,The problem with winning all the marbles is that the game is then over. And owning all the marbles is not really worth the effort if it means no one else has a chance going forward. And quick money? It pales in comparison with money earned over time for a job well done.  
554,My pickup truck is faster than your Ferrari,"November 30, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/my-pickup-truck-is-faster-than-your-ferrari/,"Culture shifts. But it’s held in place by norms, and those are driven by status and affiliation. No one actually needs a car that can accelerate one second faster than most other cars. But having one confers status in some circles. But what happens when a new generation of technology makes that previously fast car not the fastest anymore? Is it still a luxury good? Mink coats used to confer some sort of prestige in some circles. What happens when a Patagonia jacket is warmer, more durable, cheaper, lighter, less cruel and easier to wear?  A big steak dinner was a way to express generosity and hospitality. What happens when you live in a community where steak isn’t seen as generous any longer? Perhaps a master of the universe can point out that he can be at the meeting tomorrow simply by hopping on his private jet. Is there more status in being the one who can save time and overhead simply by dropping in via Zoom? A big office may no longer be more prestigious than a resilient, productive workforce that works where it wants to. A loud factory crammed with workers might not be the sign of power and influence that it used to be. Smokestacks used to show that a city was on the move… In many cases, luxury goods cease to have status when they make the owner look stupid. Norms seem normal. Until they’re not. "
555,Don’t rush,"November 29, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/dont-rush/,"Hurry, sure. We need to hurry. Hurry puts it up on our priority list. Hurry gives us urgency and focus. But rushing is something that leads to errors and then apologies. “I’m sorry, I rushed it,” is not something we want to hear.  But hurry. "
556,Vast vs specific,"November 28, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/vast-vs-specific/,"Try to fit in every general and conceptual detail when describing a very big concept and it’s likely that we’ll be confused. When you’re intent on explaining all of it, we glaze over. Consider switching gears and sharing the most specific possible example with impact and humanity instead. If we’re sold on where you’re going, we’ll probably spend the time to learn how to get there. "
557,4 D Chess,"November 27, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/4-d-chess/,"Perhaps that super-genius is playing a very well-thought-out long game, anticipating every countermove with plenty of resources and alternatives at hand. It might be the local business you’re competing with, the publisher you hope to work with or the general of the opposing army. It’s easy to imagine that they have a view of the competitive landscape that escapes ordinary humans. But it’s far more likely that they’re simply winging it. In the early stages of a campaign, winging it is a form of poking the box. A chance to try new approaches to see how the system responds. But if we confuse a policy of winging it with a long-term strategy of well-planned, strategic 4-D chess, it’s not going to end well. Because winging it doesn’t stay resilient at scale. "
558,You left out the all caps part,"November 26, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/you-left-out-the-all-caps-part/,"If you see a set of rules that don’t make sense, that are overly stern, that seemed designed to be offputting instead of helpful, it’s possible that the poster is leaving part of the memo unsaid: It could be something like: THE LAST CUSTOMER WAS UNFAIR AND UNKIND! And so the list of rules to make sure that this never happens again, even if the next customer isn’t like that at all. Or: WE’RE STILL REELING FROM THE UNEXPECTED THING THAT IS PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN, BUT ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THE TRAUMA IS TO ERECT SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS SO WE’RE SURE IT WON’T HAPPEN AGAIN. Or: WE GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE LOVED BOOKS AND THE PEOPLE WHO BUY THEM, BUT THE REAL REASON IS THAT WE MISTAKENLY THOUGHT WE COULD MAKE A GOOD LIVING WITHOUT ANNOYING PEOPLE BOTHERING US! ESPECIALLY CUSTOMERS AND PEOPLE WHO CAN BRING US CUSTOMERS. THIS IS MUCH HARDER THAN WE THOUGHT, AND WELL, MAYBE IF WE MAKE A LOT OF RULES, PEOPLE WILL LEAVE US ALONE. You certainly don’t have to put the all caps part in when you publish your rules, but it might be helpful to write it out to be sure it’s what you really want to be implying. "
559,A paradox of status and power,"November 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/a-paradox-of-status-and-power/,"One can refuse to pay bills, bully employees, steal credit, work the refs and look for shortcuts… or pay bills ahead of time, elevate employees, amplify the credit of others and take the long road. While both are modern signifiers of a certain kind of success, only one is a resilient way forward. Ancient emperors that aspired to power often had their enemies beheaded. The ones with real power gave them clemency. "
560,An antidote,"November 24, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/an-antidote/,Gratitude might be the way forward. So much of what ails us gets a bit better when we say ‘thank you.’ Even when it’s hard. Especially then. 
561,How long is “never”?,"November 23, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/how-long-is-never/,"It changes. It changes as we age, and it changes depending on the situation. A second-grader might think that a boring class is never going to end. A bad cold might feel endless, unless we have the perspective of someone who has experienced a chronic problem. Some things actually deserve “never.” But most of what we’re worried about probably would be better categorized as “eventually.” "
562,People problems are complicated problems,"November 22, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/people-problems-are-complicated-problems/,"Engineering problems are difficult, but they have a right answer. People problems, by their nature, are on a spectrum, a distribution of possible forward paths. But they’re complicated. A situation might not fit a person, and vice versa. Add a second person and now you have two people, and two people interacting exponentially increase the number of possibilities. Knowing this takes the pressure off. Because there isn’t a perfect solution to a people problem. Simply an available path forward that helps us get to the next step. "
563,Contracts and power,"November 21, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/contracts-and-power/,"A written contract benefits the party with the least power. Power might be in the form of money, access to plenty of lawyers or simply a willingness to burn it all down to the ground. In the moment before a contract is signed, the lower-powered party momentarily has more power. That’s because the other entity wants what you have. But as soon as they have it, it’s only the contract that offers concrete protection against future events. Handshake agreements are great when there’s an ongoing, stable interaction. As long as each side is honorable, the other party can continue to do what they said they were going to do. But when priorities or outside factors shift, an at-will arrangement can end up harming the person who can least afford it. The two things to focus on are: This is why adding a binding informal arbitration clause to a contract is a smart idea. Why it makes sense for there to be worker and other protections in the law. And why we need to reinforce and applaud judicial systems that enforce clearly defined agreements. "
564,No competition,"November 20, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/no-competition/,"There’s no competition for cookbooks on making food out of soccer balls and hockey pucks. There’s no competition for software that charges you to find out the temperature on Mars. There’s no competition for a service that counts how many pairs of shoes you own. In fact, in every market that’s worth entering, there’s competition. That’s what you’re looking for. It’s a sign that people have a problem that they’re trying to solve through commerce. The goal isn’t to find no competition. It’s to find a better way to solve the problem. "
565,Micropayments for content,"November 19, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/micropayments-for-content/,"This is a problem that comes up every year or two, but no one has implemented a useful solution yet. Advertising is a surprisingly bad way for a culture to pay for content, because the kind of content that gets rewarded is often dumbed down for a large audience or is optimized for a small audience of people eager to buy something that makes a profit. It’s also inefficient, as advertisers can’t know in advance what’s going to work, and creators get a very small share of the ad spend. An alternative is to pay for what you get, the way we treat carrots, baseballs and clarinets. Instead of buying a baseball, though, you’re buying a chance to watch a video. Micropayments are a system where you pay a penny or a nickel or a dollar for a piece of content.  It introduces two kinds of friction, though: About thirty years ago, I described a simple solution to both problems: For $25 you can buy a content passport. It’s available for purchase on any website that is part of the content network, and you need one to read the content on their site. The site that sells it to you gets $10 in commission for selling it to you. It keeps track of every member site you visit (that’s really easy now, with a cookie). And then the coordinator of the system allocates, on a percentage basis, $10 to the sites you visit. It’s all gonna go somewhere, whether you visit one site or a thousand. There’s no friction, because it’s a buffet, just like it is now. Read all you want, no ads, no hassles.  The sites that get visited the most get the most aggregate money from the monthly distributions of royalties. Each site has an incentive to sell a lot of passports (the commission is significant) and the coordinator of the network is making 25% as well. It’s really clear who the customer is (the reader) and it’s easy for any site to join the network. Aligned incentives, a simple and resilient solution. Have fun. (PS this is unrelated to yesterday’s post about federations, just a coincidence.) "
566,Some thoughts on Mastodon,"November 18, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/some-thoughts-on-mastodon/,"It is, by far, the fastest-growing social network in history, growing more than 20% in about a week. And yet it didn’t stutter much. How can this be?  It’s a network in the real internet sense of the word. It’s not just a network of users, it’s a network of servers as well. No one owns it. Like email, it’s a set of principles and rules, not a place. A federation is different than a corporation. It might not be as shiny, but it’s far more resilient.  It’s inconvenient. You can’t get started in ten seconds. This leads to less initial stickiness. It means that the people who get through the learning curve are more likely to be committed and perhaps generous. In the early days of email, of Compuserve, of AOL, of the web, of just about every network I’ve been part of, these early users created a different sort of magic. It never lasts, but it’s great to see. I started one of the first internet companies in 1990, and the new frontiers tend to rhyme with each other. This might be one. Part of the power of a network is its distributed nature. That’s a plus when it comes to tech and innovation. It’s a minus when it comes to the speed of central agreement as well as the potential for abuse. Email never quite recovered from the open nature of inputs, which meant that spammers, scammers and hustlers could do what they liked, and the defense was imperfect filters.  The intentional decentralization of the Mastodon federation seems designed to make those filters more natural and effective, at the expense of a super loud amplifier in the middle. You can discover new voices and ideas, but there isn’t a megaphone at work, just begging to be hacked by selfish behavior. It’s a bit more like life and a bit less like traditional social networks that create controversy to earn a profit. And finally–the culture of this federation is still being created. A lot of the folks who just arrived will be the authors of that culture, and if they figure out how to be generous and kind, that’s what will get built. Alas, as is often the case, culture is up to us, particularly when the commercial bias is removed. I’m reposting my daily blog here, and might dip in from time to time, and I’m eager to see how this peer to peer experiment unfolds.  If you’re a developer with chops in APIs, apps, and what’s happening in the Mastodon world, I’d love to hear from you for some future projects I’m noodling on. Simple form is here. "
567,Sorry/thanks,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/sorry-thanks/,"If you often find yourself saying “sorry” in a way that doesn’t advance the conversation, it might be interesting to substitute “thank you” instead. So, “I’m sorry this came out of the kitchen after your other dishes,” becomes, “thank you for waiting so patiently.” And, “I’m sorry we got disconnected,” becomes, “thank you for calling back.” It’s a subtle shift, from separation to connection. "
568,Neither here nor there,"November 17, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/neither-here-nor-there/,"It’s tempting to imagine that mixing half a glass of milk and half a glass of orange juice might get you a hybrid that’s better than either. Alas, not so much. The goal is to find something that is in and of itself. That becomes the very best version of what you’re trying to do, the solution to the consumer/user/member problem you’ve identified. Here works. There works. But here and there and everywhere generally doesn’t. In a world filled with choices, specificity in service of extraordinary results tends to outperform. "
569,Now on mastodon,"November 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/now-on-mastodon/,"Update: You can subscribe to this blog by email (but it often gets filtered by our evil tech overlords.) You can also get regular daily updates via FB , LinkedIn, Twitter while it lasts, and now, Mastodon, a distributed, free alternative to more chaotic social media outlets. The best way to get it is by RSS. Unfiltered, fast, free and not noisy.  Just add this link to a newsreader. "
570,But how will it fail?,"November 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/but-how-will-it-fail/,"The wrong answer is, “it won’t.” If you buy a piece of tech, it will break. If you buy an asset of some sort, it’s likely to go down in value one day. If you start a project, you will one day walk away from it. And everything that is alive will die. Refusing to answer the question doesn’t make it more likely that it won’t fail. All it does is make the failure more painful. "
571,Whining and status,"November 15, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/whining-and-status/,"Toddlers don’t get afforded a lot of respect. They whine all the time about how unfair things are, and it’s difficult to take them seriously. Lately, in our quest for victory, we’ve established that some winners get there via whining, and perhaps this is a useful strategy. It seems as though working the refs, blaming the conditions and questioning the score is all good as long as it helps you come out on top. In fact, whining isn’t resilient or scalable. People with confidence, power and reserves are able to admit when they are wrong, when things aren’t working and when it doesn’t turn out the way they hoped. If you’re hoping to demonstrate power, confidence or status, taking responsibility is a better signal than whining. "
572,Palliative care,"November 14, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/palliative-care/,"Few branches of medicine have created as much comfort, solace and relief. When we realize that traditional Western medicine is not going to be able to cure a life-threatening illness, the palliative care team is able to help. Instead of torturing and bankrupting patients, they can offer connection, humanity and closure. Too often, we view the fight as an unalloyed virtue. Instead of sharing our preferences and desires before we get ill (as though it’s some sort of bad luck charm), we simply hope for the best and then wait far too long (and create too much family stress) before embracing the next step in our journey. And, since I often look for metaphors, it’s probably worth noting that the same approach works for projects, companies and even relationships. We might all come out ahead if we focus on a productive and comfortable way to wrap things up, instead of fighting to the last moment. "
573,Placebos and objective reality,"November 13, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/placebos-and-objective-reality/,"A placebo is a human intervention that changes the story we tell ourselves. And those stories are powerful. They can alleviate pain, make wine taste better, improve our golf swing and even grow hair. Because the placebo is so powerful, we spend a lot of time and money on it. Entire industries (like fashion) are built on bringing people something that changes the way they interact with themselves and the world. If you think that copper bracelet is going to relieve your arthritis, it might. But in the last few generations, we’ve built more and more of our world on a foundation of measured, consistent engineering. There’s nothing you can add to your gas tank that will make your car mileage go up. It doesn’t matter whether you believe the car is running more efficiently–it either is or it isn’t, and it isn’t. If you’re a maker of placebos, then, it helps to recognize that what you do is change the story. The more a market is based on mutually agreed upon measurements, the less appealing it is to the maker of a placebo. "
574,The leaf blower parable,"November 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/the-leaf-blower-parable/,"It’s autumn in North America, and that means that homeowners and contractors are busy removing suburban leaves. It’s almost impossible to avoid the deafening roar of gas-powered leaf blowers. Here’s what we know, without doubt: We also know that: The solution, if we’re serious, is to ban gas leaf blowers. The replacements will pay for themselves in a few weeks. Once the competitive playing field is re-set, gardeners will come out ahead. Employee well-being will increase, and the leaves will still get blown. So what’s the problem? We’re not serious enough about making change happen. If we cared enough to get two dozen friends and neighbors to show up at the village hall, the regulations could be changed in a few meetings.  But sometimes it’s easier to do nothing. "
575,Always/Never,"November 11, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/always-never/,"_______ is [Always/Never] the solution to a problem. In my experience, “always” and “never” are rarely useful ways to approach a problem. “Sometimes” requires nuance and insight and discovery. It might not be the lazy response, but if you’ve got a problem, it might be worth thinking about how to solve it. "
576,Did the ad work?,"November 10, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/did-the-ad-work/,"Digital advertising has turned millions of people and organizations into not just the target of ads, but the advertisers as well. But it doesn’t easily answer the obvious question: Did that ad work? Long before digital ads were invented, my late friend Lester Wunderman coined the term “Direct Marketing.” This is measured, active advertising. Spend $10 on an ad and you’ll know by tomorrow if you made $20 or lost five. Lester helped invent the American Express card and grew the Columbia Record Club, among other direct marketing heroics. The secret is simple: Measure an ad, and if it ‘works’, do it more. And so, Google. Google makes billions of dollars selling direct marketing to organizations that aren’t being particularly brave, insightful or clever. They’re simply testing, measuring and repeating. On the other hand, ads on podcasts or Twitter almost never measure well. They rarely seem to ‘work’ in the P&L sense, because they’re brand ads, not direct ads. The purpose of a brand ad is to deliver a hard-to-measure but important feeling to the potential consumer. The brand ad tells a story, builds trust and most of all, helps a customer decide that this brand makes them feel good enough (hard to define) that they’ll pay extra for it. If you try to measure brand ads, like quarks and other quantum phenomena, the benefits disappear. The very things you would do to make them measure better cause them to be pretty lousy brand ads. Running brand ads in a medium that is counter to what the brand is trying to accomplish makes very little sense, regardless of how much it costs. On the other hand, sponsoring interactions that build trust and connection is hard to overpay for. All a long way of saying that advertisers in the digital space are finally spending more time and energy thinking about the places they’re advertising and wondering about whether they’re simply making more noise or actually making a difference.

It might not maximize our impact or enjoyment either. In fact, we each have a limited number of tickets to trade in. Limited time, limited opportunities, limited money and other resources. How will you spend today’s tickets? "

579,“I can’t go for that”,"November 7, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/i-cant-go-for-that/,"No can do. We drift. Our standards aren’t set in stone. They change over time, often based on the situation we’re in. This explains how cults or extreme views occur. Not all at once, but bit by bit. Until one day, people wake up and are shocked to discover that they’re advocating for (or doing something) that is clearly wrong. It didn’t make them uncomfortable yesterday, but the reality of what’s being done is so different from the person we’d like to be that a break occurs. The question is: If no one else was doing this, arguing for it, insisting on it–would we? Is it something you felt strongly about before the tribe and its leader took it on? We can avoid this by staying away from institutions that profit from pushing participants further than they’d want to go on their own. If the heroes are extremists (in any sense of that word) don’t be surprised if participants are pushed to be so as well. And even more powerfully, we can remind ourselves of our first principles, about what matters more than winning or being popular. Standing for something is a good way to avoid having someone stand on you. "
580,The long road,"November 6, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/the-long-road/,"What can we build for 2050? Thirty years ago this month, I created 18 Pine Street, a series of young adult novels with bestselling author Walter Dean Myers. He was a brilliant creator and a delightful partner. The kids who bought those books are having kids of their own now, and perhaps some of the books’ ideas around identity, agency and inclusion made a difference along the way. And twenty years ago, I produced and published Waiting for Godiva on SACD. It’s now on Spotify. It sounds even better than I remember. Beth and Michael made something magical on that single day we spent recording. When we’re in the middle of a project, it’s easy to imagine that it’s not going to be around for decades. But every project opens doors, for you and for the people you build it for. It doesn’t matter if it works for everyone, if it’s a worldwide bestseller or on the front page.  Oceans are made of drops.

581,The hodgepodge is normal,"November 5, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/the-hodgepodge-is-normal/,"Your house contains products from hundreds of thousands of suppliers and craftspeople. The food you eat comes to you from a very loosely coordinated (not organized, not controlled) network of millions of vendors and farmers. To read this blog, you’re using software from hundreds (probably thousands) of companies, all barely connected in time and space. In the Star Trek future, it’s all seamless, coherent and controlled. In fact, the hodgepodge continues to get more chaotic, not less. The work is to build and influence systems, not to seek to control it all. "
582,Habits are not needs,"November 4, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/habits-are-not-needs/,"It’s easy to imagine that they are, as it lets us off the hook as habits become negative, or even addictions. If someone else is thriving without the habit we seem to need, then it’s likely a desire pretending to be a need. For example: You can be a successful professional without spending time on social media. "
583,Fair and square,"November 3, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/fair-and-square/,"Fair is often in the eye of the beholder. What you think is fair might depend on where you are in the transaction. Losers tend to think an outcome is more unfair than winners do. But square? The thing about square is that everyone can agree on that part. If something is fair and square, then the losers can concur with the winners, because square isn’t relative.  The secret is simple: if the calculations look the same regardless of what you’re rooting for, then you’ve found the method. The outcome should be unrelated to the method. "
584,No good ideas?,"November 2, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/no-good-ideas/,"It’s certainly a common excuse for being stuck. In fact, there are more good ideas right now than ever before. That’s not the hard part. Need a name for your project? This site will not only invent a thousand names, it will also generate a nearly infinite number of logos for you. Instantly. Surely, at least one of them is a “good idea.” No, the hard part is choosing. And the hard part is taking responsibility. And the hard part is committing. AI doesn’t help with these. "
585,Gatekeepers and judgment,"November 1, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/11/gatekeepers-and-judgment/,"Infinity is seductive. 1,000 emails take up just as much space (and cost just as much) as one. An online bookstore can carry every book ever published. And the long tail of music gives every single person a chance to share their work. The simplest thing to do is “let the market sort itself out.” No judgment. That’s what the algorithms of the tech world purport to do. No judgment about taste, quality or standards. Hands off about sources, repercussions or impact. It’s easier. And at some level, it seems more fair. Without the scarcity of limited shelf space, it’s easy to embrace infinity. But no judgment is still a judgment in itself. When a site publishes every idea on its platform, promoting each based on a non-published formula, they’ve made a judgment about the power of ideas and the way a community can evolve. This is new. Libraries, bookstores, radio stations–all of the keepers of our culture–danced with scarcity and influence and responded with judgment. If you can’t carry or promote everything, then judgment is the obvious response. Because you have to pick something. But when companies demur and refuse to make a judgment, infinity and scarcity collide. Institutional reputation and knowledge have value, and by ignoring them, the big tech companies are making a statement about that value. Each seems to be trying harder than the next to help users fail to understand what’s worth trusting. The fracas that is kindergarten has a useful function. It helps kids grow up. But if you need surgery, I hope you’ll go to the hospital, not the local elementary school. "
586,Circus peanuts don’t contain nuts,"October 31, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/circus-peanuts-dont-contain-nuts/,"This is obvious. Circus peanuts don’t have nuts, legumes or anything else that resembles a nut. They’re a metaphor. Or perhaps a simile, it depends on your level of pedantry. And yet, many people have a hard time with metaphor. Metaphor, not memorization, is the heart of learning. If you understand A, and you see that B is like A but a little different, now you understand B. Memorization is brittle. Metaphor scales. Metaphor helps us create the next thing and find our footing when confronted with the new. I believe that understanding metaphor is a skill. We can get better at it. Find some circus peanuts you don’t understand and decode them. "
587,The opportunity to be wrong,"October 30, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/the-opportunity-to-be-wrong/,"History is filled with examples of people who made errors in judgment. The executives at Decca that turned down the Beatles, the CEO at Digital who said that no one would ever need to have a computer in their home, and the reviewers that didn’t like the movie 2001. And of course, the creators that are wrong so often. The entrepreneur who raises a bunch of money and fails, or the musician who follows up a hit with a string of duds. But these failures are all a sign that someone had been given the privilege to be wrong in the first place. It’s tempting to find a sinecure where someone tells you what to do all day–after all, then you’re off the hook and you can’t be wrong, only the boss can. But it’s far more thrilling and useful and fulfilling to be the one who might mess up. "
588,Sticking just the right amount,"October 29, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/caring-just-the-right-amount/,"There are unforeseen speedbumps, missed connections and of course, a lot of luck. If you are in love with your authentic voice, you’re unlikely to change. One lesson from the 500 Songs podcast is that most classic rock songs were made by people who started pretty far from where they ended up, but persisted, adjusted and changed until they created the hits they sought. Not one of them sounded the way they thought they would when they started… the act of making a hit involved abandoning some of what they said they believed in. These hits weren’t ‘authentic’ or the work of native talent. They were evolved, tweaked and changed in response to feedback from the world. Change too often and you stand for nothing. You’re simply chasing a shadow you will never catch. Refuse to change and you’re likely to be overlooked. Somewhere in between is the posture of someone who has the maximum chance for success. This is what happens when a creator goes to the crossroads. Professionals serve the audience by leading them to where they need to go. "
589,"Handy, cheap and willing","October 28, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/handy-cheap-and-willing/,"The industrial age prized these three attributes. We’ve all been indoctrinated into adopting them through our time in organized schooling, and it’s easy to imagine that the world still wants this.  When work is geographically bounded and the assembly line is the dynamic of efficiency, this is precisely what’s sought. Your resume certifies that you have what it takes to check the boxes, and the hiring company adjusts its offered pay to get the folks it needs, when they need them. But now the rules have changed, suddenly and perhaps for the long haul. There are still companies, many of them, searching for HCW. But those aren’t jobs we actually want. When your job is digital, when you can work from home, there is no such thing as “handy.” That means that the company is either going to hire the cheapest possible person out of perhaps a billion worldwide, or get a computer to do it, or… Or they need to hire someone special. Someone with significant skills. They might be the traditional sort of skills. That you’re actually truly great at coding or design or engineering. You’ve done the reading, built a body of work and earned the respect of your peers. That you’re not saying, “you need anyone, and I’m anyone,” but instead, are demonstrably and substantially better at the craft. Or they could be real skills, which some call soft skills. That you bring emotional labor, thoughtful analysis, care, humor, equanimity or other difficult human actions to the work. Significantly more than most people do. If you’re off the chart at this, it will be valued by the places you’d be happiest working. The good news is that there’s a path. The hard part is digging in and becoming better than good. Not better than good at everything, or even better than good for everyone. Simply better than good for someone. "
590,With certainty,"October 27, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/with-certainty/,"A 98% chance is dramatically different than a 100% certainty. Certainty isn’t on the spectrum of chance. It’s a different thing altogether. If the weather report says the chance of precipitation is zero, one should never walk outside into the rain. When you leave yourself a few points of wiggle room, you can build more trust. Low chance of rain is fundamentally different than a slight chance of rain. At the same time, if it actually is certain, say so.  "
591,Giving it a second thought,"October 26, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/giving-it-a-second-thought/,"Some problems lend themselves to reexamination. A second, third or even fourth thought is productive, because our initial impulses might not reflect our best effort at understanding the nuances of the situation. But many problems simply create more thoughts, without productive output. As we confront something that is unlikely to have a simple or productive way forward, it’s easy to go into a mental tizzy imagining solutions. The art is understanding which sort of problem we’re facing. And devoting the right amount of thought (not less and definitely not more) to the situation we’re in. Spending cycles on categorizing the problem is probably more productive than wasting time on problems that don’t deserve our effort. "
592,It’s not the last mile,"October 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/its-not-the-last-mile/,"It’s the first mile. Big tech likes to talk about the last mile problem–how to get a wire, a system or a concept from where the nodes are easy to plant to where people actually are. As if the hard part is what they’ve already done, and now it’s just the last little bit… None of it matters if the people aren’t connected. So perhaps we ought to call it the first mile instead. For the last year or so, volunteers around the world have been building The Carbon Almanac. It has become a bestseller in each country it has appeared (including the US, UK, the Netherlands, Italy and now in Chinese) and there’s a wide range of free material to go with it. Will you join our community to help with our new cities project? We have room for you, but will probably have to close registration soon. The details are right here. Thank you. "

Make appropriate trade-offs. Take responsibility for the path chosen. But when a group of people are asked to do the same thing, it’s easy to err on the side of the pursuit of perfect, or to choose to average things out. And so the legal team weighs in, and consultants are hired. And so, “but what if?” is always considered, regardless of how rare that outcome might actually be. Entire industries are built around creating deniable, average products and services that are sure to delight no one, cost more than they might and insulate the committee from backlash. When you find yourself creeping in this direction, it might be worth asking what the risk is of simply suspending the committee and putting someone in charge instead. "
594,How many good days?,"October 24, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/how-many-good-days/,"Decisions and crises and moments of significant effort and risk can be stressful. But the challenge of a stressful day is rarely directly related to today, it’s about tomorrow or years from now. Which means that pushing your way through some critical choices now will probably pay off in far more good days later. How many good days later does hard decision work today earn us? Stalling costs us more than we expect. We get stressed from the act of stalling, and then later, we will have to pay the ongoing cost of putting off work and decisions that would have been easier and more profitable a while ago. "

While we can easily see through these partitions, it ends up creating a lot of yelling. What if there were a disc, about the size of a hockey puck and the thickness of a few coasters… it would come in pairs, be low-powered and Bluetooth enabled. Stick one on one side of the glass, one on the other. It’s a microphone and a speaker… boom. At scale, they’d probably be really cheap. One extension: allow the disc to also hook up to a wifi router or laptop. Now, you can have a disc at your home office and your colleague can have one too. Tap it to turn it on, and if the other person chooses to unmute, you can have a casual conversation the way we might in the old office-bound days. It’s pretty easy to imagine creating a simple app that could record and create a transcript of every transaction, which could be useful for bureaucracies and public records. Another extension: Integrate it with real-time translation and now the disk allows you to talk to anyone in any language… "

Moore’s Law, now nearly sixty years old, describes a simple engineering fact that has changed the life of everyone on the planet. The number of transistors that can be put on a chip doubles every two years. This doesn’t sound like much, but if you double even a number as small as 2 thirty times, it increases to more than a billion.  If the price of a house followed Moore’s Law, you could buy a mansion for a few pennies. Moore’s law describes the tech path that gives us artificial intelligence, smart phones and the internet. And ever since he described the law, experts have been pointing out that it won’t continue, it can’t continue and we’ve exhausted any chance for more progress. Like most things, it probably won’t go on forever. But that doesn’t mean it’s done. Perhaps our job is to create the conditions for things to get better, not to predict that they won’t. HT to Jay. "
598,The obligation of the honest skeptic,"October 20, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/the-obligation-of-the-honest-skeptic/,"Objections are helpful. We object by holding back action or support because we question one or more pieces of data.

This means that the author has to leave out almost everything. We write our own autobiography each day by deciding what to focus on, what to rehash, and what to worry about.

601,Selling a company,"October 17, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/selling-a-company/,"Cars aren’t like companies. Most cars on the road will be sold, again and again, until they end up as parts. Companies usually start and end with their founders. Sometimes, a small, stable company is sold to an individual operator, usually for a multiple of the expected annual profit. It’s an investment in future cash flows, but it can be fraught, because, unlike a car, you can’t take a company for a test drive, and they usually need more than a periodic tune-up and charging station visit. The market for used companies isn’t as efficient or reliable as the one for used cars, as surprising as that might sound. The individual who seeks to buy and operate a used company is rare, and doesn’t often have access to significant capital. The company sales we hear about tend to be more strategic, where the buyer believes that the purchased company offers synergy (1 + 1 = 3) with their existing businesses. Perhaps the buyer has a salesforce, investment capital, systems or structures that make the combination of the companies far more successful than they would be alone. One way to look at this is the think of the assets you’ve built. They could include: More elusive than some of these are things like: Some of these things can be predicted and patiently built. Others are easy to see after the fact, but they’re more opportunistic than intentional. Perhaps the single best indicator of whether a company will be considered for a strategic acquisition is that it has investors and board members who have done this before. Because these acquisitions are rarely simply rational calculations on a spreadsheet, there is often a need for cultural fit and a shared reality distortion field to create the conditions for them to get put on the agenda.

602,“I’m not that smart”,"October 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/im-not-that-smart/,"Someone said that to me the other day and it was heartbreaking. The number of tasks in our culture that require someone who was born with off-the-charts talent is small indeed. Just about everything else we need people to do is the result of effort, practice and care. It’s true that variations of that work are easier for some folks, but no one finds all of it easy going. The correct thing to say is, “I don’t care that much.” I don’t care enough to do the reading, to fail along the way, to show up, to make a promise, to learn as I go, to confront failure, to get better at the work.  All of that might be true. But you’re almost certainly smart enough. "
603,We forgot to choose,"October 15, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/we-forgot-to-choose/,"When abundance showed up, first in manufactured goods, then in information, it all seemed like a simple win. More of what we want, thanks. But of course, more of too many things is too much. We are leaving the age of information and entering the age of choice. Not just choosing what we’ll consume, but who we will become. Who will we connect with, lead, trust, honor, dignify, isolate or believe? And how will we choose to walk through the world and what will we leave behind… "

Since 1924, they’re almost 100 years old. But it’s unlikely that it’s everyone’s favorite.  Being everyone’s favorite is such an attractive goal, and almost impossible to achieve. Ask someone about their favorite pie and they’ll talk about the one they ate as a kid, or one that a grandparent bakes, or perhaps, one from the bakery down the street. To collate all of these favorites into one singular popularity contest is unlikely to yield much success. It might be America’s most convenient pie, or the bestselling one. It might be the best value or the easiest to obtain. But none of those things mean “favorite.” Often, when we set out to do our work, we focus on popularity and breadth at the expense of the magic and singular experience that could create a favorite. Something we’d miss if it weren’t there. I wonder if seeking to be someone’s favorite is more satisfying than trying to be popular to everyone. I’m sure that if you want to be the most popular, the way to do that is not to seek to be the favorite of everyone (unless that is a side effect of being popular.) "

606,The uncanny valley of scale,"October 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/the-uncanny-valley-of-scale/,"Big companies act like big companies. We don’t take them seriously when they say they care, because there is no “they.” When they send a holiday card or an email, we don’t really think it was from a person we could connect with. Individuals act like individuals. When they write us a note or show up in person, we know that we’re dealing with a human. In between, though, problems arise. Did your friend really write that tweet, or did the staff do it?   That email that you just got, BCC… when you hit reply, will it go to the person who purported to send it, or to a team, or the infinite void? The voice in our head changes when the identity of the sender differs.  When individuals try to scale, they often think they can bring their care, personality and person-hood along for the ride. And inevitably, it ends up disappointing everyone. It’s possible you can trick us for a while, but if you succeed in persuading us that you’re a real person, we’ll feel tricked sooner or later. If it’s not from you, say so. "

As a result, it’s louder than our other senses and often outshouts the rest of our brain. That’s why it’s easy to be fooled by a magician. This focus on sight means that we often are at a loss on how to deal with things that are invisible. It works in our favor with the placebo effect. We can see that we just swallowed a pill, or wore a brace, or bought an expensive bottle of wine. That input helps us heal or enjoy the moment, even if the organic invisible things behind the scenes don’t quite match what we saw. And it works against us when it’s time for our community to process things that are invisible over time (like evolution or systems change) or invisible in the moment (like viruses and greenhouse gasses).  When there’s a conflict between what we know and what we see, we often default to the wrong one. "
610,Points of view,"October 8, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/points-of-view/,"The closer we look at what other people believe and do, the more clear it is that our view of the world doesn’t precisely match theirs. It never has, but now it’s magnified. The things we thought were a given, aren’t. No one believes what I believe, not exactly. How is it possible, we wonder, that people like us don’t believe what we believe or do what we do? Not just people we don’t know, but the people we do know. And how do we dig in to overcome magnified divisions to find shared objectives, to fight for justice and dignity and what’s right at the same time we connect with people we might be inclined to push away… Simply asking the question helps us find a way forward. Realizing that people don’t know what we know, don’t believe what we believe. And most of all, that they have a noise in their head, just as we do. "
611,A lot is a choice,"October 7, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/a-lot-is-a-choice/,"You might want to make something that a lot of people want a little… Or you could make something that a few people want a lot. It’s usually neither. It’s rarely (very rarely) both. If you work hard and make intentional choices, though, you might end up with one or the other. "
612,For the upgrade,"October 6, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/for-the-upgrade/,"The phone in your pocket cost $600, but that was two years ago, so now, it seems to be free and fully paid for. The upgrade has a slightly better camera and a slightly faster processor. Here’s the question: “If you could have chosen between the phone you have now and the phone you want now two years ago, would you have paid $700 more for the newer one?” Most people would not. So why do we upgrade? Software, phones, cars, houses… It’s because we’re not making that simple choice. Instead, we’re embracing the wisdom of the choice we made years ago at the same time we’re focusing on the glaring defects that status and affiliation relentlessly point out. They’re not trying to sell you a phone any longer. Or a house. They’re spending all their time selling you an upgrade. "
613,Steady state and the trigger for change,"October 5, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/steady-state-and-the-trigger-for-change/,"If, every time there’s a dish in the sink, you load and run the dishwasher and scrub the entire kitchen, you’re never going to get anything else done. On the other hand, if you wait until the sink is overflowing and the kitchen is filthy before you work on it, you’re going to spend a lot of time living with a dirty kitchen. Somewhere in between the two extremes is a productive steady state. The same goes for your relationship with a customer, your staffing decisions and just about everything else we do all day. Setting the triggers for action is best done in advance, and maintained regularly. Waiting for a crisis is expensive and risky. "
614,Front of house/back of house,"October 4, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/front-of-house-back-of-house/,"What do the dishwashers eat for lunch? What’s the user experience of accounts payable for that big tech company? How does the head of sales treat the receptionist? If it’s good enough for your customers, it should be good enough for your team, your vendors and your friends. And vice versa. The key is this: In many organizations, customers have a choice and customers have a voice. Treating everyone as if they have that sort of power makes it far more likely you’re earning trust and respect, not cutting corners. "
615,“What’s on tonight?”,"October 3, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/whats-on-tonight-2/,"This common question no longer means anything. Every TV show is on. All the time. Our record collection streams every record ever recorded. And our readers can find and display just about any book we can name. We haven’t thought about the impacts of this abundance nearly as much as it deserves. Live matters less, scarcity is not really a factor, and ubiquity of access can easily lead to boredom, lack of status and a search for real-time connection. Success used to be based on gatekeepers and access to access. What are the new rules? "
616,For the good of the community,"October 2, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/for-the-good-of-the-community/,"One way to serve the community is to see it as a market and solve one of its problems. When people choose to buy something, it’s ostensibly because the thing you sell is worth more to them than it costs. And so value is created. And when you make a profit selling something and pay taxes, those taxes go to create services for the community. Those are two reasons culture has evolved to enable capitalism. When this system gets out of whack, two things happen–first, some businesses use their market power to extract more value than they create. And second, they use their lobbying power to pay no taxes. The market hasn’t failed, but the system used to address market and community needs sometimes does. "
617,The way it’s done,"October 1, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/10/the-way-its-done/,"Some people say, “we’re not changing it, because this is the way it’s done.” And some people say, “the way it’s done isn’t good enough, let’s make it better.” In a given situation, you might encounter one or the other type of response. In fact, each of us might adopt one posture or the other. It’s not “who”, it’s “what do they believe.” It’s worth thinking about the beliefs of the person you’re talking to before you try to suggest making things better. And it will help you understand the feedback someone else is giving you about your work as well. "
618,Novelty vs action,"September 30, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/novelty-vs-action/,"Nerds, geeks, early adopters: they do things because they’re fresh and new and might not work. They’re novel. Most people, though, hesitate in the face of novelty. Because novelty is risky. Shoes with goldfish in the heels. The latest techno-ska-punk track. The new kind of phone… The reason we haven’t taken systemic action is that it’s scary, not because it isn’t novel enough. If you want more people to take more action, make it safe, don’t make it interesting. [PS In a month, it’s Halloween. Please don’t buy cheap chocolate.] "
619,Extensions and souvenirs,"September 29, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/extensions-and-souvenirs/,"When a brand is successful, there’s often a desire to extend it. Disneyland was an extension of Disney movies. It reflected some of the magic of the movies, but created something new and valuable as well. Disneyland had some of the Disney essence and then built something additive and new. Apple did the same thing with the iPhone in extending the brand of the Mac. On the other hand, the new Leica watch is simply a souvenir. It’s not a better watch. It’s not more of a Leica than any of a dozen other overpriced watches could be seen to be. It’s simply there to remind you that you liked the original. It’s a souvenir of a feeling, not the creator. Nothing wrong with a souvenir. I’m sure Leica will make a profit from their watch with little damage to the promise that the brand itself makes. But make too many souvenirs and you become a hollow shell, wasting the chance to make the change you seek. The crappy t-shirt you bought at your favorite musician’s concert is a souvenir, but they shouldn’t count on that as their legacy or the engine of their growth. All day, individual creators have to make choices about what they’re going to do next. Sometimes we can create an extension. And sometimes, we decide to make a souvenir instead. "
620,Logistics vs (and) innovation,"September 28, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/logistics-vs-and-innovation/,"When innovation arrives, the logistics people have to scramble to keep up, because innovation always makes it hard to do things the way we used to. Over time, an innovative company thrives if it can get its logistics in order. Ship the right stuff to the right people on time and on budget. Once this happens, it often means that the logistics people gain in power and influence. After all, they pulled off a miracle. Then, when the next innovation shows up, the logistics voices in the room are likely to have more say in what happens next. That’s why upstarts who feel like they have nothing to lose are so much more likely to innovate–they don’t realize how hard it is going to be. Innovation doesn’t work without logistics.  "
621,"Retribution, revenge, and especially, remorse","September 27, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/retribution-revenge-and-especially-remorse/,"When an organization has caused harm (through error or intent), it’s tempting to be sure they learned a lesson. We want folks to take responsibility, to admit culpability and to be sure they won’t do it again. But if you need those things to happen to make things better for all of us, we’re going to have to wait a long time.  Perhaps it makes sense to embrace, “now that I know what I know now, I can make a new decision based on new information and do this instead.” Taking responsibility for yesterday is great. Taking action for tomorrow is even better. We often become what we do, as opposed to simply doing what we say we would when under duress. "
622,Social pressure,"September 26, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/social-pressure/,"It’s normal to feel it. It changes our careers, our dress and even the way we live our lives. The question is: is it caused by external or internal forces? More often than not, it’s simply something we invent. The people we imagine are busy watching and judging us might not even know we exist. Social pressure is something we make up to simplify our decisions.  "
623,The parts between,"September 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/the-parts-between/,"Listen to one musician’s track in isolation on any record (like this one) and you might be amazed at how trivial they sound. Paul McCartney, one of the great bass players, in one the great groups of all time–it sounds a bit like a school music recital. But we don’t listen to the tracks in isolation, because the isolation isn’t the point. Human beings care about harmonies. About originality. About the tension that comes from the new. And we care about the dynamics between and among people who are working together. That’s why we listen to the whole song, not one musician’s isolation track. "
624,White glove service,"September 24, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/white-glove-service/,"It’s not about the gloves. The pointlessness of the white gloves is actually a big part of it. Good service meets expectations. It is the fulfillment of a promise to the customer. White glove service goes far beyond that. It is designed to surprise and delight. It creates a connection with the recipient that goes beyond a simple transaction, already paid for. It is a signal of care and respect, of gratitude and abundance. As soon as we start to wonder if slightly smudged grey gloves are okay (“no one will notice,”) or look to others for what is acceptable, then we might as well simply do the minimum. It’s possible your organization has just saved a ton of money by moving online–no longer paying rent, upkeep or overhead on a local sales facility. One way to replace this demonstration of stability and commitment is to invest in white glove service instead. Because it is an investment. It pays off in loyalty, in word of mouth and in employee satisfaction as well. If you do it right. Which means you need to do it all the way. Or don’t bother. "
625,The chief hype officer,"September 23, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/the-chief-hype-officer/,"The chief marketing officer at a big company has an impossible job. The typical duration of a CMO is 18 months because once the CEO realizes that hype for money can’t solve their problems, they get restless. The problem lies in what people think “marketing” is. Marketing isn’t paying for ads, changing the logo or building a social media presence. Marketing is product design, customer service, pricing, customer delight and creating and living a remarkable story. Marketing is creating the conditions for the network effect. And yet, the typical CMO isn’t in charge of ANY of those things. No wonder it’s frustrating. You thought you were getting a marketer, but all you did was hire someone to make a commotion on social media. The words matter. If you are hiring someone to be in charge of promotion, say so. But if you want someone to be in charge of marketing, have them be in charge of all of it. If it touches the market, it’s marketing. "
626,The beef tax,"September 22, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/the-beef-tax/,"We’re all paying it, every day. In the US, taxpayers subsidize the cattle industry with billions of dollars of tax money each year. Most of that goes to pay for feed crops, but there is also a huge allocation of public land for the grazing of cows. About half the land in the entire country is just for cattle. In addition, a significant portion of the climate problem is directly caused by the effects of bovine respiration as well as the clear-cutting of forests for grazing worldwide. It’s like someone is dumping manure on your living room carpet and asking you to pay for it. The end result is that whether or not you eat meat, you’re paying for it. Beef is more expensive than we realize. And it’s also significantly less convenient than we give it credit for. Climate refugees, storm-damaged assets, the loss of life and homes… these are directly caused by the one billion cows that humans raise each year. What would happen if we simply charged a fair price for the beef and milk that people consume? The industry has done a great job of persuading people that beef is cheap, convenient, easy, luxurious, wholesome and benign. It’s none of those things. I wonder how long it will take us to realize just how much it costs us. "
627,Is there a word for that?,"September 21, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/is-there-a-word-for-that/,"Experts have a word for it. If it’s important, conceptual or frequently discussed, there’s probably a domain-based word that experts understand. The precision of a special vocabulary allows them to do better work. But… Just because someone knows the word for it doesn’t mean that they understand, or that they’re a useful expert. And… If someone doesn’t know the word for it, it might be worth investigating what else they don’t know. Domain knowledge and experience are powerful tools. "
628,“It’s just not that good”,"September 20, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/its-just-not-that-good/,"That might be true, but it’s worth being clear about it. Not that good for who? If you mean to say, “I don’t like it, it doesn’t appeal to me,” then that’s what you should say. If, on the other hand, you have enough expertise and domain knowledge to say, “I understand what has appealed to the audience you’re trying to serve, and this isn’t going to work.” The first is easy, and perhaps not that helpful. The second is priceless, but are you sure? "
629,Easy in/Easy out,"September 19, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/easy-in-easy-out/,"The law is simple to describe, fair and useful: It should be as easy to unsubscribe from an online service as it is to sign up. Other than powerful brand bullies, who is against this? It took me five minutes to sign up for a data connection for my car a few years ago. Yesterday, after selling the car, it took me more than three hours to get AT&T to stop charging me for the service. Went to the store, they won’t do it. Went to their website, they won’t do it. Went to online chat, half an hour later, discovered they won’t do it (I have the transcript if Kellyn Smith Kenny wants to see it). I called, waited on hold for half an hour, was disconnected, you get the idea…) Yes, this is bad marketing by AT&T. It’s unlikely that making it inconvenient to turn off service for a car you no longer own is going to dissuade someone from doing it. It hurts their brand, demotivates the employees and destroys loyalty. It’s short term-thinking by a lazy brand manager. But they do it anyway. When organizations get too big and too short-term focused to pay attention to the market, it’s a perfect moment for consumers to band together and give them a guardrail. If I can sign up with a few clicks, I should be able to unsign up with a few clicks. "
630,The last 1%,"September 18, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/the-last-1/,"If you apply for something with a 99% rejection rate (which is more common than it sounds–job openings, sales pitches, fellowships, journals, etc.) that’s pretty close to 100%. Something with a 99% certainty is generally considered a sure thing.  Hence this Journal, which promises to reject every single person who submits an article. The absurdity of it is the point. Submitting to them feels effortless and without a lot of drama, because you know you’re going to get rejected. So instead of becoming attached to the outcome, you can simply focus on the work. That’s a useful approach to the rest of the things we apply to. "
631,“And we also”,"September 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/and-we-also/,"The simplest way to run a business is to have no also. We maximize profit, period. At least you’re being honest about it. If you say, “and we also care about the environment,” or “we also care about our people and treat them like family,” or even, “we’re here to serve our customers…” now you’re doing one of two things: Either you’re asserting that doing those things is the way to maximize your profit… Or you’re committing to not maximizing your profit, as your purpose is more human and connected than something that simple. If it’s the latter, if you’ve decided that making just enough profit to maximize your real goal is the purpose of the organization, what an extraordinary opportunity. Organizations of humans with a clear measured goal and just enough profit to get there can make a huge impact. But it’s worth being honest about whether you’re running that full-page ad with a koala in it because you’re here to help the koala or simply because you see it as a stepping stone to making more money. "
632,The grassroots,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/the-grassroots/,"Starting at the top seems like great advice. Deal with the people with power and authority. Except… Power and authority aren’t often in the same place. The real power is usually foundational. What happens when humans interact. The way things are around here. Often, the people who are ostensibly in charge are simply choosing from a few culturally acceptable choices, and those choices are dictated by the foundation. It might seem like a detour, but it’s actually the cause of change. "
633,Talking about money,"September 15, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/talking-about-money/,"Who benefits when we hesitate to look at money clearly? When we avoid doing a P&L, thinking about pricing, or creating a budget, we’re avoiding the fear that comes with these choices. And we’re also decreasing our odds of success. Good cooks talk about salt. Successful athletes talk about training.  Money isn’t the point. But talking about money enables you to find your footing and clarify your direction. [Semi-unrelated, all tangentially about talking about money, a handful of new books from friends and colleagues I’m happy to recommend.] Unreasonable Hospitality, taking service to a whole new level, by Will Guidara The Making of Her, a breathtaking story by bestselling author Bernadette Jiwa Chokepoint Capitalism, about creativity and monopoly, by Rebecca Giblin and Cory Doctorow Put Your Ass Where Your Heart Wants to Be, essential insight for creators from Steve Pressfield Survival of the Richest, a scary, true and unsettling look at what happens when money causes people to lose their humanity, by Doug Rushkoff … and I’m blown away by the foresight and generosity of pioneer Yvon Chouinard.

634,Feature creep,"September 14, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/feature-creep/,"This isn’t just software. It’s the menu at the diner. It’s the buttons on the dashboard of a car. It’s the variety of choices parents are offered of which dates summer camp starts or ends. Anything where a lot of hard work can be slightly improved simply by adding an innocuous option. At one point, Yahoo had 183 links on their home page. Google, which had two, ultimately grabbed all of their search traffic. The app on my phone can now open the trunk of my car if I press enough buttons. Features are useful (that’s why we call them features). And yes, serving the underserved and the unseen is important. But creep cannot continue forever. At some point, there’s system bankruptcy and the cycle begins again. While we might not easily say no to a new feature, we can be smart and proactive when it comes time to clear the slate and start over. "
635,The proximity hack,"September 13, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/the-proximity-hack/,"We evolved to care about things that were close by or in the near future. That makes sense. It’s a useful survival skill in a primitive world. Today, though, our instinct for the close and the imminent is being used against us. Media and those in search of our money or attention bring the far nearby, amplify the reality of threats and emphasize sunk costs in pushing us to stay stuck. We need to get much better at investing in the future, and being distracted by loud, sudden noises isn’t helpful. "
636,Who cares?,"September 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/who-cares-3/,"No one cares. That happens rarely. Someone cares. That happens all the time, and it’s at the heart of our work. Everyone cares. Almost never. Someone is enough. In fact, someone is the entire point. "
637,A reallocation of respect,"September 11, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/a-reallocation-of-respect/,"Who gets the benefit of the doubt? Who is treated with dignity? You would think that this shouldn’t be scarce. When the pool of respect is widened, no one is harmed. And yet, cultural status roles have ingrained biases all around us. We’re now seeing a long overdue evaluation of unexamined norms, which aren’t, and shouldn’t be treated as “normal.” The most direct way forward is to default to more respect, simply because that’s what people deserve. "
638,What does it mean to be smart?,"September 10, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/what-does-it-mean-to-be-smart-2/,"You probably know that Bruce Wayne is actually Batman. That’s a secret identity that most of us are aware of. And if you’re up on pop culture, you know that the best Batman was played by the late actor Adam West. Visit the visual search engine Lexica, though, and you’ll see that it knows that Adam West was Batman. A search for “Adam West” (with no mention of roles, DC comics or secret identities), shows us this: It’s important to note that none of these are pictures of Adam West, in or out of costume. It simply “knows” that Adam West is Bruce Wayne is Batman, and shows us some reconstructed images of Batman from the 1960s. It also knows that we might be looking for Batman, even though it’s a secret. The new algorithm it’s using is more than twice as good at figuring out what a picture is a picture of. When a human does something mysterious like this sort of leap, we simply call them smart. It’s a simple way to describe something we don’t understand. Complexity and breadth mixing in mysterious ways. And now computers are doing it all the time. (Except when they don’t–lots of the searches are not quite ready for the public.) PS check out this story about West and the phone book. "
639,Fake-aceuticals,"September 9, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/fake-aceuticals/,"Of course, we’ve always had snake oil salesmen. We’ve always had patent medicines, odd electric probes and copper bracelets. That’s partly because placebos work, and partly because when someone isn’t feeling well, it’s tempting to seek relief and belief. In the last fifty years, peer-reviewed and tested medicine has gotten dramatically more effective at the same time that these regulated medicines have spent a fortune on ads and marketing. As a result, the sham snake oil purveyors have worked hard to copy the scientific umbra and language of tested and regulated treatments. And thanks to aggressive lobbying, in many countries, the folk remedies are nearly unregulated. So we’ve got greedy public pharma companies, with a tested product and an ad budget that often exceeds their R&D budget (industry wide, it approaches half of R&D). They’re using every tool they can to sell something expensive that sometimes works. And then we have folk medicine companies that are responding to the high prices and ad influx by raising their own prices and sharpening their own ads, blurring the gap and grabbing some of the trust that people have in verified and tested results. Belief is useful and placebos work. But you can see the widening gap here. It’s hard to tell from the website or ad which are the actual focused, tested, double-blind and effective treatments, and which are simply scams. A cheap benign placebo is a bargain. One that costs too much or hurts you is not. If someone tells you that they’re offering a diagnostic test of your micro-biome and has you send in a sample for scientific analysis and testing, it’s almost certain that they’re doing nothing of the sort. If there’s a simple device you can buy online for $100 or so, it is likely that it doesn’t cure pain the way they say it does. If a practitioner insists that they have powers that transcend the laws of physics or reason, they’re actually only offering you the power of suggestion. And yes, if a famous doctor insists that an expensive over-the-counter magical bean is what you need, think twice. Regulated medicine has gotten dramatically more effective in the last few decades. Folk medicine hasn’t changed at all, even if it costs ten times more than it used to, and even if the packaging and hype is significantly more sophisticated. And so: targeting people in distress, charging ever more and honing the sales pitch to make it ever sharper. It’s a shame that the folks who do this don’t have the self-respect and generosity it would take to be honest about what they’re offering. Instead, they hide behind a facade of jargon and process that conceals the fact that they’re simply making it up. That oil isn’t essential, except in the way it makes a profit. There are few areas of our lives where we tolerate this much fraud. Because we really want it to be true. "
640,"But first, we need to talk about it","September 8, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/but-first-we-need-to-talk-about-it/,"People don’t talk about end-of-life suffering or the cost of healthcare in the last year of life, so it never gets better. Instead, we pretend it isn’t an issue and the problem persists. We don’t talk about the ongoing and escalating costs (human and financial) of our changing climate, so the systems that are making it worse continue, unimpeded. We don’t talk about all the time we waste in meetings, the persistence of caste and injustice, the manipulation of our communication platforms, the creeping aristocracy disguised as a meritocracy or even the ridiculous nature of the wedding-industrial complex. What all of these systems have in common is that they maintain their position in the status quo by creating a force field that somehow keeps us from talking about them. On the other hand, we talk about quarterly profits, sports rankings, celebrities and the horserace of the day’s politics all the time. Which is why so much time and energy is spent on polishing and optimizing those systems. Figure out what’s important, then create the conditions for people to talk about it. PS thanks to Eileen Fisher for doing just that. Last month, their stores gave away thousands of copies of The Carbon Almanac to people who stopped by. Simply that. To encourage people to talk about our future. Also congratulations to Gabe for 2,000 daily posts. Good stuff. "
641,Constraints are a gift,"September 7, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/constraints-are-a-gift/,"“If only” is a soothing refrain. If only the constraints were lifted, and the things that are scarce were abundant. If only the barriers were lifted and there was more time or fewer obstacles… That’s a trap. If the constraints went away, you’d be playing a totally different game, because your competitors would see their constraints lifted as well. Constraints are a gift because they bring us something to lean against, and they give us the chance to focus on work we can actually do. Every once in a while, the situation changes and constraints are lifted. In those moments, we need to be hyper-aware of the new possibilities. The rest of the time, instead of cursing the boundaries, we can celebrate them. "
642,The treatment of bystanders,"September 6, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/the-treatment-of-bystanders/,"This seems to be cultural, not based on income, caste, race or genetics.  Some professions and communities give a greater percentage of their income to charity than others. Some towns have no-kill dog shelters while others have a reputation for abandonment. You might find an online community that welcomes and supports newcomers, and another that simply trolls and argues with them. You can find a surf beach where the norm is to let others have the right of way and lend a hand, and others where surfers would rather go to jail than let you have a shot at a wave. A sailboat is more respectful than a Jetski. It’s silent, picturesque and safer for those around it. Given the choice, some groups of people choose one, some the other. And while we can have productive conversations about what actually helps the most bystanders in the best possible way, it’s also pretty clear that some organizations and cultures are more aware of their impact than others. Bystanders, by definition, can’t give you anything in return. Treating others with care and dignity isn’t a shortcut to a sale or profit, it’s simply something that gets done around here (or doesn’t.) Part of our opportunity is to normalize the behaviors we’d like to be around. "
643,Getting the hull shape right,"September 5, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/getting-the-hull-shape-right/,"It’s tempting to have your book copyedited and typeset before you have your editor read it. And it feels right to spend time on the company’s website before you have your first customer… But if you don’t have the foundational elements right, the fit and finish don’t matter at all. This summer I designed and built a skin-on-frame canoe. I could have spent a lot more time on the details, the sanding and even putting on the gunwales. But it wouldn’t have mattered, because the boat’s design was so unstable and tippy, it was unusable. All that remains of the boat is this picture and what I learned about hull design.  The first job is to figure out what “hull design” means for you and your project. What’s the hard part? What’s the part that has to be right for the rest to matter?  Then we get to focus on the rest.

644,The speed of change,"September 4, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/the-speed-of-change/,"Moore’s law talks about the fact that computer chips get faster and cheaper over time. It turns out that the biggest shift to our culture isn’t the changing speed of a computer chip, it’s what happens when we network humans together. Adding more people to the internet has accelerated science, politics and every element of culture. The echos happen faster, the learning is exponential, and connected communities heat up and morph ever faster. Science used to be a solo endeavor. A monk with some pea plants could figure out genetics. Today, there are millions of people advancing the work of millions of people, with new updates coming all day long. The problems are dramatically more difficult, but the solutions are possible because we’ve multiplied the speed of change. Thinking of problems as things for individuals to solve is hopelessly out of date. "
645,Cultural distress (and consumerism),"September 3, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/emotional-distress-and-consumerism/,"For decades, marketers (and politicians) have been working to amplify cultural distress, a hack on our emotions. Not the tragic emotional distress of being unable to care for your kids, find a place to live or deal with trauma, but the invented cultural distress of modern industrialized societies. This is the easily created shame of not having a new suit to wear to the garden party, or having to use an old model smartphone instead of the new one. It’s the dissatisfaction of knowing that something ‘better’ is available, and the invented discontent that comes from the peer pressure of being left out or left behind. Or it might be the social shame that comes from not having a big enough presence on social media, or the fomo that watching other people presenting nothing but happiness online can create. It can be amplified with a sort of nostalgia for times when everything was perfect, or anxiety about a future when we imagine we won’t have enough. Fear of this sort of cultural distress pushes us to simply spend money to avoid it. It’s easier to lose your life’s savings and peace of mind to end-of-life care than it is to simply draft a living will. It’s easier to give in to the high-pressure tactics of a real estate broker than it is to look squarely at the feelings that you might not actually get this particular house. Making a budget is hard, paying for not making one is easy. It turns out that selling an easy and convenient way to avoid social pain is a nearly boundless formula for corporate growth. And so people with a lot of resources are still unhappy, because they succumb to invented narratives about cultural distress–and then, once they buy something to avoid it, discover that it’s still there. Marathon runners don’t complain about the tired, because getting tired is a necessary component of a well-run race. And human beings are always going to find moments of cultural distress, and it’s up to each of us to decide what to trade (in the short run and the long run) to deal with it. Perhaps it makes sense simply to acknowledge that it’s present. "
646,The last minute,"September 2, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/the-last-minute-3/,"If you do anything at the last minute that takes more than a minute, you’re not organizing your project properly. The last minute is not a buffer zone, nor is it the moment to double-check your work. The last minute is simply sixty seconds to enjoy and to remind yourself that you successfully planned ahead. "
647,Don’t blame the mouse,"September 1, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/09/dont-blame-the-mouse/,"If you leave your cheese out and the mouse eats it, the mouse is simply being a mouse. While it might be nice if the mouse didn’t wreck your dinner, that’s his job. Often, we show up with our cheese and then become indignant when the mouse does what mice do. “Oh, you’re a mouse.” That makes it a lot easier to navigate. "
648,The advice gap,"August 31, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/the-advice-gap/,"Wisdom and good advice are everywhere, now more than ever.

We have a gap in selection and application. "

More than once a month they shut down a business that frightened the competition and seduced consumers. That’s part of the recipe for becoming an unbeatable behemoth. Fail a lot. Institutions like Western Union and A & P and Woolworth’s and Sears forget this part. PS Generation Carbon, an almanac for kids, is now freely available in more than ten languages worldwide. Please share it with someone you care about. "
650,“How can I help?”,"August 29, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/how-can-i-help/,"It’s a simple question that can open doors. But it also creates tension. The person you’re seeking to connect with might not want to believe that help is possible. There’s a solace that comes from being really and truly stuck, and hope might not be on their agenda. Or there might be resistance to thinking about what help would look like. Because visualizing it brings it one step closer to happening, and that can be scary. Perhaps the person has danced with hope before, and discovered that people who mean well don’t always follow through. It may be that an offer of help feels temporary and selfish, not generous. And it could be that the problem the person has built is so perfect and permanent that no help is possible. Ultimately, the only way to know if help is possible is to try. "
651,"Unprepared, as always","August 28, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/unprepared-as-always/,"Technological leaps always take us by surprise. What happens when every visual image ever created can be remixed and expanded? Van Gogh, Superman, or Moses. These link to an open search engine, so your mileage may vary. New software allows anyone to create images simply by typing in a dozen or so words. And software can already write blog posts or ad copy, and will soon do photorealistic animation. If you’re a creator, you either have a style or you don’t. If you don’t, you’re simply a gig worker. And if you have a style, there’s a computer program that’s going to not only encourage people to copy your style, but expand it. (Here’s a free beta). For some, this is going to lead to enormous opportunities in speed, creativity and possibility. For others, it’s a significant threat. "
652,Revisionism,"August 27, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/revisionism/,"There are two marketing problems when it comes to creating interventions for the public good.  The first marketing problem is that when it works we take the intervention for granted. The world doesn’t fall apart, and we don’t notice, because our expectation was that the world (whatever world matters to you) should stay on course. The intervention might have made a huge difference, but we don’t notice the persistence of good things. The second marketing problem is that if an intervention doesn’t work as well as we expected, we rarely acknowledge it would have been even worse if we hadn’t done anything.  Banning cigarettes in bars saved thousands of lives. Car safety standards have saved more than a million. The ozone layer is in better shape than it would have been, and cars seem to run fine on unleaded gas and even electricity. And yet there are revisionists writing books claiming that Ralph Nader destroyed the car industry, that Joe McCarthy was a good guy and that we don’t need to make sure that voting rights are preserved. Not all interventions work, but the ones that do are often hard to notice. "
653,“A good study”,"August 26, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/a-good-study/,"The gatekeepers keep disappearing. When it cost $500,000 to produce a record album, you could assume that it was going to reach some people and not be completely amateurish. Today, many songs in the iTunes store have had exactly one listen. When it cost $5,000,000 to make a video or a film, there was a lot of pressure to improve watchability and get an audience. Today, YouTube is filled with videos with no views at all. And books from major publishing houses used to be assured of at least 20,000 copies in print and perhaps would find some loyal readers. Today, when anyone can write and publish an ebook, there are many that have fewer than ten sales. While this open marketplace of creativity led to some broken hearts among creators, it also opened the doors for new ideas, new voices and a path to making it as a creative person. Which brings us to scientific studies. To get tenure, to spread an important idea, to gain status with colleagues, a scientific paper needed to be published in one of the dozens of journals that existed for this purpose. While there were some studies that were sloppy or even fraudulent, most peer-reviewed journal articles were probably worth taking seriously, with further inquiry appropriate when something important was at stake. Today, 87.4% of the self-published and popular science articles available contain stats that are made up and methods that can’t hold up to scrutiny. They know that few people will bother to read the footnotes.* If the goals are speed and clicks, it’s hard to also create a study that’s truly meaningful. Anyone with access to a dozen undergraduate students can publish a ‘breakthrough’ on behavioral economics or even epidemiology. If it gets read, it must be true. Not so. Before you get in a cryogenic chamber to help with your eczema, drink ionized water, or take a pill because you saw it mentioned on an opinion-focused cable show, it’s worth thinking hard about what it means for there to be a good study. Did they show their work? Have reputable peers referred to the study? What does the person publishing the study have to gain? It’s interesting to note that there are very few breakthrough studies in areas like aerodynamics, perpetual motion and bridge design. That’s because it’s really easy to tell when they’re simply making stuff up. Sometimes, the gates need keeping. *Did you see what I did there? "
654,And when we disagree…,"August 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/and-when-we-disagree/,"The hallmark of a resilient, productive and sustainable culture is that disagreements aren’t risky. When someone cares enough to make an assertion and show their work, a healthy organization or society takes a look. The alternative is the brittle, closed culture of talking points, loyalty oaths and unquestioned status quo. It might be a neighborhood social club, a large corporation or a nation, but the principle remains. What happens when we disagree? Because when the world changes (and it always does) we’ll probably end up disagreeing sooner or later. Being good at it is a skill. "
655,The Association,"August 24, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/the-association/,"You have competition, but you might be wrong about who they are. The freelance wedding photographer can easily imagine that the other professional photographers in town are the ones to beat. The romance author might imagine that the other romance authors are competing for shelf space and sales. I could give the cold shoulder to Simon or Brene or Pema instead of connecting with them. But the pie can get bigger. The competition lies in two areas: • Big companies and systems. • Apathy. Years ago, when the leading providers of AOL got together at an annual conference and compared notes, we all ended up earning more in our next contract negotiations. Not to set prices, but to learn. When small suppliers share information and insight, they find ways to not only decrease costs, but have more leverage with the bureaucracies they have to wrestle with. That’s a key function of agents–they spread information among disparate suppliers. And when speakers or authors or musicians work together, they start to chip away at apathy, bringing energy to the parts of the population that didn’t use to care or pay attention.  It’s not okay for Wal-Mart and Target to have secret meetings. But it’s totally appropriate for the little companies they work with to figure out how to band together to be treated more fairly and to increase demand for their category. Pick up the phone or send an email. Find a few folks in a situation that is just like yours. You might find that they’d appreciate the connection and that you’ll all benefit. As will those you serve.

656,Startup costs,"August 23, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/startup-costs/,"It’s typical to include machines, rent, stationery, all that stuff.

657,Five true statements we don’t hear very often,"August 22, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/five-true-statements-we-dont-hear-very-often/,"It’s a shame, because it would help us do a much better job of bringing ideas to people: “I don’t care enough to do what you’re asking.” “I don’t trust you enough to hear you out.” “I don’t believe it’s worth what it will cost in time, money or risk.” “I’m afraid of the changes it will cause.” “I don’t believe that I’m the kind of person who can do this.” Instead, people talk about features, quality or budgets. Which might be genuine inquiry, but is often simply a way of stalling until time runs out. When someone cares enough to tell us their truth, perhaps the best response is, “thank you.” "
658,Opportunity is now disorganized,"August 21, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/opportunity-is-now-disorganized/,"It used to be well lit. Apply to a famous institution, get picked. Get the agent of an agent or A&R person. Get picked. Get good grades… get picked. Now, many of the “pickers” have little influence or power.  Instead of the reassurance that comes from someone else telling us what to do and then rewarding us when we comply, we each have the chance to show up and contribute. And, if we can, do it again. It seems crowded and chaotic and uncertain. And then we get to do it again. "
659,Just that one scarce resource,"August 20, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/just-that-one-scarce-resource/,"Growing our impact or profit usually involves maximizing something that’s valuable. And things that are valuable are often scarce. Finding the one thing that is at the heart of your value/scarcity matrix makes it much easier to focus your energy on strategic decisions. If you own a single store, you need to maximize the profit per square foot. Everything in your growth journey revolves around this. On the other hand, Subway didn’t care about that at all, and instead focused on having as many sandwich franchises as they could. The resource they scaled was their franchise model. If you own a factory, the slowest, busiest part of your assembly line is the critical path that has to be identified and optimized. If you are a music teacher with 30 hours to spend with students a week, your growth is going to be about using each of those hours to maximum effectiveness (perhaps with more engaged students, or in developing digital assets or investing those 30 hours more carefully or profitably).  If you have a brand that consumers trust, you might be able to scale it by offering other products with that same brand name. If you have a strong relationship with Target or Wal-Mart, you can scale that by bringing in new varieties to gain more shelf space. That’s why successful record labels got more successful by signing more artists. Studio time is easy to scale, access to DJs and rack jobbers, not so much. If you have a permission relationship with 1,000 great customers, you can maximize the value (to them and to you) of each interaction you have. And if you’re seeking to change the culture, you could focus on how to get your one precious and scarce agenda to become a movement. "

If we’re facing an important issue at work, at school or in our community, our instinct is to let others who are better informed speak up. Which prevents people from voting on a school budget or even volunteering to speak in class. We need their input and their solutions, but without insight and understanding, folks understandably hold back. At the same time, alas, it’s apparently becoming a badge of honor to speak up (loudly and often) when one has no knowledge, has done no homework and has no insight. That’s not helpful, but there it is. The all-volunteer Carbon Almanac is a #1 bestseller precisely because it gives people a chance to know what they’re talking about. It’s an almanac, with more than 1,000 sources, so you can look up anything that seems surprising. And because it’s inexpensive and easy to share, you can give one to someone who will benefit from it even more than you. It’s helpful to know. And it’s helpful to talk about what you know. That’s how we make things better. "
662,More than your share,"August 17, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/more-than-your-share/,"The math is simple: many people do less than they should. They might be selfish, but it’s likely that they’re struggling with a lack of resources or a story of insufficiency. Either way, in any community or organization, many people contribute less than their peers. Whether it’s splitting a check, getting a project done or making an impact on the culture or a cause, if you want things to get better, the only way is to be prepared to do more than your fair share. Because we need to make up for the folks who don’t. "
663,Finding persistent invisible systems,"August 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/the-resilient-invisible-system/,"Plastic was inevitable. It took hundreds of years to perfect, but we built a system based on profit, convenience, productivity and markets.  Markets are extremely good at sniffing out problems that can be solved with transactions. If people care enough to buy something to fill a need, someone else is likely to try to make that thing. Along the way, this market-need sensing mechanism leads to factories, to retailers and to marketing. No one is in charge, no one stays on top forever, and the outputs of the system keep shifting–more of what the capital markets, parts of the labor market and most of all, the consumer market demands. And so plastic is inevitable. It makes it easy to manufacture and ship some things. It can increase productivity. It can lower costs. It makes the retail process more convenient–and consumers love convenience. Last year, earthlings manufactured and used a trillion plastic bags. The manufacturer and disposal of plastic has an enormous cost to people and the places we live. But plastic persists as a commercial solution, because the system is invisible and resilient. Each member of the system does what they do, usually for good reasons. Gaiam makes yoga mats and blocks. It’s run by people who care about their impact on things, and their customers are environmentally aware. Yoga blocks are made of semi-hard foam, but they last a long time, and most of their customers are okay with that tradeoff. But these blocks are then shrink-wrapped in plastic. And then the plastic shrink-wrapped foam blocks are wrapped in a relatively thick plastic marketing band to make them easier to display at the store. And then, if you buy the blocks from Amazon, the shrink-wrapped, belly-banded blocks are put in a plastic bag before being shipped to you. Gaiam says that they’d rather not do this, but the retailers they depend on require them to. And the retailers say that they’d rather not require this, but it would increase prices (and perhaps decrease sales) if they had to rely on store personnel to hand-sell them. And Amazon uses a stopwatch and a spreadsheet to figure out what’s cheaper and faster… And so, a system. Plastic is just one example. Industrial and cultural systems are all around us, with all participants doing what they’re encouraged to do and furthering the work of the system. Systems almost never change voluntarily. They rarely change because some of the participants in the system decide that they would prefer new rules. Systems change when their inputs change and when the rules change. In this example, the moment we charge an appropriate price for plastic, incorporating the significant costs of disposal and climate change, the system will notice and act appropriately. Every system we live with has already been altered by the needs of some of the people impacted by the system. As impacts grow, the number of people affected grows as well.  Systemic problems require systemic solutions. "
664,Expectation and delight,"August 15, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/expectation-and-delight/,"They dance with each other. If expectations are too low, you don’t get the gig, and you’ll never have a chance to engage with a customer. But if they’re too high, surprise and remarkability disappear. As you succeed, it’s harder, not easier, to bring delight to the people you serve.  Often, this is replaced by the cognitive dissonance of sunk costs and luxury goods. People assert delight because they think they’re supposed to, because they don’t want to feel stupid–not because you’ve produced anything genuine. "
665,Ownership and responsibility,"August 14, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/ownership-and-responsibility/,You own your living room and your bedroom. We take care of our front lawn for our neighbors. And our trash (in all its forms) belongs to everyone. 
666,Synchronization can be distracting,"August 13, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/synchronization-can-be-distracting/,"Both The Shawshank Redemption and The Big Lebowski bombed. If “bombed” means that during the first few weeks, no one went to a theater to see them. Since then, tens of millions of people have seen and talked about these movies. Tommy James’ first record also failed, because no one played it on the radio for months. And then, one party promoter in Pennsylvania started playing it a lot, and it became a hit. He went on to make seven top 10 hits. We are primed to pay attention to things that happen in a thunderclap.  But the events that change our culture often happen over time, distributed across parts of the population too small to notice. The Grateful Dead were the #1 live touring band more years than any other… and yet they only had one top 40 hit. Connection was worth more than wide and shallow sync. The first challenge is finding the focus and patience to work on the asynchronized adoption of important ideas. And the second is to not sacrifice the larger goal in a frenzied hustle for the big break. Drip by drip makes a wave. "
667,Naysayers (and the grifters),"August 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/naysayers-and-the-grifters/,"Oppositional energy is easy to create and spread. Once you pick a ‘they’, then it’s simply a matter of doing the opposite of whatever ‘they’ recommend. It’s a lazy shortcut, one that divides, demonizes and causes us to suspend our instincts toward better. It works great in marketing a sports team, but it stops being helpful in most other arenas. Oppositional division is a magnet for grifters. A con-man, hustler, swindler or charlatan that can’t possibly do well with thoughtful scrutiny discovers that trolling and arguing is an easy way to bypass the normal examination of what’s actually on offer. It’s not just the patent medicine door-to-door salesperson who does this. It’s large trade associations, industrial lobbyists, pyramid schemers, technobabblers and others as well. Sooner or later, someone points out that there’s a grift going on. Hopefully, we see it before it’s too late. "
668,The wisdom of the water tower,"August 11, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/the-wisdom-of-the-water-tower/,"Look around the rooftops of many cities and you’ll see wooden water towers. New York has thousands of them. The reason is simple and often overlooked: In the morning, when every resident of the building is preparing for the day, there’s a need for thousands of gallons of water under high pressure. Providing that much power via a pump is expensive, noisy and difficult to maintain. The system in use, on the other hand, takes two or three hours to refill the tank, using reliable, quiet and cheap small pumps. After that, gravity is all that’s needed. Adding a reservoir to a high-demand system creates slack, resilience and efficiency.  Too often, foolish short-term profit seekers forget this, and use up what’s in the reservoir without keeping future reserves in mind. "
669,“When do we get to the marketing part?”,"August 10, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/when-do-we-get-to-the-marketing-part/,"It was early in the development of a new product, and someone asked this question. I’m not sure the word “marketing” means what you think it means. Later, we will get to the promotion and advertising part. But right now, this is marketing. All of it. The product. The warranty. The team. The color choices. The pricing. The way it feels in your hand.

For this twelve-year old, tomorrow’s game is the big game, the biggest ever, and the emotional stakes are just as high. It doesn’t matter that this illness isn’t going to be life or death in the next few days. For this patient, it feels that way. Most of what we encounter is driven by emotions, and our emotions are always relative. When we’re shopping for a car or an avocado, we’re buying the way it makes us feel, not how it would make someone else feel. "

But online, when just about anyone might be clicking, watching or sharing, it’s disappointing to put your work into the world and hear nothing. Nothing but a black hole that absorbs your best work and reflects nothing back. And if that happens again and again, it can become overwhelming. It’s tempting to dumb down your work, or go for a shortcut or a quick hit. Worst of all, to simply give up. Please don’t. The body of work you’re creating adds up over time. The consistency and empathy of your vision will seep through. Drip by drip, you’ll create something worth noticing. The key word is empathy. While of course, you’re welcome to make work for just yourself, the path forward lies in figuring who it’s for and the change you seek to make. To go where others are instead of requiring them to put in the effort to figure out what you’re up to. Sooner or later, the crickets will ask for more. "

Perhaps it makes sense to count things where the counting tells us how to do better next time. And to count things that let us know how much risk we can take next time. Or to calibrate our judgment about the market. But it makes no sense at all to count things over which we have no control, and which teach us nothing about the future. Counting our luck (good or bad) doesn’t make us luckier. [PS I’ll be doing a free online seminar at the New York Public Library on Monday as part of Carbon Almanac Week there.

675,Waiting for a miracle?,"August 4, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/waiting-for-a-miracle/,"Every year, tens of thousands of people get into a famous college of their choice. It’s not unlikely that someone will get in, it’s simply not certain that you will. But someone will, so getting isn’t a miracle, it’s simply a long shot. If you add a pound a day to the leg press machine at the gym, it’s possible to have the ability to press 250 pounds within a year. It’s difficult and grueling, but not a long shot. Neither of these outcomes requires a miracle. The first might have low odds, and the second requires persistence. But a miracle is something that’s never happened before, and is not to be counted on. "
676,Time and focus and energy,"August 3, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/time-and-focus-and-energy/,"Sooner or later, they’re all finite. And the way we allocate our time and emotional energy determines what gets done. If we audited your day in six-minute increments, what would we find? By the clock, how did you actually spend the time given to you (we each get the same 24 hours). How much was spent on work? And the work time, how is it correlated with what creates the value you seek? A question that’s harder to measure, but with far more impact, of the time you allocated, what was your focus and emotional drive spent on? What were the crises and highlights of the last day or week?  There’s generally a gulf between what we say we did all day and what we actually did. And there’s an even bigger chasm between the urgencies and emotional moments and the ones we know actually pay off. When we give away our day, we give away our future. "
677,Unavailable options,"August 2, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/unavailable-options/,"“What other colors do you have that are not currently in stock?” There are always more options. If exploring them is the goal, please explore. And sometimes, the unavailable can lead to a breakthrough. But if the job is to simply get the work done, it might be worth pretending that the unexplored options don’t even exist. "
678,How long will this take?,"August 1, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/08/how-long-will-this-take/,"That depends. Will the spec change after we begin? Are we depending on supplies or inputs from other people? Will the budget change? Is this work that has been done by anyone before? Is this work that has been done by this team before? Is finishing it fast more important than doing it well or on budget? Do you want to participate in the work (see the part about the spec)? What are the incentives of the people working on the project? How many different people are involved? Are all the people, budgets and assets in place already? Who is choosing the tools? Pathfinding takes longer than path following. Discussions lead to changes in spec. Dependencies always add time. "
679,A good spec,"July 31, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/a-good-spec/,"If you hand a good spec to three providers, you’ll get three variations back in return. The way you know your spec is worthwhile is that you can live with the differences between them.  If it’s worth caring about, it’s worth writing down. "
680,Strength through resilience,"July 30, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/strength-through-resilience/,"Brittle systems are weak. Short-term wins feel like a demonstration of will by those that seek to be strong. But the only run is the long run. When we embrace flexible, renewable and diverse approaches, we create actual progress.  "
681,Our stories are all we really know,"July 29, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/our-stories-are-all-we-really-know/,"Joni wrote,  “Rows and floes of angel hairAnd ice cream castles in the airAnd feather canyons everywhereI’ve looked at clouds that way But now they only block the sunThey rain and snow on everyoneSo many things I would have doneBut clouds got in my way I’ve looked at clouds from both sides nowFrom up and down, and still somehowIt’s cloud illusions I recallI really don’t know clouds at all” We’d like to believe that our experiences are aligned with the world as it is. They can’t be. Everything we encounter is filtered through what we know. And what we know comes from the very human cultures we inhabit. When someone rejects you for a job, they’re not rejecting you. How could they be? They don’t know you. Instead, they’re rejecting their story of you, the best approximation they had combined with the complicated story they (all of us) tell ourselves about our needs, dreams and fears. We take these stories and we compound them. We sharpen them, rehearse them and turn them into an augmented version of the world as we see it, not the world as it is. If it’s not working for us, the best thing we can do is begin to do the very hard work of telling a new story, a better story, one that’s more useful. The clouds are up to us. "
682,When we need to show our work,"July 28, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/when-we-need-to-show-our-work/,"If you’re basing your proposal on facts, the scientific method, calculations and effectiveness, please show your work. Eagerly share your reasoning, your sources and how you came to this proposed plan. Even better, adopt a posture that welcomes improvements and corrections to your work, because after all, the purpose of your plan is to make change happen. If, on the other hand, your proposal is based on belief and opinion, tell us. You’re entitled to both. And the rest of us are allowed to disagree. When we confuse the two, it causes stress. When we feel the need to provide proof to back up our belief, we’re undermining both. "
683,Management with intent,"July 27, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/management-with-intent/,"When Frederic Taylor brought the world Scientific Management a hundred years ago, it changed what it meant to run a factory. Stopwatches and assembly lines dramatically outperformed the traditional piecemeal approach.  Henry Ford wrote a four page article for Encyclopedia Brittanica about how organizations could embrace the new model, and his focus on this lowered the price of a car by 80% or more. I’m confident that car companies like Dusenberg and Pierce Arrow felt this new approach was beneath them. They probably made thoughtful arguments about esprit de corps and the magic of a hand-built auto. But they’re gone now. Video conferencing, the pandemic and the powerful shifts that knowledge work and the internet have caused are at least as significant a shift in work as the stopwatch was. And yet the Washington Post sent a memo to its reporters telling them that if they didn’t come into the office three days a week, they’d be fired. That’s because an executive there has decided that “the office” and “work” are the same thing. Even though reporters generally report, and reporting is generally done anywhere except in the office. Was there something special about hanging out over coffee, greeting people in the lobby and gossiping every day at the water cooler? Of course. But these were side effects of good work in the office, not the cause of it. If a manager says, “the only way I can create connections, loyalty and a sense of purpose is to force people to shlep to an office every day,” they’re being lazy. Surely we can come up with something better than simply taking attendance. If it’s important to have your brilliant designer review the work of junior architects in person, then do it on purpose. Schedule it and make it worth the focus and effort. If you believe that loyalty and communication increase when people have regular physical interactions without a screen in between them, then build this into the schedule for the work that’s being done, don’t simply wait for it to accidentally happen. As knowledge work has shifted to a remote-first setting, organizations have generally done an astonishingly bad job of bringing any intent at all to how they will build a culture that they care about. Forcing people to show up so they can hide behind a screen in the office is lazy.  Yes, the old culture happened organically over the course of decades. No, it’s unlikely you’ll end up with a new culture you like if you simply pretend that nothing has changed. "
684,Joining the Carbon Almanac Network,"July 26, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/joining-the-carbon-almanac-network/,"We’re looking for some volunteers to join us. It’s life-changing, useful, powerful work. After taking our Almanac to #1 in the US, Italy and the Netherlands, the volunteers on this project are working to amplify our message. We connect online, from countries around the world, and we’ve built an actual social network, one with a purpose. [update: all set for now, thank you]. We’ll be inviting a select group where we think there might be a good fit, and we’d love to hear from you. Thanks for leading and for making a difference. "
685,Shadows and light,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/shadows-and-light-2/,"Rhetorical questions, some easy, some particularly difficult, all worth thinking about: If your house near the ocean has a beautiful view, should the person who buys the lot closer to the shore be able to build a house on it? If your restaurant needs to empty the dirty oil from the deep fryer, is it okay to dump it on the curb, possibly causing a bicyclist to slip and crash? If your car painting facility exhausts tiny droplets of red paint while doing a job, and the paint floats away and lands on a white car nearby, are you responsible? Is it okay to make money selling building toys made from little tiny powerful magnets? What happens if kids eat the pellets and suffer internal injuries? Should a factory dump poison in the river, even if it’s legal? If you deep fry your holiday turkey, is it okay to pour the used oil down the drain? Or dump it into the river? Can the architect of a skyscraper specify mirrored glass, even if the glare bothers people in nearby buildings? What about building a huge skyscraper that casts a shadow all day on the park next door? And… is it okay to take a private jet to Scotland, even if the exhaust from that jet will cause distress to countless people who didn’t choose it? What if it takes a long time for the effects to be felt? No easy answers. But we need to keep asking the questions. "
686,Paths not taken,"July 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/embracing-constraints-2/,"And vs Or. Leading a project is about causing the death of a million ‘ands’. There was a long line at the ice cream stand, but the person in front wasn’t budging. The customer had narrowed down the choice to four flavors, but they were paralyzed, unable to choose. It’s not because any of the flavors wouldn’t be fine. They were all good choices. It’s because choosing one flavor meant not having the other three. Getting an ice cream had turned into a dance with regret. You can’t build a luxury car that’s also inexpensive, AND drives well off-road, AND is very fast AND super safe. You can’t create an event that’s intimate, open to all comers, proven, resilient for any weather, held outdoors and unique. We focus on the frustration of losing an ‘and’ when we get nervous about the decisions we’re asked to make, when we are hesitant about commitment. And we obsess over the constraints we’ve already accepted because it slows us down and amplifies our fears. Instead of focusing on what we’re building, we focus on the paths that are no longer open. If we’re going to create anything at all, if we’re going to ship the work, the positive path is to look for the constraints and grab them. They’re the point. No constraints, no project. When we see them as stepping stones on the way to the work we hope to do, they’re not a problem, they’re a sign that we’re onto something. Managing a project is the craft of picking this ‘or’ that. ‘And’ isn’t often welcome because ‘and’ is a trap. "
687,Dependable,"July 24, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/dependable/,"This is a distinct skill. Something can be dependable without being extraordinary, rare or even a good value. It’s also one of the easiest skills to acquire, and often quite valuable if you stick with it. While sticking with dependable is sort of redundant, it’s also required. "
688,Bestseller energy,"July 23, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/bestseller-energy/,"Something magical happens when people are in alignment and an idea becomes a bestseller. When there’s a line out the door. When there’s a buzz in the room. When people are talking about the work you’re doing. At least some of the people. A restaurant is more fun. A course seems more important. A project at work gets more attention. When the right circle of people are involved, a new energy arrives. Less than two weeks ago, The Carbon Almanac was published in North America and Italy (just after it came out in the Netherlands). It went to #1 in all three countries. It was featured on newscasts and in blogs, newspapers and magazines. And the volunteers who built this did simultaneous book signings on six continents, with dozens of co-authors coming together in a hybrid virtual/real life jamboree of possibility. Creating a world record while we were at it. Of course, on a planet this big, this is a drop in a bucket. No book, no movie, no TV show, no movement reaches the majority of the masses. But that’s okay. In the community you seek to serve, creating bestseller energy leads to more possibility, more connection and more magic. "
689,I believe things that aren’t true,"July 22, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/i-believe-things-that-arent-true/,"Most of us do. The interesting challenge is that our brain doesn’t often make beliefs and tested reality feel like different things. It’s almost as if ‘true’ and ‘belief’ only became separate categories in our recent past. As our actions continue to bump against reality, and our culture has dramatically more interactions between and among people from different backgrounds, this bug can become a real problem. "
690,Getting stuck on the title,"July 21, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/getting-stuck-on-the-title/,"The brand name, the first name, the label… Is To Kill a Mockingbird a good title? By most measures of most committees, definitely not. And yet, it clearly and most definitely worked. Starbucks has nothing to do with Moby Dick. Nike is easy to mispronounce.  The title is simply the thing you say when you talk about the thing to someone else. It’s not the thing itself. "
691,The likable brand (or person),"July 20, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/the-likable-brand-or-person/,"Likability is a weird quality. Plenty of people are fans of Aretha Franklin or Bob Dylan, but it’s not because either of them spent a lot of time mailing out Christmas cards or being particularly warm to their fans. Google doesn’t do tech support and plenty of popular high-end restaurants got that way by being difficult to book and not particularly welcoming to new patrons. One reason is that we’re drawn to status. To like something as a way of certifying our insight or rank. But there’s a different path, one that’s far easier to maintain and travel. It’s simple: Like your customers and they’re more likely to like you back. This is one reason that the Beatles switched their focus after their first US tour (and eventually stopped touring). They couldn’t figure out how to like the screaming young fans that didn’t have much in the way of discernment. Instead, they shifted to writing and producing music for fans and colleagues that they wanted to spend their time liking. If you want to be more liked, begin by liking. "
692,Detachment and commitment,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/detachment-and-commitment/,"Working professionals develop emotional detachment. It’s the only way to thrive in the work. Emotional detachment helps us remember that we are not our work, and that feedback is useful, not an attack. Commitment permits us to keep going (especially when we’re asked to provide more effort than we planned). It’s easy to confuse the two. Being detached doesn’t mean you don’t care. It simply means you’re focusing on the work and those you serve, not on your own narrative. And being committed comes from a professional decision, not from an existential crisis. PS Thanks to Ari for two lovely essays (1 and 2) with his take on my work around marketing, dignity and leadership. "
693,Are you an autodidact?,"July 19, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/are-you-an-autodidact/,"It’s far easier now than it’s ever been before. (You can look it up.) [Bonus PS: highlighting some climate-related art and artists who helped with the Almanac: Von Wong (launching a new piece this week), Justin Brice Guariglia and Shepard Fairey.] [Bonus PS2: A major addendum to the Almanac just went live today. It’s free here.] "
694,Where do jobs come from?,"July 18, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/where-do-jobs-come-from/,"It must be more than a coincidence that there are almost enough jobs for everyone–a billion more jobs on Earth than there were a generation ago. Unemployment is debilitating and a real problem, but even high unemployment in many countries still means that most people have a job. Many times, it’s a job that didn’t exist before they had it. Jobs exist because people are productive. When their productivity produces more value than the money they are paid, someone keeps the difference. Actually, two someones: The customer gets some of the benefit and the organizer of the job gets the rest. Viewed this way, it’s easy to see that jobs aren’t a bureaucratic niche to be filled. They’re the opportunity for value to be created. Find the value and you will find the job. "
695,Little billboards,"July 17, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/little-billboards/,"On the West Side Highway in Manhattan, there’s currently a billboard for some sort of placebo supplement. In the corner is a QR code for more information. Unless the person in the passenger seat has a telephoto lens on their phone, there’s no way in the world that this is going to work. My late friend Jay Levinson said that the most effective billboard would say, “FREE COFFEE, NEXT EXIT.” A call to action, relevant to the viewer, easy to see and understand. Actual billboards are a whole category of media, but now we’re surrounded by a new kind, a smaller, more evanescent and common one: Social media posts. You might see a thousand of these a day. Social media began as text updates from one human to another, but thanks to photo sharing, some of the posts have become something else entirely. A chance to create consistent, actionable and clear reminders of what you are and what you stand for. But keeping Jay’s edict in mind, they work best when they’re about the viewer as much as they are about you. They work better when they can be seen and understood from a distance. And they work better when they “sound like you.” Here’s an example of a few dozen digital billboards that my fellow volunteers created for the Almanac. These blew me away. Free coffee indeed. "
696,The crossroads,"July 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/the-crossroads/,"Which way to head? We live in a world characterized by mistrust, ill health, economic uncertainty, inflicted racial trauma, generational shift and the existential crisis caused by carbon. Not to mention the stress and dissolution of traditional pillars like organized education, office space and live gatherings. And we live in a world with breathtaking medical technology, artificial intelligence, widespread and rapid cultural coordination, efficient farming, a move away from greed and the beginning of green tech. As well as self-driven learning, diverse cultural projects and the long tail. Now more than ever, there’s room for leaders. Go first. "
697,The correlation,"July 15, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/the-correlation/,"There might be a 100% correlation between what you do and what you get and what you want (if you’re trying to train for the hundred-meter dash.)  Anything that makes you go faster is correlated with the goal, which is winning the race. On the other hand, being funny isn’t always correlated with being a rich and famous comedian. Being the funniest is not the same in comedy as being the fastest is in sprinting. And most of what we spend our time on is closer to comedy than it is to sprinting. The things we believe are important, useful or moral are not always related to the metrics that the marketplace focuses on. That’s partly because we’re not being compared using something as simple as a stopwatch. And it’s because what other people seek out might not match what we think is the point of the work. It’s important to figure out whether the thing you want to accomplish is correlated with the performance that some imagine it might be. For a lot of us, that’s more difficult than it sounds. "
698,Who will you share it with?,"July 14, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/who-will-you-share-it-with/,"Books used to be a solitary endeavor. Ironically, it took the network effect and noise of the web to flip that idea upside down. Now, a book is a totem, a chance to share, an item to be discussed, a physical instantiation of an idea that can be drawn on, exchanged or simply sit on your desk. On Saturday, in dozens of countries around the world, the volunteers behind the Carbon Almanac will be holding book signings to celebrate the launch of this project. I’ll be doing three, and I hope you’ll stop by and say hello if you can. (Details and venues are here). It’s a world record signing because it’s the only world we’ve got–and we are all authors of our future. Why a book and not a website? Because the book is complete, coherent and represents a moment in time. Because a book can create a conversation and an event. Because we hope you’ll buy three. Why three? Because when you hand someone a book that they might not have thought to buy on their own, you can talk about it. And that’s what’s missing in this urgent but largely ignored moment. The conversation. The peer-to-peer interactions that help us make up our minds and then take action. You know someone who needs to understand what’s happening, because they care enough about our future that they’d actually like to know. Get them a copy. Hold your own signing. Talk about it and then see the systems that are changing our world. We need to start now. We are all authors of our future. And doing nothing is a choice, but one that we’ll regret. The book is already a #1 bestseller in Italy and the United States and available in the Netherlands as well. Thank you for supporting it. PS here’s another try at inserting our team’s launch video. Sorry about the tech glitch.  "
699,Intentional design (and complicated systems),"July 13, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/intentional-design-and-complicated-systems/,"Intentional design is the most productive kind. It begins with “who’s it for?” and “what’s it for?” as foundational questions. Along the way, complicated systems muddy design because there are so many “who”s to answer to. Take this simple product found at a Hilton hotel, designed and sold by a division of Sysco, the giant food service company. It’s a little bigger than your thumb… Well, if the “what’s it for” is to use in the shower, and the “who’s it for” is the hotel guest, it fails in countless ways. It’s almost impossible to read (white type on a clear background). If you’re wearing glasses, or there’s steam, or you need glasses, then it is impossible to read. It’s almost impossible to open as well. The diameter of the top is too small for most people to get a good grip on, particularly when used as intended–while in the shower. It turns out that the top doesn’t even screw off, there’s a tiny sharp lip that has to be popped up. And now we get to the system problems. The user didn’t purchase this. A well-meaning bureaucrat at Hilton worked with a well-meaning salesperson at a Sysco company to make the transaction happen. Both of them were trying to please their bosses. This might be as simple as, “buy something cheap,” but it could also have to do with favors owed, financing options or the convenience of delivery. But wait, it gets worse. When this container is used just one time, it’s discarded. It’s almost certainly put in an incinerator and burned for electricity or simply thrown into a landfill, where it will remain for a million years. The bottle is not only made of plastic, it’s at least five times thicker and heavier than it needs to be to do its job. It’s not a refillable pump that is affixed to the wall and lasts for four years. It’s a disposable jar that uses almost as much energy to produce and lasts for one day.  The end result is hundreds of thousands or millions of these bottles, poisoning our world, simply because one designer asked the wrong questions. This is the reason The Carbon Almanac needs to be part of the conversation at ordinary companies like Hilton, for typical employees like the hard-working person who is the customer of the hard-working person who designed the bottle in the first place. Because one person designed one item that ended up being reproduced a million times, frustrating hundreds of thousands of wet people in hundreds of thousands of showers and then producing countless pounds of toxic carbon released into the air. Nobody wins when this happens. It wastes time and money and goodwill. All because the system isn’t clear about who it’s for and what it’s for. "
700,It’s easier when you know,"July 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/its-easier-when-you-know/,"Someone is going to ask you. They probably already have. A co-worker, a boss, a politician, a kid… they’ll ask you about sustainability, the climate, investments, choices to be made about the future. This is the Cliff’s Notes and guidebook for that moment. We make choices every day. Choices about what to buy, whether to recycle something, what to drive, who to vote for, how to produce and whether to go for more or for less. We make choices about the future, often with considerable consequences. But we’re confused. Often deliberately, by forces that would rather we didn’t make up our own minds, who prefer that we don’t learn what need to learn. And sometimes we’re confused simply as a side effect of a complicated situation made even more complicated by a flurry of charts, graphs and opinions. We need to make up our own minds. Over the last 9 months, I’ve learned an enormous amount. Changed my mind about things I was sure were true. I’ve discovered thoughtful analysis and significant falsehoods. When I volunteered to help organize the Carbon Almanac, I didn’t know that thousands of people in more than 90 countries would volunteer to join the process, and I’m so glad they did. And today’s the day the book arrives in the US and Canada, with worldwide editions coming soon. (I’d avoid the audio edition, as it’s really designed to be a browsable, shareable almanac.) We have two slogans: Don’t take our word for it and It’s not too late. You’re already being asked to decide. Knowing what’s going on and being able to look up authoritative data gives you the chance to make up your own mind. There are more than 1,000 sources, all online, all organized in the Almanac. Isn’t it better to know? And it isn’t too late to make an impact. But we need to begin. We need to see the systems and make a decision about whether they’re the systems we want to hand off to our kids. I’m grateful to every person who contributed to this all-volunteer effort, and to you, for caring enough to learn about what’s happening. I hope you’ll get a few copies, share them and join with people around the world to learn what’s happening. Thank you. PS We’re doing a worldwide book signing on Saturday. I’ll post more details later in the week. "
701,"“Knock, knock”","July 11, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/knock-knock/,"The purpose of most communication isn’t to completely explain yourself. Too often, we get stuck relieving tension, making our case and closing the door on the discussion. The purpose is to open the door to interaction, learning and action. “Who’s there?” is a fine response to hope for. Communication is a process, not an event. "
702,Best [insert] ever,"July 10, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/best-insert-ever/,"This is a trap worth avoiding. When we examine our life experiences, the ones that stand out are usually about change. Either we were changed or we helped someone else get to where they sought to go. And change is fleeting. And change changes us. We can’t step in the same river twice, because the second time, the river itself has changed. The pressure we put on ourselves for every project to be “the best ever” experience creates a shallow race for bling instead of a deeper, more useful focus on what’s actually possible. Seeking to rank our experiences takes us out of the moment. It turns us into sportscasters, spectators and statisticians. We end up comparing our wedding or our box office numbers or our tweet stats not only to our own best ever, but to the stats of others. This summer is unlikely to be your best summer ever. But it will be a summer, and it’s up to each of us to decide what to do with it.  Every project is worth the journey if we let it be. "
703,With/for/to,"July 9, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/with-for-to/,Most of our interactions fall into one of these categories. Our strategy for the game involves doing something to the other team. Many service businesses are aligned around the idea of doing things for their patients or customers. And long-term mutually beneficial relationships are built around with. Trouble happens when one party expects a different relationship than the other one might. 
704,Office gossip,"July 8, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/office-gossip/,"Humans gossipped before we figured out fire, housing or farming. It’s built into our culture and possibly our DNA. Gossip informs culture and can influence connection and hierarchies. And in many communities, it’s destructive. If office gossip is benefitting you and the people you work with, good for you. But if office gossip is leading to stress, turnover or low satisfaction, it might be time to do something about it. Two suggestions: The first is a simple boundary. Don’t talk about anyone on the team unless they’re in the room. This is simple to say and surprisingly difficult to do. Talking about people behind their back is built into the practice of management. It’s also the main sport of the water cooler and the fuel for gossip. One boss meets with another boss to talk about an employee. And now there’s a reason to gossip and wonder. With Zoom calls transcending space and time, there’s no longer a logistical reason to leave someone out. And you can adopt the posture that if it’s worth talking about someone, it’s worth including the person being talked about. Once this becomes your practice, it gets more difficult to speculate about what was said, because nothing was said. The second, which can’t work until you’ve consistently done the first, is to challenge office gossip at every turn. Thriving DM traffic on your Slack, cliques in the lunchroom–these undermine the organization you’re building. You wouldn’t tolerate people stealing petty cash or telling off your customers… the culture becomes what you tolerate. Gossip won’t disappear. It can’t. But making it clear to the high performers that things aren’t like that around here–and meaning it–sends a message about the focus and culture of the team you’re working so hard to build. "
705,The practice effect,"July 7, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/the-practice-effect/,"There are two kinds of skills, resources and tools: Ones that get used up as you use them. And ones that get better when you do. Nobody wants there to be a crowd at the ski area on a bluebird powder day–too many people use up the new snow. On the other hand, it’s no fun at all to go dancing when you’re the only one in the club. A painting or a song that’s experienced by more people is worth more. A carpenter increases her skills when she works on new projects (to a point). On the other hand, a sharp knife gets dull if you use it too often… If you’ve got something that benefits from use, from practice and community, use it and share it.  "
706,“Do you have a plan?”,"July 6, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/do-you-have-a-plan/,"First, let’s agree that there’s a problem. It may be that I think we’re facing something serious, something costly, something urgent–and you don’t. We can have an honest conversation about the problem without worrying about whether there’s an easy or certain solution. We can also have a conversation about whether it’s a problem (problems have solutions) or whether it’s simply a situation, something like gravity that we have to live with. Once we agree that we have a problem, the status quo will show up. It will argue with every tool it has that any variation from the current path is too risky, too expensive and too painful to consider. The status quo will stall. It will argue for studies and will amplify the pain that will be caused to some as we try to make things better for everyone. And the status quo usually wins. That’s because the makers of change are now playing defense, forced to justify every choice and ameliorate every inconvenience. Perhaps there’s a more useful way forward. We begin by agreeing that there’s a problem. And then each party, every single one, needs to put forward a plan. A plan that either addresses the problem or takes responsibility for not addressing it. And for each plan, we can consider the likely outcomes. For each plan, we can ask, “will that work?” and follow it up with, “why?” and “how?” Perhaps you don’t think it’s a problem worth solving. That’s important to bring up before we ask you if you have a plan. Delay might be the best option. But then let’s be honest and announce that instead of simply stalling. "
707,Significant hurdles,"July 5, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/significant-hurdles/,"If your plan, your idea or your art doesn’t involve any significant hurdles in moving forward, it’s probably not worth that much. If it were easy, everyone would do it. The tactic is to seek a path where you see and understand the significant hurdles that kept others away. And then dance with them. They’re not a problem, they’re a feature. "
708,Demand responsibility,"July 4, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/demand-responsibility/,"Plenty of people insist on freedom and independence.  More rare and far more effective is to claim responsibility instead. “I’ve got this,” can go a long way. "
709,Two kinds of good cooks,"July 3, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/two-kinds-of-good-cooks/,"One is very skilled at following the recipe. Quality control, consistency and diligence. The other understands how the recipe works, sees patterns and opportunities and changes the recipe to fit the problem to be solved. It’s about metaphor in addition to process. Both are useful. If you think this is a post about cooking, you might be the first kind of cook. "
710,10 reps,"July 2, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/10-reps/,"If you can do it once, you might be able to do it ten times. And if you do it ten times, it will become a skill and a practice. You’ll do it more naturally and more often. Sending a note, changing your mind, throwing a ball, offering a kind word, doing leg presses. Ten reps is a great place to begin. "
711,Starting with agreement,"July 1, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/07/starting-with-agreement/,"Resilient systems are better than fragile ones. Leave the campsite better than you found it. Clean air is better than dirty air. It’s more reliable to invest in things that produce positive impacts over time. When the numbers add up, believe them People who show their work are more likely to be right. Important work is better done now, not later. Talking about our problems makes the solutions more robust. It’s better to make up your mind after you see the data, not before. If we begin with what we agree on, it’s easier to move forward. Of course, there’s always this alternative: "
712,Compounded luck,"June 30, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/compounded-luck/,"If you and I play a game of cards, the winner will largely be decided by luck. Get good cards and you come out ahead. If you and I play 100 games of backgammon, the better player will win, because the luck of the dice regress to the mean, evening out over time, leaving skill as the dominant factor. Good game design involves creating the conditions where early luck doesn’t destroy the rest of the game. A good roll or a good first hand shouldn’t eliminate the opportunity for other players to have a chance. This is why Monopoly is a more accurate social commentary than it is a good game. When people talk about life and say, “there’s no such thing as luck,” they might be referring to the fact that in the long run, people who are prepared, persistent and granted the benefit of the doubt often do okay. But what they’re missing is that life (and our culture) isn’t constructed as a game that doesn’t reward early luck. Early luck has a massive impact. Where you’re born, the caste society puts you in, whether or not you were appropriately precocious in various early ranking systems–these all get compounded. Malcolm Gladwell has written about birth month having a significant factor in who gets to play in the NHL–because where a Canadian kid plays hockey when he’s six adds up over the decades. [If you’re a sports fan, that means we could create a second NHL, with just as many star players, simply by creating a different farm system for kids born six months later].  Compounding early luck is generally fine with people who have early luck. What a surprise. But it’s unfair and it’s also a talent-utilization problem that hurts everyone. When we fail to create the conditions for people to persist with resilience until the luck comes along, we all lose. Organizations have the opportunity to invest in the long haul. They can take profits from early luck and apply them to areas where upsides will eventually appear. This is the secret of successful VCs like Brad Feld and Fred Wilson. A portfolio is a simple way to reduce the impact of luck (good or bad) over time. But we’re all in organizations. We have a chance to not confuse early luck with skill, and take the steps to build enough resilience into our journey that we’re more likely to get where we’re going. "
713,“And then what happens”,"June 29, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/and-then-what-happens-2/,"We’re not very good at predicting the future. We’re very good at being aware of the urgency of the moment, and familiar with our need to deal with emergencies. Before we react, though, it might be worth asking “and then what happens,” five times. Five steps from here to there… If any of the steps involve, “and then a miracle happens,” or “we’ll deal with that later,” it might be worth taking a few more moments to reconsider the first step. "
714,Snake handling,"June 28, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/snake-handling/,"This is a very different task than snake charming. The first is far more common, but it requires heavy equipment and is often dangerous… On the other hand, if you have empathy and patience, it’s possible to learn to charm the snakes instead. "
715,What makes it a profession?,"June 27, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/what-makes-it-a-profession/,"Malpractice by one of us is malpractice by all of us. When a calling turns into an industry, that can change. In an industry, it’s buyer beware. It’s us against the rest. It’s a quiet line of self-preservation. But in a profession, it’s clear that a service is on offer, and that standards and trust matter. "
716,When you feel like it,"June 26, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/when-you-feel-like-it/,"It’s possible to create a life where we only perform tasks when we feel like it. More likely, though, we end up with commitments. Commitments require us to do work when they feel like it, regardless of whether we do or not. And the best sorts of commitments create a positive cycle. We end up changing our attitude and our energy precisely because we said we would. This is one reason why a long vacation can leave us in a torpor. Left to our own devices, we skid to a halt.  "
717,But what’s your budget?,"June 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/but-whats-your-budget/,"This can be an uncomfortable question. Not because any of us have unlimited time and unlimited money, but because it puts us on the spot in a few ways: Too often, we’d rather say, “I’ll know it when I see it, it’s too important to compromise, you’re sucking all the fun out of it, the contractors won’t work with a budget and–don’t you want it to be good?” But the best work regularly ships on time and on budget. "
718,The kindness bonus,"June 24, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/the-kindness-bonus/,"“Please be kind” sounds like a moral imperative. And in some ways, it is. But behind the theory of the firm and a key building block of successful communities is the idea that kind interactions are significantly more productive. When people feel seen and respected, they’re more likely to focus on what needs to be done, instead of taking umbrage or being defensive. When we leave opportunities and pathways for others, they can move forward with less friction. And when we’re enjoying our days, we’ve created a posture that spreads. Hockey games aren’t supposed to be kind. But just about everything else works better when we don’t throw elbows. "
719,“Could be better”,"June 23, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/could-be-better/,"Three words that open the door for insight, understanding and improvement. Gratitude isn’t in question. Neither is acceptance of the situation. It’s not unpatriotic or disloyal to talk about how something could be improved. Instead, when we care enough to say, “could be better,” we’re putting ourselves on the hook to create. You need to care enough to describe an improvement. Because once you’ve announced how something can be better, you get the chance to show that it can be done. "
720,Fear and footnotes,"June 22, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/fear-and-footnotes/,"When you’re trying to make an argument in a scientific journal or a history monograph, you’ll need footnotes. Show your work. Make it clear who came before and what you’re basing your thesis on. But it seems as though when we’re nervous and afraid, we don’t need any footnotes. “No,” is all we have to offer. Show your work. It’s a good way to demonstrate that your decision isn’t based on fear alone. "
721,Thoughts on the solstice,"June 21, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/thoughts-on-the-solstice/,"For half the planet, today is the longest day of the year. For the rest of us, the shortest. There was a solstice before there were people. All of our other holidays don’t fit that definition. They’re invented. Short-lived. Worldwide, it’s a moment to realize that this is the only planet in the known universe that can sustain human life. And the planet is changing. We’re changing it.  It’s worth knowing how it’s changing, understanding the implications and deciding to work for systemic change. Because it’s not too late, but we need to see the change that’s happening, right now.  Many believe that it’s worth understanding and sharing the information. We can’t make things better if we can’t see what’s going on. Do you want to know?  Today was going to be the pub day for The Carbon Almanac, but we pushed it back two weeks because of global supply chain issues. The Dutch edition is out today, with editions for Italy, China, Korea, Japan, the UK and the Czech Republic coming soon. The US print run is smaller than we (the hundreds of volunteers who created this book) hoped for, so I hope you can pre-order before it sells out. Numbers and charts and tables are only part of the story of our world. We can see the changes with our own eyes. We worked with Getty to collect the work of photographers and artists to capture this moment in pictures. Download and share a free copy here. Systemic change requires sharing. Sharing information, sharing connection and sharing the work. You can make an impact simply by understanding and then teaching someone else.  "
722,The rise of placebos,"June 20, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/the-rise-of-placebos/,"I’m a fan of appropriate placebos. They often have few side effects, they’re inexpensive and they work when used in the right situations. You can check out my rant on them here, it’s been read millions of times to date. A placebo isn’t just a medical intervention. It’s any tool we use to feel better in a complicated world. They don’t just make us feel better, sometimes they actually change our physiology and can make us better. A wine label is a placebo for some (expensive wine tastes better, until the labels are obscured) and even search engine satisfaction largely comes from the story we tell ourselves about what we’re using to do the search. Many forms of marketing are actually efforts to build placebo effects. But how do we pick them? Why is chicken soup good for a cold but not tomato soup or turkey soup? And why are we seeing (often to our detriment) a rise in nostrums, conspiracies and stories around things that used to be driven by facts and replicable studies? For a placebo to be effective, our brain needs room to maneuver. That probably involves: • Complicated problems • Taking place over time • That have emotional implications When those conditions exist, our minds look for an explanation, firm footing and a chance to make things better. But that’s always been true. The other factor is that we need to hear about a placebo from someone who had it work. The power of suggestion requires that a suggestion be made. If an influential person was dieting on chicken soup when their cold naturally got better, it’s not difficult to ascribe the improvement to the soup. Because the placebo was around when the disease ran its course, we associate the soup with the improvement. We can then tell others (increasing our confidence, status and affiliation) in an effort to generously improve the health of our friends. Some of them will also be eating soup when their cold improves, further cementing the advantage that chicken soup has in the race to be the placebo of choice for colds. We had plenty of placebos of every kind a thousand years ago. We had no idea why the sun rose, why the snow fell and why someone got sick. Placebos were essential for our emotional well-being. But the rise of the scientific method moved many of these stories to the side, because we understood things more clearly, and things that were complicated became less so. In the last ten years or so, we’re seeing a shift happen. And, as always, the internet is the agent of change here. The internet has given people a chance to share their fears and confusion and frustration about the world, particularly complicated things that happen over time. The world is not getting more complicated, but our fears and confusions are getting more widely shared, which makes it feel more complicated. Few people rant about gravity, but it’s easy to see mystery or even conspiracy in events and trends that are less simple. If someone suggests a placebo as a cure, a palliative or a cultural touchstone, it might be used by others. And some that use it will find that it was present as things got better, and so it gains in currency. Not because it worked in the way that vitamin C works to cure scurvy, but worked in the sense that it was co-existent with something else happening. Placebos that give us solace and patience with no side effects are magical. Alas, when we apply them to areas where we’d be better off doing something that has a more direct impact, we’re making a mistake that costs us and those around us as well. "
723,The arc of history,"June 19, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/the-arc-of-history/,"By every geologic measure, modern human life is a tiny blip, a spark of static on a very long-playing record. For most of the time that life has existed on Earth, there were no humans. And when there were human-like creatures, they spent much of their time doing not much. Nomads eat when they need to, move around and hang out. It’s not an easy life, but there are none of the modern distractions or problems that urban culture presents. Grain began to change things, because agriculture produces far more calories per acre, allowing populations to grow… and to store the results of our labor. Stored grain, though, is easier to steal and to tax than something that must be eaten fresh off the tree or harvested. And so you get markets and wars and governments and the rise of a group of people wealthier than any individual farmer or nomad could be. This is all mostly irrelevant. It’s irrelevant in the way that understanding how Edison made movies or sound recordings is irrelevant. It’s nice to know the history, but it doesn’t help you win an Oscar or a Grammy. The two most relevant forces are in a powerful dance right now: • The carbon-fueled growth of industry. • The information-fueled growth of ideas and connection. Industry changed the way the Earth looks from space, it enriched billions of people and it has driven our species to the brink of extinction due to our impact on the climate. It has often been based on caste and coercion, and created both opportunities and problems. Connection has enabled culture to thrive, and in recent years, amplified by the noise of the internet, it’s also made many people miserable in the short-run. As we slog through another long, challenging year, one in which these two forces conflict, amplify and engage with each other, I’m remembering what Theodore Parker said more than 150 years ago: I do not pretend to understand the moral universe, the arc is a long one, my eye reaches but little ways. I cannot calculate the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; I can divine it by conscience. But from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice. We really don’t have a lot of choice about yesterday. Here we are, many of us with more leverage and power than any human on Earth had just a hundred years ago.  In the last few decades, so many areas of culture have moved forward that defenders of the status quo are becoming exhausted trying to defend what was. And they sometimes express that exhaustion through anger, division and vitriol. The good news is that we have exactly what we need to make things better. If enough of us stand up and lead and connect, we’ll continue to get closer to what’s possible. Here’s to peace of mind and possibility. They go together. "
724,Acceptance vs. ennui,"June 18, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/acceptance-vs-ennui/,"The best way to make things better is to see how they are. And then do something about it. Acknowledging the problem is not the same as giving up. Too often, we’d rather not hear about it, or we choose to catastrophize as a way of protecting ourselves from the reality of what’s actually happening. Denialism isn’t a long-term strategy. "
725,Carrying benefits,"June 17, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/carrying-benefits/,"Compared to easily-overlooked carrying costs, carrying benefits are practically invisible. Pay once, but come out ahead over and over again. There are habits, assets and learnings that seem too expensive right now. And so we simply stick with our status quo. When we take the time to itemize the carrying benefits and write them down, understanding the accumulated benefits over time, they’re harder to overlook. "
726,Carrying costs,"June 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/carrying-costs/,"How much does a puppy cost? At the shelter, maybe you need to put up a hundred dollar fee or donation. But that’s tiny compared to food, vet bills, time spent walking, chew toys, yak bones, bully sticks, groomers and those ridiculous dog costumes… perhaps $20,000 if you add it all up. Yet we tend to focus on the cost of acquisition. Twitter is free. Oh, it’s not. It’s not free at all. It costs a fortune in time and brain space. Putting your business online is cheap. A simple web page. Except it’s not. It’s hundreds of thousands of dollars in management time and salaries. Announcing the carrying costs up front is a great way to avoid hiding from them. "
727,Some questions,"June 15, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/some-questions/,"Who’s it for? What’s it for? What change do you seek to make? What’s the hard part? If you could learn one skill that would help your project, what would it be? How can you tell if it’s working? Would it be easier if you had help? Would it be easier to make an impact if you were willing to give up credit or control? Does this project matter? Is the journey worth it? What are you afraid of? Would they miss you if you stopped? "
728,Problems now (problems later),"June 14, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/problems-now-problems-later/,"People always address now problems before they work on later problems. Every time. On one night in 2004, you might have had two choices. You could go out for a fancy dinner with friends, or you could buy one share of Google at their IPO. A couple of decades later, your dinner is forgotten but the shares are up many times. Of course, some people did buy that stock. That’s not because they encountered an opportunity to save for their retirement 18 years later. It’s because they told themselves a story that people in their shoes sent money to the market that day. They turned a problem in the future (retirement) into a problem for the now (I’m a loser if I go out to this dinner instead). Our story about the future is in the now, regardless of how far away the future is. All we can do with the future is experience our story about it right now. All problems are short-term problems if we tell ourselves the right story. But we usually don’t, because we discount the future significantly. A grilled cheese sandwich today is more important than two grilled cheese sandwiches next week. Unless we tell ourselves a present and urgent story about what it feels like to ignore the future. Because sooner or later, we live in the present. A present filled with stories and cultural pressure and the urgencies we invent for ourselves. "
729,"Handmade, original and significant","June 13, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/handmade-original-and-significant/,"There are still pockets of our culture where a single individual can create and share a body of work that’s resonant and unique. I’ve become hooked on a podcast called A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs. I’m now a backer on Patreon. The show is at https://500songs.com/ [My suggestion is that you start with a song you know and love instead of beginning at the beginning.] It’s simply extraordinary. Trivia connected to cultural commentary connected to the endless web of the pop music world. Hundreds of hours of insight and connection, all written, narrated and produced by a single person. There’s a lot to be said about the power of teams to create art and magic. But there’s still room for individuals to do this as well. [While we’re talking music, happy to suggest a piece of software that might change how you find and play it. Built by a team, not an individual, Roon is a game-changer.] "
730,Push vs. pull,"June 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/push-vs-pull/,"The non-networked world was driven by push. The merchant stocked goods and waited for you to come buy them. The manufacturer made things in advance and advertised so you’d go buy them. The cab waited by the corner hoping you’d come out and hail it. The door-to-door salesperson went door to door… But the web amplifies pull instead. When you need something, you tell Google or Amazon or Lyft or Shopify and they bring it to you. The ratio of inventory to demand has shifted dramatically–instead of one encyclopedia in every single house that sits idly waiting for you to need it, there’s just one Wikipedia, available to be pulled by anyone, at will. When we seek to make change, our instinct is to start pushing. But shifting to pull can create efficiencies that can’t be matched by mass promotion. "
731,The coyote’s anguish,"June 11, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/the-coyotes-anguish/,"It’s one of the best metaphors for life, marketing, achievement, community and possibility in all of TV cartooning. The coyote is always looking for a quick win. Because he doesn’t persist with a plan that builds over time, all of his outlandish stunts add up to nothing but frustration. The coyote is obsessed with gaining at the expense of his enemy. As a result, he’s faced with either defeat or short-lived and ultimately empty victory. The coyote is obviously immortal, but he’s always in pain. Either in the pain that comes from hitting a wall at 100 miles an hour, or the pain of knowing that yet another short-term plan came to no good. The coyote challenges the laws of physics in the belief that he, and he alone is entitled to his own rules. The coyote is happy to spend money on ludicrous devices that make promises he must know are empty, but instead of investing, he keeps chasing the gimmicks. The coyote picked the wrong goal. Even though it’s clear he can’t succeed, he doesn’t switch, obsessing about sunk costs instead. And even though he has experienced the frustration of the short-term selfish shortcut again and again, he never pauses to consider what would happen if he created something of value instead. "
732,Marketing vs. promotion,"June 10, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/marketing-vs-promotion/,"People often use the words to mean the same thing, but they’re different. If an exterminator puts signs and banners in front of a fancy house when they’re inside killing rats, that’s promotion. But it’s not good marketing. Marketing is creating the conditions for a story to spread so you can help people get to where they hope to go. Marketing is work that matters for people who care, a chance to create products and services that lead to change. Promotion can support that. Or it might simply be a selfish hustle for attention. If you have to interrupt, trick or coerce people to get the word out, you might be doing too much promotion and not enough marketing. "
733,Are you smart?,"June 9, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/are-you-smart/,"Smart is no longer memorization. It’s not worth much. Smart is no longer access to information. Everyone has that. Smart is: • Situational awareness • Filtering information • Troubleshooting • Clarity of goals • Good taste • Empathy and compassion for others • The ability to make decisions that further your goals The good news is that smart is a choice, and smart is a skill.

734,Scale vs. Speed: Why organizations slow down,"June 8, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/scale-vs-speed-why-organizations-slow-down/,"If you compare a Starbucks of ten years ago to a current one, they’re virtually the same. Compare this to the originals in Seattle, and the difference is startling. The same goes for the design of a typical McDonald’s. Apple launched the Mac with about a dozen full-time people working on its development. Today, they have more than a thousand times as many engineers and they haven’t launched a groundbreaking product in a while. The same goes for Google. And Slack. It’s not just famous big brands. Just about every organization hits a point where the pace of innovation slows as scale increases. This happens for a number of reasons, and there are two ways to deal with them. Technical debt is the result of shortcuts taken to get things to work right now. As a result of these shortcuts, the software (or hardware) isn’t easily expandable for future needs.  Handshake overhead is the result of the simple law of more people. n*(n – 1)/2. Two people need one handshake to be introduced. On the other hand, 9 people need 36 handshakes. More people involve more meetings, more approvals, more coordination. Customer commitments are an asset but also a brake on innovation. The customers you already have didn’t necessarily sign up for you to change things. Partner preferences are similar to customer commitments. The partners you work with have their own objectives and pace, the easiest common denominator is ‘slower.’ Wall Street’s fear is common, but fading a bit. This is the instinct that many institutional investors have to avoid the unknown. “The stock is going up, don’t blow it.” Managerial anxiety is what happens when an operating bureaucracy comes to replace daring leadership. People get promoted because they’re good at their jobs, and innovation isn’t an opportunity, it’s a threat. So, what to do? Ignoring everything above isn’t going to work. Tasking your people to burn all candles at both ends and to change their approach, while also violating the laws of institutional physics is simply not going to work. You’ll hit the wall. Every time. There are two useful options: Boring as a strategy is the approach that Apple and a large number of famous brands have taken. As you cross the chasm, the bulk of your new customers don’t want innovation at all. They want promises kept, a lack of surprises and reasonable prices and efficiency. Shipping your improvements on a regular schedule and bringing predictability to your offering allows you to reach more people and make a bigger impact. Small innovations allow an organization to avoid falling too far behind innovative competitors, and it can take decades before the gap is big enough to matter. And then you become Yahoo. Or Chrysler. Or Carvel. Structural bankruptcy is a daring alternative. Create a skunkworks. Refactor your code from scratch. Spin off the cash cow and assemble a team to start something new from scratch. The new things probably won’t work at first, but if you do enough of them, your experience and persistence will pay off. I’ve faced these choices many times in my career, and neither choice is easy or obvious, but the choice itself shouldn’t be ignored. If you simply hope for the best of both worlds, you’re likely to be frustrated at the same time you disappoint the people you work with and serve. "
735,Paying extra,"June 7, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/paying-extra/,"For six years, if you wanted an electric car, you’d need to pay extra. It cost more than the regular kind. Of course, if you decided to buy one, you weren’t paying extra. You were buying sustainability, community awareness, cachet, status, safety, quiet and the feeling of being an early adopter. People never pay extra. They buy something they want at a price that feels fair to them. In the next few years, electric cars are actually going to be cheaper than their more-polluting brethren. And that means that anyone who wants to charge a premium is going to have to offer quality, service, design and a feeling that it’s worth whatever is being charged. It’s very difficult to make a living selling something that doesn’t, by some apparent measure, cost extra. The hard work is in keeping the promise that your extra isn’t extra at all. "
736,What are things like around here?,"June 6, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/relentlessly-dumber/,"Industries are often held together by unspoken hierarchies, signposts on the road to achievement. In the fancy parts of the book business, it’s not profit. Editors are often unaware of which books are truly profitable. They keep track of cultural impact, literary respect, the idea of a book being ‘well published’ and the hard-to-measure currency of ‘important’. The Kindle and the long tail changed that, with new entrants keeping track of something else. The “A” list movies, on the other hand, have an entire circle of status that’s organized around Academy Awards, famous directors and a pecking order that would be invisible to many of us. Netflix and Youtube changed that as well, with new entrants keeping track of shorter cycles and different metrics. In Silicon Valley, which has been an engine of our future for thirty years, technical prowess and elegance were the key drivers. Now, the focus has shifted to simplicity, memes and momentary cultural currency in search of big numbers. The new signposts are about cultural ubiquity, IPOs, quick flips and harvesting data. Apps instead of programs, user interfaces that need no instructions and don’t really reward a lot of effort, and output that’s driven by both. Like a roach motel, the goal is to make it seductive and hard to escape.  The hierarchies of status drive decisions far more than we realize. We often architect the systems that create our culture without paying attention to why. "
737,Skepticism and Denial,"June 5, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/skepticism-and-denial/,"Skepticism is a virtue. It requires a willingness to question conventional wisdom, and the guts to accept something after you discover that it’s actually true. Denialism, on the other hand, is a willful rejection of reality. It’s safe and easy, and unproductive. Because there’s no room to change your mind. To be a generous skeptic, we need to state in advance specifically what it would take for us to engage with the proposed insight, and then do so after our standards are met. This is hard work. It’s not easy to change one’s mind. Difficult but worth it. Big shifts in perception are rare and it’s not something we look forward to. Skeptics are a key to the scientific method, organizational design and even investing. We sign up to doubt and question and push, and then we become productive contributors by embracing the new tools and results. Often, people in denial pretend to be skeptics. It feels more powerful than acknowledging that we’re simply avoiding change. "
738,Interested vs. interesting,"June 4, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/interested-vs-interesting/,"Of course you’re interesting. There’s something about what you’ve done, what you say, how you show up in the world that’s worthy of interest. But that doesn’t mean that people are interested. We each have a noise in our heads, an agenda and something urgent that’s grabbing our attention. And so, the amount of interest you receive (or don’t receive) has little to do with how interesting you are and a lot to do with how the people you seek to serve have organized their priorities long before you got there. "
739,The next train,"June 3, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/the-next-train/,"It’s not a luxury, it’s a choice. We can build slack into our lives. We can create cycles so that we don’t need to dance with a crisis around time on a regular basis.  If there’s another train after this one, you don’t have to fret. If the deadline for the project is tomorrow, not today, you don’t have to sweat it. If the guests aren’t arriving for an hour… Sometimes, we choose to use the urgent crisis as fuel. We set up our lives around creating these deadlines, reminding ourselves that if we cross that line, we’re dead. And then we allow the world to do it to us. To create urgencies simply to take our attention and focus. Productivity is a measure of the value of what we ship in the time we’ve got to invest. It’s not measured in drama. It’s possible to do great work without putting everything in jeopardy. "
740,Failing in the trough,"June 2, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/failing-in-the-trough/,"There’s a time gap. Marketers raise expectations in order to get someone to sign up and try a product and service. And (hopefully) there’s satisfaction, delight and remarkability once the organization actually delivers on what you promised. In between, the trough. You spend $400 per customer on rent and architecture and web design. Perhaps it’s $200 per new customer on podcast ads or salespeople. All of these expenses happen long before you deliver. And then, you confront the new customer with a surly receptionist, a website that is hard to understand, a wait for a table, a mismatch in the professional you assign, slow customer service, packaging that is difficult to open, fine print that suddenly becomes obnoxious and expectations that aren’t met. In this trough, we have a few options: The first, the most common, is to try to ignore it. Let em seethe. Bet on time and momentum and sunk costs to get them over the hump. The second, a variation of this, is to spend as little as you can to address the problem of the trough. Acknowledge the problem, sure, but throw boilerplate and your lowest cost (least trained, least respected) people at the problem. The third, the intelligent, difficult choice, is to invest in onboarding. At $50 an hour, a well-trained, passionate and committed person might be able to onboard four customers an hour. That’s $12.50 to protect the $300 to $800 (or more) it cost you to earn that customer’s trial in the first place. This person isn’t a replacement for what you sell or deliver. This person is the bridge over the trough. They’re the patient voice at the end of the phone (who picks up on one ring) to help with a recalcitrant bit of software. Or the person who sends a handwritten note telling the guest what to expect when they get to your hotel. Or the human who simply calls to say ‘hi’ as soon as the trough begins. Not reading a script, but working as hard to make a connection and a difference as your ads and your location do. The key rhetorical question, usually unasked and unanswered: Is it an expense or an investment? Notes: Promotion is the time and expense of encouraging non-customers to raise their expectations. The trough kicks in when reality intrudes, when we’re trying to understand what’s actually involved, when sunk costs become clear and when buyer’s remorse begins. It’s the form, the warmup act and that feeling of being alone at a cocktail party filled with people who know each other. Many of your potential lifelong, supportive and profitable customers never materialize on the other side of the trough, because they left before you had a chance to delight them. Actual marketing success happens after the trough, when people become loyal, when the product or service is remarkable and when the word spreads. "
741,In search of hypocrites,"June 1, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/06/in-search-of-hypocrites/,"Why would we want to wait until someone is perfect before we give them a chance to make things better? Each of us is part of a system, cogs in a process that rewards us for certain actions based on various inputs. When the system is broken, some of the most highly leveraged, aware and insightful people notice. And of course, since they’re part of the system, they’ve been affected by it. These are ideal qualifications to speak up and make the system better. One way the status quo stays in charge is by encouraging people to stand by in silence, fearful of being called out for hypocrisy. "
742,The delay,"May 31, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/the-delay/,"Sometimes we’re not that good with time. If people got a hacking cough and a chronic disease an hour after smoking their first cigarette, it’s unlikely many people would smoke. If earthquakes happened a day after fracking for gas was tried, they would probably have stopped. And if entrepreneurs discovered freedom, satisfaction and customer delight a week after starting their projects, more people would probably give it a go. Most of us are able to respond to a feedback loop in the short run. The real opportunity and challenge is to get much better at recognizing the long loops. "
743,Personal responsibility,"May 30, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/personal-responsibility/,"It’s complicated. Because we made it complicated. Our culture is built on the principle that people are responsible for what they do. And then we spend time and effort diffusing the responsibility. If you work for a company and are just doing your job, are you responsible? What if you founded the company? What if you invest in it? Are marketers responsible for the negative side effects of increased consumption? If companies work, if marketing works, if work works, then who is responsible if it causes something to happen? If we dump something in the river, are we responsible for what happens to people downstream? What if you buy something from someone who dumps something in the river? Are we responsible for the actions of the causes we support and the people we vote for? What about the implications of not supporting something? Are we responsible for the bad things that happen because of our apathy? The world is smaller than we think. "
744,Expressing something,"May 29, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/expressing-something/,"In an episode of a podcast I really respect, three of the experts quoted used words that I was familiar with: Debunk, gaslighting and cult. These are powerful words, words with specific and evocative meanings. In all three cases, the people speaking used them ‘wrong.’ Being on a podcast might be nerve-wracking, and in an effort to overcome anxiety, sound smart and level up, each person ended up doing the opposite. But that’s how language works. We’re trying to say what we mean, and sometimes, it’s not what other people think we meant. The emotions behind the words are real, even if the words are a mismatch. When it happens often enough, the words develop a new meaning. Words are a moving target, an expression of feelings, and they inevitably shift. There’s no absolute measure of wrong. Simply what we thought vs what they meant. "
745,Craft and imperfection,"May 28, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/craft-and-imperfection/,"As soon as we mechanize, measure and perfect something, it becomes far less interesting. There’s not a lot of discussion about which factory made your can of Coke, because they’re all the same. Implicit in the desire to have something handmade is that while it might be better than what you’re used to, it might be worse. As we get better at industrialism, the variability of imperfection becomes even more fascinating. Imperfect and proud of it. "
746,How change happens,"May 27, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/how-change-happens/,"Slowly then all at once For people who aren’t paying attention or actively involved, it can seem like cultural change is sudden. One big shift after another. In fact, cultural change always happens relatively slowly. Person by person, conversation by conversation. Expectations are established, roles are defined, systems are built. From the foundation The people in the news and at the podium get all the attention, but they’re a symptom, not usually a cause. Everyday people aren’t the bottom, they are the roots, the foundation, the source of culture itself. We are the culture, and we change it or are changed by it. From peer to peer Change happens horizontally. What do we expect from others? What do we talk about? Who do we emulate or follow or support? What becomes the regular kind? People like us do things like this. Day by day, week by week, year by year. Going to the protest of the day, performing acts of slacktivism, hopping from urgency to emergency–this is how people who day trade in our culture are whipsawed. But the people who are consistently and actively changing the culture are not easily distracted. One more small action, one more conversation, one more standard established. The internet would like us to focus on what happened five minutes ago. The culture understands that what happens in five years is what matters. Focused, persistent community action is how systems change. And systems concretize and enforce cultural norms. If you care, keep talking. Keep acting. Stay focused. And don’t get bored. "
747,Switching your search engine,"May 26, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/switching-your-search-engine/,"Make the choice to upgrade from Google. There are many good reasons to do so, and few downsides. Do it for your efficiency, for the health of the web and for the planet too. First, a quick clarification because this is confusing to many people: The thing you use to browse the internet is not a search engine. Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Safari–these are web browsers. A browser is software that allows you to look at any web page–and these companies often make money by selling your attention to the search engine that bids the most. Apple takes billions of dollars a year from Google in exchange for steering you to their search engine. And the reason that Google bids so much is that they make an insane amount of money. Billions of dollars a year from serving up ads and harvesting your data from your searches. That money needs to come from somewhere. You can switch your search engine in just a few clicks. See a short video and find the links right here. Here’s what will happen when you switch to Ecosia: If you don’t like the results, you can switch back in two minutes.  Faster, free, and more convenient. If you switch and then you forward this to five more people who switch, we’re likely to plant another 100,000,000 trees in the next year. That’s a lot. If you switch and spread the word, search results will get better and Google will start to do a better job knowing that they don’t have quite the same scale of monopoly. If you switch, we all come out ahead. Share a question or experience here and I’ll share in a future post. PS I wasn’t asked to post this or compensated to do so. I switched 9 months ago and I’m glad I did. [Thanks for making this my most popular post of the year. Please share. And here are some of the comments and questions I got.] "
748,Classical music and documentaries,"May 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/classical-music-and-documentaries/,"Check the ratings, whichever magazine or website you choose: Classical music and documentary films almost always get more stars and higher ratings than pop music and feature films. The reason is simple: The folks who like stuff like that like stuff like that. The smallest viable audience for certain genres is very clear. That allows the creators of the work to be specific and to deliver on expectations. The broader you seek to make your offering, the more likely you are to run into people who don’t care, don’t get the joke or are simply not open to being satisfied. It’s not easy to record a symphony or edit Restrepo. But your work is more likely to pay off in audience satisfaction. "
749,Looking at taxes,"May 24, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/clarity-about-taxes/,"Ever since there have been taxes, people have been against paying them. If we define a tax as a “non-productive burden on our activities,” then it makes sense. And a payment doesn’t have to be to the government to be a tax. Is paying your electric bill a tax? Most people don’t mind paying for electricity, because it makes their lives safer and happier, and helps them do their job with dramatically more productivity. So the payment isn’t what makes something a tax, it’s the non-productive part. When industrial systems arrive, they’re usually embraced because the transactions they offer are so productive. When Walmart comes to a town, everyone gets a short-term raise, because the cost of buying the things we want and need goes down. When a new technology or system offers to save people time and money in the short run, it’s often embraced because it’s a free choice and productive. But then the rules start to change. Monopolies are a tax. They limit choice and raise prices. As a result, we pay “taxes” on a regular basis for things like broadband and spare parts because there are no options. Loss of vibrant markets is a tax. When local businesses are upended, then jobs are lost, choices are diminished and the essence of a community fades away. Lobbying is a tax. As large industrial entities invest money to capture government control, each of us pay for this even though it only benefits the lobbyists. Subsidies and duties are a tax. Last year, Americans spent 50 billion dollars subsidizing the beef industry.  Constraints on trade aren’t called taxes, but they are. Traffic is a tax. The time we spend waiting for a train or sitting in traffic is time we don’t get back, and unmade investments in mass transit infrastructure cost us far more than the ones we do make. Lack of public health systems is a tax. The inability to find clean water, or the prospect of often getting ill is a real cost. And climate change is a looming and sneaky tax. The money and loss of productivity that it already costs us, and the extraordinary amounts it will cost us are unproductive burdens on meeting our goals and living our lives. There are no government taxes on an abandoned desert island. But it’s almost impossible to imagine living or working there. "
750,Sharp language,"May 23, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/sharp-language/,"The internet has provided all of us with an advanced class on using innuendo, piercing invective and anger to make a point with our writing. Now, instead of simply seething or ranting, just about anyone can write an email or a social media post that absolutely destroys someone else. To what end? If the goal is to persuade, it’s clearly not working. If we want to let someone know we’re upset, it might be easier to just say so. The purpose of speech is to alert others to our point of view, and the purpose of conversation is to connect and to persuade. It’s not clear that making language angrier or more cutting is helping much. "
751,The smallest viable audience,"May 22, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/the-smallest-viable-audience/,"It’s a stepping-stone, not a compromise. The media and our culture push us to build something for everyone, to sand off the edges and to invest in infrastructure toward scale. But it turns out that quality, magic and satisfaction can lie in the other direction. Not because we can’t get bigger, but because we’d rather be better. One of the three best restaurants in New York only has 14 seats. With the right fan base and technology, that’s enough to allow the chef to build an experience he can be proud of. Down the street is an extraordinary cafe that pays a tiny fraction of the rent that a midtown neighborhood would require. It’s not about getting found by everyone. A focus on experience creates something that (some) people want to look for. Eliot Peper writes books that his fans can’t get enough of. And the long tail of online bookselling lets him do that without having to get a movie deal or a fancy publisher to thrive. Junior is able to run a successful appliance repair business without a fancy truck or office, simply by earning a reputation in a very specific lane on a very specific website. A focus on the SVA can also enable a business to scale. PSAudio doesn’t reach many people… but the team’s focus is precise enough and deep enough that they’ve built one of the largest and most successful operations in their industry. Or chocolates or software or baked goods or … The strategy of the smallest viable audience doesn’t let you off the hook–it does the opposite. You don’t get to say, “well, we’ll just wait for the next random person to find us.” Instead, you have to choose your customers–who’s it for and what’s it for. And when you’ve identified them, the opportunity/requirement is to create so much delight and connection that they choose to spread the word to like-minded peers. Not everyone, but someone. And it turns out that ‘someone’ isn’t as easy as it sounds. When you strip away the alternative mantra of “you can pick anyone, and we’re anyone,” then you have to lean into the obligation of being the sort of provider that people would miss if you were gone. That’s not easy, but people with this sort of focus wouldn’t have it any other way. Specificity is the way. It has nothing to do with absolute scale and everything to do with being really clear about what hook you want to be on and setting a standard for producing work that people connect to and are changed by. What could be better? "
752,The department of bad behavior,"May 21, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/the-department-of-bad-behavior/,"What if organizations had a division that simply did the bad stuff? The people who were responsible for creating system updates that slow down old computers, that cover up bad behavior by employees, the people who dump pollution into the river when no one is watching… If all the folks who invent dark patterns, lobby in secret, and gaslight whistleblowers all worked in the same department, we could watch them a lot more carefully. After all, the lawyers have a department, and so do the customer service people. Couldn’t we have a VP of dirty tricks? Alas, mixed incentives and short-term thinking mean that it’s unlikely we’ll ever be able to narrow it down to just a few people… "
753,Switch before perfect,"May 20, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/switch-before-perfect/,"In 1993, when I was raising investment for one of the first internet companies, there weren’t any firms that specialized in this sort of thing. They were VCs from a different era, looking for the next Fedex or pharma company. I pitched dozens of them, and the answer was consistent, “get back to us when this is irresistible and then of course we’ll say yes.” The same thinking is applied to many new products, from vegan burgers to online services. None of them are perfect at first, just as none of the things we’re reliant on today began as perfect. And yet, some folks went first. Some, like Jerry and Fred, started a VC fund that had record returns because they invested in internet companies that weren’t perfect (yet). And some consumers bought things from the local store when version .5 wasn’t quite ready yet. If you want to leap forward, you’ll need to ship things before they’re perfect, mostly to people who want to buy them before they are. "
754,False metrics appearing real,"May 19, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/false-metrics-appearing-real/,"Just because they’re easy to measure doesn’t mean they matter. If they appear in round numbers and are easily compared to those from others, we’re tempted to compare. But something that looks like a useful metric might not be. If you’re working with people who say they care about measurement, it might not pay to persuade them to stop measuring. It might make more sense to give them useful numbers to measure instead.  "
755,Possibility is fragile,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/possibility-is-fragile/,"And that’s the paradox, because the closer possibility gets to reality, the more it engages with the unforgiving edges of the real world. As we begin to imagine something better, it’s important to have some insulation, room to believe and a chance to fill in the missing pieces. But then we have to allow the constraints of reality to intersect with our beautiful new conception. And when that happens, it’s easy for all of our imaginings to simply evaporate. But fragile doesn’t mean impossible. Possibility looms around every corner if we’re willing to bring resilience and iteration to the dance as well. Yes, it might not work. But deciding that in advance undermines the value of the gift we intended to bring people. "
756,The grandstanders,"May 18, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/the-grandstanders/,"This is a common sort of feedback/criticism/brainstorming, and it deserves a name. Show up toward the end, when most of the work has been done and it’s almost time to ship… Make a suggestion that would require changing a great deal of what’s been done. It might even be a good suggestion on its face, but it’s hard to tell… Contribute your suggestion without having built a body of work, without evidence of significant expertise and without being willing to take responsibility for what happens next. It’s a form of yelling from the bleachers. The fact that your idea is fresh or innovative doesn’t change the role of Resistance. This sort of suggestion is a great place to hide. You’re helping, aren’t you? And if they ignore you, well, that’s on them. The grandstander wants to be part of things, but isn’t showing up to do the hard part. This might be the guest who shows up half an hour before dinner and suggests you change the menu. Or the publicist that wants to weigh in on the product’s design a week before launch. Or the good friend who wonders out loud if you should marry him, right after your four-year relationship turns into an engagement. The alternative is to get out of the bleachers and into the field. Do the training. Show your work. Engage early. Own the outcomes. We need that more than ever. "
757,Please share the extra with a friend,"May 17, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/please-share-the-extra-with-a-friend/,"Krispy Kreme grew to become a doughnut behemoth in the US. The formula was simple: Scarce supply, high short-term taste satisfaction, and a dozen priced almost the same as just four. As a result, most people bought a dozen. But few could eat a dozen, and you can’t really save them, so you realized that sharing a warm doughnut was the way to go. Carmine’s restaurant in New York was the hot ticket for decades. One reason was that the only way to get a reservation was to come with five other people. So you needed to talk about it. I’ve learned in sharing galleys of The Carbon Almanac that sending two is far more useful and beneficial than sending one. Because when someone gets two, they immediately decide to share the other one. Organizing around ‘please share’ is a choice. We’re building a Wall of Fame on our website to celebrate companies that care enough about our future to share copies of the Almanac when it comes out. Small companies can easily find a good use for five or ten copies, and we’ve made it easy and cost-effective to pre-order. The form is to sign up is here. All participants get a link back to their site and a chance to make an impact in the world. Please share with someone who trusts you. ALSO! We’re inviting you to join our worldwide group of volunteers as we prepare to launch the Almanac in June. Our launch team is forming now, and it’s a chance to be part of something and make a difference. Please check out this page for the details. Thank you. "
758,Newbies welcome,"May 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/newbies-welcome/,"The paradox of most tightly-knit communities is that they have an internal culture. And that culture often makes it difficult for a new person to join. It’s hard to have insiders if you don’t have outsiders. This is true for guilds of copy editors, fans of anime or branches of science. The key transition point for any cause or tribe or movement that seeks to grow is to shift from an insular desire to keep things as they are to a willingness–or better, a desire–to water things down by getting bigger. It’s hard to have it both ways. "
759,Everyone else is,"May 15, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/everyone-else-is/,"Well, not everyone. Just most people. When you do something that everyone else is doing, you’re likely to get what everyone else is getting. But in almost every population, “everyone” leaves out the people who go first, who change things, who are weird and who challenge the status quo. That’s an option, even when it doesn’t seem that way. Mass culture gets us more mass culture. It’s not the only choice. "
760,"Data, information and decisions","May 14, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/data-information-and-decisions/,"Data is everywhere, but turning it into information isn’t free. It takes focus, effort, consultation and time. More information is only useful if it helps you make a decision. Knowing the temperature on Saturn isn’t useful. Knowing it to even more accuracy is less useful. That’s because we’re not making any decisions that involve the temperature on another planet. We’re surrounded by data that our spreadsheets or networks or cohorts seem to want us to be aware of. How many people clicked yesterday, or what someone wrote in a comment, what a backlist book sold or the foot traffic in that store vs. this store. But if you’re not going to use the data to make a decision, don’t spend the time to expose yourself to it. It’s resistance at work.  If you can’t do anything with the data, it’s never going to be information. "
761,Five beats,"May 13, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/five-beats/,"When we’re close to an answer, there are two easy paths–name it, right now, and move on. Or avoid the answer and the responsibility that comes with it and stall. The best path is the third one. Wait for five beats. Kneejerk is not an admirable trait. A few breaths before we rip into someone. A few questions before we issue a diagnosis. A chance to do a bit more research or consultation. And then, yes, we have to name it. No stalling. Five beats of tension open the door for connection, accuracy and insight. And then we ship. "
762,The post-industrial collision,"May 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/the-post-industrial-collision/,"Many knowledge-economy employees say that the main cause of dissatisfaction at work is lack of agency. Lack of control over our time and our decisions and our output is demeaning. It turns people into cogs. As the nature of work changes, innovation and small groups are adding far more value than the race to the bottom of industrial control can. So people are getting what they asked for. Autonomy. Responsibility instead of authority. The chance to speak up and be heard. Most of all, the opportunity to be on the hook. Not surprisingly, some people, particularly if they’ve been indoctrinated into the industrial mindset, don’t like this. They can’t ask, “just tell me what to do.” The search for an A, the hope to be picked by someone in charge, the desire for perfect–it’s gone. So is the deniability that comes with following instructions. Be careful what you hope for. "
763,“…somebody else will.”,"May 11, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/somebody-else-will/,"This is a great excuse for racing to the bottom.  Corporations with power go ahead and take advantage of customers. “Well, if we don’t do it, a competitor will.” The public markets don’t require companies to throw out their principles to succeed. In fact, they reward companies that do the opposite. People exploit vulnerabilities in systems, or cut a little close to one edge or another. Because, after all, it’s a competitive world, and if they don’t, someone else will. Not really. Human culture has a long history of standards being set by people who refuse this line of reasoning. And as a result of these standards, somebody else doesn’t. "
764,But where are the secret recipes?,"May 10, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/but-where-are-the-secret-recipes/,"Over the years, I’ve been sharing recipes as pages here on the blog, but never posting about them… you only got the link if I sent it to you. Well, your wait is over. For those seeking non-obvious but delicious and light-on-their-feet recipes, here you go: "
765,The ones who didn’t help,"May 9, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/the-ones-who-didnt-help/,"If 2% of a population takes coordinated action, it makes a difference. If 5% do, it can change everything. This simple math also means that most people rarely do anything. Perhaps they don’t care. Perhaps they’re afraid to speak up and commit. And perhaps it’s simply easier to go along for a free ride. Of course it hurts when friends and colleagues we thought we could count on shirk and hide. But everyone has their own narrative, their own issues, their own fears. We can say, “if I were you,” but we’re not them, they are. When we focus on the ones who didn’t help, we’re undermining our work. It’s a distraction and a disservice.  Shun the non-believers. Ignore the well-meaning but unmoved. Instead, we have the chance to find and connect and celebrate the people who care enough to make a difference. Toward better. "
766,Resilient markets,"May 8, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/resilient-markets/,"The “free market” is a bit of a myth. Other than some board games, it doesn’t exist in real life. We eagerly regulate things like dangerous goods, fraud, insider trading, the warranty of merchantability, trademarks, dumping poison in the water supply, selling heroin to kids, etc. All of these boundaries are designed to create more resilient markets. Markets that serve newcomers as well as insiders. Markets that eventually serve the culture. We’re not very good at it, but trying is the only way forward. The right question isn’t, “how do we remove regulations?” It might be, “how do we make this more resilient over time?” "
767,Defining the enemy,"May 7, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/defining-the-enemy/,"Some situations seem to call for an opponent. It might be our personality, the structure of the engagement or the way we’ve been taught to behave, but having an enemy seems to focus individuals and groups. For fifty years, America decided that the USSR was the enemy, and spent a great deal of time and money and attention maintaining that threat. For many people, the boss is the enemy, the controlling managerial authority, the opponent to be bested in a fight over work, effort and passion. Or it might simply be the hockey team we’re skating against tonight. Pick your enemies, pick your future. "
768,Half baked,"May 6, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/half-baked/,"If you care about a creative practice, my guess is that you’ve already seen Peter Jackson’s new Beatles movie. If not, go check it out. It’s a miracle that the movie exists at all. I mean, four of the most famous creative humans who ever lived, tenuously holding on to a fracturing association, agree to write and record an album in three weeks and record every single interaction on film. The intimacy of this setting lets us see each of the Beatles as they had decided to become. Ringo is in the background, happy to be there, supporting the process and causing no trouble. George is wrestling with his place in the world and his ego. You’ll notice that he rarely plays a song unless he’s sure it’s almost done, and even then, apologizes before sharing it. John is the fifth hammer. In the first sessions, his creative method is not really on display in the group setting–his song arrives already recorded, on vinyl. This is a post about Paul. Paul’s not a genius, neither is John. This isn’t about talent, it’s about skill. And the genius that was the Beatles happens between Paul and John, not inside of either of them. Paul wants the group to be excited. He wants George to be happier. Most of all, he wants John to like his songs. That’s his fuel. And Paul’s practice is simple: Bring the work forward. Play a song before it’s ready. Because in the moment before it’s ready, that’s when it’s ready. By bringing music that’s half-baked to the table, he takes a risk. It means that George might become critical or mopey. It means that John might not be engaged. It means that the room might not feel it. But the risk is worth it. Because the half-baked work, shared in a trusting environment, is the fuel for the system that created the works of genius.  Paul needed the movie and the live event in the future to create tension, tension that he knew would be pushing against the group’s need for approval and not-blowing-it. By putting themselves in a corner, he created (at no small cost) the conditions where he could do the work. And it begins, as it usually does, by having the guts to share something that’s half baked. [My Akimbo podcast on this topic is here.] "
769,Going for baroque,"May 5, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/going-for-baroque/,"The essence of baroque art and craft is its complexity. Difficult to create, overloaded with ornamentation, filled with grandeur and color and surprise, the focus is on the effort expended. And that dramatic display of effort has a place. It communicates a sort of emotional labor, and creates an imbalance of status. You don’t expect a scoop of rice and some dal at a very fancy restaurant, no matter how delicious it is. You paid for the effort, not just the sustenance. Baroque is often at odds with utility. I don’t want a hammer with a baroque design, I want one that does precisely what I need it to when it comes to driving a nail. On the other hand, much of what we buy and use isn’t about utility at all… it’s an expression of the story we tell ourselves about value, status and our place in the world. If you’re going to offer something baroque, the key is to go all out. Halfway is worth very little. "
770,Full out,"May 4, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/full-out/,"It’s thrilling. Nothing held in reserve. All in, leaving nothing behind. It’s easy to get hooked on this. And it’s easy to never experience it. The internet has made each path more attractive.  It can put us into always-on mode, in a worldwide competition against infinite competitors and inputs in which the goal always seems within reach and also never arrives. But it can also lull us into a stupor of clicks, likes, home deliveries and spectatorship. Neither is ultimately productive or healthy.  The opportunity is in finding places that are finite enough for your full-court press to matter, and then, after you’ve shipped the work, to walk away. Not in defeat, but with the satisfaction that you produced something of value. We didn’t evolve for a life of all-in or one of hibernation. It’s the transitions and the variations that contribute to our health, well-being and ability to contribute. "
771,Preaching to the choir,"May 3, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/preaching-to-the-choir/,"The original expression implies that preaching to the converted is a waste of time. After all, why bother marketing to people who are already on the team? The reality is that the people who aren’t enrolled in the journey are going to ignore you. They’re simply not open to being marketed to, taught, talked at or lectured. On the other hand, the folks who are in on it have a chance to become members of the choir. And they are the ones that spread the word. It’s peer-to-peer interaction that shapes our culture, and culture that shapes our world. The opportunity for anyone seeking to make a change happen is to enlist people who are on a similar path and give them the tools and the motivation to engage with the people around them. If your work is worth doing, it’s worth preaching to the choir. "
772,Sunk costs at work,"May 2, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/sunk-costs-at-work/,"For skilled information workers, job mobility has never been easier or more profitable. And yet, countless people stay where they are, without ever considering why. For example, there are hundreds of senior leaders and contributors at Twitter who haven’t quit their jobs in the last week. Even though they have a financial cushion, a technical reputation and are facing the prospect of working for a new boss who has little respect for what they’ve worked on for years. Sunk costs are powerful. Some people stay where they are because they value unearned options in ways that undervalue their upside potential at a different gig. Some people stay where they are because they’ve worked hard to get where they are and don’t want to risk it. And some people stay because thinking about alternative options feels risky, and feelings of risk are tempting to avoid. But with work-from-home, transferable networks and valuable tech skills, there are now millions of people who might benefit from thinking hard about what they hope to contribute in the future. You don’t get tomorrow over again. The chance to build something you’re proud of with a team you are eager to work with is a privilege, and ignoring it would be a shame. Quitting is underrated. "
773,Read to your kids/read to your parents,"May 1, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/05/read-to-your-kids-read-to-your-parents/,"Launching today, a free ebook: Generation Carbon: A Carbon Almanac for Kids. A worldwide team of volunteers wrote, designed and illustrated this free PDF. The hope is that you’ll grab a copy and share it with ten people. That you’ll read it to your parents or to your kids. There are all sorts of bonuses and certificates, podcasts and experiments using chocolate.  I’m gobsmacked by how powerful and beautiful their work is. I hope you’ll share it. PS our free daily email newsletter goes live tomorrow.  "
774,Making our decisions,"April 30, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/make-your-decisions/,"For trivial matters, it’s efficient and perhaps useful to simply follow a crowd or whatever leader we’ve chosen. But when it matters, we need to make (and own) our own decisions. To do that effectively, consider: None of these steps are easy. This could be why we so often outsource them to someone else. "
775,“The market has spoken”,"April 29, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/the-market-has-spoken/,"Why would someone buy a share of stock for $945? One reason might be that they think they can sell it tomorrow for $950. A more common reason is that someone bought it an hour ago for $940. Of course, this applies to more than equities. Why buy a Birkin bag for more than $25,000? Because someone else did. The only thing worse than losing an auction by a few dollars is winning one by a lot. All of this makes sense until it doesn’t. The “market” is very smart about any given moment in time, but not always particularly smart about the future. "
776,Our areas of expertise,"April 28, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/our-areas-of-expertise/,"Most of all, we’re experts in our own narrative, our feelings, our lived experience. No one has had that but us, and while it might be unexamined or instinctive, we’re the experts. Experts in who we associate with and what we choose to believe. And many of us are experts in what we do all day. Our craft and our profession. We’ve been doing it for a long time. Suddenly, as a spiral of media, world events and science all come together, we’re confronted with a range of things we might not be experts in. Statistics, long-term thinking, epidemiology, semiotics, constitutional law, technology, the scientific method, history and environmental science. One option is to get smart about each of these things, just as we’ve learned other important skills in the past. That requires the energy to pay attention and the humility to encounter new ideas and realize that we’re not an expert yet. Another is to simply pretend we’re experts, conflating our (well-earned) feelings with actual expertise. And the third is to simply shrug and ignore it all. It’s never been easier to learn what we need to learn. And it’s never been more urgent that we do so. "
777,Two kinds of useful help,"April 27, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/two-kinds-of-useful-help/,"The first kind, the common kind, is when someone helps you with advice or labor to accomplish what you’ve already set out to do. The second kind, more rare and more useful, is when someone helps you realize that your original plan wasn’t as good as you thought it was, and helps you come up with a better one. Which kind are you looking for? "
778,Yelling “fire”,"April 26, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/yelling-fire/,"With the possible exception of hockey games, there have been few places in our modern lives where public interactions are supposed to be coarse. If (back when we could, and soon when we can again) you go to the theater, a museum, the mall, a restaurant, the library, school, the supermarket, the park, or yes, even to a movie theater, the management does not tolerate or encourage acting like a jerk. And then social media arrived. Social media is a place where the business model depends on some percentage of the crowd acting in unpleasant ways. It draws a crowd. And crowds generate profit. We’ve created a new default, a default where it’s somehow defensible to be a selfish, short-sighted, anonymous troll. At scale. Civility has always been enforced by culture, and for the last hundred years, amplified by commerce. We shouldn’t accept anything less than kindness, even if the stock price is at stake. DMS has a great point about the algorithm. Once you start prioritizing some voices, you become responsible for the tone and noise and disconnection (or possibility, connection and peace of mind) you’ve caused. "
779,The answer imperative,"April 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/the-answer-imperative/,"“C’mon, c’mon, c’mon…” We’re standing on one foot, impatiently waiting for the shortcut, the method, the guarantee. Skip the preamble and the analysis–what’s your take? Don’t talk to me about genre and method and history. No time for that. What are we supposed to do right now? Perhaps the reason we’re struggling is that along the way, we forgot to focus on the questions instead. More answers are only going to insulate us from the questions we actually need to be focusing on. "
780,The win-win fallacy,"April 24, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/the-win-win-fallacy/,"There are some problems where a useful solution is a win for everyone. But not many. Certainly not the problems that have been around for a while. If there were a win win solution, someone would have probably found it already. For significant problems, someone is going to lose in the short run. Leadership is not the act of making everyone happy. It’s the ability to show up and help us get to a place where, on balance, more of us are glad to be. If you can’t find a win-win, it might be time to find a win-lose where the most people with something at stake end up benefitting. Often, that means that entrenched interests and those that have traditionally come first don’t do as well in the short run. "
781,“Because it’s more convenient”,"April 23, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/because-its-more-convenient/,"This is a terrible reason to do something that makes things a little worse for other people. And a common one, of course. Much of the time, we’re willing to go out of our way to do work we’re proud of. Unless it would be inconvenient to do so. One of the reasons our best work is important is that it’s also inconvenient. Alas, convenience beats just about everything. [But then, as some people who actually care do inconvenient things, those things become normal, which, amazingly, makes them more convenient for everyone else.] "
782,The traffic metaphors,"April 22, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/the-traffic-metaphors/,"Your mileage may vary. Speeding up to get to a red light faster just wastes energy. Honking doesn’t make traffic go away.  Doesn’t matter how fancy your car is, it’s not worth very much if they close the road. One of the worst ways to get to where you’re going is to always drive in the fastest moving lane and avoid any toll roads. The flow of traffic isn’t always going where you want to go. Following another car will eventually get you lost. If you don’t stop to refuel, you’re going to get stranded. Giving someone a chance, or the right of way, and letting them into traffic doesn’t really slow you down that much. In our culture, we give way too many resources to cars and their efficiency and not enough to pedestrians and the opportunities that they deserve. The map is not the territory, but a map is a good thing to have. Acceleration is overrated. Persistence, good directions and a reliable vehicle almost always beat horsepower. "
783,Words that matter,"April 21, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/words-that-matter-2/,"Any word that’s really important is also confusing. Words like trust, love, friend, fair, honest, lead, connect, authentic, justice, dignity–they have dozens of different meanings. Perhaps that’s because they’re important. It’s worth spending a moment to understand what we mean when we say something that might mean something else. "
784,Defender of the brand,"April 20, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/defender-of-the-brand/,"Some CMOs and marketing types simply do ads and promo. Give them average products for average people and some money, and they’ll do the ad thing. And some are actually marketers. Marketing involves making a promise and keeping it. Marketers understand that your logo isn’t a brand, it’s simply a flag. The brand is the experience that people expect to have when they engage with you. It’s your benefit of the doubt. If you’re that kind of marketer, you quickly come to learn that the single most important part of your job is being sure that you make great products and services. Because sooner or later, the experience is the brand. Sooner or later, the story you tell needs to be true. Which means… That your main job is persuading the people you work with to ship great stuff. No junk. No shortcuts. If you’re not the defender of the brand, who is? "
785,Cooperative enthusiasm,"April 19, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/cooperative-enthusiasm/,"When someone shares a new idea, or makes a pitch, or describes a dream, what would happen if you were enthusiastic? Perhaps positive thinking is contagious. Perhaps egging on the other person will help them explore the edges. And perhaps it will help them overcome their fear and share the very best version of what they have in mind. You can always say ‘no’ later. In this moment, your confidence and enthusiasm exist to make the idea better. No harm in that. For either of you. "
786,Coiling ropes,"April 18, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/coiling-ropes/,Professionals put things away slowly so that they’ll be ready quickly when needed. Investing time now for time later. 
787,Asking and daring,"April 17, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/asking-and-daring/,"High Noon is a cornerstone of American cinema, a sobering and memorable look at heroism and community. In the movie, the sheriff is facing near-certain death at the hands of a killer freed from prison. He has about an hour to gather a posse of deputies, because together they’ll be able to repel the avenging outlaw when he arrives on the noon train. As the clock ticks down, the marshal visits one part of the community after another, begging them to help him. And each finds a reason to say no, preferring short-term safety to long-term freedom, community belonging and heroism. Howard Hawks, director of Rio Bravo, pointed out that the reason that the marshal failed to rally the community was that he was asking. In search of affiliation, he shared his fears and a story of mutual support as well as loyalty for what he’d done for them for so long. In Rio Bravo, on the other hand, John Wayne does nothing of the sort. He regularly turns down offers of help, being selective about who’s worthy of being on his team. He shares no fear or trepidation. He’s selling status and dominance, not affiliation. “Are you good enough to be on this team?” Humans are motivated by affiliation or by status. And in the archetypal old west, it was status that often carried the day. The same might be true for the community that you are part of. "
788,The resolution of communication,"April 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/the-resolution-of-communication/,"What’s better, a phone call or a zoom call? Which creates more intimacy, a meeting in person or a hand-written letter? The only answer is: it depends. It’s tempting to believe that being in a store, surrounded by sights, smells, packaging, crowds and helpful salespeople delivers more interaction and sales than a catalog. But a company like Zingerman’s manages to make a can of sardines sound far more exciting than it would at the deli. When we communicate, the real issue isn’t how many bits of information are available. Instead, I think there are three forces at work: Are we using all the information we can? (The baker can choose how the store smells and how the display looks). Are we showing up with permission, in the right moment? Is there a path to emotional connection and trust? Whether it’s connecting with an old friend or hearing from a politician, there’s no universal hi-rez option. It’s more complicated than that. "
789,Things to feel bad about,"April 15, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/things-to-feel-bad-about/,"You might have a list of them. In fact, many of us do, and consult it quite often. The list is defective for a number of reasons: Lists like this aren’t a helpful way to avoid bad outcomes. But they do allow us to experience the bad outcomes in advance, even the ones that don’t happen. If feeling bad is keeping us from doing things that produce better outcomes, more connection or simply joy, it’s a waste. The best use of the list might be to write it down, make it complete, carefully put it in a drawer for later. And then forget about it. "
790,Two things we say to kids,"April 14, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/two-things-we-say-to-kids/,"Overhead recently: To a 10-year-old on his way to a baseball game, “Come home with a win.” To a 9-year-old at the supermarket, “I don’t think you’ll like that.” It’s pretty clear what lessons are being taught.

791,Rethinking categories of media,"April 13, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/rethinking-categories-of-media/,"It is found or it arrives. It is hosted many places or it has a single home. It earns and delivers on permission, or it’s spam. It changes over time or it’s static. It’s the work of an individual or the production of a community. It’s valuable because of network effects, or in spite of them. It produces energy and momentum, or it absorbs it. It’s scarce or it’s widely available. It thrives on the long tail or only works if it’s a hit. It dances with the early adopters or soothes the feelings of the late majority. It’s truly live, or it benefits from time shifting. It launches itself or it waits to be pressed. It enhances productivity, or it reduces it. It is a catalyst for cultural change, or it feeds on cultural change. It energizes and inspires, or it trolls with snark and irony. People share it because it benefits them, or someone has to hustle to make it spread. It goes stale very quickly, or it becomes more relevant over time. It’s worth talking about, or it’s not. "
792,Generation C,"April 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/generation-c/,"We’ve been naming generations for a long time. Demographers use it to begin a conversation about the changes around us. While a birth range doesn’t guarantee an outlook, the demographics and cultural shifts that a group shares tell us a lot about how they might see the world. And the name is a shortcut to remind us that not everyone sees the world the way we do. The last four are pretty unimaginative if you ask me, but I also know that a baby boomer is probably thinking of the world differently than a millennial is right now. These are inexact labels, but helpful nonetheless. So what to call the next generation? My co-authors Bruce Clark and Paige NeJame have coined the term “Generation C.” It’s so well-suited, I believe it’s going to stick. C is for Covid, C is for Carbon, C is for Climate. The combination of years of school spent at home, in a mask, combined with the significant revolution (economic, political and social) that our industrialism has led us to means that this generation will be different than the ones before. Every decision and investment and interaction is going to be filtered through the lens of carbon and remediation and resilience. And yet, if we combine this with the c of connection, of a cohort of people who are finding solace and possibility in community, there’s a chance for all of us. It will take compassion as well. Generation C didn’t ask for any of this, but I’m hopeful that they’re up for leading the change. "
793,Not impossible,"April 11, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/not-impossible/,"Some folks build their work on the frontier of impossible. Breakthrough coding, an astonishing new magic trick, a concerto that takes your breath away. It’s so remarkable that we’re tempted to believe that this is our job as well. Not every once in a while, but daily. To do what has never been done before, creating emotions that are scarce indeed. But the scarcity of this sort of work might be the proof we need to realize that it’s not for us to create, at least not today. Today, we get the chance to lead, to connect and to do work we’re proud of. Work we can describe before we begin, and work we’re confident is worth doing. That might be enough. "

795,Convenience and boredom,"April 9, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/convenience-and-boredom/,"The last fifty years have seen a worldwide effort to maximize one and eliminate the other. Marketers and technologists work overtime to create convenience. We’ve gone from hunting and growing our food to pressing three buttons on a phone to get it…  And the cost of that convenience is high. We give up privacy, control and satisfaction to get it, in every corner of our lives. At the same time, the market has figured out that we simply don’t like to be bored. And so there’s more stimulation, more options and more noise than ever before. The problem is that boredom is a partner with satisfaction and joy. It’s hard to overstimulate ourselves into those feelings. "
796,When the gauge is broken,"April 8, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/when-the-gauge-is-broken/,"When your watch stops, it’s unlikely that you believe that time is now standing still. It’s obviously the watch that’s broken, not time. But when a metric on our culture or a complex machine is functioning poorly, it’s easy to get confused. Is this work actually unpopular, or is the bestseller list not an accurate reporter of what people care about? Is the pump actually overheating, or is the temperature probe broken? The more complex the system, the more likely we are to believe a broken gauge, even if it’s only right twice a day. If you’re not satisfied with what you think is happening, it might be worth recalibrating. "

798,And maybe it’s enough,"April 6, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/and-maybe-its-enough/,"To feel sufficient, to be satisfied with what we have: Chisoku in Japanese. Of course, by some measures, there’s never enough. We can always come up with a reason why more is better, or better is better, or new is better or different is better. Enough becomes a choice, not a measure of science. The essence of choice is that it belongs to each of us. And if you decide you have enough, then you do. And with that choice comes a remarkable sort of freedom. The freedom to be still, to become aware and to stop hiding from the living that’s yet to be done. "
799,Modern marketing and hustle,"April 5, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/modern-marketing-and-hustle/,"Hustle uses shortcuts and effort to bend the conventions of society to get more than the hustler’s fair share of attention. Hustle burns trust for awareness. Because it’s a shortcut, hustle might deliver in the short-run, but hustle is notably non-consensual. Few people want to be hustled. Marketing is the work of helping people get what they’ve wanted all along. Marketing is about establishing the conditions for a small group of people to eagerly spread the word and build connection. Modern marketing changes the culture by establishing what the new norms are, and does it in a way that makes things better for those it serves. Taking attention vs. storytelling and service. Sometimes it feels like the shortcuts and depersonalization and scale are the only option, then a great marketing project comes along and we’re reminded that in fact, we can do work we’re proud of. "
800,The surprising thing about expectations,"April 4, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/the-surprising-thing-about-expectations/,"When you meet expectations, when you make a promise and keep it, when your quality is on spec—we say “of course.” On the other hand, if you relentlessly raise expectations, if you overpromise and add a bit of hype, you’re almost certain to fail to meet our dreams and hopes. At the same time, though, those raised hopes are their own sort of placebo, an internal cognitive dissonance that will make some people like your work more than if you had simply promised less.  And finally, if you invest the time, care and money to dramatically over-deliver, you probably won’t make as much in profit today, but that imbalance is often made up for with word of mouth in your favor. When you amaze and delight, your fans will pay it forward. A hundred years into our industrial age, each of these forms of expectation has become its own signal. We’ve established expectations about expectations. You can’t raise money from a VC if you tell them exactly what the numbers are going to be like, and no one would have surgery if surgeons were clear about all the details. The challenge is to be sure we put the correct expectations in the right categories. "
801,Anytimed,"April 3, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/anytimed/,"It’s not a word, but perhaps it should be. If a competitor goes after your customers by offering them faster service, all day and all night, you’ve been anytimed. And if your boss, fearing that event, or simply trying to boost output for free, pushes you to be available all hours of the day and night, you’re being anytimed as well. The market wants convenience and speed and price. Anytimed is a side effect of that race. "
802,Catastrophization,"April 2, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/catastrophization/,"Life’s a tragedy. It always surprises us, and eventually, we all die. But tragedies don’t have to lead to catastrophes. A catastrophe is a shared emergency that overwhelms our interactions and narratives. Lately, they’ve become a business model and a never-ending part of our days. If we live in a world driven by attention, catastrophization is a sure way to grab some. It’s a bright red button that causes forward motion to freeze up. If it helped, it wouldn’t be a problem. If it helped, we could use our resources to make a difference. But it’s not designed to help, it’s designed to shift our focus and activate our emotions. It might be the catastrophe of world events, or the political scrum or even an unhappy customer on Yelp. For too long, people with power and privilege simply ignored things that mattered, and catastrophization is a reasonable response–until it begins to undermine the work we need to do. It quickly becomes a version of Pressfield’s resistance, a way to avoid leaning into important projects that might not work–because it’s safer to focus on a thing over there than it is to work on something right here. And it’s exhausting. Catastrophe fatigue sets in, and we end up losing interest and drifting away, until the next emergency arrives. Catastrophization ends up distracting us from the long-term systemic work we signed up to do. It’s a signal that we care about what’s happening right now, but it also keeps us from focusing on what’s going to happen soon.  The best way to care is to persist in bending the culture and our systems to improve things over time. "
803,“Not a heavy lift”,"April 1, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/04/not-a-heavy-lift/,"If you work with your hands and your back, avoiding a heavy lift is totally understandable. For many of us, though, we work with time or with trust.  If someone asks you to endorse their new project, “it’ll only take a minute,” they’re offering to save you time, but at the risk of the trust you’ve built. That’s not a light lift, it’s a huge risk. If someone says, “please forward this to everyone in your address book, here’s a simple script to do it automatically,” that is indeed a heavy lift. Just because it’s fast doesn’t mean it’s worth doing. "
804,The physical therapy metaphor,"March 31, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/the-physical-therapy-metaphor/,"For many ailments, physical therapy shows some of the best results. We can learn a lot from this for our own projects, organizations and narratives. Physical therapy often works better than pills or surgery. Here’s why: –it’s self-produced. Even though we work with a professional, it’s done BY us, not TO us. –it’s gradual. No one gets better after one session.  –it puts our own resources to work to create the change we seek. –it’s simple. There’s no magic involved, just directed, persistent effort based on science and testing. –it takes effort. If you want something easy, you’re in the wrong place. Thanks to Ricardo. "
805,Testing new ideas,"March 30, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/testing-new-ideas/,"What would a focus group have said about the title of Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird? Is it easy to understand, did you know what it’s about before you pick up the book? What about the consumer testing on a name like Nike or Starbucks?  Some objective measures of new names and concepts are worth knowing about before you launch. Seeing what search results look like, understanding the trademark register, having insight about pronunciation and language issues. But general “how does this make you feel” feedback on a new concept is almost certain to give you exactly the wrong feedback. That’s because the idea isn’t going to work because it’s objectively, obviously and completely better. It’s going to work because the network effects and cultural dynamics behind it push it forward. "
806,The hospitality systems gap,"March 29, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/the-hospitality-systems-gap/,"What’s the variance in customer service at your organization? Even if there’s just one employee, the question is: If an issue is handled by a committed employee having a good attitude, vs a cranky one who is a bit off–can the customer tell? One philosophy is to make this gap as small as possible. Create systems that ensure that the experience remains the same, always pretty good. Make sure your scripts and your policies and your phone tree and your management oversight is such that there isn’t much of a gap. The other philosophy is to hire great people and give them room to shine. With all the variability that entails. It’s almost impossible to have both.  If you want to create remarkable service, you’re simply going to have to trust your people and yourself. Heroes use systems, they aren’t held back by them. "
807,Re-calibrating,"March 28, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/re-calibrating/,"When an entrepreneur gets funded, it’s often difficult for them to start spending money on assets–the old limits fade slowly. What used to be smart is now dumb. What used to too risky is now the safe thing to do.  When someone gets older or is injured, one of the dangers is that they’ll fail to realize that they can’t do the things they used to do in quite the same way. And graduating from college means that you probably can’t maintain the lifestyle you used to have… None of these changes are failures. They’re simply steps in the journey. We change. That’s part of the deal. A well-lived life without calibration is unlikely. "
808,Speeding up for the red light,"March 27, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/speeding-up-for-the-red-light/,"Bad drivers do this often, everywhere I’ve ever been in the world. Instead of gracefully and safely slowing for a light they know will be red by the time they get there, or even a stop sign, they hit the gas and then slam the brakes. One big reason is that the certainty of on-then-off is a lot easier for them to navigate than a thoughtful approach to transitions. If you’re going to have to stop soon, perhaps you should start coasting now. And of course, we all make the braking mistake in our daily lives. A transition doesn’t have to be a crisis, unless we want it to be. "
809,Expertise vs Attitude,"March 26, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/expertise-vs-attitude/,"The typical online job site lists millions of jobs. And just about every one of them is a cry for expertise. From the title to the requirements, companies hire for expertise. Logic helps us understand that only one out of ten people are in the top 10% when it comes to expertise. And that means that most companies are settling for good enough. If the organization needs people with expertise in the top decile, they’re going to have to pay far more and work far harder to find and retain that sort of skill. So most companies don’t try. They create jobs that can be done pretty well by people with a typical amount of expertise. That means that the actual differentiator in just about every job is attitude. From plumbers to carpenters to radiologists to pharmacists, someone with extraordinary soft skills (honesty, commitment, compassion, resilience, enrollment in the journey, empathy, willingness to be coached… the real skills that we actually care about) is going to outperform. If this is so obviously true, then why don’t organizations hire for attitude and train for expertise? "
810,Where do symbols live?,"March 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/where-do-symbols-live/,"If the original Nike swoosh, on a sheet of paper in a filing cabinet somewhere, disappeared, what would happen to the value of Nike? Or to the way you feel about your sneakers? If the negative of a famous photo is burned in a fire, or a painting is stolen from a museum, what happens to the symbol it’s related to? As soon as an object becomes a symbol, the object itself becomes separate from that story. In fact, freeing the symbol from the object gives it more power, and allows it to spread and become ever more relevant. My town is trying to decide whether or not it should spend millions of dollars preserving a defunct carbon-steel water tower. But whether they preserve it or not, the symbol of the tower remains, and the stories we tell ourselves about place and time remain as well. Spending the money on education, climate remediation and equity will all make the symbol more powerful than steel restoration ever could. If you want to turn your object into a more powerful symbol, it might pay to get rid of the object. "
811,The power of TK,"March 24, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/the-power-of-tk/,"The origin of the editor’s mark “TK” is murky. It’s what you write when there’s a fact or addition you’re waiting on. Instead of stopping everything, simply type “TK” and you know you can come back and fix it later. The modern purpose of TK is that there are few words in English that contain these two letters juxtaposed in this way, so it’s super easy to use Word to search your manuscript. (Except for ‘latkes’ and ‘pocketknife.’) But I think it predates search. The magic of TK is more interesting. The existence of TK means we don’t have to stop and wait for everything to be perfect before we proceed. If the flooring for the kitchen hasn’t arrived yet, TK and then move on to wallpaper the dining room. Our lives are filled with TK moments. It’ll come. No need to stop and wait for it. "
812,The cake mix insight,"March 23, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/the-cake-mix-insight/,"When Betty Crocker (not her real name) first started selling cake mixes, all you had to do was add water. They failed. But when they changed the recipe and required users to add oil and an egg, sales went up. Because people like to feel as though they’re cooking. It made the mix an activity that felt like home making. If you order a high-end table saw (and you should, so you don’t get injured) you might discover that there are a fair number of nuts and bolts to install. For the premium that’s charged, there’s no reason for this–except that assembling the last bit yourself feels worthy. And you’ve probably guessed the punchline, so I won’t tell it to you. When you assemble it yourself… "
813,The lurkers,"March 22, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/the-lurkers/,"It’s frustrating for anyone who leads. If everyone who says that they’re a contributor/member/supporter/fan/long-term customer showed up, huge things would happen.  So we spend a lot of time hustling to get the lurkers to take action. Post again! Create more incentives! Dumb it down! Most of all, focus on creating urgency. This isn’t how progress actually happens. The 95% who lurk will almost always lurk. That’s okay. The place to focus is on the 5%. Because when their persistent, consistent and generous action begins to add up, change happens. And that brings the lurkers along. It might even activate them. They’ll catch up when they need to. There’s nothing wrong with lurkers. Lurkers are potential action-takers. For now, though, our focus, our energy and our gratitude is for the people who are already showing up.  "
814,Peak customer service and the hospitality mindset,"March 21, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/peak-customer-service-and-the-hospitality-mindset/,"Is cheaper better? Is profit the only thing to be maximized? For its first decade, Federal Express embraced customer service as a marketing tool. They were competing with the postal service, but more than that, they were trying hard to create a habit that turned 25 cent deliveries into $20 deliveries, particularly among businesses. They answered the phone on the first ring. They hired people who cared about the customer experience and gave them tools to keep their promises. They sacrificed short-term profits in order to build a brand promise that people could trust. Some organizations end up ingraining this ethos deeply into what they do, and stick with it for the long haul. They have a hospitality mindset. Service isn’t simply the tool to make profits–it’s a key part of why you’re here in the first place. In the last decade, Fedex (simply to pick a familiar example, they’re by no means unique) decided to take a different path. They don’t answer the phone easily. When they do, they box their low-paid workers in with scripts and policies that leave little room for human engagement. They remove less profitable dropboxes, and shorten the hours they do pickups. When a package goes awry, they do little to repair the broken trust it creates.  I’m sure a McKinsey consultant ran the numbers on all of these changes.  All of these steps add up to slightly more profit in the short run. And, perhaps, over time, people who really care (the difficult customers?) switch to another provider. But the real cost here is to their people, their mission and the culture they seek to build. Hospitality is a choice, not simply a tactic. It’s possible to build an organization that does work you’re proud of, surrounded by people who feel the same way. People who care, solving problems and creating connection. "
815,The things you can’t see,"March 20, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/the-things-you-cant-see/,"Do you remember all the elements you didn’t used to notice? It might be the way you see typography now, or the tuning of an orchestra. Or the alignment in the mouldings of a house you’re inspecting or the way an engine sounds… (or whether you put a ‘u’ in moulding) Expertise is about learning new ways to notice. Often, once we learn to see, we assume we’ve always known. And that allows us to believe that the things we can’t see, we’ll never be able to see. But it doesn’t work that way unless we get complacent. There’s always something just below the surface, the elements that most people simply don’t notice. But we can if we choose. "
816,Question authority,"March 19, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/question-authority/,"Lock-in persists. That’s why it’s so valued by monopolists, tyrants and cults. The ability to speak up always creates inefficiency. It’s easier to just shut up and drive. Or be driven. But the ability to speak up is a self-cleaning algorithm. Our freedom to move on, to criticize and to suggest creates the conditions for the system to improve. It’s tempting to sign up for the one with lock-in. It often comes with bonuses, inducements and the promises of efficiency and dominance. But it’s not resilient. When the world changes, and it always does, open systems are far less brittle than their shiny counterparts. "
817,Inside the bubble,"March 18, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/inside-the-bubble/,"Whenever there’s a speculative bubble going on (or a cultural one, for that matter) life inside the bubble seems rational and normal. And so artists at Miami:Basel are talking about minting NFTs. Not because they understand them (they don’t) or because they provide actual utility (they don’t) but because that’s what life is like inside of this particular speculative bubble. And people outside the bubble are supposed to feel left behind, because that’s part of the fuel of life inside the bubble. When a corporate culture begins to get insular, or a community starts acting like a cult, the same thing happens. Culture is “the way we do things around here.” The very nature of a bubble is that there’s an inside and an outside, an expanding reality-distortion field that assures people inside the bubble that they’re doing things that are rational and normal. If you’re confident that the bubble is here for the long-term, perhaps we shouldn’t hesitate to play along. But when the bubble bursts (and speculative bubbles always do), be prepared for reality to disagree with your assertions. “Art does not lie down on the bed that is made for it; it runs away as soon as one says its name; it loves to be incognito. Its best moments are when it forgets what it is called.” –Jean Dubuffet "
818,How should we celebrate your day?,"March 17, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/how-should-we-celebrate-your-day/,"If today was a holiday in your honor, what would it be about? If we had to examine everything about you, your work, your impact, your reputation–what would be the positive caricature we would draw? What sorts of slogans, banners and greetings would we use to celebrate you and your work? It’s never accurate to boil down an organization or a person’s work to a simple sentence or two, but we do it anyway. What’s yours? "
819,The hobgoblin of fidelity,"March 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/the-hobgoblin-of-fidelity/,"My first computer game design was in 1977–I came up with a version of Star Wars. It was almost nothing like the movie, but it was a pretty good game for something running on a mainframe. The Godfather isn’t a perfect retelling of the book.  But it’s a better movie as a result. A really good recording doesn’t sound like a live concert or what you’d hear sitting in the studio. It sounds like a really good record. And when Alan Dean Foster and I turned Shadowkeep from a computer game into a novel, the goal wasn’t to replicate a computer game, it was to create a good novel. When a medium arrives, or time shifts, it’s sometimes tempting to aim for a complete reconstruction of what came before. Follow the rules, don’t innovate. But that’s a mistake–a safe choice that’s actually a trap. People desire media that is in and of itself. Each form of media has its own character, and fidelity from one form to another is a compromise that rarely works. Because the world has changed, original isn’t original anymore. It can’t be, even if we want it to, because now it’s out of place. Just as we can’t step in the same river twice, each innovation in media forces us to walk away from fidelity to honor what’s possible. Fidelity might feel like an option, and it takes effort and care. But is fidelity the best you can do? When we switch media, or time zones, or cultures, or technology, it’s up to us to make the idea what it can become, not simply an unpalatable simulacrum of what it was over there. "
820,All the best,"March 15, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/all-the-best/,"Benchmarking involves looking at every element of what you offer and comparing it to the very best element of any of your competitors. So your door handle is as good as the Audi’s, and your brake pedal is as good as the Volvo’s and… It’s pretty tempting to do this. Who wants any element of what they do to be inferior to a competitor’s? And yet… That’s almost never what makes something remarkable (it’s worth noting that the Ford Taurus was the car that brought benchmarking to my attention… who wants a Ford Taurus?). What makes something remarkable is a combination of its internal synergy—the parts work together as a coherent whole—and its imbalance. Something about it is worth talking about. Something about it is hard to find. Something about it helps us achieve our goals if we talk about it. This uneven allocation of attention is the opposite of benchmarking. Find your edge and go over it. "
821,Assuming other people have it too,"March 14, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/assuming-other-people-have-it-too/,"Whatever “it” is. That’s probably a mistake. People don’t know what you know, don’t believe what you believe, don’t fear what you fear. They’re not equally skilled, equally fast and equally equipped. “If I were you” isn’t that helpful. "
822,Reply all,"March 13, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/reply-all/,"Who decided that this was a good way for a group to interact? It’s all the worst elements of synchronous and asynchronous discussion rolled into one. It prioritizes speed of reply over thoughtfulness, and creates a hard-to-manage non-coordinated sort of discovery and decision making. If it’s worth taking the time of the team, it’s worth doing it in a shared doc or in real-time. Neither is as convenient, both reward thinking hard about how we want to move things forward. "
823,The easy measurements,"March 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/the-easy-measurements/,"The system is lazy. It focuses on the things that are easy to measure: How fast can you type, what was your score on the test, how many followers do you have? One way to move forward is to learn discernment. You can discover overlooked value by measuring things that are difficult to measure. And finding the energy and commitment to do things that others might not easily measure in the short run is the best way to make a difference. "
824,Start with someone else’s work,"March 11, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/start-with-someone-elses-work/,"A simple approach to learning how to solicit and receive feedback: Begin by showing a well-meaning peer someone else’s novel, painting, design or business plan… You might discover that when you show it to a friend (“here’s a chapter from a novel I’m writing” or “Here’s the logo my firm is considering”) you get harsh, direct criticism, filled with certainty and warning. It’s easier to hear, because it’s not your work. They’re busy criticizing a chapter that JK Rowling wrote, or a logo that the late Milton Glaser created. “Oh,” you’ll realize, “this isn’t about the work, it’s about me, it’s about someone trying to help me avoid heartache later.” It turns out that most people are unpracticed and unprofessional at giving useful feedback. Learning to differentiate well-meaning fear-on-your-behalf from actually useful insight is a great first step in understanding who to ask when it really matters. We don’t need unwarranted criticism or simple reassurance. In fact, we need someone who understands genre and has the insight to share what they know in a way we can use. "
825,On the hook,"March 10, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/on-the-hook-2/,"It’s scary. That’s the point. Pick a date certain. You’re on the hook. Describe a particular type of client, or even choose one by name.  Be really clear about the change you seek to make. Put your name on it. Charge a fair price. Assert that you’ve got something to say. Know what you are doing and then act like it. Avoid gimmicks and hustle. These are all ways to put yourself on the hook. Is there any better place to be? "
826,Calculating the last minute,"March 9, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/calculating-the-last-minute/,"It probably doesn’t pay to buy your prom dress when you are 12 years old. You’re not sure of the size, not sure of what styles will be like and not even sure you want to go. On the other hand, filing your taxes an hour before the deadline is a risk that doesn’t really pay off. The last minute is an easy habit to fall into. Once you start focusing on crises, it makes it really difficult to find the focus and energy to begin planning ahead. But the last minute can be risky and expensive. If something is: the last minute might be a smart strategy. On the other hand, events that have some combination of: lend themselves to the discipline of planning ahead. If it’s not worth the time to do the calculation, it’s probably not worth waiting for the last minute. "
827,Three problems of healthcare,"March 8, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/three-problems-of-healthcare/,"Technology/science Resources Information For a long time, we had no clue. We didn’t know about germs or viruses. We thought that ulcers were caused by pastrami sandwiches. We went to the barber for bloodletting and didn’t understand genes or evolution. Technology in medicine, the science of understanding and intervening, has made huge leaps. There are more to come, but most of what ails us is very well understood. As we’ve developed more of an understanding of technology, we’ve also dramatically increased the number of resources we put into healthcare. Particularly in parts of the privileged world, but also worldwide, we spend more on clean water, pharmaceuticals, surgery etc. than we ever did before. The real problem of healthcare in this moment is information. We hamstring well-meaning healthcare professionals, burdening them with forms and scans and processes simply because their institutions don’t have a better way to collect and share information. We suffer from cranks, trolls and charlatans because we don’t have a systemic, trusted way to share what we already know about how our health works. And all of us make damaging lifestyle choices that erode the world’s health far more than any disease. Information about technology and resources is the key to using the tools we already have. Who needs help, when they  need help and what help they need–we’re doing a lousy job of this. In one sense, the information problem is good news. Because we keep getting better at information. In two decades, we went from a visit to the library to Google. We have access to more science, more location and historical data and more behavior insight in the last few years than in all of recorded history before that. Humans are always going to be fearful and superstitious when it comes to our health. We’ll probably continue to fall into bad habits and make panicked choices. The answer might not be a scientific breakthrough or more money spent on a new device. It might simply be allowing skilled practitioners to bring their care and insight to the right people in the right moment. "
828,The million-dollar gap,"March 7, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/the-million-dollar-gap/,"To make an album of music good enough to make it to the Top 40, it used to cost a million dollars. Now you can do it in your bedroom. To make a commercial for network TV, a minute of footage cost about a million dollars… And that same million was what it would cost to create an email engine for permission-based marketing in 1996. And you needed a million dollars to build a website that could hold up under a lot of traffic, or to build a social media presence that would reach a million people. All of these things are now incredibly cheap. A veteran marketer’s first reaction is relief at how inexpensive so many tools now are. But the reality is that the reduction in cost means that price is not a barrier, and when it comes to producing your message, your movie, your song, your site, your book–everyone else is now doing it as well. And yet, more than a decade into this dramatic compression of the gap, big-time marketers and industry players are still acting as if the gap is still there, as if their ‘professional’ creations are only competing with each other for attention. Abundance creates new kinds of scarcity. "
829,The leap,"March 6, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/the-leap/,"Marketing makes change happen. And for humans, the change is rarely linear. There’s a moment before and a moment after the decision is made. Some people find the moment thrilling, others are unnerved by it. When a salesperson fails to open the door for the leap, the customer is ill-served. The status quo is powerful and left to our own devices, many of us would fail to go where we hope to. On the other hand, when the marketing and sales folks push too hard, trust is broken. People end up being manipulated into actions that they’d rather not have taken, and relationships fall apart. Forward motion happens when individuals and organizations decide to adopt a posture of possibility. And that’s enabled by marketers ready to help them embrace that possibility. "
830,Show us your work,"March 5, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/show-us-your-work/,"There’s a mythology around people with famous resumes. Folks who have worked for brands we’ve heard of and on projects that have been successful. We give the benefit of the doubt to someone who did “app development at Slack” or “sales at Google.” But what this generally means is that they were patient and pretty good at going to meetings. Show us the code you wrote. Show us the difficult presentations you were able to produce. Most of all, show us the work you did when no one asked you to do the work. When you’re on your own, what is important enough to you to ship? We need teamwork. But we also need people who can master their tools and ship the work. "

The sign might be legal, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be effective. We’re surrounded by instruction manuals, videos, announcements and all sorts of other forms of instruction. But a map only works if it helps. Finding our way, getting the job done, changing our minds–these are forms of wayfinding. And our internal layout of the world doesn’t match the way it is actually built. You can drive to your childhood home blindfolded, but you probably couldn’t draw a route of how to get there for someone else. Realizing that our job is to help others find the way is half the job. "
832,Outsourcing,"March 3, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/outsourcing/,"“I’d like corn for dinner.” So, six months ago, you’ll need to plant the corn so you can harvest it today and cook it tonight. Or you can drive to the farmer’s market this morning, buy a few ears and have it tonight. Or you can walk over to the supermarket and get a can. Or you can press this button on your phone and dinner will be here in twenty minutes. I write this blog but I didn’t program the website. Everything we do uses materials and tools that were made by someone else. When we built Yoyodyne thirty years ago, we spent millions of dollars to build email servers that you could rent today for $50 a month… The question that isn’t asked, but that must be asked, is: Which part are you going to do yourself? If you’re a photographer, does it make sense to edit your own work, or should you send it out to someone who is twice as good, half the price and faster than you are? We act as though we’re locked into this decision, but in fact, we make it again, every single day. What are you doing today that only you can do? What would happen if that’s all you did all day? PS Akimbo (my weekly podcast) is now over 200 episodes. You can find it all the normal places (Apple, acast, site) "
833,Continuous incremental improvement,"March 2, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/continuous-incremental-improvement/,"Who invented the smartphone? Well, certainly Alexander Graham Bell, Antonio Meucci, Hedy Lamarr and Edison and Tesla had something to do with it. And the folks at Fairchild. And Palm and Cisco and General Magic and countless others. When we insist on waiting until it’s done before we share it, we walk away from the most important component of innovation. "
834,Encouragement and reassurance,"March 1, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/03/encouragement-and-reassurance/,"Reassurance always runs out. Reassurance implies that the only reason to go forward is because it’s certain to work. Reassurance is futile. Encouragement means that someone sees us, understands us and believes in us. Even (especially) when things don’t turn out as we hoped. Encouragement lasts. Encouragement is self-fueling and self-fulfilling. "
835,One sigh per yes,"February 28, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/one-grudge-per-yes/,"When a client, a boss or an employee makes a special request, it’s okay to get a little bent out of shape. It might cost you extra time or money, it might be a hassle, it might not be deserved. And then you can say no. But if you say yes, then it pays to be in it. 100%.  If you’re not, your yes was worthless. It ceases to be a favor if it comes with grumbling. Holding a grudge means that our hands are too full to do our best work. "
836,"Chaos, connection and industrial systems","February 27, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/chaos-connection-and-industrial-systems/,"Industrial systems thrive on predictability. It smooths out the supply chain, improves efficiency and makes many of the participants more comfortable. Tomorrow is like yesterday, but perhaps a little faster or cheaper. But breakthroughs, creativity and human connection don’t come from predictability. They come from unpredictable interactions with unknown ideas and voices. Just about all bestsellers are surprise bestsellers. All big ideas come out of left field. But if you spend your time looking at left field, they’ll come out of right field instead. Chaos is uncomfortable, particularly if you’ve been indoctrinated in the industrial mindset. But if the right people and the right conditions are present, chaos creates possibility. Do it with intent. "
837,Difficult problems,"February 26, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/difficult-problems/,"The easy problems are often an illusion. If they were real and they were easy, they’d be solved already. Difficult problems, on the other hand, stick around until someone with insight, dedication and commitment shows up and gets to work. Seeking out difficult problems is far more effective than avoiding them. "
838,Common pitfalls and myths of the new economy,"February 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/common-pitfalls-of-the-new-economy/,"It’s not high school. But some of the advice that people are embracing reminds us of those days… Things that everyone tells you that aren’t true: It’s possible to get rich quickly without taking risks (not really) Just because someone bought some crazy dog currency or NFT and got lucky doesn’t mean that you will. It’s remarkable when someone beats the odds because, by definition, the odds are always hard to beat. Every social media platform has stars and if you follow the path, you will become one (not most people) There are more media stars now than ever before in history. But the nature of the power-law curve is clear: in order for a star to be valuable, most people can’t be one. Doing what the last star did is not likely to get you what the last star got. The best way to build a following online is to be fully authentic (oof) Keanu is not Neo. He’s an actor. Youssou N’Dour doesn’t go on stage when he feels like it, he goes on stage when it’s showtime. The world will never know you, but they will judge you.  Or at least the you that is presented when you go online. The hardest part of online commerce is building your website (well, no.) Actually, it’s simply the part you do before you go live. It’s the clothes you wear, not the way you actually engage with the world. The hard part is finding an audience and earning the benefit of the doubt. The hard part is creating community, leading and building something people want. Freelancing is like having a job without a boss (alas) Well, you still have a boss. It’s you. And you might not be a good one. Freelancers spend part of their day doing the work, and the rest of the time earning better clients.  The hard part of the work is doing the work. "

840,A little more or a little less,"February 23, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/a-little-more-or-a-little-less/,"The producer of a successful product has a choice to make. If you put a little less in the box, people will run out sooner and have to buy more. If you give people a little more for their money, they’ll purchase less often, but become more loyal. It turns out that in most markets where there are easy substitutions, the long-term value of loyalty is far greater than the short-term profit of less. "
841,A second opinion,"February 22, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/a-second-opinion/,"A friend is selling his house. Apparently, real estate brokers now have a way of reporting the comments (reviews) from potential buyers at open houses, and he was crazy enough to read them. Of course, this is incredibly unhelpful. He can’t rebuild his house to sell it. Hearing that people don’t like his custom cabinets or the layout of the living room isn’t actionable–especially since the other half of the comments contradict the first half. What’s actually happening is that someone who isn’t qualified or emotionally connected enough to make a purchase is looking for something to say. And humans are really bad at explaining our irrational feelings in the context of rational reasons. So we make stuff up. And we’re equally bad at hearing comments about things we can’t change. By all means, ask a second doctor before you get surgery. But in just about every public setting, the comments aren’t going to be particularly helpful. "
842,Sales and the story of money,"February 21, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/sales-and-the-story-of-money/,"“Twenty-four ninety-five.” I was on the phone hearing a pitch for a service I needed. I had reached out to a recommended vendor, and was now sitting through a pitch from a salesperson who had a script but no listening skills. I had figured that the service was probably $300 if I shopped around, but I was willing to pay a bit more than that if it would save time. Finally, the script-reader got to the price. “It’s 24.95.” I paused for a second. “You mean it’s twenty four dollars and ninety-five cents?” “No,” he said. “Oh… you meant to say two-thousand-four-hundred-and-ninety-five dollars…” Why would you write the script to anchor the price at 1% of what it really costs? Instead of a fruitless hustle, two other stories could have worked better. A competent salesperson could have said, “Some of our competitors charge $300 and some charge $5,000. We’re right in the middle and I can tell you why.” Or perhaps they could have said, “Some people charge as little as $300 for this. Let me tell you why we charge a lot more than that, and why it might be a smart choice for you.” In both cases, the truth becomes a firm foundation for a story about value and position. Money is a story we tell ourselves about value, status and position. "
843,Begrudgingly,"February 20, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/begrudgingly/,"Social niceties are easy to do half-heartedly. But they’re not for us, they’re for the other person. When you show up begrudgingly, it’s not half-hearted, it’s cold hearted. A handshake, a greeting, the way we sit in a meeting or wear a mask–it’s a chance to connect and to make a difference for the person we’re with. All in, or not at all. "
844,Who chooses?,"February 19, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/who-chooses/,"When Google or Facebook or Spotify decide what you’ll see next, they’re making a choice. That’s very different from an open platform like “podcasting” or “blogging” (in quotes with no capital letters, because no one is in charge.) Being in charge implies that choices are being made. And people who are in charge–even if it’s just one person in charge of their own voice–are choosing. Choosing is a form of selection, of amplification and of curation. Not official government censorship, but something more nuanced than that, the responsibility that comes from choice. In many parts of our culture, particularly pockets of tech, it’s fashionable to talk about ‘free speech’ and ‘open platforms’ as if they’re unalloyed virtues. But the moment Apple puts a podcast on its home page,  Google decides to put this blog in your promo folder, or Spotify decides to promote one song or podcast over another, the platform is no longer truly open. Often, individuals and organizations use terms like this when they’re defending something that isn’t helpful to the people who encountered it.  When money enters the picture, it’s even more complicated. There’s a difference between a truly open platform and an algorithm staffed by people who put one sort of website on their spam list and another highly ranked, simply because they make more of a profit on the second one. Or when YouTube or Spotify pay people a thousand (or two hundred million) dollars to host their content… Ideas shared create value. Good ideas are the engine of our future. We’ve seen that when creators of ideas take responsibility for their work, it’s more likely that we all benefit. Wide-open platforms almost always lead to chaos, negative side effects and anonymous spam. I’m in favor of choice, especially when it’s made by organizations and individuals willing to be held responsible for the choices they make. "
845,"The Oxford comma, trap","February 18, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/the-oxford-comma-trap/,"It’s easy to accept the limits that are implied when someone asks us for advice and feedback. Fix the typos, sure. That’s important. But perhaps you have something bigger to add. A friend shares plans to launch a new retail website. It’s tempting to fix the small errors on the page, but perhaps it’s more useful to discuss the product line, the pricing or whether or not it should be online at all… The author shares a draft of a new work. You could help with the grammar, but maybe it would help more if you talked about the parts that weren’t included. The agency shows three versions of a new design they’re considering. Multiple choice might be on offer, but ‘none of the above’ might be a more generous answer. I’m pretty confident that when the Titanic went down, the deck chairs were clean and well-ordered. It’s a shame no one talked about the icebergs. "

And it’s something that three hundred people are building together. But I say “our” because it’s bigger than me or the three hundred of us or even the people who are reading this blog. Like it or not, this is the project of the rest of our days. My publisher announced it this week. You can check it out and pre-order it here.  … the real purpose of this post is to invite you to consider being active in the worldwide launch of The Carbon Almanac this June. If you have the bandwidth to be part of something important, I hope you’ll consider checking it out and join us in this work. You’ll contribute your skills, learn a lot about strategy and tactics and be connected to an extraordinary group that already spans 41 countries. It’s an all-volunteer project for people ready to commit to help make things better. Because it’s not too late.  [We’re not taking new volunteers just now…we’ll update when it reopens.] "
847,Don’t guard your luck,"February 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/dont-guard-your-luck/,"Maybe we don’t want to talk about it. Perhaps we believe that unexamined luck isn’t quite as fragile. Perhaps we don’t want to let anyone else in. It could be that we think that success is scarce, and scarcity will somehow preserve it. Or maybe we want to insist that it’s all due to skill and nothing but skill. Even though we know that this isn’t true. "
848,Open field running,"February 15, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/open-field-running/,"Here’s what’s easy to find: Multiple choice plus effort plus persistence. We’ve been trained since birth to look for small, do-able tasks with boundaries. It seems as though our effort is better spent there, the risk and responsibility are a lot smaller. “Don’t ask me what’s next, tell me what’s next!” As a result, we often default to others when it comes to figuring out the boundaries and ignore the opportunities that are right in front of us. The alternative is to draw the map instead of reading it. Because the willingness to do this is scarce, it’s often valued quite highly. And we can learn to do it better if we practice. "

How would you celebrate it? Who else needs to be part of it? It’s a symbol, a marker, a chance for conversation. It can amplify culture, give you a chance to have a conversation and allow you and the people around you to focus on something for a short while. And it might catch on. This is the way just about every widespread holiday came to be. "
850,The thing about a gold rush,"February 13, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/the-thing-about-a-gold-rush/,"It’s not the “gold.” It’s the “rush” that changes the way people behave. When consumed by a gold rush, people make decisions that they would never make on ordinary days. They trust entities, make assumptions and suspend disbelief. Not because there’s gold on the line, but because everyone else is rushing, and the fear of missing out is significant. Rushing can help us overcome the status quo and our fear of the unknown. It can also lead to choices that hurt us in the long run. We should rush on purpose. It’s a choice. "
851,“We don’t care” (you won’t let us),"February 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/we-dont-care-you-wont-let-us/,"The customer service from the freight shipping company that came to my home a few months ago was truly terrible. Not simply a lack of care, but an aggressive embrace of uncaring. Every interaction was offputting and inefficient. This is the result of sort by price. It turns out that a lot of freight shipping is done through an intermediary. Software automatically scans all available options and picks the cheapest one. Which means that brands don’t matter, customer feedback doesn’t matter and reviews don’t matter. Neither does corporate responsibility or employee satisfaction. All that matters is the price the shipper pays and ultimately the price of the stock. Sort by price insulates the producer from the customer. When we resort to a single metric, we get what we measure, and the side effects pile up. More and more, the choices are, “You’ll get a discount and you will get less than you paid for” and /or “you’ll pay a bit more and you’ll get more than you paid for.” "
852,“We were wrong”,"February 11, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/we-were-wrong/,"Groups rarely say this. They often (and loudly) state “we are right,” but when the future arrives, and it always does, it’s not surprising that it turns out that many projections and predictions turned out to be wrong. When smoking was banned in New York restaurants and bars, the trade associations vehemently protested, insisting that it would doom their businesses. It turned out to be a benefit instead. All we can hope for is for an individual to say, “based on new information, I’ve made a new decision.” While it might be satisfying for a group to publicly acknowledge what they’ve learned, waiting for this is a waste of time and energy. The alternative is to help a person make a new decision instead. "
853,Marked cards,"February 10, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/marked-cards/,"It’s almost impossible to tell if a playing card is marked. But if you take ten cards and riffle them, you can tell instantly. The changes from the back of one card to another jump out at you. It’s difficult to tell where we are if we only have a few data points–sooner or later, anywhere feels normal. The key question is, “compared to what?” On the other hand, if all you’ve got is all you’ve got, comparing it to something else might only create regret. "

Writing an instruction manual, doing a survey, creating a map–they’re all difficult tasks because of the translation that’s required: the person doing the work already knows what they’re trying to teach. But the person interacting with the manual doesn’t. The empathy required here overwhelms many people, regardless of how well-meaning they might be. After all, the person you’re instructing doesn’t know what you know (yet). They might not learn the way you learn. And you might have come to your knowledge via a different path. The three elements of successful instructional design might be: Acknowledge that communicating what you know is difficult. Find empathy for people who don’t know what you know yet. Test the work, often. Humility in design dances with the arrogance of believing we can help other people move forward. "
855,Limitless,"February 8, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/limitless/,"Infinity is a great idea, but unless you’re doing math, it’s mostly an idea. Everything else in our world has limits. It’s the limits that make it interesting, the limits that give us an edge to the box, something to leverage against. Instead of denying the existence of limits and the trade-offs that they bring with them, it might be helpful to begin with an understanding of what they are, or at least what other people think they are. "
856,The stale green light,"February 7, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/the-stale-green-light/,"Coming down the empty road, you can see the light from a ways off. It’s been green for awhile, which means it’s due to turn red soon. Should you speed up, so you can make it through before the yellow appears and is gone… Or should you slow down, so you can safely and gracefully come to a complete stop? It depends. If it’s an actual green light, you should certainly slow down. It’s safer. It won’t take that much time. You have the engine of the car to do the work. But if it’s a metaphorical green light, a window of opportunity, a shift in the culture you can feel disappearing, it might very well pay to speed up. Because that extra effort, done with safety on behalf of those you seek to serve, will compound.  It never pays to wait until a deadline, but when you see the world changing, it might be a good excuse to redouble your efforts. "

Of course, spiders, dogs and walruses prefer if the world doesn’t change. But humans are different. Change is fuel for growth and possibility.

861,The trough of inefficiency,"February 2, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/the-trough-of-inefficiency/,"Successful organizations of just one or two freelancers have very high revenue per employee, effective labor utilization and few communications problems. And significant organizations of a hundred or a thousand people also produce enormous amounts of revenue, profit and perhaps value. In between, though, there’s a slog. That’s because a successful tiny organization that adds people creates communication problems. Instead of each person knowing what to do, they need to meet about it. They also require people to support their people–HR, policies, etc. The trough is characterized by nascent specialization, and if any specialist can’t deliver, the entire entity struggles, because there’s just one specialist for each category. Many mouths to feed, but fewer farmers per capita. In that trough, many small businesses flounder. They had the profit or the investment to grow, but they grew too much or didn’t grow enough. Either way, they’re caught in the trough. The trick is to understand your industry well enough to know where the trough lies. "
862,In temporary residence,"February 1, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/02/in-temporary-residence/,"They will outlast you. Why are some industries so irrational (when seen from the point of view of the customer)? So many things about college, funerals, real estate, hotels, weddings and the contractor trade are frustrating and opaque to customers. It almost seems as though they’re organized with a long-term, industry-wide focus away from customer satisfaction. No one chooses to regularly have a party as expensive, isolating or stressful as a wedding is. We don’t view the pricing or activities of a funeral as natural or affirming. If someone tried to build an institution like college today, there’s no way it would be structured the way it is now. If you think about the rituals of most of these industries, they don’t make sense. That’s because customers come and customers go. Sometimes quite literally, but always.  As a result, the customer is often a first-timer, in need of indoctrination. And the customer has far less power, because they won’t be back again any time soon. In some ways, the connecting power of the internet reinforces this imbalance, allowing industry forces to coordinate and coalesce. But in other ways, each of these industries is open to radical shift because customers can get smarter and coordinate on their part as well. "
863,On schedule,"January 31, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/on-schedule/,"We get a huge benefit from making a simple commitment: Don’t miss deadlines. The benefit is that once we agree to the deadline, we don’t have to worry about it anymore. We don’t have to negotiate, come up with excuses or even stress about it. It won’t ship when it’s perfect. It will ship because we said it would. Once this is clear, the quality of what we ship goes way up. Instead of spending time and energy looking for reasons, excuses or deniability, we simply do the work. And over time, we get better at figuring out which deadlines to promise. Because if we promise, we ship. "

I hand them out like Halloween candy to colleagues, and often, they end up paying them forward as I did.  Authors and ideas for the long haul. Classics in our field, in fact. One is brand new, others I read decades ago. Tom and I have known each other for 39 years… Every one of these authors is the real deal.

866,The asking price,"January 29, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/the-asking-price/,"The asking price is true, but it’s also an illusion. If you are offered a job and negotiate a raise of 10% over what was originally offered, that’s good, but it has nothing at all to do with what you’re actually worth. If you buy a house for 15% over asking price, it doesn’t mean you overpaid. The asking price is a signal, a way to message expectations and begin a negotiation. It’s simply a guess about the future, made by the person who goes first. It can anchor our thinking, but if we’re not careful, it can be an anchor that also drags us down. "

Better to sell your services or your products in a place where you’re the only one. But crowded markets also have lots of customers. A mutual understanding of what’s expected.

These scripts are everywhere. If the ones you have are working for you, you’ve discovered a reliable way to succeed and find satisfaction as you do. But if they’re not, it might pay to spend the energy to approach the next cycle, ‘as if’. The script might not be your fault. It might have taken a really long time to become ingrained. And it might be getting in the way. What if you could leave the script behind, just this one time? It might take a lot of focus and effort, it might be incredibly difficult, but just once might be do-able. The thing that gets us stuck isn’t us. It’s the script that we’ve decided is our only option. Call it out. Realize that it’s not the only option. A script doesn’t always feel like a choice, but until we realize we’re running one, it’s unlikely we can do the hard work it takes to change it. Rewrite the script, rewrite the outcome. "
870,Ostracodish,"January 25, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/ostracodish/,"The ostracod is extinct. Over millions of years, with good reasons at every step, it evolved to become the creature it was.  And when we add up all of those little steps, we end up with a creature that was no longer fit for its environment. Organizations develop like this. So do work practices, cultural systems and “the way we do things around here.” I’m sure there was a really good reason twenty years ago for all the steps that are now involved in the thing you do right now, but your competitor, the one who is starting from scratch, is skipping most of them. Every day we get a new chance to begin again. And if you don’t, someone else will. [Update! I apologize to all fans of the ostracodish. While some types are gone, it is very much not extinct. Which I’m glad about, even if the metaphor isn’t as good.] "
871,Personal velocity,"January 24, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/personal-velocity/,"Why do bikes stay stable when you ride them (and fall down when you stop)? A tiny reason is the gyroscopic stability of the wheels, but the real reason is the forward momentum of the rider. And we learn the first day we’re on the bike that forward motion is essential or we’re in trouble. In our fast-moving world, it’s easy to get hooked on personal velocity. What’s in your inbox? Did someone follow you in the last ten seconds? Where’s the beep and the beep and the beep from your last post? Perhaps we talk faster, interrupt, talk over, invent, dissect, criticize and then move on to the next thing. Boom, boom, boom. Don’t want to fall off the bike. But life isn’t a bike. It works fine if we take a moment and leave space for the person next to us to speak. Are you going fast without getting anywhere? We can get hooked on systems that want us to get hooked, on platforms that use our effort as their product, our emotions as fodder for their next milestone. Doing something new simply because we’re worried that the old thing we were doing a minute ago isn’t fast enough is a waste. The crowd might enjoy it, but in the long run, it diminishes our contributions and our joy. I could just as easily write about the person who is stuck, sitting in the back of the room, the corner of the Zoom, looking for deniability and a place to hide. That person with no velocity has ceased to contribute and might be in as much pain as the person who’s doing nothing but maintaining high personal velocity. Somewhere in between the two, as in most things, is the place we’d like to be. "
872,The control/responsibility matrix,"January 23, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/the-control-responsibility-matrix/,"Alert readers of my last two posts have probably guessed what this one is about. People make choices about their preferences for control and for taking responsibility. When we combine those choices, we end up with a simple matrix. In the top right is an ideal combination. Someone with control and authority who also takes responsibility when things go wrong. This creates a useful feedback loop, because they can actually do something about the problems they caused. In the bottom right is a disaster waiting to happen. This is brittle megalomaniac, Robert Moses, the builder, who spent nearly a century paving New York while neglecting housing and other social justice issues, but never took responsibility for any of the effects of his work. People who grab control and avoid responsibility are often easily identified because they spend a lot of time whining. In the top left corner is someone who truly cares. They bring huge empathy to the situation, and they help people feel seen. Alas, because they don’t have power (either because it’s been denied to them or because they avoid it), their willingness to take responsibility is sort of hollow. This is one reason that frontline workers that are required to exert emotional labor and empathy on the job so often burn out. And finally, in most situations, most people are in the bottom left. The system pushes us to be cogs, to accept what’s given in exchange for being let off the hook and not being held responsible for what happens next.  In many situations, we have the freedom to choose. We can choose a quadrant or we can choose not to participate. And if we’re lucky or care enough, we can choose who to vote for, who to work for and where we’re headed. "
873,Your responsibility preference,"January 22, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/your-responsibility-preference/,"When things go wrong, is your instinct to hide in a corner and hope you won’t get noticed–or to lean into the situation and make it clear that this one is on you? “I’ve got this,” is a phrase that some people will go out of their way to avoid saying. At work, where it’s incredibly valuable, or in personal relationships, where it creates deep connection. The movies are filled with heroes who take responsibility. Organizations are miserly when it comes to handing out authority, but most of them are eager to pay attention (and give respect) to anyone who is willing to take responsibility. Like our control preference, responsibility is a learned skill. You might be born with an instinct for it, but mostly it’s something we’re taught or choose to learn. Sadly, this is a line that’s missing from every resume I’ve ever seen. It seems to be that a bias toward taking responsibility is one of the most important things to look for when hiring an employee, finding a doctor or building a team. [Part 2 of 3] "
874,Your control preference,"January 21, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/your-control-preference/,"Would you rather write the script, read the script, watch the movie or write the review? When someone commutes by train, they’re giving up control over the journey. On one hand, that means that they can’t actively impact how fast the train arrives. On the other hand, it means that they don’t have to be fully present and in command of all the decisions involved. There’s a huge diversity of control preference, and it varies across the many areas of our lives. Perhaps you need to be in control over your work, but have no interest in controlling what you eat for dinner–or vice versa. I remember a restaurant in the Bronx where the waiter would ask you one or two questions about which food you liked, and then walk away and bring you back a series of dishes that you didn’t expect or choose. Some people really enjoy this, others are frustrated by the lack of control it requires. While it may be that each of us has an inherent bias away or toward control, it’s pretty clear that it is also a skill that can be learned, and that different industries allocate control to people as part of their hierarchies. It’s also true that different cultures have evolved to allocate and teach control preference in different ways. Sometimes it’s based on gender and caste, but there are also cultural mores that have been fueled by industry, the patriarchy and governance. One of the things we certainly have control over is deciding whether we’ll seek to spend our days in control or not. We might have to make sacrifices along the way, but the feeling is up to us. [part 1 of a series] "
875,Fear of strangers,"January 20, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/fear-of-strangers/,"Why are we more likely to take off our masks or avoid social distancing with a group of friends at a party instead of strangers on the train? Why do we drive more carefully in a new neighborhood instead of near our home? Why trust the advice of a doctor who looks like us, or went to the same school we did? Our evolved preference for familiarity often backfires. There are many signals that give us useful information about whether a situation is productive or safe. But pre-existing social networks might not be the best one. "
876,The myth about the apples,"January 19, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/the-myth-about-the-apples/,"In settings where sorting is difficult, half a bushel of perfect apples is worth more than a full bushel with a rotten apple in it. One bad apple can spoil a whole bunch. We pay a significant premium for pre-selection, confidence and a guarantee. Sorting adds value. "
877,“The dog ate my homework”,"January 18, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/the-dog-ate-my-homework/,"How did the dog become your teacher’s problem? When we’re actively enrolled in a journey, it’s on us. That’s the requirement once you choose to act professionally. You know the terms, the dates, the structure. It wasn’t even fine print. It’s simply the structure you agreed to be part of. Of course, enrollment is frightening. Because enrollment confers responsibility. “This is something I’m choosing to do.” Compulsory education doesn’t often lead to real learning. That’s because compulsory education is coerced. There’s no active enrollment. For the rest of us, there’s the chance to engage and to move forward. And part of the journey is acknowledging that we have a dog, that life gets in the way, that it’s never the ideal moment or the perfect time. And then doing something about it. Leaping isn’t easy, but it’s far better and safer than the alternative. "
878,“The way things are”,"January 17, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/the-way-things-are/,"That’s how culture perpetuates injustice and indignity. Because that’s just the way things are around here. But the status quo isn’t permanent. The world doesn’t stay the way it was. It changes. And it’s been changing faster than ever. It doesn’t change because the status quo sub-committee had a meeting and decided to change it. It changes when someone decides that the way things are around here needs to change, and simply and bravely begins to do something differently. And then someone else follows along. Yes, it bends toward justice. But only if we help. Only if we lead. "
879,Who’s responsible?,"January 16, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/whos-responsible-2/,Freedom without consequences is a myth. Our actions always have consequences. The question is: who will bear them? 
880,Harsh feedback,"January 15, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/harsh-feedback/,"It often comes from one of two kinds of people: People who give themselves feedback in the same heartless tone. They don’t hesitate to brutally lash out, because that’s the noise they often hear inside. And folks who honestly believe that their work is flawless. They can’t understand how anyone else can fail to measure up, because they never seem to. Of course, each group has a significant (though different) problem. In fact, now that they’re spreading their harshness with others, they have two problems. When in doubt, look for the fear. "
881,Portfolio thinking,"January 14, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/portfolio-thinking/,"When we’re not certain of the right answer, the best approach is to have a portfolio, a range of bets that reward us with resilience and significant upside. An example can be something as simple as what to put on the buffet–if you’re not sure who’s coming to the meeting, it makes sense to have a variety of options, because the chances you’ll get it right go way up. A more important example is in filling a job. If you only interview people from similar backgrounds and with similar skills, you’re eliminating a huge pool of talent that might in fact be a much better fit for the job. The mistake we often make is in building a choice set (which we mistakenly call a ‘portfolio’) by trying again and again for one guaranteed ideal choice. That’s not a portfolio. Instead, we should focus on going to the edges, not trying to group everything at some imaginary ‘center’. Back to the simple buffet example. If you have one spicy dish, one vegan dish, one dish without cilantro and one dish from a cuisine that’s out of the ordinary in this setting, your chances of “best lunch ever” are far higher than if you simply put out very slight variations of one theme. When we can’t be sure of the future, a portfolio that acknowledges this by going to various edges will outperform one where we pretend we know the right answer. "
882,"Harder, easier and more convenient","January 13, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/harder-easier-and-more-convenient/,"Consider the windows on a car. First, they were manually clipped into place. And then they were hand-rolled into position. But that was too difficult. So the electric window was born. But holding your finger on the button for 10 seconds was onerous, so now, it’s automatic. It’s easy to see the trend toward convenience in many areas of our lives. Tim Wu has pointed out that people will trade privacy, money or friendships in exchange for convenience. But… There’s a countertrend. Sourdough is far less convenient than buying a loaf of Wonder bread. Running a marathon is less convenient than driving to wherever it is you’d like to go. And the best programmers still code by hand, even though there are plenty of apps that would make it easier to create average user interactions. The battle for most convenient is fierce. It might be easier to stake out your claim to interactions and products that are less convenient, but worth it. "
883,CB radio,"January 12, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/cb-radio/,"It was huge and kept growing by leaps and bounds. Until it didn’t. (My license was KFV2338, a number I haven’t said out loud in 40 years). CB radio took off because human beings desperately want to connect with people they know and be heard by people they don’t. And then it went away because it was noisy, unfiltered and sort of pointless. We can’t imagine why people were so entranced. Until the next one comes along. "
884,Flow (and progress),"January 11, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/flow-and-progress/,"A flow state is priceless. It happens when we lose ourselves in the work, simply connecting with the task, without commentary or doubt. When we’re in flow, time slows down, satisfaction rises and we feel fully engaged. An easy way to end a flow state is to see how well you’re doing. Are you ahead of the other runners? Are you progressing according to the milestones? Do you have more social metrics now? The irony, of course, is that the best way to make progress is to find flow. But if you’re using progress as a yardstick, it won’t last long. "
885,Dancing with status roles,"January 10, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/dancing-with-status-roles/,"First, we have to see them. Some people, no matter how fast or slow their friends are walking, always walk a step behind. Or perhaps you need to live in the nicest house on the block, or drive the fanciest car. There are people who can’t rest until they know that they’re at the top of their class, or use up their available credit limit, whatever the limit is. Maybe you need to finish everything on your plate, plus your friend’s. Or maybe you always leave something over. The thing is that status roles are always local. We compare ourselves to the others in our circle, not everyone on the planet. If your status narrative isn’t making you happy, you can try to change it–but it’s truly difficult to do so. The get-along person rarely shifts gears and becomes the dominating competitor, or vice versa. An alternative is to do the hard work (but in a brief window) of choosing your circle and setting your limits. If you need to live in the biggest, fanciest house, choose a neighborhood where doing that won’t break everything else in your personal life. If you overtrain to be sure you’re going to win, enter races where the overtraining won’t wipe you out. If you need to avoid the front of the parade, don’t pick an industry or a cultural setting where only the people at the front are treated well. We choose our boundaries rarely, but we have to live with them every day. "
886,Speed limits,"January 9, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/speed-limits/,"The school zone has a speed limit of 15 miles per hour. It’s hard to be opposed to this sort of restriction, because the consequences are so dire and the cost is so low. The driver is making a choice, the kids, not so much. The driver is surrounded by steel and safety devices, the kids, not so much. Living in community is about limits. That’s a foundational feature that permits it to work. They’re all around us, and we only notice them when they change. "
887,Coming soon,"January 8, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/coming-soon/,"The phone is ringing. Your ice cream is melting. Next month’s rent is due.

Your back tooth is going to need a crown in 2030. New York City is going to be underwater in 2050. When is soon? Every one of these things is something we can choose to pay attention to right now. Each one is either urgent or important, it’s up to us. Paying attention to something when the problem is still small makes it far less of an issue later. The ringer on a phone was designed to establish urgency. And social media has optimized for that itch as well. But it’s not up to them. [For your calendars, two updates: I’ll be doing a live event with Chip Conley, bestselling author, impresario and big thinker (and my first co-author, from 1986!) in a live chat (with QA) about jobs, learning, wisdom and making a ruckus. Today! Just hours from now.  All the details are at this LinkedIn post. In addition, I’ll be joining the other Akimbo teachers for an online free-for-all and jamboree on Tuesday, January 11th.

888,Progress,"January 7, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/progress-2/,"Technology is not neutral. It can’t be, because by definition, advances in tech create change, and change always creates positives and negatives. We now live in a time of rapid technological change, perhaps the biggest in 150 years. In the face of the overwhelming impact of tech, we might not be enjoying the ride. Sometimes the problem is the tech itself, and sometimes it’s about our fear of change and unknown. It’s worth taking a moment to think about which technology we’d rather live without–in other words, when was the golden age that we’re nostalgic for, the one that technology has tarnished in the name of progress? They’re not in a perfect order, but if you had to draw the line, where and when would you put it?

889,Shipping creative work,"January 6, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/shipping-creative-work-3/,"This is not the same as being creative. In fact, they’re very different skills and emotional mindsets. All humans are creative. Sometimes. Creativity is a special sort of internal conversation, an opportunity to see a problem or a situation and then produce something that dances with it. But shipping creative work is a cultural and professional risk. One way to confirm this is to see how different something feels when it’s truly anonymous. If it doesn’t matter to you whether the work resonates with someone else, if there’s no way to tell and no feedback of any kind, then it’s far less fraught. Realizing that there are two things at work here–the willingness to lean into problem solving AND the willingness to share it–it’s possible to focus on the part that’s holding you back. "
890,Laser noise,"January 5, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/laser-noise/,"Laser guns don’t make noise. At least in real life. In the movies, they always do. Phasers and ray guns and light sabers all manage to make distinctive sounds. And we don’t mind. In fact, we expect them to. The foley artist works overtime to create sounds that amplify our experience and fill in the gaps–because the experience is the point. Does your project have a foley artist? Because it certainly has gaps. "
891,Defensive/offensive/actual,"January 4, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/defensive-offensive-actual/,"The problem with becoming defensive is that our internal narrative gets in the way of expressing what’s actually going on. Because we’re imagining all the blame and shame and scorn that the other person may or may not be feeling toward us, we bring those feelings into our words and actions, and end up making a mess. And the problem with being offensive is that the person we’re offending can no longer hear what we’re saying. Communication lives between the two. We do best when we can describe the actual, the same way we might talk about the weather. Here is what is. Simply that. "
892,Generative hobbies,"January 3, 2022",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2022/01/generative-hobbies/,"Some people say “hobby” like it’s a bad thing. In a race for more, it seems as though doing something you don’t get paid for, something that requires patience and skill–well, some people don’t get it. They’d rather troll around on social media or watch a rerun. A generation or two ago, hobbies were things like paint by number or candlemaking, or perhaps a woodshop. That’s changing. Not simply because computers allow us to be far more professional, but because the very nature of the output is different. This might be the golden age for a new kind of hobby, one that’s about community, leadership and producing public goods, not private ones. Because it’s so much easier to connect and because ideas multiply, the generative hobby gives us a chance to make a contribution, even (especially) when we’re not at work. Sharing ideas, leading, connecting… Wikipedia is the result of 5,000 people working together to produce a resource that’s used by a billion people. The people who have contributed the most don’t work there, they work on it. Jeff Atwood is transforming a long-lost and influential book into a modern tool for a new generation. Github is a professional tool, but it’s also become a clearinghouse for projects that simply exist to make things better. It’s magical when it works. I’ve spent the last three months working with a cadre of people on a community project, and it’s been a highlight of my career. Perhaps “generative contribution” is a better name for it. But I’m all for reclaiming “hobby,” because the way we spend our time is the way we spend our lives. "

You can hire folks. You can use mailmerge. You can even send it to voice mail. But all of these time shortcuts fail to express the thing we want the most. Your time, my time, their time–we all get the same number of minutes per day.  If you spend them on someone, they can tell. "

You’ll never be able to keep all the promises. It can’t last forever. We’re all going to die. It’s not perfect. Someone might steal your idea. There will be critics. You’re not ready. Someone else is going to do it. It’s not that important. It might not work. On the other hand… Now is better than later, and perfect is an illusion.  Act as if. Simply begin.

896,Which errors to focus on?,"December 30, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/the-things-to-feel-terrible-about/,"So many missed opportunities. Decisions not made, errors in judgment, opportunities lost. Perhaps you didn’t buy Google stock at $80, didn’t buy ETH at $5, didn’t buy that winning lottery ticket… You also didn’t take that course in college, or go out of your way to meet that person on campus or learn Spanish when you had the chance. But most of the time, those aren’t the things we’re obsessed about. Instead of these huge opportunities not seen, we think about the near misses, the ones we had some sort of proximity to. As if the emotional proximity to a choice is the thing to feel badly about. So, instead of thinking of the $10,000 we didn’t make by buying a certain equity, we think about the $10 we affirmatively lost by leaving it on a counter. Instead of thinking about a breakthrough paper we didn’t write, we worry about a typo we made in a brief years ago. One is thousands of times more expensive than the other, and the amount of effort in each is the same, but our minds focus on the one where we feel like we had more responsibility. Which causes us to focus even more on the wrong sort of decision in the future. The roads not seen almost always matter more than the potholes we hit along the way. "
897,The two choices for anyone with a new idea,"December 29, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/the-two-choices-for-anyone-with-a-new-idea/,"“It’s simple.” “It’s complicated.” When you talk to someone about your new idea, they’re going to realize right away that it’s one or the other. The trap is trying to pitch a complicated cultural shift, possibility or project as if it’s simple. Darwin’s insight about how the world evolved is simple once you understand it, but it represents such a conceptual leap that bringing it to someone who’s looking for a simple and easy explanation is sure to fail. But if you invite someone along for a journey instead of a quick fix, you earn the right to take your time and tell your story. Some non-profits are simple, “there’s an earthquake, and these people need food right now.” Some are complicated, “we can create a significant, permanent change in the culture by treating people with dignity so that they can live fuller, more complete lives.” The simple/complex trap often confuses well-meaning people in politics, business and the arts. The solution isn’t to dumb down the complex. The solution is to invite the right people along on the journey. "
898,Choice vs. convenience,"December 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/choice-vs-convenience/,"You have more than a billion choices online. With just a few clicks, you could be just about anywhere. Thanks for reading this today. What did you have for lunch yesterday? Of all the lunches in all your possible universes, was it your first choice? Best choice? When someone tries to take our freedom of choice away, it’s a problem. And yet… We have far more choices than we realize. In school, we’re bound by the course catalog, the schedule and the requirements of a degree, but even there, we had more freedom than we imagined. The organizations we could have started, the projects we could have launched, the people we could have connected… It’s convenience that holds us back. And it comes in many forms. Social convenience: it’s easier to sit through a boring cocktail party or a meeting than it is to tell someone you don’t want to come. Physical convenience: things that are handy are much more likely to be chosen than ones that require us to move somewhere to go get them. Intellectual convenience: change makes us uncomfortable. Sunk costs are hard to ignore. Possibility comes with agency, and agency comes with risk. Financial convenience: if it’s cheaper in the short run, we’re more likely to choose it, even if it costs satisfaction, opportunity or cash in the long run. Cultural convenience: A combination of all of these, because culture likes the status quo and reminds of this regularly. If we ever saw precisely how much freedom of choice we have if we were willing to sacrifice convenience for it, we’d be paralyzed. But if the choices we’re making now aren’t helping us live the way we choose, it might be worth taking a hard look at why. [PS Thanks for reading this on the slowest week of the year. If you’re up for an inconvenient choice, I’ve created a coupon for my Udemy lectures on learning so it only costs half the usual amount for the next few days.

899,Best behavior,"December 27, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/best-behavior/,"If we’re new to a situation, or feeling unsure, we pay careful attention. We’re closely examining how others feel, what the cultural norms are, and what impact we’re seeking to make. On the other hand, sometimes we fail to be on our best behavior. That’s another way of describing impulsive selfishness. The surprising thing isn’t that being on our best behavior makes things go more smoothly. No, for many of us, the surprise is that it actually makes the experience better for us, not just the other folks. "

901,Lead by leading,"December 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/lead-by-leading/,"Managers have to wait for permission, because management requires authority. But in every area of our lives, if we choose to lead, we can lead. Simply by beginning. It might be that few will choose to follow, but then we can learn to get better at leading. First we begin. "
902,Value capture (and the minibar),"December 24, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/value-capture-and-the-minibar/,"No one freely buys anything unless it’s worth more than it costs. And so, in a competitive market, organizations will compete to capture as little value as they can afford to, offering the most surplus to the customer, because that’s how they can grow and thrive. And monopolies (and organizations that would like to profit as they do) work to create situations where the customer has no real options, so they can capture almost all the value that’s created. That’s why nuts at the minibar cost so much. The goal is to price them a penny less than they’re worth to the traveler in that moment. Value creation is a worthwhile goal. Capturing all of that value might not be. "
903,What did you expect?,"December 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/what-did-you-expect-2/,"If you open a roadside motel, expect that tired and demanding budget travelers will arrive. If you run a fancy restaurant, don’t be surprised if people will angle and cajole and lie to get a ‘better’ table. If you hustle to get market share, you’ll probably end up with customers who insist on ever more hustle and trickery to stay with you. If you decide to become a coach, realize that most of your prospects will be people who don’t think they need a coach. (Because the people who want and need a coach already have one). If you attract new freelance business by being the cheapest, I’m betting that your customers will give you a hard time about your rates. If you’re a mental health professional, expect that the people you encounter will have issues with their mental health. Sometimes, things work the way they are supposed to, even if it’s not what we might want in the moment. "
904,The problems with churlishness,"December 22, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/the-problems-with-churlishness/,"Sometimes, people with every advantage act as if they don’t have what they deserve. They’re ungracious, unkind and even vulgar about it. The first problem is that it earns them little in the way of sympathy or kindness from people who believe that they ought to be behaving better. And the second problem is that the person who’s acting churlish knows that they have little reason to take umbrage and that makes it even harder to feel better. When we feel like a churl, the best path could be to head for gracious humility and kindness instead. It might not work, but it works better than any other option. "
905,Intricate systems,"December 21, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/intricate-systems/,"Over time, every system becomes increasingly complex. That’s because in order to make it better, we tweak it. We add exceptions. We do things that are urgent, essential or smart for a particular use case. We learn from what’s broken and we fix that broken spot. New projects can’t possibly be as intricate as old ones. And so the campus at Oxford is going to be very different than a vocational school in a new building. When we start a new system, it doesn’t pay to comment on the lack of patina, elegance or special case handling. Of course a new system can’t do any of those things. The part that’s worth noticing is the efficiency and design of the structure itself. Is it extensible? How will it respond to the need to become more customized, resilient or user friendly? A clean sheet of paper is a wonderful sight, but it’s not nearly as useful as a dog-eared notebook. The only way to get to a dog-eared bit of utility, though, is to start with something fresh. "
906,When the future arrives,"December 20, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/when-the-future-arrives/,"It used to be easy to put off the future until after you retired or died. We could live with the world we had long enough to avoid dealing with significant cultural or technical change. Sure, teenagers might listen to loud music or have long hair, but that didn’t mean you had to. And there were parts of the world where the future would arrive five years after it had reached California or Kenya. Plenty of time to prepare. But now, thanks to the network and to wired culture, that insulation is gone. The future is here. It’s not going away. And a new future is going to be here tomorrow. "
907,Cobbled together,"December 19, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/cobbled-together/,"I knew someone who bought skis to match their outfit–the entire set was coordinated, and it ended up being used once or twice.  And when you register for an old-fashioned wedding, they might try to persuade you to make sure your plates match your furniture… For everything else, the coordination of a matched set is almost always replaced by the utility of things cobbled together over time. Our career doesn’t follow a perfect arc. The font on the website doesn’t match the one on the package. The management team doesn’t look precisely like the stock photos would have us believe. It turns out that acute angles, rough edges and the imperfect matches of diversity actually make things work better. Especially when we’re dealing with humans. "
908,All the stuff,"December 18, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/all-the-stuff/,Markets often persuade us that we don’t have enough. Communities remind us that we do. 
909,Novacula Occami,"December 17, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/novacula-occami/,"Ockham’s razor is really useful: Generally, the simple explanation is the most likely to be true. Don’t invent complicating factors when none are necessary. “It’s simple” is probably correct when describing how any individual mechanism works. [For example, UFOs are unlikely to be piloted by aliens from light-years away, who just happened to show up in that period in between our invention of airplanes and the widespread use of digital cameras. It’s far more likely that they’re simply unexpected events that we turn into complicated stories.] On the other hand, systems–where there are multiple mechanisms at work–are almost never simple. In those cases, it might be more useful to understand that, “it’s complicated.” When an unexpected event occurs, we look for stories, coincidences, supernatural causes and other forms of solace to explain something that frightens or surprises us. But unexpected events are usually caused by simple mechanisms. How we react and respond to these events as a culture, on the other hand, is complicated indeed. "
910,And when is the shift over?,"December 16, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/and-when-is-the-shift-over/,"If you sell your time as the measure of the work you do, the work is over when the shift ends. Clock in, clock out. If you sell your output as the measure of the work, your work is over when the inbox is empty. Once you’ve made all the pizzas that were ordered, you’re done. But more and more, our work can be endless. One more sales call might lead to one more sale. One more cycle of innovation might lead to the breakthrough we’ve been looking for. One more post might get you the traffic you’re on the hook for. In a competitive marketplace, self-regulating the length of our shift is a lot to ask. Given that the list of things to do is intentionally endless, it’s on each of us to decide what ‘enough’ looks like. Because more time isn’t always the answer. "
911,Blaming the weather is a trap,"December 15, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/blaming-the-weather-is-a-trap/,"“If it were only nicer out, I’d be happier.” That’s just a step away from, “If the current world crisis would abate, then I’d be able to concentrate.” Which is not that far from, “If you would simply behave, I wouldn’t be upset.” When we focus on external forces and tie them directly to our state of mind, we’re giving up agency. The hard-won privilege of being in control of our own status and peace of mind. Without a doubt, there are situations that are unfair, abusive or dangerous. And we should work to fix them or walk away if we possibly can. However, we don’t have to link these external forces to the way we choose to talk to ourselves. We can decide to claim possibility and take action instead. Roz Zander teaches us to avoid, “I’m on vacation but it’s raining.” It’s far more powerful and useful to think, “I’m on vacation and it’s raining… what should I do with this moment?” The story we tell ourselves belongs to us and only us. It’s entirely possible that someone selfishly or thoughtlessly put a story there. It’s possible that there isn’t enough empathy or fairness or opportunity. But once we see that we’re able to own our story, we gain a huge amount of power. And we retain that power for as long as we refuse to hand it over to someone else. If the blame and the anger isn’t going to change the situation, better to reclaim our agency instead. "
912,Akimbo updates,"December 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/akimbo-updates/,"Alert readers know that about a year ago, the Akimbo Workshops became an independent B corp, owned and run by the team that I worked with for years. They’ve been doing great work, and tens of thousands of people have benefited from the extraordinary learning that happens when you’re part of a committed cohort. I’m thrilled that Bernadette Jiwa, Alex DiPalma, Ramon Ray, Kristin Hatcher and Margo Aaron run workshops with them as well. I’ll be joining the other teachers for an online free-for-all and jamboree on January 11th. Hosted by Ramon Ray, I’m looking forward to joining my friends online. I hope you can come. It’s free and you can sign up for it here. All of the workshops Akimbo offers will launch at the same time next month. If you’re interested in beginning the new year with more energy and insight, I hope you’ll check them out. You can see the details and choose the one that works for you right here. And of course, the altMBA, flagship of Akimbo, continues to establish the foundation for a new crop of leaders. Their first session begins soon, the next application deadline is January 4, and you can find the details here as well. In addition, I’ll be doing a live event with Chip Conley, bestselling author, impresario and big thinker (and my first co-author, from 1986!) in a live chat (with QA) about the Modern Elder Academy on January 8th. I’ll post the details here in a few weeks. (And, to confuse things, my podcast is also called Akimbo, and we just passed 200 episodes. You can find show notes and subscribe here.) "
913,Write a better spec,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/write-a-better-spec/,"If you’re asking someone to work for you, help you or advise you, it turns out that being specific about what success looks like is an obvious way to get better results. If everyone can agree on what success looks like, you’re more likely to achieve it. And yet… And yet we prefer to say, “I’ll know it when I see it.” We’re vague, murky or even contradictory about what we want. The reason is simple: If you write a great spec, we get to blame you if it doesn’t work out. The vagueness is a way to hide. If you don’t know what you want now, what makes you think you’ll know what you want later? On the hook. That’s the most effective place to be. "
914,Someone to take care of it,"December 13, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/someone-to-take-care-of-it/,"“If I could just find someone to handle all the sales, I could get back to work.” “Do you know someone who can do all of the investments, accounting, taxes and strategies around money?” “Why do I have to spend time managing people, I want to get back to creating.” I hear this from busy creative entrepreneurs, soloists and creators often. If someone who cared as much as they did, but was focused and good at something like accounting or sales or management could just join in, life would be so much better. A consigliere! A proven partner who is not only trustworthy and skilled, but works cheap and is available to work at the scale of a small team’s operations. Someone able to work full time, or at least focus their full energy, the way you do. Well, when you put it that way, it’s pretty clear why this is a tough role to fill. If that superstar salesperson is so good, why on Earth would they want to drop everything and work to build your fledgling operation? Part of being a superstar salesperson is being smart about what you sell–and most of the time, that means picking things that are easier, more obvious and at a larger scale. The same goes for the money folks. Money is money, and if you’re good at managing it, managing more of it is probably on your agenda. There are two takeaways from these sobering truths: "
915,Secret conspiracies and public systems,"December 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/secret-conspiracies-and-public-systems/,"It’s tempting to believe that powerful people and organizations are conspiring in secret to cause mysterious or unfair events to occur. The conspiracies supposedly involve dozens of people working across many time zones in complete secrecy. That’s unlikely. Unlikely because cooperation of this sort is hard to find, especially among the powerful, and because it’s essentially impossible to keep it a secret. What’s actually happening, right in front of us, all the time, is that systems are causing uncoordinated actions to occur. When banks, for example, create a cycle of more debt and higher interest rates for students, they didn’t need to have a secret meeting to pull that off. All they did was act within the system that they’ve built for themselves. When companies race offshore to pay ever less in taxes, no one coordinated that. It was a ratchet, a system that rewarded a race to the bottom. And even though the NCAA is an organized entity, it’s the system that has driven up the pay of college head coaches, not a secret conspiracy.  If we’d like the world to work better, more fairly and with more of a long-term view, we have to identify the systems that push participants to do the opposite. And then we need to consistently and persistently work to change the incentives that cause the entities in those systems to act the way they do. "
916,Cultural half-life,"December 11, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/cultural-half-life/,"Things decay. We know precisely how many yoctoseconds it takes for half of a given amount of Hydrogen-7 to transform into ordinary hydrogen. And we know how old old things are because Carbon-14 loses half its mass every 5,700 years.  But ideas and cultural impact have a half-life as well. Einstein wrote a paper 120 years ago that is still being discussed. It certainly had more of a cultural/scientific impact when it first arrived, but it lasted.  To Kill a Mockingbird has more cultural relevance today than a bestseller like The Bridges of Madison County, even though both were bestsellers at their peak. There are ten-year-old posts on this blog that still get a lot of traffic, and ones from a few weeks ago that are unlikely to be seen much in the future. When marketers or leaders or artists show up to the culture with an idea, the immediate goal is to find traction and to change things. But the choice of medium, message and persistence have a lot to do with how long that impact will last. Of the half a billion tweets that are tweeted every day on Twitter, perhaps a handful have a half-life of a year or more. Most fade away in a few yoctoseconds. On the other hand, a peer-reviewed scientific paper probably has a higher average half-life. Darwin is still going strong. Over the last few decades, there’s been a relentless move toward the yoctosecond–more ideas, lasting a shorter and shorter amount of time. I’m not sure that we benefit from that, and if there’s a mismatch between how much work and focus an idea requires and its half-life, you’re likely to be disappointed. Plan accordingly. "
917,The Wizard and the Prophet,"December 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/the-wizard-and-the-prophet/,"This is my book of the year. It delivers on so many things that we want a book to do–it could never be replicated by a website or even a film. The audiobook is even better… It’s engaging, powerful and resonates really deeply. Mann has given us a deeply researched narrative, a book that will change the way you see just about everything in the natural world and its relationship with humanity. It’s about an epic struggle and mostly, about our future. It seems to be about two obscure characters of the 20th century, but it’s not. It’s about each of us and the tools we can choose to bring with us to the future. I found myself switching camps every few minutes. I am taking notes on every page, and I mention the book in most of the conversations I have. Definitely a fine use of your time and attention. I’m glad books like this persist in a world that’s in too much of a hurry to get the tldr. "
918,Do you have a tuner?,"December 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/do-you-have-a-tuner/,"Piano tuners have a vital job… and very few pianists do that work themselves. Who maintains your tools? Perhaps it’s a computer with all the software that goes with it. Do you have a world-class pro, someone who is up-to-date, skilled, innovative and empathic making sure that they’re working well? Or are you doing it yourself, muddling through? If we have mediocre tools, why should we expect great work? Or perhaps it’s not the software or the hardware that needs tuning. Perhaps it’s our attitude, our approach to work, the way we deal with possibility… A self-representing lawyer might have a fool for a client, but the rest of us are probably suffering from tools that aren’t what they could be.

919,Accuracy and precision,"December 8, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/accuracy-and-precision/,"They’re not the same. Precision brings granularity to measurement. You can drive around 50 miles an hour, or you can drive 54.7 miles an hour with precision. But accuracy is how we describe doing what we intended to do. Driving in the wrong direction with precision isn’t much help, when accuracy in describing the goal would have been a better plan. Most organizations spend their time on meetings about precision, instead of taking a few cycles to choose to be accurate instead. "

921,The pyramid of modern marketing,"December 6, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/the-pyramid-of-modern-marketing/,"In most pyramids, the top gets all the attention, but it’s the foundation that truly matters. Marketing is no exception. The base of the pyramid, the most important layer, is INTENTION. What change are you seeking to make? Does the team have clarity, measurements and resources to prioritize this? Intention comes with design thinking. Who’s it for and what’s it for? Have you identified the smallest viable audience and built a product and created and designed a service infrastructure around it that works beautifully for this audience? Your story is intricately linked with your intention. If you don’t know who it’s for and what it’s for, the story can’t resonate. A story doesn’t work when it’s your story. It works when it becomes their story. Then comes RETENTION. Because existing customers are worth far more than new ones. If you are constantly losing the folks you worked so hard to attract, you’ll have to work even harder to find people to replace the ones who just left. And then comes REMARKABILITY. The conversations that happen as the result of your work. The network effect is the most powerful force for growth that most organizations ever encounter, but people aren’t going to talk about your work unless they believe it will help their goals to do so. If you’re fortunate and focused, retention and remarkability will earn you PERMISSION. The privilege of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to the people who want to get them. This is the asset of the future, because building and maintaining teams to spam the world is exhausting. And then, only then, do you have the ability to focus on tactics, words and images. What’s the narrative that engages with people eager to join you on this journey? Where is their status? What sort of affiliation do they seek? Finally, in tiny print, hardly worth mentioning, are hype and hustle and the rest. Ignore them if you can. By volume, by priority, by effectiveness, this is nearly worthless noise, despite the fact that it gets so much attention from pundits who have rarely successfully marketed much of anything. "
922,Perhaps it’s worth throwing it out today,"December 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/just-throw-out-the-key/,"If you’re considering putting an unmarked key into a drawer filled with keys, you’re better off simply throwing it out instead.  Not only won’t you be able to find that unmarked key when you need it, but you’ve just made it more difficult to sort the other keys as well. We hesitate to embrace or announce failure right now, preferring to put it off to some indeterminate date in the future. But postponing the announcement isn’t the same as not failing. It simply makes things worse later. And being clear about the failure we’re about to cause someday makes it more likely we’ll do the work to avoid it. If you don’t have time to do it right, you’re unlikely to have time to do it over. No sense wasting tomorrow as well. "
923,UYBJ,"December 4, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/uybj/,This is an absolutely terrible acronym for a really important idea. Use Your Best Judgment. Don’t wait for someone else to take responsibility. Don’t wait for perfect. Don’t wait to find this exact situation in the manual or in history.  Use your best judgment. My preferred abbreviation is: Go go go. Not with a guarantee. Not with someone to blame. Simply because we need you to lead us. 
924,Do you feel rich?,"December 3, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/do-you-feel-rich/,"It’s not the same as being rich. Rich is always relative. Compared to your great-grandparents, we’re impossibly, supernaturally rich. We have access to information and technology that was unimagined a century ago. At the same time, compared to someone ten miles away or ten years in the future, we’re way behind. Two people with precisely the same resources and options might answer the question of ‘rich’ completely differently. Because money is a story. The neighborhood or industry or peer group you choose has a lot to do with whether you’re relatively rich or not. After a stock market adjustment, billionaires give less to charity. They still have more money than they can count, but they’re not as rich as they used to be, and not-as-rich is easy to interpret as not rich. Which means that for many people, feeling rich is a choice. If that choice encourages us to be imperious, selfish and a bully, it’s probably best to avoid it. On the other hand, if choosing to see our choices, chances and privileges as a path toward generosity, long-term thinking and connection, then we can do it right now. "
925,Customer service is free,"December 2, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/customer-service-is-free-2/,"Most large organizations would disagree. They hire cheap labor to answer the phone. They install recordings to mollify people who are on hold for hours. They measure the cost of the call center and put loopholes in the warranty.  When you see customer service as a cost center, all of these steps make sense. Any money spent lowering costs seems to raise profits. But customer service is actually a profit center, for four reasons: First, because the customer who calls you or shows up at the adjustments window is fully enrolled. Unlike just about every other moment you’ve had with them, in this moment, they are paying attention, leaning into the situation and on high alert. Everything you do here, unlike just about every other marketing interaction you have, will go on your permanent record. Second, because your competitors have foolishly decided to treat this interaction as a cost, the chances that you can dramatically overdeliver are pretty good. You can’t make a car that’s ten times better, but you can easily produce customer service for your car customers that’s ten times better than what most manufacturers deliver. And third, because in our industrialized economy, people love to tell stories about service. And so the word spreads (or doesn’t) based on what you’re about to do. Finally, it’s been demonstrated again and again that the most valuable customers are the loyal ones. While your promotional team is out there making noise to get you new customers, you’d be much better off turning your existing customers into repeat customers and ambassadors. And so, the money you spend on customer service isn’t simply free. It actually repays you many times over. "
926,Chief Apology Officer,"December 1, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/12/chief-apology-officer/,"Companies are discovering that hiring people to mollify critics and disappointed customers is cheaper (in the short run) than changing things, learning from the feedback or even wasting the time of people who do the ‘real work.’ The CAO doesn’t participate in tactical or strategic discussions, and probably can’t explain the dynamics that led to a given policy, or why it’s difficult to change. That’s not their job. Their job is to make the customer or critic feel heard enough that they’ll accept the status quo without further fuss. This is the tech support person who’s not allowed to acknowledge that the software has a bug, or the gate agent who is unable to report to the home office that the scheduling system is causing real problems for loyal customers. In addition to eating away at the mollifier’s well-being, the work of the Chief Apology Officer is also ultimately doomed. By insulating the industrial system from the feedback loop that would improve it, these organizations doom themselves to a slow fade.  “Do you have any influence on how the organization is going to respond to this?” is a fair question. And the CAO can only honestly answer, “no.”  It’s a tough gig. "
927,The lifeguard hack,"November 30, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-lifeguard-hack/,"Who am I to walk up to someone at a party and introduce myself? Who are you to start a new project? Who are they to give a talk on the main stage? Don’t raise your hand–someone else might have a better question. Don’t ship that work, it’s not ready… There are endless excuses, comparisons and reasons to hold back. Unless… Unless you’re on lifeguard duty and someone is drowning. In that situation, even if you’re not the best lifeguard in the world, and even if the water isn’t the perfect temperature, and even if you don’t quite remember how to do the latest version of the cross-chest carry… you jump in the water. Because it’s not for you. It’s for them. Generosity unlocks doors inside of us. "
928,The oracle,"November 29, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-oracle/,"Resistance often shows up insisting that it can predict the future. The voice in our head, the one that knows everything, also knows that you will be rejected, that the work will be misunderstood, that you’ll end up shamed. Not just the voice, but the circle around us can do this as well if we choose to listen. Wearing the hat of the ardent supporter, they will try to protect you by predicting the demise of that next thing you were pinning your hopes on. And it’s easy (and tempting) to give them credit for soothsaying because they know so many other things. They (“we” if we count the voice) know all about the failures and disappointments of the past. They know all about the hard work and all about how others have stumbled. And so, of course, they must also know about the future. A lesson from a koan is really valuable here. Voices that purport to know the future–whether they are psychics, astrologers, family or the noise in our head–are pretty effective when it’s vague enough, but terrible when it comes to specifics. That’s because when it’s vague, we complete the story on our own, creating our own fact patterns after things happen. The simple question to ask the oracle is: I have a handful of beans. How many are there? As much as we might want an oracle, there aren’t any. What we need, it turns out, are supporters who trust us and have our back. "
929,A Scrabble hack,"November 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/a-scrabble-hack/,"It’s definitely a regular pastime of mine, and one of my favorite games. I usually play solo with the Word Master app. The structure of the game rewards knowledge of really short words like qi and aa, but the exciting part happens when you find a seven-letter word… The hack that would work if you’re playing in real life, with other people and actual tiles: On every turn, each player is allowed to turn one of the letters in their rack over and treat it as a blank, which could be any letter of the alphabet. Suddenly, possibilities multiply! The number of 7 letter bingo words explodes. Instead of wrestling with 7 dependent variables, you have 6 and a wildcard. The metaphor, as you’ve already guessed, is that every day we may have a chance to turn over one of our ‘letters’ and make it into something else, if we are brave enough. "

The teacher is doing the best they can. But the principal and the board and the regents and the parents… The board member got elected with great intentions. But the state and the unions and the parents… The textbook publishers want to do better, but the boards and… You get the idea. The circumstances conspire to put us under them. The option is to start small, as small as possible. Small enough to work, big enough to put you on the hook. Build something that works.

It’s pretty clear to me that our speaking voice is not the result of the inevitable physical evolution of our vocal cords. It’s something our brain figured out how to do with the part of our body that keeps us alive by breathing. And because it’s a late addition, there are a bunch of kinks in the system. Talking while breathing is the beginning of the challenge. But it’s also worth noting that the entire process is in the middle of a huge number of sensitive muscles and nerves. This means that when we’re talking (calling attention to ourselves) we’re also trying to keep all of that stress at bay. Add microphones, Zoom, and the high-stakes world of being seen, and you can start to understand why it’s so easy to get hoarse, to sound like someone you’re not, to develop tics, to amplify your stress, and a whole host of other challenges. If you don’t sound like you, it might simply be because your brain is sabotaging the thing you’re trying to say. I used to riff about “no one gets talker’s block” but now I’m not so sure. I think most of us do. If you’ve experienced any of this, I encourage you to find a good voice coach. Not because you’re some fancy keynote speaker about to go on the TED stage. Simply because you have something to say and it would be nice to be able to say it without pain. It’s easier than ever to have a few sessions remotely, and many people I know have found it life-changing. You can find someone nearby or even watch some videos to get started. The world needs to hear from you. "
932,So many accidents,"November 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/so-many-accidents/,"The ones we notice are the negative ones. The time we slipped and hurt our knee, or the lingering illness that won’t go away. The gig we didn’t get, or the friend who is afraid or lonely. But we’re surrounded by positive accidents as well, too many to mention. And often, we forget to mention them. To be born when and where we were. To have people who give us the benefit of the doubt. To have a chance to read and to speak and to connect. To be surrounded by opportunities that others never even dreamed of. And then, given those opportunities, the efforts expended and the care extended. The belief we have in others, the smile we offer or the contributions we make. All toward community and possibility. I heard from two of my oldest friends yesterday, as well as from a dozen new ones. I met each of them accidentally. Every event opens the door for another one. So many things to be thankful for. Accidents included. PS anywhere in the world, feel free to check out The Thanksgiving Reader. "
933,Books unread,"November 24, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/books-unread/,"I was sitting in a friend’s study the other day, and noticed that he had hundreds of books I’d never read. Each was written, perhaps over the course of a year (or a decade), by a smart, passionate person with something to share. All of that focus and insight, generously shared with anyone who wants to take the time. It reminded me of how much is out there, just waiting for us to explore and understand. We have a chance to learn and move forward if we care to. "
934,Marketing as a service,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/marketing-as-a-service/,"Some folks think of marketing as something that is done to people. A hustle, a hype, a stealing of attention. We need a name for that, but I don’t think that’s marketing. On the other hand, calling dinner, “cold dead fish on rice,” while accurate, doesn’t really help people enjoy their sushi. Human beings aren’t information processing machines. We’re not hyper-rational or predictable. Instead, we find joy and possibility in stories, in connection and yes, in tension and status roles as well. When you care enough to see your audience with empathy, you’ll realize that they’re not happier if you simply recite a list of facts. Almost everything we engage with is a placebo at some level, and bringing a human-friendly story to the interaction is a way to serve people. We need to not only have the ability to imagine what others see, we have to have the guts to go where they are and talk with them on their terms. This means that we’re willing to be wrong on our way to being useful. We need to make assertions and show up with consistency, making promises and keeping them. Promises not just about the atomic weight of nitrogen, but about experiences and expectations that are sometimes hard to pin down.  Don’t make something that you would buy. Make something that they would buy. "
935,A freelancer’s dilemma,"November 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/a-freelancers-dilemma/,"What do you own?What are you really good at?What do you enjoy? Engaging with the marketplace requires creating value for people who have a choice. And deciding what to offer your customers is your choice. If you own something (a patent, a building, a process, a set of relationships) you can create more value than if you simply start over with new work each time. If you are really good at something, having amassed skills and a reputation, it’s more likely that you will earn the benefit of the doubt and more easily create value. And if you focus on being on the hook for work you actually enjoy, your days are better and it’s easier to do great work. The freelancer’s dilemma is to figure out what to say instead of, “you can pick anyone and I’m anyone.” And the entrepreneur’s job is to build enough assets that each transaction gets easier and more profitable. It begins by being clear about what you own, what you’re good at it and what gives you satisfaction. "
936,Aimless clicking,"November 22, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/aimless-clicking/,"Wandering around in a digital swamp is a pretty common way to spend an hour these days. Alas, most of us would never consider doing this in a forest. Walking over to a tree because it looked sort of interesting, standing there for a minute, then wandering away. Tree after tree, for hours. The thing is, the digital wandering is mostly a waste. It doesn’t free our imagination, it stifles it. It’s as if this digital version of a tree has making us stressed out as a goal… The next time we consider wasting an afternoon clicking on whatever baits us, perhaps it might make sense going for a walk instead. "
937,The right tool for the job,"November 21, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-right-tool-for-the-job/,"It’s almost a cliche among woodworkers and others that create with their hands. The difference between the right tool and the wrong one is time, money and safety. The satisfaction of having an appropriate lever for your effort is extraordinary. Watching people wrestling with their phones or their laptops is sad and frustrating. People continue to use the wrong tools. Perhaps they were the ones they learned a long time ago. Perhaps they came free with the device. More likely, they’re the result of a software company pushing forward an agenda that doesn’t take the user’s needs into account. There’s probably a better digital tool for the thing you’re trying to do next online. It might be worth a few cycles to ask and discover and learn. Invest once, benefit for a very long time. "
938,The expertise gap,"November 20, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-expertise-gap/,"Just about everyone knows how to drive a car. Very few of us know how to build one. For almost all of history, expertise wasn’t really a factor. If you were raised with the other hunter-gatherers, you were pretty good (good enough) at building a fire, maintaining a hut, hunting and gathering… But as we built more complex devices, expertise started to arrive. You could tell people that you knew how to sail a boat (or build one), but it was pretty easy to separate those who had hard-won experience and expertise from the others. Either the boat reached the port or it didn’t. The one thing that everyone is the world’s expert on is their own feelings. In just about every other area that we value, though, there are people with proven expertise, who can show their work, understand the state of the art and produce testable and measurable results. “Experts” are part of the problem. An expert is someone who has expertise, but sometimes, they forget that past expertise doesn’t mean that they’re always right. When someone with expertise blindly supports a status quo and fails to engage in a relentless search for better, they aren’t showing expertise, they’re simply being a human. Folk wisdom is priceless. It’s the sum total of shared human experience, usually around our emotions. But folk wisdom is not the same as folk expertise. I think that most of us, faced with a troubling diagnosis of cancer, would prefer to find the person with the most expertise, not someone who had done a bunch of googling for twenty minutes… And yet, particularly with the amplification of social media, there’s a devaluing of expertise. Politicians, sure, but regular folks as well. People who assert insight into anthropogenic climate change, public health or the toxicity of medical interventions. People who are sure they can understand the fine print of a 10K or analyze the approach of an athlete. Everyone is entitled to feelings about things, but expertise is earned.  Does your boat make it into port?  "
939,The CEO of you,"November 19, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-ceo-of-you/,"Big company CEOs get paid ridiculous amounts of money, but the good ones also do something that most of us avoid. They make decisions. In fact, that’s pretty much the core of the job. Whether to shut a plant, open a store, create a division, invest in a new technology… That’s the part that creates the most value. When we go to work, most of us simply go to work. We do our jobs, respond to the incoming, hone our craft, make some sales. The decisions get put off or ignored altogether. And yet it’s the strategic decisions that can change the arc of our career and our job satisfaction as well. Here’s a simple list of questions: What are the five big decisions on your desk right now? Would others in your position have a different list? How much of your day is spent learning what you need to know to make those decisions? And can you make them all by Tuesday? "
940,Prove them right or prove them wrong,"November 18, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/prove-them-right-or-prove-them-wrong/,"One way to cause forward motion is to help people see that they were right all along.  “The person you were hoping to hire, that’s me.” “The car you were hoping to buy, it’s here.” The other way to do it is to try to persuade someone that what they thought they wanted is incorrect. That can cause real change–it’s leadership, not simply fulfilling an established need. But to do that, we need to find something in the other person’s set of desires and beliefs that doesn’t have to change. “You’ve always wanted to do the right thing, and you thought the right thing was X, but now I’m hoping you’ll see it’s Y. You weren’t wrong, you simply didn’t have all the information…” "
941,The stairstep and the curve,"November 17, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-stairstep-and-the-curve/,"If your roof is leaking, the water in the basement will gradually move up until you’ve got a full-blown flood. And for most humans, for twenty years, each day we get a little taller. It’s easy to take this physical reality and imagine that it applies to the way humans improve their skills, or organizations mature and grow. But they’re usually more quantum than that. One day we’re at one state or scale or system, and then we’re leaping to the next level. It’s not a curve, it’s a flight of stairs. And leaping takes guts. "
942,"Pushing, pulling and leading","November 16, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/pushing-pulling-and-leading/,"Tug boats don’t usually tug. They push. That’s because pushing is more mechanically efficient than pulling. When we pull, there’s tension and slack in the ropes, and the attachment between the puller and the pushed keeps changing. But the metaphor gets far more interesting when we think about leading instead. One bird at the head of the flock can lead 100 others if they’re enrolled in the journey. That bird would never be able to pull (or push) even one bird, never mind all of them. "
943,Snowflakes and fingerprints,"November 15, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/snowflakes-and-fingerprints/,"Every kid knows that no two are the same. The thing is, at appropriate magnification, if we’re paying attention and deciding to care, that applies to just about everything in the natural world. Everyone is different. It’s convenient to put people into groups and categories, and if that’s working out for you, carry on. But simply because it’s convenient to assume that people are the same doesn’t mean it’s true. "
944,In search of poka-yokes,"November 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/in-search-of-poka-yokes/,"You can’t run the microwave with the door open. There’s a cut-off switch that won’t let it turn on until the door is closed. On the other hand, there’s nothing at all keeping you from putting a big bowl of silverware and a can of spray paint in the microwave and blowing up your house. Your car might not let you switch to Drive unless you press the brake first. That’s because people who weren’t paying attention were slamming their Audis into the walls of their garage, thinking that they were hitting the brake, not the gas. So Audi installed a poka-yoke. It was easier than teaching people how to use the pedals the way they intended. Sending a manuscript to a freelance copyeditor before you submit it to your publisher is a self-built poka-yoke. As is handing over the keys to your partner when you get to a cocktail party. You can add a poka-yoke to just about any system that is fraught, or one where you’re nervous about the outcome. "

It was fun to go back and collect all of this, and I’ll probably update it from time to time with other things of interest. It’s at seths.store Thanks. "
946,Reading scripts and pushing buttons,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/reading-scripts-and-pushing-buttons/,"Hiring phone salespeople and giving them a script used to make sense. Throw enough human spam at the population and sooner or later, you might make a profit. The person who responded to my web query the other day was doing a great job of working with his script. It didn’t really sound like him, but he was grabbing bits and pieces and pushing hard. What he wasn’t doing was listening. He hadn’t been empowered or trained to ask questions, and he used every gap in the conversation to read another part of his script. And when I spoke up, it didn’t matter what I said, it was back to the script. This is a waste. A waste for me, a waste for him and a waste for the people who hired him. Sales have been around a long time. They’re not going away. But they work best when they are a transfer of emotion, an actual human connection and a dialogue. If all you’re going to do is read a script, best to put it on your website instead. "
947,Together,"November 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/together/,"In the US, Thanksgiving is right around the corner. Despite what you might see around you, it’s not a holiday that exists to mark the beginning of shopping season. It celebrates the harvest, and in the original glossed-over telling, celebrates the connections between people from different backgrounds and cultures. And each year, we get another chance to make that version true. Every day, in fact. Two thoughts as you begin to plan your celebration (wherever you are, and whatever day you have it.) First, I hope you’ll consider the free Thanksgiving Reader. It’s a PDF you can print and share at the event. For years, people have been using it to go around the table and give friends and family a chance to speak and connect. I’m thrilled that it’s already touched more than a million people. Second, perhaps today would be a good day to share some of those unused Frequent Flyer miles. This organization is well on the way to collecting a billion miles to enable families to have a fresh start before the end of the year. It’s surprisingly easy to donate miles that the airlines are hoping will expire, and see them used for a good cause. I’m giving away two copies of the out-of-print 18-pound titan to people who enter my little sweepstakes celebrating this project. Readers of this blog are well on the way to donating more than a million miles. [Update: More than 2.5 million miles from this blog so far, thank you.] Thanks for leading, caring and connecting. "
948,Your big idea,"November 11, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/your-big-idea-2/,"No one is going to steal it. Not if it’s actually a big idea. One thing that big ideas have in common is that they’re almost impossible to give away. You could have bought Amazon stock for lunch money, been an early backer of Acumen, financed part of Spike Lee’s first movie, had front row seats to Hamilton, bought BTC for $2… you get the idea. Even insiders usually take cash instead of stock options. And early customers almost never race out to build a competitor. When big ideas show up, almost no one sees what’s possible. All they notice is that change is risky and new stuff might not work. Don’t worry so much about someone stealing your ideas. In fact, it’s probably worth working harder to get people imagining that they might. "
949,School vs. progress,"November 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/school-vs-progress/,"“Will this be on the test?” is a question invented by industrialists. It’s the cornerstone of traditional schooling at scale, because it is such an effective way to indoctrinate kids to become cogs in the system. And it’s almost an accident that we manage to make progress, because we’ve spent so much time encouraging citizens to maintain the status quo: Follow vs. lead Copy vs. innovate Authority vs. responsibility Compete vs. cooperate Comply vs. invent Answer vs. ask Correct vs. possible Fast-growing organizations and bold leaders want to hire people who have the second skill in the table above. And yet we’re working overtime to encourage the first. What’s on your transcript? "
950,The thing about the oxygen mask,"November 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-thing-about-the-oxygen-mask/,"It feels odd to hear the flight attendants remind us to put on our own mask before helping others. That’s backward, isn’t it? The theory is that if you can’t breathe, it’s probable that you’re going to have a hard time lending a hand. In our daily lives, the oxygen mask might be metaphorical, and the insecurity/threat might be invented, but it still feels real. It’s worth remembering that the next time someone doesn’t act in a way you expect. It might be that they’re having a little trouble on their own, trouble you might not even be aware of. "
951,Optimism is a tool,"November 8, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/optimism-is-a-tool/,"We generally adopt a posture of optimism or pessimism as a response (or reaction) to external events. We see how things are unfolding and make a decision about what to expect. We feel like we need to justify our response based on the facts on the ground. But that doesn’t actually explain why different people, similarly informed, might adopt an optimistic mood or a pessimistic one. In fact, that mood is a choice. And it’s one that determines how we’ll behave. Optimism is a tool that permits us to solve problems more effectively. If used wisely, it brings enthusiasm, inspiration and hope to projects that benefit from them. [And pessimism is a tool as well–it can help you with budgeting, scheduling and other projects. If it works for you, that’s great. Choose your tools wisely.] As a universal default, either mood will certainly lead to misguided energy and poor decisions. But if we can be thoughtful about optimism as a tactic, the focus and energy it brings can solve problems that others might simply walk away from. Our pessimism might not be an accurate diagnosis of the past. It might simply be a tool we’re using to produce a future we’re not happy with. "
952,Kinds of projects,"November 7, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/kinds-of-projects/,"At first, we sold our labor. That was 10,000 years of history. You traded sweat for food. Eventually, people figured out that they could build an organization. And an organization made things, which someone could buy. Add some technology and machines and productivity would go up, the things would get better, and profits would result. Industrial capitalism. This is the sort of project that most people think about when someone says “I’m going to start a business.” But there are other options. Linux and Wikipedia and the local farmer’s market are all projects. They may or may not lead to a profit for every person who engages with them, but they’re distinct entities that organize various talents and inputs and create value for the people they serve. Stemming climate change, stopping the spread of disease and fighting homelessness are also projects. They may not have coordinating bodies or a single entity, but they represent a combination of ideas, people and initiatives that are coordinated through culture. Bitcoin is a multi-trillion dollar project with no one in charge. As our world gets more connected, the projects that change us are more and more likely to have a form that would be hard to recognize just a generation ago. But inventing and choosing and supporting these projects is now on us, and it begins by recognizing that they even exist. "
953,What’s the appropriate resolution?,"November 6, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/whats-the-appropriate-resolution/,"If you don’t ask the question, you probably won’t get the answer. The microwave in my office has a button that says, “add a minute.” That’s not helpful, as there are plenty of items that need thirty seconds or ninety seconds, neither of which is possible if all you can do is add a minute. On the other hand, “add five seconds” would be a waste, because no one wants to press a button 18 times. The appropriate resolution for a microwave is either fifteen or thirty seconds. On the other hand, it doesn’t pay for the readout on a radar gun to be a tenth of a mile an hour. Given its accuracy and the need for proof, five miles an hour is probably fine, and one is just the right amount of apparent authority. Should you be measuring your call center team’s performance on a given interaction on a scale of one to a hundred, or is one to five more reasonable? Often, we don’t even bother to ask. "
954,"Truth is elusive, but it isn’t evasive","November 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/truth-isnt-evasive/,"There is almost certainly life on other planets in the universe.  And, by definition, there are flying things that are difficult to identify. But it doesn’t follow that unidentified flying things are spaceships with aliens in them. There are definitely conspiracies all around us. And, by definition, organizations often do things that are difficult to explain. But that doesn’t mean that all of those actions are the result of a conspiracy. The modern era of UFO-ology began in 1947. UFOs as in aliens in ships, not in the obvious statement that some objects we encounter aren’t identified yet. In the seventy years since the aliens came on the scene, our ability to take photographs has become significantly more widespread and the quality of those photos and videos is incomparable to what we used to have. And yet the pictures of UFOs haven’t improved. People who used to see things in broad daylight in their backyards suddenly stopped seeing them as soon as they got an iPhone. One way to tell that you’re dealing with a story instead of falsifiable science is that the story changes when evidence is brought to the table. (Falsifiable means that it can be proven false. “I’m thinking of a unicorn” is not falsifiable, because I can change my story if I need to.) That’s because we’re humans, and humans embrace stories. There are countless good reasons to believe in the possibility of UFOs and other conspiracies. But evidence that holds up to scrutiny and Occam’s razor isn’t one of them.  If we’re not prepared to change our minds in the face of a test that demonstrates the opposite, then we’re embracing a story. Crop circles and Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster are useful stories. But they’re also busy evading our ability to find them. If someone gives a new excuse every time there’s better data about medicine or other useful technology, it’s a clue that we’re hearing a story, not a scientific debate. Truth is hard to find. Truth is difficult to understand when it arrives. But truth doesn’t work to evade us. It usually stays still until we find it. "
955,Who will criticize your dreams?,"November 4, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/who-will-criticize-your-dreams/,"I hope you have dreams. Dreams are precious, and they open the door for what happens next. Some dreams are tactical. They’re very specific executions of a possible future, designed to create a certain kind of happiness. And some dreams are strategic. They might be short on specifics, but they help us understand exactly the change we seek to make in the world and the way it might make us feel. If your dream is to be a vaudeville star working nightly at the Rialto on Broadway, that’s specific and tactical. If, on the other hand, your dream is to pursue your craft in front of an audience that appreciates you and makes it possible for you to do it again, that’s strategic. The more we talk about them, the more tactical they become, as if a dream doesn’t count if it isn’t imminent. But getting the strategic part right is far more important. The feeling and contribution you’re going for, not what it looks like on your resume. The problem is that people are often terrible at helping with your dreams. Perhaps you might get lucky and find someone who cares enough about you that they’ll happily give useful feedback and advice about your tactical dreams. What a precious gift. They’re celebrating your journey at the same time they’re helping you see how you can improve the tactics you’ve chosen. Tactical dreams are almost certain to never work out the way we hope. We need all the help we can get to understand what we’re actually hoping to accomplish and why. We need to learn to see the strategy behind the tactics we’ve chosen. Because once we can settle on a strategy that works for us and the audience we care about, our tactics can change over time. Too often, we believe that the first set of tactics we’ve settled on is our true calling, the only way to accomplish our dream. And then we get trapped, and turn away from those that might help us figure out what we really need to be focusing on. On the other hand, folks who criticize your strategic dreams might mean well, but they’re probably keeping you from making a real impact. To protect you, they pull you down instead. They’re hoping to prevent you from failing at anything. That’s not helpful. It’s easy to get confused and to simply hope that people will cheer us on, regardless of how realistic our tactics are. But if the people around you are afraid to criticize any of your dreams, you’re likely to find yourself in a tactical bind one day soon. "
956,The next big idea,"November 3, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-next-big-idea/,"There are two confusions. The first is that the next big idea must be fully original. The second is that it have no competition. This is almost never the case. Henry Ford didn’t invent the car, and there were plenty of social networks before the dominance of Facebook. Madam CJ Walker didn’t invent haircare, and Ray Kroc definitely didn’t invent the hamburger or the french fry. The same is even more true for thriving, important local businesses of manageable size. The future of all of these types of organizations isn’t based on a lack of customer choice. It’s based on customer traction. When there’s a compelling reason, often due to execution, care and people (combined with a network effect), then a new organization can thrive. Because people want what it offers. Once you realize that you’re not looking for something original and alone, you have countless options. Because the opportunity is to simply solve a problem, to show up in the world with leadership and generosity and make things that people choose. The hard part is showing up to lead. We’ve been indoctrinated to join a ‘safe’ venture instead of seeking out something worth leading. And that’s the reason that innovations often stall. Because it’s easier to be skeptical than it is to say, “I’m leading.” And the reason that projects often fail in the early stages is because leaders can get scared of competition and choice, when it’s actually competition and choice that are the symptoms that you’re on to something. In the middle of all the trauma and change in our lives, we are all on the cusp of a huge multiplication of new business models, new funding models and new ways of being in our communities. If you’ve been waiting for a moment to start a project bigger than your own hourly contribution, this is truly the best moment I can recall. "
957,Let’s vote on it,"November 2, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/lets-vote-on-it/,"Voting with a capital “V” is fraught. It happens rarely, it’s fairly permanent and thus momentous. We bring identity and media and politics into a swirl, spending billions of dollars to create something that feels both fruitless and participatory at the same time. Voting uses a 5,000-year-old method to, in a tiny moment of time, have people raise their hands and make a choice. These sorts of Votes are a ceremony that adorns the way we govern. But Voting with a capital V actually confuses us about the power we each have to speak up in all sorts of informal ways. We vote (with a small v) every time we discuss who to invite over for dinner, what sort of car to buy, and particularly when it comes to work and commerce, how we’ll accomplish anything as a team. And technology, which has made it easier than ever for us to collide with other peoples’ ideas (and to collude with them), hasn’t done much to institute useful new ways to vote and to be heard. And when we feel heard, we’re far more likely to connect and commit. Instead, we rely on traditional status roles, on caste, on signals of strength. We rarely adequately reward wisdom or a good track record when making these decisions, and often the decisions that are confirmed create more team divisions instead of building connection and resilience. What if we could build a voting layer into our teams and our culture? What if it were community-based, resilient and easy to use? And what if that voting layer allowed us to create new forms of value, new projects and better ways to connect and decide? For the last year, I’ve been noodling on a plan for a DAO that creates the conditions for a new form of widespread tally. Dozens of really smart and passionate people helped me think about the tech and the implications. The plan I’m sharing below is filled with examples, traditional ideas, new technologies, cultural shifts and a different way of changing the culture while building a layer of the internet. But this is bigger than me. As I’ve written about before, describing the project and running it are very different things… It needs dedicated leaders ready to commit to building something for the long haul. So I’m publishing the idea here, giving it away and hoping that many people around the world will copy it, improve it, develop it, share it and make it work far beyond what I’ve described.  Here’s the plan for Pluralism. And the published web version. (Static backup version).  Make it yours. Have fun. ¶ "
958,Leadership is a choice,"November 1, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/leadership-is-a-choice/,"It’s such an odd thing to say. The benefit of the doubt is withheld from many of us, options are unevenly distributed and indoctrination is real. And yet… no matter where we begin, we each get the choice, every day, to choose to lead.  It’s tragic that the brainwashing runs so deep that we’ve hidden that choice from many people. But it’s there, in areas big and small. My friends at Akimbo continue to open doors for people who are ready to make that choice. The altMBA’s Regular Decision Deadline is tomorrow, November 2nd for the upcoming altMBA January 2022 session. And Thursday is the last day to enroll in the next session of the legendary Story Skills Workshop. The world is changing faster than it ever has before, and we can choose to lead those changes or simply follow them. "
959,“You’re either with us or against us”,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/11/youre-either-with-us-or-against-us/,"This is almost never true. For just about any issue, behavior, company or movement, the vast majority of people are neither. They might be unaware, they might be unconcerned, they might have a different priority list. Forward motion happens from two things: First, creating synchronized, persistent action among the people who are with you. Second, creating a path where some of the inactive decide to join you. Insisting that someone choose sides might feel like the satisfying and urgent thing to do, but it rarely leads to enrollment and action. "
960,"New problems, old problems","October 31, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/new-problems-old-problems/,"Most of the challenges we face are things we’ve faced before. It might be a personal situation or a business one, but it’s not new. If what you’ve done before works, it’s not a problem any more. If you need to stick it out because there’s no other way through it, it’s not a problem, it’s a situation. But if you think it’s a problem, then the hard work is deciding to try something new, as opposed to the predictable but unsuccessful path of doing what you did before. That’s not the same as the challenge we face when a new problem arises. A new problem doesn’t need fresh thinking, it needs clear awareness. We can begin by acknowledging we have a problem, identifying the constraints, the boundaries and the assets involved.  And then we can go to work to solve it. Because ultimately, that’s our job. To solve interesting problems. "
961,The simple but difficult marketing flip,"October 30, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/the-simple-but-difficult-marketing-flip/,"From, “Pay attention, I want you to buy what I made.” to… “I’ve been paying attention, and I think I can offer you what you want.” "
962,The point of maximum leverage,"October 29, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/the-point-of-maximum-leverage/,"The best way for a movie studio to outperform is to attract and encourage creators with vision, drive and commitment. And yet, the key executives might be spending their time and focus and effort on micro-managing the end credits on the next movie or setting up a press junket. The best way for a marketing team to grow sales and market share is to help design a product that uses a network effect and builds remarkability and engagement right into the item itself. And yet, the team just spent three hours arguing about where to shoot the next commercial. That small business will probably be most transformed by creating sell-through and market demand for their new product, But it’s overwhelmingly urgent to focus on a shipment that’s delayed, even though the supply chain can’t be fixed. It goes on and on. For a job search, fixing your resume isn’t nearly as important as shipping a personal project. For a restaurant, creating a reason to come back with friends is more important than getting all the normal things right… We can’t fix this problem until we see it, and then we need to be clear with ourselves and with our colleagues about where that leverage point is. "
963,Fill before empty,"October 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/fill-before-empty/,"When the cost of topping off your battery is less than the catastrophic risk of running out of juice, it pays to add to your reserves. That’s the entire point of having a tank. Going near empty isn’t nearly as effective as building up a cushion. Have your emergency on your own schedule. "
964,Effort toward quality,"October 27, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/effort-toward-quality/,"Quality is defined as consistently meeting spec. A measurable promise made and kept. Effort is what happens when we go beyond our normal speed. When we dig deep and exert physical or emotional labor and focus on something that is out of the ordinary. Effort is the opposite of coasting. Often we’re taught that quality is the result of effort. That if you simply tried harder, you’d come closer to meeting spec. And yet, when we look at organizations or brands or individuals with a reputation for quality, it’s not at all clear that they accomplish this with more effort. Because that’s simply not sustainable. The people who work at a Lexus plant aren’t more tired at the end of the day than those that make the Cadillac Escalade. It’s not about effort. The same is true for the Dabbawalla who never misses a delivery. In fact, focusing on effort (and the effort of your team) is almost guaranteed to ensure that your quality problem will persist. Persistent quality problems are a systemic issue, and if you’re not working on your system, you’re not going to improve it.  “How do we do this work?” is a much better question than, “who isn’t trying hard enough?” "
965,Entitlement,"October 26, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/entitlement/,"A feeling of entitlement is hard won. You suffered to get to this spot. You were mistreated. You worked hard. You paid your dues. You were treated unfairly. It’s your turn. Justice demands it. You’re aggrieved. Or perhaps the thing you’ve worked so hard on is magical, special and totally worth people’s attention. Like I said, you’re entitled. To your grievance or the meeting or even simply, the benefit of the doubt. Alas: Our entitlement isn’t helpful. Feeling entitled doesn’t make it more likely that others will listen to you, do what you ask or respect you. Feeling entitled doesn’t get you a sale or make it easier to merge into moving traffic, no matter how long you’ve been waiting. So yes, you’re entitled. We all are, sooner or later. But feeling that we’re entitled and demanding that others realize that we’re entitled is completely useless and might even get in the way of the work we hope to do. "
966,Customer service is free,"October 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/customer-service-is-free/,"(Customer service is expensive) Of course it’s expensive. You’ll need to hire people inclined to be empathic and kind. You’ll need to provide systems and training and support. You’ll need to avoid shortcuts and treat people better than the minimum required to get through the day. And you’ll need to trust your people to do what’s right. But all of that expense–it’s the cheapest way to spread the word about what you do. Great customer service pays for itself. There are many situations where no customer service at all also pays for itself. Google spends not a nickel on helping people with many of the services they offer… and the money they save is spent on something else that permits them to grow. It’s the in-between spots, the choice of low customer service, or nearly enough–that’s when it’s simply a waste of time and money. The single biggest marketing bargain remains a customer who chooses to recruit new customers. "
967,Sunday driver,"October 24, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/sunday-driver/,"There’s a road near my house that was built early in the automobile era. It was built so that early adopter car owners would have something to do with their cars–a parkway that went nowhere in particular, perfect for a Sunday drive. Along the way, the term “Sunday driver” has become a criticism. It describes a meandering, purposeless driver. A driver who might be watching the scenery instead of paying attention to the road–someone who rarely yields the right of way and probably causes more than a small number of accidents when surrounded by drivers who are in a hurry. We went from Sunday driving being the point to it being a hindrance, because the road is hard to share. The digital world we live in was created and populated for Sunday drivers. It’s only in the last two decades that, like expressways, it has become a center of commerce and industry. But unlike the scarcity of the road, the digital world has lots of space. There are several internets. One is filled with hobbies and connection and possibility. And sometimes we confuse it with the other one, the one that’s at the center of our commercial life. Most of the time, internet Sunday drivers don’t bother anyone, and perhaps we can all learn a lesson from their desire and ability to make the journey worth the effort. "
968,Art with intent,"October 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/art-with-intent/,"Art (movies, plays, fiction, paintings, poetry…) exists to create a change. Often, that’s a change in the viewer, and sometimes, powerful art changes the culture. Art with no intent can entertain us, and it can also reinforce stereotypes and simply help what is in our world persist. Art with selfish intent exists to manipulate the viewer to serve the needs of the artist. It doesn’t often spread, but when it does, it can have a corrosive effect on the world around us. But art with generous intent is different. It might not address an issue the way you would (in fact, that’s precisely why we need it) and it creates tension as it helps us look at things in a new way. The plays of Sarah Jones,  or a book by Sinclair Lewis or music by Charles Wilson or a movie by Amy Koppelman exist to make us think hard. To think about what we’ve taken for granted and to think about what might be different if we cared enough. I’m not sure it even matters what the artist thought they wanted when they sat down to create the work. The art itself seems to want something, to make a change in the world. And the ability to create art like that belongs to each of us. "
969,Afraid of afraid,"October 22, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/afraid-of-afraid/,"We’d probably be better off if we could simply say, “I’m afraid.” Our culture has persistently reminded us that the only thing to fear is fear itself, that confessing fear is a failure and that it’s better to lie than to appear un-brave. And so we pretend to be experts in public health and epidemiology instead of simply saying, “I’m afraid.” We fight possible change from the start instead of examining it on the merits. And we make uninformed assertions about the causes and implications of global phenomena instead of acknowledging that change is scary. Fear of being afraid keeps things on our to-do list forever, keeps important conversations from happening and shifts how we see our agency and leverage in the world. The bravest leaders and contributors aren’t worried about appearing afraid. It allows them to see the world more clearly. "
970,What will you leave behind?,"October 21, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/what-will-you-leave-behind/,"Twenty years from now, you will have new skills. New customers. A new title and a new kind of leverage. All of this forward motion requires a less celebrated element–all the things you’re not doing any longer. To get a new job, you’ll need to leave the old job behind. When you have a child, you’ve initiated a process that leads to an adult… Often, we try to pretend that growth comes with no goodbyes, but it does. Perhaps we can go in with our eyes open, understanding that what we begin will likely end. And when we plan for it, we’ll do it better. "
971,The test kitchen mindsets,"October 20, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/the-test-kitchen-mindsets/,"The first mindset is pretty common. Take good notes. Make tiny changes. Repeat. Improve. Incrementally move along the asymptote. Test and measure.  The other mindset is rare indeed. Do things that might not work. Develop new assertions. Go past the edges to unexplored territory. Try to figure out why things are the way they are. Fail often. Blaze a trail. After all, it’s a test kitchen, not a Michelin restaurant. When the world changes, we see lots of people lining up to do the first sort of ‘tests’. A lot of crib sheets, looking over the competition and trying to fit in all the way. But real innovation comes from the science of “this might not work.” "
972,“They were all bored to tears waiting to hear something they knew”,"October 19, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/they-were-all-bored-to-tears-waiting-to-hear-something-they-knew/,"That’s the report from the band on the audience’s reaction to the first live performance of Stairway to Heaven. They bombed. The audience wanted hits, not something new. Every good idea starts as a new idea. And new ideas are never familiar. "
973,An illusion of scale,"October 18, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/an-illusion-of-scale/,"Successful small businesses often stumble when they seek to get to an entirely different scale. It’s easy to believe that things are dramatically better when there’s more. More customers, more employees, more market share. And it’s easy to believe that getting to the next sustainable level is simply the result of efforts similar to the ones that got you here. But neither is true. Between this level and the one you seek there may be a slog that’s longer, more difficult and more expensive than it appears. Staying at a scale that’s working isn’t a cowardly copout. It might be the single best way to do work that matters for people who care. And if you choose to get through the Dip, consider whether you have the resources, the patience and the team to get to the other side. "
974,Effort,"October 17, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/effort-2/,"Insufficient effort creates work that’s wasted. If you do a slapdash job, then the roof leaks, the food is inedible, the car doesn’t start. Insufficient effort is a shortcut that wasn’t worth taking. Sufficient effort is the goal of the industrial capitalist. Capture the most value with the least work. Build a house that doesn’t fall down, with components that last exactly long enough to avoid a claim. Explain that due to unusually call volume… And then, perhaps, there’s a third option. Expending more effort than most people think is sufficient. This is attention to detail. Care in design. Follow through in customer service. This is an embrace of elegance and wabisabi and the opposite of laziness. This is bringing care (which is rare and precious) to work even if most people would look for a shortcut instead. More effort creates beauty and magic and remarkability. Perfectionism is a false hope and a place to hide.  Effort, on the other hand, is our best chance to do work that matters. "
975,The hedonic buffet,"October 16, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/the-hedonic-buffet/,"Every day around 3 pm, my dog takes a nap.  As far as dogs go, he has a ton of available options. He could hang in the backyard, chase a squirrel, whatever. But in that moment, every day, the choice with the most benefit for him appears to be a nap. We’re not that different. Except times a billion. In any given moment, you could read a blog like this one. Or watch a video. Or check your email. Or send an email. Or… We choose. We choose to see what Wolf Blitzer thinks is breaking news. We choose to have an argument or send a compliment. We do it largely out of habit, and our habit is grooved by countless choices in countless moments that came before. Like the buffet, it probably won’t make you happier to keep loading your plate up simply because you can. Our best path usually begins by acknowledging that we do, in fact, have a choice. "
976,Zero percent market share,"October 15, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/zero-percent-market-share/,"If you have a million Twitter followers, that means that 99.9% of the people on Twitter are ignoring you, which, with a little rounding, means you have 0%. If you write a book and it sells a million copies, it will be one of the bestselling books of the year. It will also reach far fewer than 1% of the country’s population, never mind the world. There are very few things that ever rise to 1% of the market. You don’t need everyone, in fact, the act of chasing everyone is probably keeping you from reaching anyone. Zero (rounded) is enough. "
977,Contagious commerce,"October 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/contagious-commerce/,"Early adopters change the world. While one person choosing not to eat meat will have a small impact on our climate, it will have a much bigger impact on the restaurants, groceries and food suppliers who notice what you’re doing. They’ll change what they offer, and that will lead to a multiplier effect of other people changing their habits. Buying an electric car or installing solar before they’re the obvious economic choice has the same impact. Because once marketers and investors discover that there’s a significant group that likes to go first, they’re far more likely to invest the time and energy to improve what’s already there. The same goes for philanthropy. When some people eagerly fund a non-profit with a solution that’s still in beta, it makes it easier (and more likely) that someone else will start one as well. It also happens in the other direction. If we buy from a spamming telemarketer, abandon a trusted brand to save a buck or succumb to the hustle, the market notices. Very few people have the leverage to change the world. But all of us have the chance to change the people around us, and those actions change what gets built, funded and launched. "
978,A future of retail,"October 13, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/a-future-of-retail/,"What do traditional retailers own or control? And now you can see the problem. When retailers move online, the things they used to own are either eliminated or transformed. And many retailers, in their eagerness to compete on price and their focus on selling things that everyone else is selling end up failing to build much of anything. Permission–the privilege to deliver anticipated, personal and relevant messages to people who want to get them, and the ability to work with customers toward something better–is at the heart of every retailer’s future. But many are so busy spamming about this week’s promotions that they forgot to earn much of anything. "
979,Swap the line,"October 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/swap-the-line/,"Here’s a business idea for you, feel free to build it if you’re interested.  Don’t waste a waiting list The waiting list has value, and it’s also a source of frustration. There are people waiting for delivery of a new car, or to stay in a popular airbnb or to buy a limited edition jigsaw puzzle. There are people waiting for an appointment or a reservation or a handmade luxury good as well. Or let’s say two companies are waiting for a shipment of computer chips. One has a few left in stock, the other needs them to finish a high-value product that serves people in life-threatening situations… On one hand, it feels fair. The people ahead of us in line got there before we did. On the other hand, perhaps someone behind us needs or wants our slot way more than we do… Swap the Line is a simple smart-contract-based system that makes it easy to trade your spot in line. Pay money to someone who wants the cash and you can swap with them. Sell your spot for more than you think it’s worth. Stay put if you want to. This addresses problems with our current scarcity due to the supply chain along with the trade-anything mindset of crypto. Here’s how it works: An organization with a waiting list enables swaptheline.com They onboard with two simple steps: If you’re ready to swap yourself to a different spot on the list, simply enter how much you’re willing to pay to go how far on the list. Or enter how much you’re willing to take to swap with someone behind you. Perhaps there’s a list of bids and you can grab one, or perhaps it’s done automatically. Either way, the system simply updates the waitlist in the cloud and transfers the money. Some percentage of the transaction goes to the host, and some percentage goes to swaptheline for running the smart contracts and user interface that makes it work. There’s a popular jigsaw puzzle company that has a six-month waiting list for a chance to buy one of their $200 jigsaw puzzles. If they kept 15% of the swaptheline percentage, it’s easy to see how they could double their profit at the same time that they served their customers better–because no one buys or sells a spot on the line unless they want to. Or consider the 50,000 people now eagerly awaiting news about their new Rivian pickup truck. The truck costs $70,000. The deposit to get on the line was $1,000. A person could swap their spot at #100 to someone who is #18,000 and probably make enough to pay for half the car. And if even 10% of the line did a swap at an average price of $6,000, Rivian would earn $5,000,000 in profit simply by giving their customers what they want. The rigidity of the line is a sort of tax that ignores the market. Or perhaps it’s something more civic-minded. The organization could allocate their percentage, perhaps they set it at 50%, for a local charity. It could easily replace a fundraising gala or two… This is one of hundreds of examples of the impossible things an always-on network can do, things that feel odd at first and then obvious. Have fun. "
980,Shift your tech time horizon,"October 11, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/shift-your-tech-time-horizon/,"Ten years ago, if you were as good at using networks and software as you are today, most of your peers would have considered you some sort of wizard. The question isn’t whether or not each of us is going to get better at using our tools, the only issue is: how soon? We can choose to live behind the curve or ahead of it. It turns out that there are significant rewards for pushing through discomfort and getting (much) better at all the resources that are suddenly freely available in data acquisition, learning technologies, financial tech, marketing and networks. What if instead of resisting until we had no choice, we decided to pioneer instead? PS the same thing is true for our other skills, including leadership. "
981,Life by anecdote,"October 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/life-by-anecdote/,"“What evidence would you need to see to change your mind?” The honest answer to this question is usually: “I need a new story that’s more immediate, more vivid and most of all, more culturally aligned than the one I have now.” It took humans 100,000 years to invent the scientific method. Before that, we lived our lives by stories, examples and the urgent. We still do. An anecdote is not evidence. But we often treat it that way. "
982,“In it together”,"October 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/in-it-together/,"That’s not what we usually hear. To have “us” we often need “them.” To make a profit (or a commotion) in social media, the math is usually division, not addition. And as media has crept into every corner of our lives, it often thrives on discord. The irony is that the network effect that powers our culture (it works better when others are using it too) depends on connection. When Stewart Brand put a picture of the Earth from space on the cover of the original Whole Earth Catalog, it was a revelation for many. The photo was new, but the image was also a timeless reminder of how futile it is to forget the very nature of our finite world. Ideas can spread and multiply, creating new opportunities and new frontiers. But we’re still on the same planet, no matter how much a few people spend to go (almost) into orbit. As we begin to move beyond a century of industrialism, all of us are coming to grips with the impact that the industrial engines we depend on have created. The chronic shift in the climate of the entire planet is going to be the most significant driver of change of the next twenty years. For all of us, not just a few. Unlike current events or politics, this is neither local nor temporary. It’s hard to fight the weather, as it changes all of the inputs and the outputs of our life.  The first step is to realize that we’re in it together.  In the old days, when I was a book packager, I created a series of bestselling almanacs. Almanacs have been around since Benjamin Franklin, and even in the age of the web, they serve a useful function. Collecting relevant tables, facts, explanations, lists and history in a format that’s easy to reference and share gives us a chance to agree on what we agree on, a common foundation for moving forward. I’m putting together a worldwide team of people who are interested in volunteering to contribute to the new Carbon Almanac. It’s a zero-profit venture, a group effort designed to create a print and digital document that fills the vital niche between the cutting edge and apathy. There are currently 40 of us, from 20 countries, working on the early versions. If this is something you have the time and inclination to contribute to, I hope you’ll take a minute to fill out this quick form. We’ll be inviting some folks to join us next week. Thanks. "
983,Crowding the pan,"October 8, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/crowding-the-pan-2/,"No matter what it is you’re cooking, if you put too much in the pot, it’s not going to come out as well. Very few things scale forever. The hardest moment to stop scaling our work is the moment when it’s working the best.  And that’s precisely the moment when we need to have the guts to stop making it bigger. "
984,Tools for modern citizens,"October 7, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/tools-for-modern-citizens/,"It has taken us by surprise, but in our current situation, when everyone has more of a voice and more impact on the public than ever before, it suddenly matters. You wouldn’t take your car to a mechanic who didn’t know how to fix a car, and citizens, each of us, should be held to at least as high a standard of knowledge. Everyone around us needs to know about: Statistics Germ theory Epidemiology Decision making Propaganda and the status quo Semiotics and indoctrination The mechanics of global weather Network effects and artificial intelligence Either we are the makers of our future or we’re the victims. And if we don’t understand these fundamental components of how the world works, our actions may undermine our goals as well as the people around us. The world is changing fast and we’re all more connected than ever before. The good news is that these are all skills, they can be learned and it’s imperative that we teach them to others. "

986,Superfamous,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/superfamous/,"Among painters, poets, writers, actors, bloggers, directors, influencers, capitalists, fundraisers, politicians and singers, you’ll find a few who want to go all the way to superfamous. They understand that their work won’t reach every single human, it can’t. They’re okay with that. But they’d like to reach just a few more people than anyone else. Back when the New York Times bestseller list mattered, they worked to be on it. Not just on it, but on top of it. Back when 100,000 followers were seen as a lot on Twitter, they hustled to be in the top spot. And when it got to a million, then that was the new goal. Pop albums used to sell millions of copies. Now they sell in the tens of thousands. But one more than just about anyone else is enough (for now). The desire to be superfamous might come from a good place. The work is important, it deserves to be seen by more people. The work is arduous, and reaching more people with it feels appropriate. The work is measurable, and measuring better is a symptom of good work. Or the desire might come from the same drive that pushes people to do the work in the first place. Bigger is better, after all. The problems with superfamous are varied and persistent. First, it corrupts the work. By ignoring the smallest viable audience and focusing on mass, the creator gives up the focus that can create important work. Second, the infinity of more can become a gaping hole. Instead of finding solace and a foundation for better work, the bottomless pit of just a little more quickly ceases to be fuel and becomes a burden instead. Trust is worth more than attention, and the purpose of the work is to create meaningful change, not to be on a list. "
987,Lucky charms,"October 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/lucky-charms/,"We’d rather not claim luck. Good luck feels like something was unearned. And bad luck sounds like an excuse. The false promise of meritocracy decries luck in all its forms. And yet… Among famous colleges, perhaps one in five qualified applicants are admitted. Here’s what that means: The school could make a list of every student who is ‘good’ enough to get in. The combination of background, test scores, grades, activities, all of it. Every student who, under some circumstances, would be happily admitted. They could send a note to every one of those students telling them that they are finalists, and now, a random number  generator is going to pick 20% of them. Because that’s what they’re actually doing anyway. If you got rejected, perhaps it would be better to know that you were a finalist and then you got unlucky, instead of blaming yourself and some imagined defect. And the same goes for countless things that happen to us in our lives. That I was lucky to get that first TED talk. That I was unlucky to not get that big meeting years ago…  Giving credit (or blame) to luck makes it easier to get back to the hard work of making things better. "
988,Tasks or initiatives?,"October 4, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/tasks-or-initiatives/,"For the longest time, just about all jobs were task jobs. Factory work. Inbox then outbox. The assembly line, the ticket taker, the cook… We learned how to hire for these jobs, measure them, manage the work to be done. Over time, we’ve figured out how to outsource them, mechanize them and pay as little as possible for them. But in many pockets of our economy, the new jobs and the best jobs aren’t task jobs. They are jobs of initiative. Work that’s taken, not simply assigned. Work that can’t be easily forecast, and work that thrives with a different sort of teamwork. These jobs often have a lot of task work mixed in, which is really confusing for everyone involved. Because reverting to task work feels safe and hiring for task work is easier. Apparently, people are supposed to learn how to do initiative work on their own and do it in their spare time. Most organizations do an astonishingly bad job at creating, initiating and dancing with the next thing. And so they struggle and eventually become Yahoo. First step: announce what the jobs around here are like. Hire for them and measure and reward appropriately. "
989,The two mistakes around competition,"October 3, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/the-two-mistakes-around-competition/,"Sometimes we assume that our competitors are far smarter than we are, better informed and harder working. And sometimes we assume that they’re clueless, lazy and hapless. Neither is true. "
990,When did you decide?,"October 2, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/when-did-you-decide/,"to never miss a deadline to be the last to speak up or offer help to learn something new every day to be helpless in the face of a technology to give others the benefit of the doubt to ask for help when you get stuck to persist in the face of disappointment to not bother to look it up to react instead of respond? If it’s a habit, then it’s a decision, made consciously or not. And if we decided, we could decide to make a new decision about how we’ll act going forward. "
991,Predictability,"October 1, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/10/predictability/,"We’d like the systems we depend on to do what we expect and need them to do. A useful component of that sort of system is that there’s a bedrock set of expectations, principles and boundaries that exist before and after we encounter it. The drawbridge operates because of the rules of physics, not because an invisible elf decided to open it in this moment. There are two kinds of situations, then. One in which we’re dealing with a predictable system with expectations about how and why things happen, and the other in which explanations might be suggested after the fact, but they’re justifications, not explanations or principles. In the irrational system, explanations are often made up after the fact and changed as soon as they’re scrutinized. Both kinds of systems make up our world, but the first kind, the civilized, effective, mature kind, is the type we can build our world around. We can state the rules and play by them. We can outline a theory and prove it.  Principles truly matter in the moments when it’s really difficult to stick with them. "
992,"First come, first served","September 30, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/first-come-first-served/,"This is the default for allocating something that’s scarce. It’s also rarely the fairest or most efficient alternative. And it’s sort of lazy. I called a service provider yesterday and was told that they had a two-year waitlist.  They could sort the list by who needs what they do the most. They could sort it by which sort of client would be the best fit. They could even sort it by which client would allocate the most resources to be next in line. Any of these choices would be more useful to them and to their clients than the semi-random solution of handing out numbers at the deli. It feels more fair because we’re used to it. But it’s actually less fair to just about everyone involved. When a luxury good is allocated based on time invested by the purchaser, it may seem that rewarding someone who stayed up all night to wait in line makes sense. After all, they traded the one commodity that everyone has the same amount of to signal their desire to be in the line. But perhaps there’s someone who would put the item to better use. Or consider the utility of allowing people who want something to trade time spent as a tutor or in a food shelter for priority instead.  The internet allows us to transcend time and space. We can collect information and connect people who aren’t necessarily first in line. Every time we choose not to, we’ve chosen to ignore the value that could be created. "
993,Seeing the continuum,"September 29, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/seeing-the-continuum/,"It’s so much easier to see and process the world if we divide it into discrete bits. This is non-fiction, that’s fiction. This is a good restaurant, that’s a bad one. This person is succesful, that one isn’t. These distinctions are almost always wrong. Not just wrong, but unhelpful, because by ignoring the stuff in between, we isolate ideas (and people) instead of seeing them as part of a continuous whole. Slopes aren’t necessarily slippery, but they’re far more likely to exist than neat staircases. And then we have to make the very difficult decision of where in the messy middle we’re going to place a marker. "
994,The chance you’ve been waiting for,"September 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/the-chance-youve-been-waiting-for/,"It’s here, right now, today. The open-source project that needs a contributor. The community charity that needs a volunteer fundraiser. The co-worker who needs coaching on a new presentation. The startup idea that needs someone to go out on a limb and talk about it in public. The local elected board that needs to be covered now that newspapers don’t do that any more. The free-to-use courses online that teach everything from language to technology. The friend who would love to hear from you by phone. The Wikipedia article that needs editing. The codebase that needs bugs fixed. The story that needs to be told… Opportunity is another word for a problem to be solved. And opportunity is often there, but it rarely knocks. "

996,On doing the reading,"September 26, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/on-doing-the-reading/,"It’s essential.  Domain knowledge is a gift. It’s how we advance in our field and in society. The insights and false steps of those that came before us, laid out clearly, there to be learned. And it’s sort of a trap. Because you used to be able to do ALL the reading. You could read all the essential science fiction books before you wrote yours. You could watch all the key movies before you directed yours. You could understand all the current thinking in a field of medicine before you prescribed a drug… No longer. Some people have responded to the long tail of available “reading” by deciding to do none of it, as if naive beginner’s mind is an appropriate strategy for a professional. And some have responded by simply freezing in place, demanding perfect knowledge before making an assertion. Clearly, the successful path lies somewhere on the curve. There comes a moment in doing your reading where new work begins to rhyme. When you start to see the connections. When you understand who influenced the person you’re engaging with right now. That’s the moment to begin shipping your work and making your own assertions. "
997,All the answers,"September 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/all-the-answers/,"In an expert-run industrialized economy, there’s a lot of pressure to be the one who’s sure, the person with all the answers.  Far more valuable is someone who has all the questions. The ability to figure out what hasn’t been figured out and see what hasn’t been seen is a significant advantage. Rarest of all is the person with the humility (and confidence) to realize that even the list of questions can remain elusive. Finding the right questions might be the very thing we need to do. "
998,The Goldilocks fallacy,"September 24, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/the-goldilocks-fallacy/,"One way to tell if the audience is happy is to ask a simple question: “Do you want it spicier?” (or the equivalent). If half the people want it to go in one direction and the other half want the other, then you know you’re at ‘just right’. You’ve minimized the number of unhappy customers. Here’s the problem: This assumes that there’s a normal distribution of preferences. In nature, many things are in fact distributed like this. Height, for example, or sensitivity to loud sounds. Most people are in the middle, fewer people are at either end. The goal when making something for everyone, if everyone is distributed normally, is to seek out the middle. But! Personal preferences aren’t normally distributed. Most people don’t care at all, some people care a lot.  And! In any market with choices, you’re no longer going to be able to serve everyone, because given a choice, people will make a choice. So, seeking the Goldilocks equilibrium is a trap. While it might diminish criticism, it maximizes apathy. While it might increase your appeal to a hypothetical middle-of-the-road consumer, it might be that there aren’t many of these. For many products and services, the middle is hollowed out. What you’re left with are the people who want a lot more or want a lot less of whatever it is you’re able to adjust. "
999,"When in doubt, look for the fear","September 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/when-in-doubt-look-for-the-fear/,"My friend Amy taught me that “craven” doesn’t mean what I thought it meant. I’ve been using it to mean, “selfish in a particularly short-sighted way.” It actually means fearful and gutless. But, exploring the thesaurus, I discovered that it also means “dastardly.” I was sure that Snidely Whiplash was a dastardly villain. A dastardly deed must be something bad. Nope, it means “cowardly.” But wait! It turns out that it also means particularly selfish and evil. When someone is fearful enough, craven enough, they sometimes end up acting in unsocial and even hurtful ways. While there are definitely some super villains among us, it’s more likely we’re simply dealing with someone who feels like he’s drowning.

1000,Defending change (or the status quo),"September 22, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/defending-change-or-the-status-quo/,"The easy argument to make is that the thing we have now is better than the new thing that’s on offer. All one has to do is take the thing we have now as a given (ignoring its real costs) and then challenge the defects and question the benefits of the new thing, while also maximizing the potential risk. “A hand-written letter is more thoughtful, more likely to be a keepsake, and a more permanent record than a simple email.” On the other hand, the technophile defending change simply has to list all the new features and ignore the benefits we’re used to. “An email is far faster, cheaper and easier to track than a letter. It is more likely to be saved, and it can be sorted and searched. Not to mention copied and forwarded with no problem.” What’s truly difficult is being a fair arbiter. I fall into this trap all the time. We begin to develop a point of view, usually around defending the status quo, but sometimes around overturning it, and then the arguments become more and more concrete. While we might pretend to be evenhanded, it’s very hard to do. Sometimes, we end up simply arguing for or against a given status quo, instead of the issue that’s actually at hand. And the danger is pretending you’re being fair, when you’re not. In this silly article from the Times, the author (and their editors) are wondering if oat milk and pea milk are a “scam.” This is a classic case of defending the status quo. Here’s a simple way to tell if that’s what you’re doing: imagine for a second that milk was a new product, designed to take on existing beverages made from hemp, oats or nuts. Defending oat milk against the incursion of cow milk is pretty easy. The author could point out the often horrific conditions used to create cow milk. “Wait, you’re going to do what to that cow?” They could write about the biological difficulty many people have drinking it. Or they could focus on the significant environmental impact, not to mention how easily it spoils, etc. Or imagine that solar power was everywhere, and someone invented kerosene, gasoline or whale oil. You get the idea… There are endless arguments to be had when new ideas arrive. The challenge is in being clear that we’re about to take a side, and to do it on the effects, not on our emotional connection to the change that’s involved. "
1001,Messing with Strathern’s Law,"September 21, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/messing-with-stratherns-law/,"“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Marilyn Strathern expanded on Charles Goodhart’s comment about monetary policy and turned it into a useful law of the universe. As soon as we try to manipulate behaviors to alter a measure, it’s no longer useful. That’s why you can’t believe social media metrics. Because they don’t measure anything except whether someone is good at making them go up. "
1002,Labor and value,"September 20, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/labor-and-value/,"Adam Smith and David Ricardo argued that all value comes from labor, and the value of something is in the amount of labor it took to produce it. But Henry George understood that this is backward. The value of something lies in how much labor we’re willing to exchange for it. Too often, we’re tempted to price things based on what they cost us to make. It’s more useful to price things based on what they’re worth to those that might want to buy them. "
1003,"Gift cards, serial numbers and hard technology","September 19, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/gift-cards-serial-numbers-and-hard-technology/,"I bought someone a digital gift card the other day. That’s generally a bad idea, since there’s so much waste and breakage, but it was the right answer to the problem in the moment. The code the person would have to type in to redeem the card was: X5LMFP478DRYTHQY I’m sure that the team who worked on creating a secure platform for the transfer of billions of dollars of transactions was proud of the hard work they did. Except no one wants to type this in, and it’s incredibly impersonal. It could have been just as secure if there was a list of 1,000 words and the code was five of the words. All the words could be positive and easy to spell and remember. Typing in “happy love birthday celebrate friend walrus” is going to be more memorable, fun and engaging, and the computer is smart enough to ignore the spaces. The day before, the tech support folks at a different big company wanted me to read off the serial number on the bottom of a device. I’m sure the tech folks were proud of the check digits and other elements that were embedded in the serial number, which was printed in grey type considerably smaller than this blog is written in. It included a 0 and an O as well as a 1 and perhaps an l. And the serial number for my oven requires lying on the floor to read it. In all of these cases, the organizations failed because they decided that humanity and technical issues don’t overlap. These minor issues I’m complaining about are nothing compared to the life-changing impacts that technology that avoids the hard problems can create. In medical school, they spend days teaching people to operate on lungs, and no time at all helping young doctors learn how to get their patients to stop smoking and get vaccinated. The technologists forgot about the human issues. This is most glaring when we go near the edges of a bell curve. Disabled people or folks who are out of the mean in any way are shunted aside by what the busy but blindered tech people think is important. A captcha that doesn’t work, machine learning that doesn’t learn well, systems that don’t serve the people who need them… Technology that doesn’t solve a problem for the people using it isn’t finished yet.

1004,Raining on your picnic (on your birthday),"September 18, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/raining-on-your-birthday-at-your-picnic/,"A friend just got handed an unreasonable rejection. It came on a platter, delivered with very little in the way of kindness and no hints at all about what to do next. It is not personal. Not about her. She did nothing wrong. It might not even be about her idea. No one wants exactly what you want, sees what you see, believes what you believe. That’s normal. Oh, that happened. Now what? Go plan another picnic. "
1005,The programmatic ask,"September 17, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/the-programmatic-ask/,"Favors are part of the glue of our culture. It’s not easy to ask for a favor, it’s not always easy to say yes, but when the two people engaged in this dance find a connection, it means something. Alas, the modern hustle, amplified by databases and computers, has turned this equation upside down. “It doesn’t hurt to ask,” the hustling spammer says, using second-order connections to “reach out” to hundreds of people. “No pressure,” they add, as if this diminishes the coarsening of the conversation. If you ask 100 people for a favor to “get the word out,” then of course you don’t care so much if 80 or 90 people decline. The problem is that you’ve just hurt the relationship you had with these people (as thin as it was) as well as made it more difficult for the next person, the one who actually put some effort and care into making a connection. The honest first line of the programmatic ask is, “I’m using you to get what I want right now, because I didn’t plan ahead, care enough or show up with enough generosity to do it the old way.”  No one wants to be hustled. Just because you are in a hurry, know how to use mailmerge and have figured out how to hustle people doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. "
1006,The simple market,"September 16, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/the-simple-market/,"If you want something that makes your life better, you can buy it. If you want to get the money to buy something, you can make something or do something that makes someone’s life better. It stops being simple when externalities, market failures and greed show up. "
1007,Copy design,"September 15, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/copy-design/,"Copywriting turns words into action.  But which words? And which action? Often, copywriters take a strategy for granted. They don’t take the time to think about what this sentence or that paragraph might be for. They hesitate to describe the foundations of their method, and instead resort to time-tested tricks and phrases. We have a word for the strategies involved in creating a product or service that fills a niche and solves a problem. That’s what designers do. The pretty part comes next (and it’s confusingly called design as well, when it should probably be called craft.) Design leads to leaps and breakthroughs. Craft ensures that great design accomplishes its mission. Designing effective copy begins with the presumption that you can then craft the sentences that support that strategy. But beginning with design ensures that good craft won’t go to waste. [Check out my friend Margo Aaron’s breakthrough Copy Workshop. It’s cohort-based, peer-to-peer and live, and signups begins today. She’s doing it with the folks at Akimbo, and I’ve seen how powerful this work is.] If it’s worth writing, it’s worth writing effectively. "
1008,Appropriate risk,"September 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/appropriate-risk/,"We talk about risk like it’s a bad thing. But all forward motion involves risk. You can’t find a risk-free way to accomplish much of anything. Appropriate risk has two elements: We don’t try something simply because there’s no downside. Instead, we intelligently choose projects where the downside is understood and the work is worth doing. "
1009,Respecting their time,"September 13, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/respecting-their-time/,"When we go around the room and have each person introduce themselves, we’re burning time, attention and trust. 40 people: 45 minutes, gone. Worse—the person who goes first spends 43 minutes daydreaming, and the person who goes last spends 44 minutes worrying about what to say. When we read our powerpoint slides to the audience, we’re sabotaging our message and wasting the attention that we’ve been granted. When a school fritters away live classroom time requiring lectures instead of answering questions, they’re squandering precious real-time engagement. It’s far more productive to assign the lecture on video to be done at the student’s own pace. When a conference organizer (remember conferences?) has people wait in a long line to check in instead of using a web-driven smartphone system, they’ve burned a million dollars in time and travel expenses. One of the little-seen benefits of a networked world is that we’ve re-configured what needs to be done in a queue and what can be done in parallel.  The simple rule is: If this can be done on multiple tracks, at our own pace, it should be. If it creates a benefit when we all do it together, then let’s. People have already decided that they’d rather watch a movie at home. But people who love the theater can’t wait to get back to it. That’s because only one of them is better together, in real time. It’s much easier to demonstrate power (and to get a quick result) if we simply demand that people do it when we say. But the effort in creating a platform for interaction, attention and growth pays off. We’re not just respecting people’s time. We’re respecting their voice and their passion. Synchronized, real-time interaction is precious. It creates magic. We shouldn’t waste it on bureaucracy or displays of false control–it’s better saved for moments of connection and possibility. "
1010,Assume that both are true,"September 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/assume-that-both-are-true/,"Syncretism is the act of integrating new cultural ideas into the ones that already exist. It’s very common in the evolution of religious practice. Instead of ‘this’ or ‘that’, the answer might be ‘both’. Sometimes, we’re so eager to fight off a new idea (to protect an old one) that we miss an opportunity to imagine how our world could go forward instead. It’s much easier to be unequivocal. It’s also not that productive. It’s possible to be in favor of something without being against something else. "
1011,We are not astronomers,"September 11, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/we-are-not-astronomers/,"Unlike most of the sciences, astronomy is always done at a distance. You can see the stars, but you can’t do anything about them. Sometimes the media would like us to believe that we’re all astronomers, simply passive witnesses in a world out of our control. But the world is never out of our influence. Remembrance, connection, possibility, invention, empathy, insight, correction, care and justice are all up to us. We not only observe, but we make changes happen. Our participation (or apathy) leads to a different future. The ocean is made of drops. And the drops are up to us. Who else is going to care enough to make an impact? "
1012,Fuzzy type,"September 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/fuzzy-type/,"Digital typography always looks crisp. The words on our screen seem official, because they’re not the victim of sloppy or rushed handwriting. But sometimes, we might be better off with a little less crispness. Malka Older points out that polling data and predictions would probably be better understood if the graphs and charts were intentionally fuzzy. The less sure we are of the prediction, the fuzzier it ought to be. For example: The weather next Saturday is going to be crisp and clear, with no chance of rain. becomes And if it’s something we’re quite unsure about, better to set it like this: The fact that we have to squint a little bit is far more effective than adding a disclaimer about our margin of error. If you’re not willing to make it fuzzy, it might be better to not say it. "
1013,Speculation is the new luxury good,"September 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/speculation-is-the-new-luxury-good/,"A luxury good is one where the price paid is much higher than the apparent utility it offers. We pay extra precisely because it’s not a good value. The utility lies in how we and our peers think about it. The scarcity and bling of a luxury good are used to increase our status (in our own eyes and those in our cohort). And so, a top-end Mercedes isn’t much better at being a car than a Hyundai is, it simply costs more. As engineering has improved and knock-offs have increased, though, the two-hundred-year tradition of physical luxury goods is fading away. One thing that’s taking its place is speculation. An NFT has zero utility. It’s simply an entry in the blockchain that shows ownership of something that anyone could see for free.  But that in itself is a sort of luxury. There are now hundreds of digital NFTs each worth more than a million dollars each. Just like Reddit stocks, they change in value dramatically, they come with a story and they’re fun to talk about with your friends and peers. And one day, every one of them will be owned by someone who is unable to sell it at a profit.  Speculation is a great hobby if you can afford it, but it shouldn’t be confused with investment. "
1014,The modern curriculum,"September 8, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/the-modern-curriculum/,"We’ve spent 130 years indoctrinating kids with the same structure. Now, as some of us enter a post-lockdown world, I’d like to propose a useful (though some might say radical) way to reimagine the curriculum. It’s been a century of biology, chemistry, arithmetic, social studies and the rest. So long that the foundational building blocks are seen as a given, unquestioned and unimproved. The very structure of the curriculum actually prevents school from working as it should. I think that a significant shift is overdue. The one below could work for kids from the age of 6. It doesn’t eliminate the fundamentals of being educated, but it puts them into context. More important, because it’s self-directed and project-based, kids can choose to learn, instead of being forced to. We’re living in the age of an always-connected universal encyclopedia and instantly updated fact and teaching machine called the Net. This means that it’s more important to want to know the answer and to know how to look it up than it is to have memorized it when we were seven. Given the choice between wasting time and learning, too many people have been brainwashed into thinking that learning is somehow onerous or taxing. Introducing the modern curriculum The basic foundation is student-centered, self-directed projects. In service of learning to solve interesting problems and how to lead as well as follow. And to support that, the “courses” are practical tools students can use on their projects. Statistics–seeing the world around us clearly and understanding nuance, analog results and taxometrics (learning how to sort like with like). Realizing that everyone and everything doesn’t fit into a simple box. Learning to see the danger of false labels and propaganda, and the power of seeing how things are actually distributed. Games–finite and infinite, poker, algorithms, business structures, interpersonal relationships, negotiation, why they work and when they don’t. We all play them, even when they’re not called games. Communication–listening and speaking, reading and writing, presentations, critical examination and empathy. Can you read for content? Can you write to be understood? Can you stand up and express yourself, and sit still and listen to someone else who is working to be heard? What happens when we realize that no one is exactly like us? History and propaganda–what happened and how we talk about it. More why than when. The fundamental currents of human events over time. Citizenship–Participating, leading, asking and answering good questions. As a voter, but also as a participant in any organization. Real skills–Hard to measure things like honesty, perseverance, empathy, keeping promises, trust, charisma, curiosity, problem solving and humor. The scientific method–understanding what we know and figuring out how to discover the next thing. Learning to do the reading and show your work. There’s no point in memorizing the Krebs Cycle. Programming–thinking in ways that a computer can help you with. From Excel and Photoshop to C++. Art–expressing yourself with passion and consistency and a point of view. Not because it’s your job, but because you can and because it matters. Appreciating the art that has come before and creating your own, in whatever form that takes. Decision-making–using the rest of the skills above to make better choices. Meta-cognition–thinking about thinking, creating habits with intention. Here’s my question: If you could work for someone who had these skills, developed over the course of a decade or more of public school, would you want to? What about working next to them, or having them work for you? Or dating them? Or living next door or voting for them? If this is what we need and what we value, why aren’t we teaching it? "
1015,Intentional connection in the digital office,"September 7, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/intentional-connection-in-the-digital-office/,"The virtual office skeptic says, “we can’t go fully remote, because the serendipity of personal connection is too important.” The theory goes that watercooler conversations and elevator encounters add up to an emotional bond. Add to that the happy coincidence of overhearing a conversation where you have something to add or seeing something on a colleague’s screen, and the case is made for bringing people back to a building. Of course, what it overlooks is that in any building with more than 200 square feet of space, you’re only bumping into a tiny fraction of the people who work there. If they’re on another floor, or across the street, they might as well be in another country for all the serendipity that happens. [I recently talked with a CEO who was incensed by the stories (hyped by the media) of people who had finagled their way to two full-time jobs while working remotely. Apparently, if you spend a lot of time managing your calendar, faking your zoom calls and living in fear, you can get away with it for a while. Perhaps one in a thousand workers pulls this off. Better to worry about embezzlers, I think, because if someone is focused enough to pull off the two-job trick, they’re probably aware that all of this energy is better spent in other ways. But I digress…] The real challenge of remote work isn’t that it somehow erases the mysterious serendipity of magical office collisions. The problem is that making connections digitally requires enrollment and effort. If we do it with intent, it actually works better. We can collaborate in real-time on shared documents with people we’d never be able to meet face to face. We can have a six-minute impromptu brainstorming session and have it transcribed to a shared doc–anytime we have the guts to invite the right people to the right platform and say ‘go’. We can share a screen when we get stuck, and we can share it not with the closest person, but with the best person. And yes, we can deliberately take five minutes off to have a one on one conversation with someone at work about nothing in particular. The real magic of connections at the office was that we were having these connections without trying. It’s not that they were better, it’s that they were effortless. But they didn’t work for everyone in the same way. They often reinforced status roles and privilege. They were unevenly distributed and didn’t usually appear when we needed them. All of which added up to a new layer of stress for many people. No, we’re not sharing donuts. But if we put in the effort, we can share more than that. "
1016,Creativity and leadership,"September 6, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/creativity-and-leadership/,"They’re related. Management isn’t. Management uses power and authority to get people to do tasks you know can be done. Management is needed, but management is insufficient. Leadership is voluntary. It’s voluntary to lead and it’s voluntary to follow. If you’re insisting, then you’re managing… And creativity is the magical human act of doing something that might not work. If you know it’s going to work–then it’s management. Akimbo (a now-independent B corp that is pioneering cohort-based learning) has proven that creativity and leadership can be learned. They’re learned by doing, not by lectures. Consider the legendary altMBA, now in its sixth year. The First Priority Application Deadline is tomorrow, September 7th for altMBA’s January 2022 session. Learn to lead by doing the work. And I’m excited that the fifth session of the Creative’s Workshop, which inspired my book The Practice, begins September 28th. You can sign up and find details at this site. It’s a place to find the others, to share your work and most of all, to learn to see your creative practice in a powerful new way. Many people return to work with and learn from their peers again and again. Check out what they’re building at Akimbo… "
1017,Simple connection tools,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/simple-connection-tools/,"The Rolodex and the Filofax disappeared a while ago, but we’re still not all using the tools that make it easier to coordinate people and time.  I use Calendly to book various kinds of 1 on 1 discussions. I set it up to have access to certain windows in my calendar. Then, I just send the link (for example, to the 15-minute zoom call) and the other person can pick any time that works for them. Done. No back and forth. I use Streamyard to have conversations with one or two people that can be recorded or broadcast live on social media. This is a great substitute for a live Zoom meeting where you’re asking your entire team to watch a conversation as it happens. By sending them a recording instead, they can watch it at their convenience and even speed it up or watch it again. I have found that Doodle saves a ton of time when you’re trying to organize five or ten people to a coordinated live meeting or call. Instead of the endless circle of guesses, there’s a simple grid and people vote for what’s workable. It’s still not seamless, but it works. Shared workspaces like Google Drive and Lucid are a dramatic improvement over sending docs and back and forth. There’s really no comparison. And Zapier is next-level when it comes to moving information, regularly, from one digital silo to another. It takes a few minutes to set up, but then saves a huge amount of time, allowing you to get back to what you’re really here to do. Also Figma, which is generally used for laying out websites but is a powerful tool for graphic collaboration. Don’t forget Discourse, when you and a group are ready to get serious about developing ideas and discussion in scalable ways. Cooperation, connection and the power of being in sync is getting more important every day. We do better together. "
1018,Write something,"September 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/write-something/,"Then improve it. Then write something else. Repeat this process until you have a post. Then post it. Then repeat this process. There’s no such thing as writer’s block. There’s simply a fear of bad writing. Do enough bad writing and some good writing is bound to show up. And along the way, you will clarify your thinking and strengthen your point of view. But it begins by simply writing something. "

Instead of a nasty tweet or cutting remark, write it down in a private notebook. Instead of the elevator, take the stairs. Instead of doomscrolling, send someone a nice note. Instead of an angry email, make a phone call. Instead of a purchase seeking joy, consider a donation… "
1020,Negative marginal cost,"September 3, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/negative-marginal-cost/,"Marginal cost is how much extra you’ll need to spend to serve one more customer. The marginal cost of a hot dog is pretty low–if you don’t have to account for rent and labor and insurance and the rest, one more hot dog might only cost 15 cents to serve. On the other hand, the marginal cost of a custom pair of shoes is pretty high, because the labor and materials are expensive. The internet is transformative because so many things have a zero marginal cost. It doesn’t cost anything for WordPress to add one more user. And it doesn’t cost me anything to have one more person read this blog. But… When we factor in the magic of the network effect (things that work better when more people are using them) it turns out that the marginal cost isn’t zero. It’s actually negative. That means that it’s expensive for an online service to have fewer users.  Moving from expensive to cheap to free to “it’s a bonus to add one more person” changes our economy and our culture forever.

1021,Urgent cultural change,"September 2, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/urgent-cultural-change/,"Culture doesn’t change (much). Elements of human culture have been around for 100,000 years, and it persists. In fact, its persistence is a key attribute of why it works. People like us do things like this. In the last ten years, the culture has changed dramatically. We’re buffeted by shifts that are faster and more widespread than anyone can recall. The combination of media, illness, technology and climate have made each week different from the one that came before. Even early adopters and news junkies are becoming fatigued in the face of so much, so often. And this persistent shifting in the foundations of our culture is sharpening the rhetoric and resolve of folks who would rather things stay as they imagined they were. Our conversations and arguments about how we react to changes in the culture do little to change the forces that are shaping our future, though. Change persists whether we asked for it or not. Wishing and insisting won’t get us back to a world that’s static. Our response to change is often all we have control over. And the way we respond is how we create the next cycle of culture and possibility. "
1022,We get what the business model wants,"September 1, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/09/we-get-what-the-business-model-wants/,"The model for TV in the 1960s was three major networks supported by mass advertising. And so the shows that were produced were banal, reassuring and fairly inexpensive to produce. The goal was simply to keep someone from watching the other two channels. The business model in the Netflix age, with multiple streaming channels racing to gain market share among affluent consumers with a surfeit of choice, is fundamentally different. And as a result, so is the content being produced. It’s not that the TV people wanted to watch suddenly changed–it’s that the economic model for delivering it did. The business model for news has changed, and so the news has. Not what’s happening in the world, but the way the internet reports it. The business model for all the lifestyle (health, gossip, etc.) filler we see has changed as well. And so it goes… And for many people, the biggest change is this: the business model of social networks has replaced the simple act of being in community. "

And late ideas are acclaimed by most of the reviewers with opinions that don’t actually matter. Part of our challenge is that the lousy ideas get a very similar pre-launch response as the great ones. If you wait until the market is telling you exactly what it wants, you’re almost certainly too late. On the other hand, if you can find the resources to stick it out through the trough of skepticism, you’ll be around to discover if your idea was any good or not. The best shortcut is the long way forward. "
1024,How’d they do it without you?,"August 30, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/howd-they-do-it-without-you/,"Somewhere, perhaps nearby, it went well.  A family gathering happened and all the details were right. A project launched on Kickstarter and it succeeded. A person was hired and they were a good choice. The terms and conditions were updated, and no mistakes were made… It’s easy to use our indispensability as fuel. Fuel to speak up and contribute. That’s important. But it’s also possible for that same instinct to backfire, and for us to believe that if we don’t do it, it won’t get done right. That’s unlikely. "
1025,Is TikTok powerful?,"August 29, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/is-tiktok-powerful/,"To be powerful, a medium needs two things: The telephone reaches a lot of people, but AT&T has very little power because they have no influence over who makes phone calls. Lots of people have Sony TVs, but it’s Netflix that has the cultural power because they decide which shows are promoted on the start screen. People in the music business are flummoxed by the number of new acts that are showing up out of nowhere and becoming hits on TikTok. They’re talking about how powerful this company is. But it’s not. It’s simply reporting on what people are doing, not actively causing it. The folks with the power are the anonymous engineers, tweaking algorithms without clear awareness of what the impact might be. Google and Amazon used to invite authors to come speak, at the author’s expense. The implied promise was that they’re so powerful, access to their people was priceless. But the algorithm writers weren’t in the room. You ended up spending time with people who pretended they had influence, but were more like weatherpeople, not weather makers. Reporting the weather is different from creating the weather. There are still cultural weather makers, but they might not be the people we think they are. "
1026,Feature requests for monopolists,"August 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/feature-requests-for-monopolists/,"I’d like Gmail to be smart enough to automatically skip the spam folder for any mail that’s coming from someone I just wrote to. I’d like my Apple calendar to know that I never, ever schedule meetings at 3:30 am and to guess that I mean PM. And I’d like it to not only know what time I typed in, but to not make me hit an extra button every single time to change the time from the default. I’d like Final Cut Pro to allow me to watch the video I’m editing at a faster speed, the way all modern video playback permits these days. It would save hours and it’s got to be easy to implement. (Update: Fixed!) I wish Fedex had phone service like they used to, and that UPS would make it easy for me to let the driver know where packages go, even (especially) since driver turnover is so high. I’d like Netflix to offer much smarter sort mechanisms for discovery. It would be great if Google stopped acting like an evil overlord when it comes to search, discovery and their relentless obliteration of providers they decide are competitors. I have 80 more, but what’s the point, really? Without adversarial interoperability, monopolists don’t listen. They don’t have to. "
1027,Cyber-realists,"August 27, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/cyber-realists/,"Soon after the invention of the wagon, someone was able to move logs around much more easily. And shortly after that, someone had a wagon run over their leg. Wagons were used to deliver food but they also were put to use hauling weapons around. The cyber-optimists believe that the wheel of technology turns towards progress, perfecting our life a bit more each day. In which prior century would you rather live? The cyber-pessimists view technological change as a threat, to be examined daily and guarded against with vigilance. Neither default position is defensible or sustainable. Technological change doesn’t always make things better. It often comes with significant side effects and costs. And yet, thanks for the vigilance and hard work of some folks, technology also has a long track record of making us safer, healthier and even happier. The cyber-realist sees both and is focused on being careful about systemic change and lock-in, especially for cultural and organizational changes that are hard to walk away from. "

1029,The inevitable decline of fully open platforms,"August 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/the-inevitable-decline-of-fully-open-platforms/,"The spammers have found Substack. There’s a long history of useful tools on the internet attracting selfish con men. Substack is a platform for bloggers who want paying subscribers. They’ve done the technical work and quiet lobbying to get past the promo folder and the spam filters, and as a result, a blog on Substack is going to reach more people and come with a veneer of respectability. One option a company with a useful network has (whether it’s an email platform or a social network) is to curate what they feature. They’ve built an asset and that asset goes up in value when it attracts thoughtful users. The other option is to believe that ‘open’ is the answer, the more open the better. As we learned when we launched Squidoo a decade ago, it rarely is. People in disguise don’t make good neighbors. A fully open platform inevitably attracts selfish jerks, who, without curation, begin to degrade the very asset that made the platform appealing in the first place. Wikipedia used to be fully open, but persistent graffiti on useful articles meant that serious users were spending most of their time fixing what shouldn’t have been broken. Now, you have to earn the right to do certain edits to certain articles. The tension is simple: If a platform is carefully vetted and well-curated, it meets expectations and creates trust. If it’s too locked down and calcifies, it slows progress and fades away.  Radio, TV and magazines have always been curated. Even the letters to the editor are read by someone before they’re printed. The magazines that went to the web and let just about anyone write on their sites ended up with sites that just about no one trusted. Too much curation stifles creativity, opposing viewpoints and useful conversation. But no curation inevitably turns a platform over to quacks, denialists, scammers and trolls. Over time, the value of a uniform, a brand or a platform is defined by the worst people who wear it or use it. Trust and attention are in a long dance, but only trust wins in the long run. "
1030,Solving for stress,"August 24, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/solving/,"If we’re hungry, the obvious solution is to eat something. If we’re restless, it pays to get up and walk around. Is stress different?  Along the way, it seems as though we got confused about the best way to deal with the stress that comes from work and from the projects we work on.  “Push through the stress and on the other side, everything will be okay.” Simply get all the details right, get an A, get into a famous college, make the sale, polish the logo, do the pitch and then… reassurance will follow. The reassurance of success or even survival. The reassurance of external acclaim or simply relief. Now that everything’s okay, no need to be stressed! Until the next time. Which might be tomorrow. Reassurance is futile, because there’s never enough of it. Some folks manage to get their projects done without this sort of stress. They’re not using the search for reassurance as fuel.  The solution to stress isn’t reassurance. It’s accurately understanding the world as it is, and making choices about what we do and how we do it. But far more than that, we relieve stress by making choices about the stories we tell ourselves. What’s the difference between giving a speech to your dog and giving one on the TED stage? It’s the same speech. The difference is in the story we tell ourselves about the stakes, the opportunity and what might happen next. If that story gets debilitating enough, it can paralyze us. If you’re on a backpacking trip, there’s little doubt that ten more minutes of tired to get to the next campsite is a smart investment. A little more tired translates into a lot more rest. But if you’re at work, there’s not a lot of evidence that more stress is the best way to have less stress. Look for the story instead. [PS It’s not easy to change your story. For some people, and in some situations, it’s almost impossible. But that doesn’t mean that more stress in search of reassurance is going to make your search for a useful story any easier. If others in your situation have figured out a story that works for them, that’s a good sign that you might find one too. If no one has, changing your situation (if you can) might be the best way forward. But we need to get unhooked from the cycle of reassurance.] "
1031,Which problem are we solving?,"August 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/which-problem-are-we-solving/,"Solving a problem puts value creation first. Who’s it for? What problem does it solve? Would we miss it if you didn’t build it? At the beginning of the web, companies grew by focusing on the problems that their users had. As a result, people found a partner, a place to chat, a way to buy a book they’d been searching for, and yes, a chance to sell their Beanie Baby collection. They listed jobs and found them, sent messages around the world and looked up information they needed. There wasn’t always a business model, but the successful startups got successful because they were relentlessly focusing on solving a problem for the customer. If it was hard to explain why someone needed what you were doing, you had a real problem. This was the single best use of the venture money that flowed into the web twenty-five years ago. Patient investors said, “solve a customer problem well enough and the profit will take care of itself.” In just a few decades, a lot of the straightforward problems found profitable outcomes.  Many small businesses run into trouble because they start in a different place–the question they ask is: how does the owner make a living? Serving the customer comes second when the owner is focused too much on sunk costs and bills due.  Over time, successful businesses figure out how to align their goals with the customers they serve.   Even Beanie Babies solved a problem for someone. "

You can get a puppy at a pet mill/pet shop in about an hour (please don’t). But over the course of your lifetime with that dog, you’ll need about 3,000 hours of time and money to take care of him. The same time/money math applies to doing a good job on any social network. It only takes a few minutes to sign up for an account, but most users put in just enough time to be wasteful and not nearly enough time to generate anything of value as a result. Accepting international orders, supporting a different category of industrial customers, putting your customer service phone number on the box, opening a conflict or litigation–these are all puppy questions. The cool kids waste a lot of time because they forgot to think about them. "

Because money is tied into status, possibility, self-worth, connection, sustenance and more. How many people would be doctors if being a doctor was something you couldn’t get paid for? How many artists would mint NFTs if they couldn’t sell them? How many people would buy them if they couldn’t resell them?

That’s not because this step often fixes the problem, but if it does, you’ve found a very fast way to get back to work. The idea of the easy test is often ignored. Before spending three years in law school, why not get a temp job for a week at a law firm? Or spend a day reading depositions on file at the courthouse? If we can’t figure out how to understand and support a simple small business, it doesn’t make sense to spend our time decoding a complex large one. And if you want to make a feature film, figure out how to create a delightful three-minute short first. The ocean is made of drops. Start with those, not the waves.

1037,Time dilation,"August 17, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/time-dilation/,"You can read this post in six minutes. It took me more than an hour to write.  That extra editing and polish is a benefit to the reader. You can read this post instead of 100 others, because people highlighted or shared or ranked or otherwise filtered the other things you might be reading. That curation created value as well. The math here is compelling indeed: 1,000 would-be authors pitch books but only 30 get published. Each book takes a year to write but just six hours to read. And you didn’t read all thirty of them, just the one that had the best reviews… 10,000 hours of work by authors and editors to deliver six hours to you. The time dilation of polish and curation is possible because of asynchronicity and the one-to-many nature of publishing ideas. Asynchronous because you’re not doing it live, reading it as I write it.  And one-to-many because the work of a creator is multiplied across many readers. A friend recently sent me a note via voice mail. It was 14 minutes long. Because he didn’t spend another ten or fifteen minutes editing it into a three-minute long email, he wasted a ton of my time. But the nature of 1:1 interaction meant that it was either his time or mine, even steven. And listening to someone live, at an open mic nite or at a concert, promises wonderful surprise, but it also means that there’s bound to be a lot of dead time. Because no one is curating, and you have no selection advantage. One of the surprising unsung benefits of the worldwide web and the organized sharing of information is time dilation. A benefit we constantly waste by seeking the more human habit of mindlessly taking what comes, in real-time instead. "

That’s a ridiculous question, because they’re not opposites nor are they exclusive. It’s tempting to come to the conclusion that discipline is on one end of a spectrum and fairness is on the other. We see it in sports, business and politics all the time. A boss or coach is seen as a voice of discipline, right and wrong, certainty and power, while the ‘other side’ is all tied up in knots over what’s more fair. But they actually don’t oppose each other. Fairness can be executed with rigor. Fairness can lead to productivity and efficiency. Fairness is actually what forward motion is capable of. The opposite of discipline is actually laziness, and that’s often associated with fear. Fear of responsibility and fear of the truth. Responsibility and truth are required if we’re going to get on the right track. "

Perhaps you’ve decided: We’re going. That detour we hit, the pothole we narrowly avoided, the interruption that was unexpected–we experienced them, and we decided that we’re still going. Speed bumps are real. They’re a warning, or they’re unavoidable, and they hurt. Speed bumps cannot be denied. A speed bump that stops us from going is an obstacle. Often, the only difference between a speed bump and an obstacle is our decision about which one it is. Onward. "
1040,"Variability, industrialization and hating your job","August 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/variability-industrialization-and-hating-your-job/,"50 years ago, Oldham and Hackman proposed the job characteristics model. It so resonates with people that it feels like common sense: Job satisfaction is driven by five factors:  Task significance: Does the work you do create meaning or impact?Task identity: Do you feel ownership (emotionally) in the work you’re doing?Autonomy: Do you have the freedom to make choices?Skill variety: Is the task monotonous?Feedback: Are you in a place where you can safely and easily get feedback and use it to improve? If you think about your moments of flow, or the pastimes and hobbies we choose, they have all or most of these elements. And if you think about the most boring day you’ve ever had, or the worst job you had to do, it’s likely that most of these were missing. And yet, even though it’s easy to show that these five factors are critical in attracting and keeping skilled and talented workers, many organizations work overtime to eliminate them. “I’m just doing my job” is the antithesis of what works for workers. So why? Because industrial systems hate variability. They work to mechanize as many steps as they can, and if forced to use a human, work hard to keep that human within very specific boundaries. Better to have a three-hour Zoom call where everyone listens to the rules than risk having someone make a mistake, even one with no negative impact. Better to parcel out jobs to the cheapest available cog than depend on a linchpin to make a difference. And better to know in advance exactly what to expect. The industrial system would rather settle for mediocre than suffer between moments of brilliance and occasional defects. The solution is not surrendering to the system. It’s to realize that in a competitive marketplace, automating human performance is a shortcut to becoming a commodity. If you can automate it, so can your competitors.  Instead, we have the opportunity to do work that is unexpected, generous and original. It won’t be perfect, it won’t be the cheapest, but it will matter. "

He was an early radio and TV star, a comedian primarily remembered for just one line. The other day, a peer said, “well, if you’re giving me a Jack Benny choice…” It occurred to me that few people younger than us were ever going to use that reference. It ends with this generation. YouTube and the net have extended the half-life, dramatically. Instead of TV shows or memes disappearing forever, they simply move to the back row of search. But they’re still there. Will Pi Day or Rickrolls be a thing in 44 years? There’s been an explosion in pop culture. I created a book a long time ago: The Encyclopedia of Fictional People. Today, there would be far too many to ever fit in a book. It doesn’t make sense to create books on trivia or music or cultural ephemera because there’s just too much to fit inside. But our brains can’t keep track of all of it, so we go shallow and we forget the old stuff. Was Paul McCartney in a band before his solo career? I’m not sure the perfect preservation of culture is possible or even beneficial. It marches on, regardless. "
1042,Making a difference (making a point),"August 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/making-a-difference-making-a-point/,"There are countless ways to make a point. You can clearly demonstrate that you are angry, smart, concerned, stronger, faster or more prepared than the person you’re engaging with. But making a point isn’t the same thing as making a difference. To make a difference, we need the practical empathy to realize that the other person doesn’t know what you know, doesn’t believe what you believe and might not want what you want. We have to move from where we are and momentarily understand where they are. When we make a point, we reject all of this. When we make a point, we establish our power in one way or another, but we probably don’t change very much. Change comes about when the story the other person tells themselves begins to change. If all you do is make a point, you’ve handed them a story about yourself. When you make a change, you’ve helped them embrace a new story about themselves. And even though it’s more fun (and feels safe, in some way) to make a point, if we really care, we’ll do the hard work to make a difference instead. "

Software, careers, our culture–we develop them daily, adding a little bit at a time, toward the future we seek to create. "
1044,Thoughts on your book cover,"August 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/thoughts-on-your-book-cover/,"(Or your logo, your house, your tie, your business card, your website…) Like a suit or a skirt, it needs to fit. You’re going to be looking at it for a long time. And you’re certainly going to look at it more than any other human will, so if it’s not perfect, don’t sweat it, that’s mostly a personal challenge. The book cover should work at any size, because most people will see it before they buy it, and they will see it online, at just a one inch square size. The book cover should not only reflect the genre it’s in, it should send a powerful signal within that genre. One signal might be: It fits! I get the joke! This is what works, for example, in romance novels. If you’re looking for a book like this, this is a book like that. Another signal might be: I know what sophisticated books look like, but this one is deliberately not that. It’s for people who don’t buy a lot of books. Something like The One Minute Manager belongs here. And a third signal, my favorite, is: I know what the genre looks like, AND this book is in that genre, BUT, this book is a bestseller and so it is stretching the boundaries in a way that only an important new book can. It’s worth noting that your cover will almost certainly NOT sell even one copy of the book, but it can certainly unsell someone who might have considered your cover. So there’s not a lot of room for risky, daring maneuvers. You don’t need them. When in doubt, check out this gallery of movie posters  A lot of people spent a lot of time arguing at the meeting, but it doesn’t change how people engage with the movie. Unless you go too far away from the genre. "
1045,Leveling up isn’t easy,"August 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/levelling-up-isnt-easy/,"Once you’re in a slot, it’s harder and harder to move out of it. The status quo is here because it’s good at persisting. One option, particularly if you’re on your own, is to take your development seriously. Instead of simply clearing the incoming and reacting to what’s knocking on your door, you can invest the time to learn and the effort to practice. My friends at Akimbo have a few workshops that are worth considering: The Freelancer’s Workshop begins tomorrow. It’s about one simple idea: becoming the sort of freelancer who gets better clients. Because better clients change your work and your standing as well. Bernadette Jiwa’s Story Skills Workshop is back beginning tomorrow as well. The story we tell ourselves (and others) drives how we spend our days and who responds to us. The breakthrough Real Skills Conference (truly a conference, no speeches!) is back on August 19th but you’ll need to get tickets in advance. And, if you haven’t already, I hope you’ll consider the altMBA. Six years in, it’s proven itself, and now it’s your turn to leap. "
1046,The two train illusion,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/the-two-train-illusion/,"If you’re at the station, sitting on a train about to leave, you might notice that the train next to you is moving. But, perhaps, that train is sitting still and you’re moving. It’s hard to tell. Without the lurch of sudden acceleration, the only clue we have is that our relative position is changing. For most of us, it’s disconcerting–we know something is moving, but we’re not sure exactly what’s happening. Do we stay where we are… does anyone? Whether or not we commit to movement, the world never stays precisely as it was. Insisting that it does is simply a waste of time and a source of frustration. "
1047,Limiting data in search of information,"August 8, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/controlling-information/,"Neil Postman pointed out that bureaucracies control the flow of information. A form, for example, has no room for all the information, just the stuff that’s requested. It’s impossible to share all the information about anything, particularly at scale. The deluge that is the internet is an opportunity and a problem. With a few clicks, we’re able to get more data. And there’s no end in sight, since new data is posted faster than we can consume it. If you want to get better at astronomy, it doesn’t pay to get up to speed on all the books about gardening that you can find. Or texts on gambling, posts on the stock market or tweets about today’s political gambits. They won’t help you learn what you seek. It’s easy to be in favor of more data. After all, until we reach a certain point, more data is the best way to make a better decision. But then, fairly suddenly, more isn’t better. It’s simply a way to become confused or to stall. If you want more information, be careful about the data you seek out. "

1049,The end of the office,"August 6, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/the-end-of-the-office/,"The office is a fairly modern phenomenon. We got by for millenia without them. For a century, the office was simply a small room next to the factory or the store. The office was upstairs from the bakery, or next to the stockyard or the foundry. Proximity to the worksite was its primary attribute. For the last fifty years, though, more and more office workers never actually saw the factory floor.  Office culture became a thing onto itself, with layers of workers supporting other workers who supported workers who  helped improve the productivity of the factory, whatever sort of factory that was. And office culture was based on physical proximity. With most written communication taking far too long (a week for a letter!) and electronic communication insufficient in resolution, we built office towers to house the layers of office hierarchy that were evolving. We even named ‘the corner office’ after an executive’s physical location in the flow of information and power. But then the factory was moved even further away–most big company CEOs have never even visited all of their factories, retail outlets or development centers. And if you have more than a few, it means that no matter where you are, you’re not at most of them. And then email turned written communication into something instant and high resolution. Asynchronous messaging eliminates time. And then Zoom meant that location didn’t matter much either. Over the last 18 months, many of us have felt isolation as part of the dislocation from the office. Easily overlooked, though, is how much faster and more efficient so many systems became. Now, it’s not the communications system that’s holding us back, it’s our unwillingness to make change happen in concert with our peers.  Some organizations dealt with enforced work-from-home by using endless Zoom meetings as a form of compliance… a high-tech way to take attendance. But others leaned into the opportunity to create nimble, task-oriented decision making and communications hubs, ones that were no longer constrained by physical proximity. The last forty years have taught us that the technology that most disrupts established industries is speed. The speed of connection to peers, to suppliers and most of all, to customers. The speed of decision making, of ignoring sunk costs and of coordinated action. The internet has pushed all of these things forward, and we’ve just discovered, the office was holding all of them back. As social creatures, many people very much need a place to go, a community to be part of, a sense of belonging and meaning. But it’s not at all clear that the 1957 office building is the best way to solve those problems. "
1050,The specific yes and the meandering no,"August 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/the-specific-yes-and-the-meandering-no/,"When a change arrives, some people embrace it. And because it’s new, they have to be specific about why. They can talk clearly about the benefits it offers and why they feel drawn to the change it can produce. But many people don’t embrace the change. And more often than not, their objections are diffuse. They change their story over time, sometimes within the same conversation. When one objection is overcome, they switch to another one. They embrace mutually exclusive arguments and generally appear vague in their discomfort. That’s because the people who say yes are seeing and embracing what’s possible. There are definitely specific nos as well. People who have considered the details and implications of a new technology or cultural shift and then declined to use it.  But that’s not a meandering no. While some people reject a new idea simply because it doesn’t work for them, often the people who are saying no are afraid. They’re afraid of what change may bring, and they’re not sure they trust the innovation and the system enough to go forward. But we’ve been conditioned to avoid saying, “I’m afraid,” so if we’re uninformed and afraid, we make up objections instead. And even add angry bravado to our objections, simply as a way of hiding what’s really going on. A meandering no doesn’t turn into a yes because someone with a good idea listened very carefully to every spoken objection and rationally and clearly countered it. Because the objections aren’t real, and the naysayer isn’t listening very hard to the responses. Instead, the culture changes when a combination of two things happens: The last fifty years of technology adoption show that this happens every single time a shift spreads across the culture. Every time. "
1051,Not for Diana,"August 4, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/08/not-for-diana/,"Demetri Martin tells the story of seeing a necklace for sale. It says, “Diana” on it. “Wait,” he says to the owner of the jewelry store, “you’d probably sell more if it said ‘Not Diana’ on it.” After all, just about everyone isn’t named Diana. The absurdity of this story is precisely why focusing on the smallest viable audience makes so much more sense than trying to make average stuff for average people. "

At the same time that air travel is becoming less favored by businesses, the world is more connected than ever before. There are lots of organizations that want to do business internationally but might not be as eager to fly across the world to visit a factory or meet with a supplier. And so the pharmaceuticals, the software, the fabrics, the call centers, the chips—it becomes ever more difficult to truly understand how to source and produce the components that world-based products demand. The expediter is local talent. They speak the language. They are retained by the company to join in on zoom calls and to do site visits if needed. The modern expediter provides something that’s more useful than ever: insight. My friend Jojo does this in China. I’m guessing that there are others who do it in many other countries around the world, but they’re not easy to find. In the original post, I offered to put together a list of expediters suggested by my readers. I got more than 200 responses. Here’s the very lightly edited, unvetted list. "

Clocks have an agenda. They aren’t a part of the human condition–they’re fairly recent. They enabled industrialism, and the very fact that they have an ‘alarm’ built in is a clue. It’s definitely possible to put time to good use. But if we’re without a compass and a goal, we can find it using us. "

For just about everything, there’s level 1 (too cheap, total loss, all money and effort less than 1 is wasted) and there’s level 2 (spending ever more money to get not much more than investing at level 2 would have created.) This rule applies to copyediting, to used cars, to the building of bridges and everything in between. What’s the point of underspending on a software project? You merely end up with nothing but frustration. And the gold-plated RFP that comes from deep within the bureaucracy is designed to avoid finger-pointing and blame, not to actually buy something that gets us a return–that might lead to even more waste. Better to pay a little more than you should and get something you can use than pay too little and end up with nothing at all. Better as well to avoid paying a ridiculous amount for something that never satisfies–better to live without until you learn to see the curve. Learning to see the curve–that’s the benefit of deliberate experience, well earned. "
1055,Easily confused,"July 31, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/easily-confused/,"There are countless arguments about words that we often don’t understand the way someone else might. Words like education, learning, merit, talent, skill, privilege, smart and successful. They might not mean what we think they do. Well-educated isn’t the same thing as smart. Talents are different than skills. Learning is not the same as education. Successful isn’t the same as rich. Agreeing on what we mean is a great place to begin. "
1056,Fresh herbs,"July 30, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/fresh-herbs/,"Chain restaurants rarely use fresh herbs. They’re uneven, unreliable and expensive, and most diners have been conditioned to want food that’s more processed and bland. The same is true for most of what we buy and sell. It’s becoming ever more predictable, pre-processed and cost-reduced. The pressure tends to go in one direction–turn your work into a commodity, smooth over the edges and fit in all the way. That seems hard to argue with, particularly if you want to be popular and profitable. But the restaurant that makes the best sabich in all of New York City takes a different approach. At Nana, in an obscure shopping mall on the outskirts of an outer borough, they’re serving memorable food that doesn’t match the prevailing industrial model. You can’t get something similar from your grocer’s freezer. It’s distinctive and probably a lot more difficult to produce on a regular basis.  The same could be true for what you choose to do. It might not get you a Fortune 500 company as a client, and probably won’t make you #1 on whatever bestseller list tracks the one that’s for everyone, but it might be exactly the work that you’re proud to do. Thanks, Gina, for caring. And for anyone who goes out of their way to add fresh herbs when they don’t have to. "
1057,“Make the sign bigger!”,"July 29, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/make-the-sign-bigger/,"Make the announcement louder. Make the logo bigger. Yell. Call more people on the phone to sell them an extended warranty. Send more emails. Hustle harder. None of it works. The problem with the fountain isn’t that they didn’t make a big enough sign. The problem is that the fountain itself is poorly designed. It’s an attractive nuisance, a dangerous thing to put in the middle of a boring courtyard. The sides invite sitting and standing, and the height beckons people to walk in and around it. And the consistent cues of its design aren’t going to be undone by an ugly, intrusive sign, even one in red with ALL CAPS. And louder and more persistent PA announcements aren’t going to help if the situation people are in has lulled them into not listening. And a bigger logo isn’t going to get someone to care about your company if the product and your story don’t resonate with them. Insisting on a bigger interruption is lazy. It’s lazy because if you really cared about solving the problem, you’d change the situation, not  yell about it. If you get the design right, you can whisper instead. "
1058,Progress is a trade,"July 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/progress-is-a-trade/,"It’s easy to imagine that over there, just a few steps ahead, our problems will disappear. Pessimists, of course, are sure that instead of disappearing, tomorrow will make things worse. The truth is pretty simple: All we do, all we ever do, is trade one set of problems for another. Problems are a feature. They’re the opportunity to see how we can productively move forward. Not to a world with no problems at all, but to a situation with different problems, ones that are worth dancing with. HT to Gabe. "
1059,Narrative and feelings,"July 27, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/narrative-and-feelings/,"Which comes first? The feelings, the facts, or the story we tell ourselves that leads to the feelings? It’s surprising that I ended up at the college I went to. Back in 1978, there were two ways to visit campus if you were taking a subway from the airport. One route went through Harvard Square, with its magical campus, and then via bus down youth-friendly Mass. Ave., past Steve’s famous ice cream parlor and on to the small school. The other route, the route the admissions office suggested when I called them, went through gritty Lechmere, then by bus past wood-frame houses built in the 1950s, then some more grittiness and then on to the back of the campus. It would have been easy to use the feelings that the second route created in me, a solo traveler barely 17 years old, to invent a narrative about what was missing from this choice of school. We like to think we make complicated decisions based on rational analysis, but most of the time, we actually make an emotional decision and then invent a rational analysis to justify it. That’s why so many kids pick a school based on how it felt to go to a football game there in October. Or why it matters if it’s raining on the day you visit. Feelings first, then they create a story. Facts come in third. If our goal is to help people make better choices, it helps to first create better feelings. "

1061,“Let the market fix it”,"July 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/let-the-market-fix-it/,"After all, the marketplace is scalable, independent, self-funding, convenient and persistent. Except there are problems that the market hasn’t solved, and probably can’t. A century into this worldwide experiment, the market hasn’t solved mass education, it’s made obesity and health problems worse, and it has dumped an enormous amount of long-term toxic waste into the world where we all live. Patient capital can work wonders, but networked economies are becoming ever more impatient in their race for basis points and shortcuts. When we hand a chronic problem over to the market, it might be because we can’t bear to look at it or take responsibility for the hard work and sacrifice it will take to solve it. If the market can solve a problem, it’s a bargain. Markets are effective listening devices and resilient and often self-coordinating. But expecting the market to solve every problem isn’t useful. Sometimes, the specific tools of the open market aren’t aligned with the problem at hand. Externalities, patience and incentives are all worth considering before we decide the problem will solve itself. "

1063,“I don’t want to play”,"July 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/i-dont-want-to-play/,"Tactical approaches can undermine useful strategies. And knowing your goals and the reason for the game are the best way to avoid the problem. Tactical thinking forces us to think in innings. It says, “here’s a situation, what’s your best reaction/response?” The strategic approach has a different question, “Does playing this particular tactical game get me closer to the reason I’m here in the first place?” Strategies don’t change. They’re not a secret. It doesn’t matter if your peers or opponents know your strategy. Tactics, on the other hand, change often, and are usually best kept quiet. So why do we get so hung up on tactics? It begins with: Strategies can be frightening. If we say what we want and how we hope to achieve it, two things could happen: we could fail, and that would disappoint us, or we could succeed, and that would frighten us. It’s easier to simply react by engaging in another tactical round that the world has presented to us. You can spend your days doing nothing but playing with tactics, and never realize you didn’t even have a strategy. What do you want? What change do you seek to make, how do you want to spend your days? How will get you there? Figuring out which games you aren’t going to play is a fine step on the road to figuring out your strategy.

It might be because of the indoctrination of a lifetime of growing up in a particular culture. It might be because of personal experiences they’ve had with others that didn’t work out very well. And it might be because what you’re saying contradicts what they’re seeing. Whichever it is, they nod their head, politely listening, but don’t change their expectations at all. Because they’ve been taught through experience not to believe that things are going to be different. If you’ve read ten employee handbooks that say one thing when the company does another, you’re likely to not believe the eleventh one. When you hear a boss say ‘people before profits’, you’re likely to hold back before baring your soul and sharing your fears. “Trust me” is easy to say, especially when you mean it, but hard to hear. Showing tends to beat telling, and it takes a very long time to earn trust when you’re running counter to culture. "

And that group of 100 people might be able and willing to help you improve your work, or to introduce you to resources you need, or to become clients. Which might lead to more opportunities, conversations and improvements. Step by step. Like building a house. It’s not direct marketing, which is focused on action and measurement and a funnel. It’s directed marketing, because you’re generous and specific about precisely who the work is for. And you’re willing to ignore most everyone else. "

We see the value in someone else directing our actions. On one hand, giving someone else authority over our effort is challenging, because they might not be aware of how much we have in reserve or what else we’ve got going on. But the alternative is emotionally taxing: Taking initiative. Instead of calling it “taking initiative” perhaps it would be more accurate to say “giving initiative.” Because it’s in short supply and we need more. Deciding to do something that no one expected or ordered you to do. Reading something or developing a skill on your own account. Raising your hand, speaking up, launching a new project… We’ve been trained to avoid all of these things. And the proof is that four-year-olds don’t have trouble with any of them.

The newspaper, social media, dinner time conversation, the principal’s office, sportscasters, the weather, the boardroom–the conversation is almost always about the emergency of the moment. The thing that’s happening all at once. We have a volunteer fire department in town, but we don’t often have a volunteer corps dedicated to long-term culture change. Even typing that out seems odd. But the chronic problems define our future, and the persistent changes over time brought us to where we are. Evolution of species is a chronic process. And most of us die from chronic illnesses. What would it take for us to spend even a fraction of our time and energy and attention on the chronic instead of the urgent? Drip by drip. "

When a kid takes driver’s ed, shouldn’t they teach what to do if they get a ticket or have a fender bender? If you’re a district attorney, your staff might go after an innocent person. If you’re a doctor, a patient might die. If you’re a blogger, you might post something that isn’t correct. That’s not the moment to start coming up with a plan. Are you ready and eager to say, “now that I know what I know, I’m going to change my course?” Are you open and willing to say, “I didn’t know that key fact then, but I should have, and I’m building systems to make sure I will know it next time?” Doubling down on wrong always makes things worse.

That’s the power of industry to shape our world–it’s very good at producing more of what’s finding a market. And so we paved more roads, built more cars and pumped more oil. And we made more telemarketing calls, sent more spam and bought more ads. And we built more houses, produced more bandages and developed ever more convenient ways to shop. It doesn’t matter if it’s hard work. The system finds a way. It’s beyond dispute that industry is an efficient way to produce more. The question is: More of what? "
1072,A return to cottage work,"July 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/a-return-to-cottage-work/,"Businesses care about productivity. At the core of their ability to create a profit is the simple formula of work produced per dollar spent. Frederick Taylor used a stopwatch to revolutionize the production of cars and just about everything else. By measuring the output of each person on the line, he was able to dramatically increase how much a company like Ford could produce for every hour of labor it used. Working in a system like this can be exhausting. While it brings the comfort of knowing precisely what’s expected in any given moment, it’s also an endless tug of war between humanity and profit. Many in the idea economy haven’t recognized the rare situation that they might be in. Better pay, better working conditions and a job that’s hard to measure with a stopwatch. So you’ve got the chef for the Grateful Dead cooking you lunch and a purple couch in the lobby, along with a long series of perks and benefits. I had one friend who worked at a law firm for two years before they realized that he kept switching departments every few months so he could avoid being asked to bill too many hours. But management has never stopped looking for a way to measure output. Sooner or later, they do, or the company disappears. It can vary from the insulation of paying for your time (but keeping track of impact created) all the way to paying by the keystroke, the click or the sale. When bosses had trouble measuring output, they bought our time, and then layered ‘process’ and bureaucracy on everything as a stand-in for actual productivity. But now, measurement is everywhere, freelancers and contractors are easier to find, and work is being atomized. Being good at process is a weak stand-in for being good at work. The shift to self-directed days, working from home, focusing on projects and not simply selling our time means that this push back to cottage industry management is going to be accelerated. Before Manchester factories were up to speed, this was normal–you did your work on your kitchen table and got paid by the piece. The alternative is to double down on work that’s truly hard to measure, to sign up for emotional labor and experimentation and group leadership and working on the frontier. These jobs are harder to get, harder to keep and are fraught precisely because they’re less measurable. These are the jobs that create quantum leaps in value, but are hard to spec and manage. Companies aren’t going to trust you because you asked them to. They’ll do it when they believe that you are one of the few people who can lean outside of the comfort zone and bring back something extraordinary. It’s pretty clear to me that we’re unlikely to see much in the way of steady jobs where someone tells you what to do all day, allows you to allocate your own time and effort, but doesn’t measure your output. Because one thing that we all keep learning is that if something can be measured, it probably will be. "
1073,A coaching paradox,"July 13, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/a-coaching-paradox/,"At the top tier of just about any sort of endeavor, you’ll find that the performers have coaches. Pianists, orators and athletes all have coaches. In fact, it would be weird if we heard of someone on stage or on the field who didn’t have one. And yet, in the world of business, they’re seen as the exception. Part of the reason is that work feels like an extension of something we’ve been doing our whole lives. Figure skating isn’t like school, but showing up at work seems to be. “I’ve got this,” is a badge of honor. And part of the reason is that a few coaches have made claims that stretch belief, and we’re not actually sure what they do. It doesn’t help that there’s no easy way to identify what sort of coach we need or what we’re going to get… It turns out that the people with the potential to benefit the most from a coach are often the most hesitant precisely because of what coaching involves. Talking about our challenges. Setting goals. Acknowledging that we can get better. Eagerly seeking responsibility… And yet we avert our eyes and hesitate. It might be because having a coach might be interpreted as a sign of weakness. And what if we acknowledge our challenges but fail to overcome them? It could be that we don’t want to cause change to happen, or that we’re worried that we will. One company I admire believes in coaches so much that they’ve put several on staff, ensuring that their leadership all benefit from one. But mostly, it’s something we have to pay for ourselves. And so, paying for a coach, for something that’s hard to measure, which might be socially awkward, to get better at something that feels normal—combine that with a hesitancy to ask for help—it’s a wonder anyone has a coach. The paradox is that the very things that hold us back are the reasons we need a coach in the first place. [Email subscribers!

1074,Magnetic or sticky?,"July 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/magnetic-or-sticky/,"Some projects and ideas are magnetic. They attract large numbers of people. And some are sticky. The folks who show up stick around and make the project part of their lives on an ongoing basis. Rarely, something is both magnetic and sticky. Often, it’s neither. "
1075,Good writing is cheaper than special effects,"July 11, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/good-writing-is-cheaper-than-special-effects/,"In movies, that’s obvious. It costs far less to make The Big Lebowski than a Marvel movie. But the metaphor applies to just about any sort of creative project. We often err on the side of ‘special effects’. It’s easier to staff it up, to spend the money, to aim for slightly-above average. Committees and corporations are happy to pay extra for reassurance and consistency. It trends toward mediocre, because mediocre feels predictable and manageable. But the race to spend more and more on special effects, on promo, on hype, on industrial might–it might be worth more to take the time and invest the effort to design something great instead. "
1076,The current and the wind,"July 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/the-current-and-the-wind/,"The wind gets all the attention. The wind howls and the wind gusts… But the wind is light.  The current, on the other hand is persistent and heavy. On a river, it’s the current that will move the canoe far more than the wind will. But the wind distracts us. Back on land, the current looks like the educational industrial complex, or the network effect or the ratchet of Moore’s Law and the cultural trends that last for decades. The current is our persistent systems of class and race and gender, and the powerful industrial economy. It can be overcome, but it takes focused effort.  On the other hand, the wind is the breaking news of the moment, the latest social media sensation and the thin layer of hype that surrounds us. It might be a useful distraction, but our real work lies in overcoming the current, or changing it. It helps to see it first, and to ignore the wind when we can. "
1077,Abracadabra,"July 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/abracadabra/,"The word is thousands of years old, and it probably comes from the Aramaic: “I will create it as I speak.” We’re much more likely to believe what we say than the other way around. Outline, illustrate and argue and you will make it more likely that you believe what you’re saying. Which is a great reason to be really careful about the arguments we make, because we might end up believing them. "
1078,Old-school snobs,"July 8, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/old-school-snobs/,"Two centuries ago, shoemakers in England were called snobs. (It sort of rhymes with cobbler). Good ones combined care with quality. They put in the effort to make a shoe that exceeded expectations, and leaned into the possibility of their craft. The others were simply hacks, trying to get by with little effort. In an ironic and cruel twist, the term “snob” was taken from these committed craftspeople and used to describe someone who looked down on others, particularly those with fewer resources. A hard-working cobbler was viewed with disdain, because they had no silver spoon. It was also used to describe someone who gave those with more money or caste a persistent benefit of the doubt that they might not deserve. And for a century the term has been pushed beyond cultural economics to describe someone who is a defender of scarcity and the status quo. A wine snob, for example, insisted on an expensive vintage, preferably from certain parts of Europe. The circle comes around, as it often does. The best kind of snob is a throwback to that original cobbler and their customers, someone who can see past appearances or the traditional approaches and instead looks for care and quality. Which can happen regardless of where someone comes from. It’s not enough to be a cobbler. You need to be one who cares. Effort and good judgment lead to good taste and cultural leadership. We shouldn’t settle. "
1079,What did you learn on vacation?,"July 7, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/what-did-you-learn-on-vacation/,"It always seemed like a silly question–school is for doing what you’re told, summer vacation was for discovering all the things that were worth caring about. As adults though, regardless of our hemisphere, we’re always on vacation from school. No tests or diplomas, simply a huge array of choices. And in a world that keeps changing, regardless of how much we might want it to slow down, learning is the attribute that is often overlooked.

1080,The focus on the last thing,"July 7, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/the-focus-on-the-last-thing/,"The play before time ran out. The last speech of the campaign. The typo on your resume or the spot on your tie. The final decision before the company declared bankruptcy. We focus on the thing that happened just before the end. And that’s almost always an unimportant moment. Things went wrong (or things went right) because of a long series of decisions and implementations. A misguided strategy, a bad hire, a brilliant insight about network effects–these are the acts with leverage, not the obvious thing that all the pundits would like to talk about. When you get to the thing before the last thing, don’t sweat it. It’s almost certainly too late to make the outcome change. On the other hand, when you’re quietly discussing the thing before that before that before that before that, it might pay to bring more attention to it than the circumstances seem to demand. Because that’s the key moment. "
1081,Customer development,"July 6, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/customer-development/,"Organizations grow when they develop a base of customers. Companies find profits, non-profits serve their cause, political ideas become movements for just one reason: they develop a group of people who are changed by what they do. For ease, let’s call them ‘customers.’ Once you see that, it becomes pretty clear that this is the most difficult and important thing that the organization does, and in fact is the only one you can’t outsource or work your way around. It’s possible but unlikely that the first product or service you develop will be exactly what potential customers were already hoping for. That’s why failure is the fuel that moves new projects forward. Failure is a way of discovering one more thing that customers didn’t want, and perhaps, learning a bit about what they might want. By iterating without tears or fears, organizations are able to discover things about their future customers. Sometimes (actually, almost every time) the innovation an organization brings to the market isn’t instantly and universally adopted. While there are people who get satisfaction and status and results by going first (early adopters), most customers would prefer to wait. These customers see little upside in investing the time to be a pioneer or in taking the risk to go first. [And to be clear, that’s true for non-profit donors, voters and any other sort of ‘customer’]. And so you see the paradox: on one hand, organizations need to be agile and eager to pivot as they engage with a market that’s invisible or skeptical, but on the other hand, ideas don’t spread through a marketplace instantly. That’s one reason why it’s so important to identify your smallest viable audience. The smallest group of customers that will enable you to thrive. By seeing them, obsessing about them and serving them, you can refine your product at the very same time that you establish the conditions for growth. At this stage, growth can come from one of two places: It could be that your core audience begins to tell the others. That you’ve built the network effect into your offering, so that it works even better when people tell their friends and colleagues. This is Tom’s shoes or Starbucks coffee. This is Twitter and the ice bucket challenge as well. When you create a purple cow, the remarkable nature of your product or service is in fact part of the reason people buy it, and the reason they talk about it. Not because it helps you, but because it helps them. Or, just as powerful, it could be that your success at serving this small but viable audience gives you the team, the cash flow and most of all, the social proof to begin to find a different set of customers. Customers that might want a different set of benefits, a different story, a different way to change.  Often, this shift to a different customer set is difficult, because now you might feel stretched, you might even have to leave behind the people who originally embraced you and your offering. Patagonia doesn’t spend a lot of time selling removable pitons to hard-core rock climbers anymore. As they shifted to become the organization they are now, they probably got a lot of push back from people who said, “no one buys from them anymore, it’s too popular.” Both approaches share two underlying principles: You’re telling a story. You’re making a change. Being clear about ‘who’s it for?’ and ‘what’s it for?’ is the actual hard work of developing customers. And if you’re not gaining traction, deciding to hype harder is not the right choice. Traction doesn’t come from more social posting or working your network and asking for favors. Traction comes from accompanying the customers you’ve chosen on a journey that they’re eager to go on. And the hard work of customer development is finding a reason for your customers to bring in new customers, or discovering a path where you can help non-customers discover what you offer and eagerly engage with it.

1082,Rigor and Rigid,"July 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/rigor-and-rigid/,"They sound the same but work in opposite directions. They both began as Latin terms for stiff and unyielding, but now, they’ve diverged. A rigid approach is easy to describe, but it’s brittle. Being rigid takes little imagination and a fair amount of fear. On the other hand, approaching our craft with rigor means that we’re able to eagerly shift in the face of reality. We have rules for ourselves, but one of the rules is to adapt.  Rigor is a combination of expertise, awareness and flexibility. And it’s often in short supply. "
1083,From/to,"July 4, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/from-to/,"Freedom has a partner, and its name is responsibility. It’s easy to insist on all the things we should be free from.  But then we realize that we also have the freedom to act, to lead and to confront our fear and our selfishness. Once we realize our own agency, freedom begins to feel like a responsibility. The freedom to make a difference. "
1084,Lines and curves,"July 3, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/lines-and-curves/,"Working with a ruler is pretty straightforward. Just about anyone can extend a line, or fix something straight if it breaks. It’s on the line or it’s not. But curves? Curves are complex and hard to get right. It turns out that humans bring curves with them, wherever we go. "
1085,Folk typography,"July 2, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/folk-typography/,"Why is type getting so bad? Well, actually, the people who are noticing it, the ones who care about kerning or keming or serifs or the rest… we’re not the reason that it’s getting bad. It’s all the people who don’t notice it. For thousands of years, type was something you did with your hands. If you were a writer, you were also the person who was putting the words onto the paper. It was only in the last few centuries that setting type was a craft, reserved for people with a printing press, or a set of Letraset rub-down letters or even a top-of-the-line Mac with the right software. And so, into this specialty, principles developed. There was actually a difference between professional and amateur typesetting. There was style and craft and insight that was worth paying for. There were magazines and conferences about what looked good and right and professional and cutting edge. Of course, social media changed that. Memes and the rest, built on a flimsy foundation of Comic Sans and Arial and Impact. Whatever’s handy. And then what was handy became popular, and what was popular became the new standard. And this is always the way. When the public gets tools, they use them, without regard for the rules that might have come before. But there’s still a desire for craft, and people, particularly over 30, are eager to judge a book, not by its cover but by its type. Even if they don’t know why. There will be a new set of standards for type, just as the quality of every folk innovation has improved over time. "
1086,Use your hips,"July 1, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/07/use-your-hips/,"There’s almost no sport or physical activity where that advice isn’t useful. Golf. Ping pong. Dancing. The more likely it is that people are tempted to focus on their hands or feet, the more the hips really matter. And you’ve already guessed the metaphor. The work we do needs a solid foundation. The biggest muscles are around the hips, just as the biggest leverage comes from our approach to cash flow, market presence and hiring. Instead of focusing on short-term wins or delighting the crowd with jazz hands in whatever form they take, it makes sense to get our hips right first. "
1087,The market is a listening device,"June 30, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/the-market-is-a-listening-device/,"It’s the most resilient, most granular technique available for us to figure out what people want. When individuals have the freedom to choose, they often do. At the same time that markets enable choice, large-scale industrial capitalism works overtime to remove it. The main job of most big company CEOs is to figure out how to lock in customers, because customers without choices stick around longer and pay more. Some organizations exist to satisfy market demand. Some work hard to create market demand. And some are focused on capturing demand and then eliminating the market itself. The internet has created changes in both directions. We have dramatically more choice when it comes to ways to spend/waste our time, but we also have to deal with the natural monopolies created by the network effect and the hidden levers that drive toward lock in. If we’re not alert, many of the choice-driven markets we depend on will disappear. "
1088,Luck is not a strategy,"June 29, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/luck-is-not-a-strategy/,"Advice from people who have gotten lucky is a tricky thing. Perhaps they did x, y and z, and then got lucky. As story telling creatures, it’s natural to assume that x, y or z had something to do with it. Which can lead to bad advice. Consider the guy who smoked like a chimney, drank like a fish and lived to be 100. It’s not clear that his habits helped him get lucky. Luck might not be a strategy, but setting yourself up to be lucky might be. Luck is a tactic. An unpredictable one, sure, but if it works, it works. A useful strategy might be: I’m going to establish a pattern of resilience and apply information and testing to discover what works. And one of the tactics to support that strategy could be showing up in places where luck can help me out. If I can persist long enough, I’ll get lucky. But that’s very different than the false correlation of past behavior with lucky outcomes. "
1089,What’s new?,"June 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/whats-new/,"That’s a fun question, but not nearly as useful as, “what’s effective?” Pick up a fifteen-year-old copy of Wired, or a business book from 1969 and see what’s still around. The technology keeps changing, but connection and trust are what still work. Ideas that spread, win. Ideas that stick are worth even more. You can race to be first on a new platform, but it’s far better to be the voice that we would miss if you weren’t there. "
1090,Anecdotes are not science,"June 27, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/anecdotes-are-not-science/,"Phrenology was discredited a long time ago. People who should have known better were sure that by studying the bumps on someone’s head, a trained expert could divine insights about their personality. It ended up being used to advance racist and class-based agendas, and was completely debunked. It faded away for decades. And it’s back. New technology creates the appearance (and sometimes the actual fact) of new insights, new resolution, new certainty. We might not know what an oscillation overthruster is, or why single photon imaging is better, but it sounds well studied and precise. A chart from Excel seems a lot more certain than one that’s hand drawn. In our search for anecdotes, particularly about health, behavior or the economy, this apparent increase in accuracy opens the door for more hope, even if it’s not based on widespread results. The charts used to describe the behavior of stocks and tokens keep getting more complex and refined, but they’re still unable to accurately predict what will happen next week. The fancy readouts of horoscopes or biorhythms glow with many insignificant digits, but they still tell us nothing about someone’s future, any more than palm reading does. And an x-ray can tell us with great certainty if your appendix has burst, but a SPECT scan is useless in determining someone’s personality without the aid of an in-person consultation, which is all we’ve ever needed. In fact, that’s precisely how phrenology used to work: meet with someone first, then find validation in the mysterious reading of their bumps. The standard worth checking for is easy: From the chart or the bumps or the scan alone, without meeting the patient, tell me what you see and what’s going to happen next. They put Einstein’s brain in a jar, but learned nothing from it. The folks who ate green coffee beans or swallowed colloidal silver have plenty of anecdotes to support their placebos. And when they move on from pyramids to magnets, the anecdotes will follow them. But anecdotes aren’t science. Like coincidences, they’re by-products of our story-seeking minds, connections we make as we search for solace in a confusing world. And sometimes marketers use the anecdotes to make a sale and hurt the customer. Very few interventions that involve humans are simple. We need more than a double-blind study, because humans aren’t double-blind. We know what’s on offer, and the story we tell ourselves changes how we behave. Science is often not the right answer to every question–it often fails to deliver what we need. But hustles pretending to be science are almost always a bad idea. In fact, stories are too important and worthwhile to need a babble of pseudoscience that some would like put on them. Placebos are powerful, and if they’re cheap and benign, I’m all for them. My day is filled with placebos of all kinds, because they work. The problems happen when they stop being benign, when they keep us from appropriate treatment and when they’re used against us… Somehow, we’ve persuaded ourselves that we need to pretend that our anecdotal interventions are actual scientific breakthroughs instead of embracing the fact that we’re humans, and that stories work on us. By wearing the mantle of science, hypesters are not only able to charge more, but they also degrade the reputation of the very methods they purport to use–when we see firsthand that pretend science doesn’t work, we’re tempted to imagine that the same is true for interventions that are actually studied and tested. We wouldn’t fly on a plane or cross a bridge that was built with the same doublespeak that many folk medicines and soothsayers use. They have their place, they make us who we are, but anecdotes aren’t science. "
1091,Furious/curious,"June 26, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/furious-curious/,"They rhyme, but they have opposite meanings. It’s very difficult to feel both emotions at the same time, and one is far more productive than the other. "
1092,When the objections change,"June 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/when-the-objections-change/,"An objection is a useful way to understand what someone wants or needs. “I might buy that, but I need one that comes in red,” helps you learn that the color choice matters to this person. Sometimes, it’s possible that an objection can be overcome. “I just found a red one in the warehouse,” certainly deals with the color issue. If that happens, if new information overcomes a previous objection, it’s often followed by a new objection. “The safety issue you said you were worried about is addressed in this peer-reviewed study…”  And then there’s another objection, and another… What’s actually happening is the person is saying, “I’m afraid.” It might be, “I’m afraid to tell you that I’m not interested.” But it’s more likely that it’s, “I’m afraid of the unknown, I’m afraid about what my friends will think, I’m afraid about money…” And there are two reasons that people won’t tell you that they’re afraid. First, because our culture has taught us that fear is something to be ashamed of. But far more than that, because we’re concerned that if we share our fear, you’ll push us to go forward, and we’re afraid to do that. When dealing with someone who’s afraid, when they’re objecting to something that’s important, it’s tempting to imagine that more evidence will make a difference–that it’s the objections that matter. But more studies of efficacy or public health or performance aren’t going to address the real objection. Money (“it’s too expensive”) is a common objection, but it’s often not the real reason. Price is simply a useful way to end the conversation. “I’m afraid” is something we don’t want to say, so we search for an objection instead. And what leads to forward motion? Either a shift in the culture, in peer approval, which lowers fear. Or sometimes, the fear of doing nothing exceeds the fear of moving forward. "
1093,How much does a mistake cost?,"June 24, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/how-much-does-a-mistake-cost/,"Errors are preventable.  But preventing errors requires an investment. Before committing to an error-free production environment, it’s worth calculating the cost. A typo on this blog is relatively inexpensive. (Thanks to loyal reader Seth Barnes for graciously emailing me when one slips through).  On the other hand, a mistake in calculating the route of a high-speed rail line might cost a billion dollars… And we probably don’t want any errors on the pacemaker assembly line. If you’ve decided that errors are too expensive for your project, then build a system that doesn’t depend on heroics to avoid errors. Sure, that costs more than just trying harder, but if trying harder was going to reduce errors, it would have worked already.  The pilot who painstakingly works through the pre-flight checklist might not be a swashbuckling Maverick type, but they are much less likely to be the victim of a careless error. The reason that planes don’t crash is because there are countless layers of redundancy and systems to be sure that they don’t. Spend the time and spend the money and the errors can be avoided. Or accept that errors are part of wayfinding, and realize that your problem is caused by a systemic situation, not a lack of effort. "
1094,The wayfinding premium,"June 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/the-wayfinding-premium/,"The second time you rewire a system after finding a hum, it might take two minutes. The first time, the time you figured out what the problem was, it might have taken two hours. Typing a book takes a few days at most. Figuring out what to type might take years. We are either adding value by using our time to do something that’s been done before… or we’re contributing by finding out a way to do something new or create a better path forward. If you’re simply ‘typing’, the work might still be important, but you’re not fulfilling your potential. You won’t earn as much in the way of respect, compensation or satisfaction, either.  On the other hand, if you’ve signed up for wayfinding, forgive yourself if it takes a little (or a lot) longer. Because if we knew the right answer, we would have found it already. That’s the hard part. It’s possible that you can earn a wayfinding premium when you’re merely repeating something you discovered a while ago, but that’s hard to maintain. And it’s possible that you could find someone to solve your interesting problem fast and cheap, but that’s unlikely. Being really clear about what we’re buying (and selling) opens the door to getting serious about whether or not you’re here to solve an interesting problem. "
1095,Self-conception,"June 22, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/self-conception/,"The mirror might not lie, but no one looks at you in the mirror more than you do. Your business or project or life story is intimately known to you. You have lived it. But the outside world will never see all of it, can never see all of it. And so we bump into the disconnect. The disconnect between the thing we know so well and what others have decided based on their own agenda, background and limited experience with us and our work. When they don’t align, we can focus on the quality and consistency of our story, and be sure that our actions are integral with the conception we’re working so hard to share. Consistency is what people pay attention to, and when it’s not there, they make up a story about why. Because they can’t truly know. "
1096,A new decision based on new information,"June 21, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/a-new-decision-based-on-new-information/,"People don’t say yes or change their minds because you persist.  That’s because we don’t like to admit we were wrong. If we’re going to go forward, it’s because something has changed. It might be that our situation is different, that the story we tell ourselves is different, that the times have changed or that your offering has. It might be that we trust you more. What’s new? "
1097,Busy (and reliable),"June 20, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/busy-and-reliable/,"The thing that made you busy might have been the reputation you earned for being reliable. Ironically, that very busy-ness might destroy your reputation. That’s one reason that so many service providers stumble once they begin to gain traction. There are two things you can do before the crisis hits: First, say “no.” A lot. The gigs you would have taken when you were struggling might not be the gigs you should take now. Your reputation for reliability earns you more trust, and that trust gets you invited to work with better clients and on better projects. The cost (benefit) of that is that you’ll need to turn down opportunities that you would have been willing to take on just a little while ago. Second, tell the truth. It’s hard at first, particularly since our self-conception might have been built around independence and invulnerability. But being reliable doesn’t mean being perfect. It means being clear. Two mottos that might help: “You’ll pay a lot, but you’ll get more than you paid for.” and “Our secret is that we don’t lie to get the project.” "

1100,Non-machinable surcharge,"June 17, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/non-machinable-surcharge/,"I got a marketing letter from a colleague yesterday. Not a sales pitch, just an update on what they were up to. I was delighted to discover that this mass mailing had a hand-lettered address on it, with little bits of water color for fun. It was slightly irregularly shaped, requiring an extra stamp because it wasn’t machinable. Inside, in addition to a personal (and personalized) note, there was a gift card for an ice cream cone. But the coolest part was that the card wasn’t from a national chain, it was from the local place down the street. It obviously cost more in time to create than it was going to take me to read. It obviously didn’t go to a lot of people. And that imbalance is now rare. People eager to hustle are busy spamming lists of millions of people with an email that takes two minutes to write and poorly mail merge, giving the hustler a 2,000 to 1 advantage in time spent vs. time consumed. It’s a form of leverage that feels like theft to the recipient, because our time, the irreplaceable thing we all are given, was taken. Of course, I don’t need an ice cream cone, and a small gift card isn’t a bribe. What it represents is care and respect. The opposite of hustle. It was done with sprezzatura, not with a transaction in mind. None of it works unless you’ve already earned permission. It doesn’t work if it’s part of a clever hustle. It doesn’t work if it’s seen as spam or creates uncomfortable tension or a need for reciprocity. It simply works because it required a surcharge. Instead of using an asset, you can choose to build one. [And yes, this is exactly the opposite of the way my bank answers the phone, the way most customer service is grudgingly offered, the way many publicists do their job, the way that organizations make foolish choices about attention and trust…] The question shouldn’t be, “does it scale?” Instead, it might be, “is it worth it?” Interactions with the people who are enrolled and giving you the benefit of the doubt are a form of avocado time. They shouldn’t be optimized for efficiency or even leverage. Instead, it’s a chance to make a difference. [Thanks Stephen] "
1101,Lucky breaks,"June 16, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/lucky-breaks/,"Almost every project comes in a little bit late and a little bit over budget. When things break, the breaks are rarely lucky ones. Part of the reason is that in proposing the project we made our best guess and predicted the predictable. If we didn’t, the project would probably never get approved. Optimists bring an expectation of possibility and goodwill. But they’re also aware of the math of coordination. Hiccups multiply. Betting on lucky isn’t nearly as productive as simply establishing a platform where you can benefit from the occasional arrival of good fortune. "
1102,Abstain from abstaining,"June 15, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/abstain-from-abstaining/,"Even when you’re not completely certain. Because we can never be certain about the future. So we show up for the work, do the reading, engage with the problem. The challenge is to find a point of view if we don’t have one yet. The exception is simple: if, after being well informed, you are willing to accept every outcome, you do us all a favor when you stand down. Hiding doesn’t help us. "
1103,Five useful questions,"June 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/five-useful-questions/,"They might be difficult to answer, but your project will benefit: What’s the hard part? Which part of your work, if it suddenly got much better, would have the biggest impact on the outcome you seek? How are you spending your time? If we took at look at your calendar, how much time is spent reacting or responding to incoming, how much is under your control, and how much is focused on the hard part? What do you need to know? What are the skills that you don’t have that would make your work more effective? What is the scary part? Which outcomes or interactions are you trying to avoid thinking about or interacting with? Why? Is it worth it? After looking at your four answers to these questions, you might have a better idea of what it will take for your project to reach its potential. Does the outcome of the project–for those you serve and for you–justify what it will take to get it there? "
1104,False equivalencies,"June 13, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/false-equivalencies/,"It’s a pointless form of argument. “This scientist made a careless error in their paper, therefore we need to excuse a con artist who falsified an entire career.” Or, “that restaurant served fish that got someone sick, therefore, there’s no reason for there to be a health inspection at my restaurant or any other one for that matter.” Or, “there was a typo in this book from a major publisher, so I’m not going to bother with an editor at all.” The open-minded respond by trying to defend the original error or the intent behind it. But that simply amplifies the false equivalency argument and leads to a no-standards race to the bottom. The false equivalency itself is the problem, not the unexpected error. Perfect is a trap. "
1105,The airline mile hoax,"June 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/the-airline-mile-hoax/,"First: If you’re a frequent flyer on American and haven’t flown in over a year, it’s possible your miles are going to expire very soon. You can fix this by “donating” 2,500 miles here. In the US, private lotteries are against the law. A lottery is a random drawing for a prize of value that you have to pay to participate in. That’s different from a game of skill, in which the best performance wins. Or a sweepstakes, which doesn’t cost anything to enter (which is why the rules so often say ‘no purchase necessary.’) The question is: Is it a random/lucky thing to be able to trade in your miles for the prize you were promised? I think it’s pretty clear that as the points economy has gotten into the billions, the answer is yes. There aren’t as many ‘free’ seats per miles as there used to be. The airlines benefit when they offer fewer and fewer seats as a percentage of available points floating around, because then people are pushed to either ignore their miles or settle for something less than they expected. Some people play with points as a hobby. For the rest of us, they’re worth way less than they appear. But mostly I wanted to remind you not to let yours expire. Thanks for staying safe by staying home. UPDATE: After I queued up this post, AA and UA extended their deadlines. I’m glad! The rest of my rant still persists. "
1106,Disenchantment,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/disenchantment/,"It originally means, “no longer believing in magic.” Humans like magic. It gives us solace and energy and hope. In many ways, the rational era of science and engineering and evidence and proof eliminated any practical belief in magical forces. We know how and why the sun sets every night. But we still desire magic. Creating it for your customers and peers is a gift. "
1107,“No problem” is a problem,"June 11, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/slippery/,"The right response to feedback is, “thank you.” Or perhaps, “that’s a great point.” Even if it’s not your job to change the system, or not your fault that things didn’t work as expected, both of these responses are valid and useful. Feedback is a gift. It lets you know precisely what the other person wants or needs. After you receive the gift, it’s up to you to accept it or not. But shutting down feedback with an argument or by appearing ungrateful makes it less likely you’ll be offered it again. And if you’re getting feedback from a customer or a prospect, shutting it down makes it likely that they’ll walk away and take their attention and their trust somewhere else. When you say, “no problem,” you’re letting yourself off the hook, refusing to acknowledge what was said and closing the door for a useful interaction. Because there is a problem. Exploring what the problem is is far better than denying it. "
1108,Over the circumstances,"June 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/over-the-circumstances/,"How do you act when you’re in charge? Or when someone else is in control? How do you act when you win? Or when you lose? Is there a difference between the times you’ve been given the benefit of the doubt and the times you wish you had? The circumstances change, but perhaps the way we’d like to contribute, to be seen and to connect shouldn’t. The circumstances are here, no matter what we do. It’s up to us to decide to be under them or over them. "
1109,Two ways to challenge the status quo,"June 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/two-ways-to-challenge-the-status-quo/,"Slowly, or all at once. Culture shifts slowly. “People like us do things like this.” Seismic events may make newspaper headlines, but they don’t rapidly change the way human beings in community behave. Instead, the status quo erodes, redefining itself as it goes. If you’re the kind of person who believes in what’s all around us (which is most of us), then you won’t change your beliefs until the people around you change as well. That’s why the smallest viable audience is so important. Focusing on a specific group of people, understanding their beliefs, engaging with empathy, creating new social norms and then, peer-to-peer, spreading the new normal. Science, on the other hand, can shift more rapidly. A new paper detailing groundbreaking research on Parkinson’s disease, for example, can persuade 100 of the right doctors and funders of a paradigm shift. If they’re participating in the scientific method, they’ll do their research and change their assumptions. And then, as always, it goes back to the slow move toward culture shift. It took twenty years for the medical community to embrace the fact that ulcers were caused by bacteria, not pastrami sandwiches. The bacteria didn’t care if the community believed in them, but the patients were glad the doctors made a new decision based on new information. The culture is changing far more rapidly than it ever has before. And yet, it still changes slowly enough for us to grow impatient when important ideas and practices around health, justice and community are ignored. And yet it changes. Persistent and consistent effort with focus is our only way forward. "
1110,Lessons learned the hard way,"June 8, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/lessons-learned/,"It will be a long time before I spell “handkerchief” incorrectly. That’s because in third grade, I lost the entry round of the spelling bee to my friend Elisa because I got it wrong. Who knew that there was a “d”? And now I know where I keep the thermos in my house. I spent twenty minutes looking for it the other day, and failed. A few days later, I came across it. Because of the previous challenge of missing it, my brain was on high alert when it finally appeared. That’s how we learn most of the foundational things that we know, remember and care about–not through exposure, but through effort and failure. That’s why tests aren’t nearly as useful as projects.  Just about anything worth learning is worth learning the hard way. "
1111,KAR 120C,"June 7, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/kar-120c/,"It’s not trivia unless other people know it too. 42 isn’t the answer unless your friends are able to tell you the relevant question. And trivia isn’t trivial. In fact, it’s a building block of our culture, a shared, safe secret, a shortcut to belonging. And creators of culture get to invent new bits every day. Be seeing you. "
1112,Production values,"June 6, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/production-values/,"The gulf between network news of 1968 and cable news of today is dramatic, far more than the shift in, say, a typical sitcom. The Dick Van Dyke show is quaint, but it has a lot in common with a sitcom of today. The news, on the other hand, is completely different. A generation ago, delivering the news was a civic duty. Now it’s a profit center. The quick edits, the crawling text, the noise–it all exists to remind us of a thrilling movie, not of real life. And the clickbaiting reality of online news multiplies that. But real life isn’t like that. An actual house-fire or street demonstration is boring compared to what we’re shown in the media. Does the increase in drama, tension and fear that these production values create produce anything of value? Would it be possible to be an informed citizen without it?  Even more so: Is it possible to be an informed citizen with it? "
1113,The benefit of the doubt,"June 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/the-benefit-of-the-doubt-4/,"It’s priceless. When we’re used to it, when it comes along as a result of nothing we did to earn it, we take it for granted. But when you don’t have it, it makes everything more difficult. The benefit of the doubt is what happens when instead of being skeptical, we’re inclined to believe. It’s when instead of defaulting to ignoring a stranger, we seek to engage with them. It’s the convenient choice, not the exception. In different settings, we grant the benefit of the doubt to the big man on campus, the homecoming queen, the tall person, the celebrity, the person who apparently has amassed a lot of money, the one who fits our cultural mores, the male, the white person, the conventionally pretty one, the conventionally abled one, the one who is popular. But it also might be the class cut-up, the insurgent or the renegade. Status roles are the silent measure of our days, and we often default to reinforcing them based on an unseen and uncommented on status quo. Every time we fail to give the benefit of the doubt to someone who can create value, we not only hurt them, but we hurt ourselves as well. "
1114,The reciprocity hustle,"June 4, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/the-reciprocity-hustle/,"People are culturally wired to want to reciprocate. That’s one of the things that make a community function–someone does something nice for you and you’re inclined to want to find a way to do something nice in return. Along the way, that instinct has been turned into a selfish way to get what you want. Find someone you need (or will need) something from, figure out a way to do them a ‘favor’ and then use the interaction to create the conditions where the other person feels obligated to help you in return. First, no one likes to be hustled. Second, your hustle is more transparent than you realize. Third, people value things differently. The thing you thought was a big lift didn’t mean that much to the person you did it for, or the thing you’re hoping they’ll do in return is far more difficult than it appears to be from your perspective. The alternative is to go through your day oblivious to the idea that reciprocity might be a thing that other people feel compelled to act on. Simply show up with good intent to do work that you’re proud of. If we do this with consistency and care, sooner or later, it comes back around. Not because we hustled, but precisely because we didn’t. "
1115,Monarchists,"June 3, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/monarchists/,"For as long as there’s been recorded history, kings and queens have ruled and been celebrated by their subjects. Not everywhere, not all the time, but widely. Not simply the royalty of nations, but of organizations as well. It’s worth noting that in addition to monarchs, there are monarchists, citizens and employees and followers who prefer the certainty that comes from someone else. Royalty offers something to some of those who are ruled. If it didn’t, it wouldn’t exist. As Sahlins and Graeber outline in their extraordinary (and dense) book on Kings, there’s often a pattern in the nature of monarchs. Royalty doesn’t have to play by the same cultural rules, and often ‘comes from away.’ Having someone from a different place and background allows the population to let themselves off the hook when it comes to creating the future. If your participation in leadership is not required, then you’re free to simply be a spectator. When we industrialized the world over the last century, we defaulted to this structure. Many Western industrial organizations began as founder-celebrated and founder-driven. CEOs could, apparently, do no wrong. Until the world their business operated in changed. In large corporations, the autocratic, well-paid chieftain has the trappings of a monarch. A private air force, minions and the automatic benefit of the doubt. Working in this setting requires obedience and effort from employees more than agency or independence. A well-functioning constitutional monarchy is surprisingly effective. That’s not the problem. The problem is what happens when it stops to function well. The problem can happen when royalty becomes selfish, shortsighted or impatient. Or the problem could be a pattern of employees or members or citizens failing to participate. Resilience disappears and the system becomes brittle. When the world changes, and it does, faster than ever, it’s community and connection that moves us forward. Modern organizations are discovering that all of us know more than any of us, and that engaged individuals ready to not only speak up but to eagerly take responsibility for the work they do is an effective, resilient and equitable way to show up in the world. "
1116,“We’ll fix it in post”,"June 2, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/well-fix-it-in-post/,"Post-production. The most expensive way to adjust a movie is at the end, in the editing room. The most expensive way to please a customer is after they call customer service with a complaint. The most expensive way to make a beautiful piece of furniture is with sandpaper… Better motto: “Let’s try to skip post.” And then, after acting like you could, don’t. Important clarification: It turns out, of course, that if you can easily fix something in ‘post’, then you should do exactly that. Too often, we get confused about when and where the best place to improve the work is. One mark of the professional is that they understand that a reshoot might cost way more than an edit… "
1117,Commencement is today,"June 1, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/commencement-is-today/,"Actually, it’s every day. We talk about graduation as if it’s the end of some journey, but it’s the beginning of one. The chance to see the world differently, to contribute, to understand. I hope you’ll get a chance to check out what my friends at Akimbo are doing. They’re persistently, consistently and generously showing up to create learning cohorts that actually cause real and long-lasting change. (They’re hiring.) The altMBA has already demonstrated its impact. More than five years, 70 countries and 5,000 graduates so far. The First Priority Deadline for applications is today, June 1st, for altMBA’s October 2021 session Bernadette Jiwa’s Story Skills Workshop is back for its seventh session. You’ll discover that while reading one of her bestselling books will open your eyes, it’s the work done with others that’s remarkable. People are often surprised by the mutual support and feedback that they can find online. It begins tomorrow. If you’re on your own and feeling the stress between freelancing and entrepreneurship, it may be that you’re actually a bootstrapper. Bootstrapping is a different way to look at your work, the chance to build an organization of some scale without going to a bank or finding a rich aunt to back your project. The Bootstrapper’s Workshop is back for its sixth session. You can enroll today and it begins on the 15th of June.  Also open for enrollment today is Alex DiPalma’s breakthrough podcasting workshop. The ninth session begins in about six weeks. Check out the details here. Make something that matters. It’s easier when we do it together. "
1118,Meeting nullification,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/06/meeting-nullification/,"Here are two policies it might be fun to try for a week: Meeting abstention: Anyone invited to an internal meeting has the power to opt-out. “Send me the summary, please.” If someone abstains, they give up their ability to have a say in the meeting, but most meetings these days don’t actually give people a platform to have a say. And then that person can leave the Zoom room and get back to whatever it is they were doing that was actually productive. Meeting nullification: If anyone in an internal meeting announces that the meeting is a pointless waste of time, it’s over. The meeting organizer is obligated to send everyone the memo that they probably should have sent in the first place. If you discover that you’re calling meetings where people abstain, or worse, call for nullification, perhaps you should be more careful about which meetings you call and who you invite. Does your organization have the guts to try this out? Do you, as an attendee, care enough to abstain? The fact that even discussing this idea is stressful helps us understand status roles and power. "
1119,Identity and ideas,"May 31, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/identity-and-ideas/,"We rarely do or say something intentionally that surprises us. That’s because we are in intimate contact with the noise in our heads–we spend our days looking in the mirror, listening to our inner voice and defining our point of view. “That’s not the sort of thing I would say or do…” We call this internal familiarity our ‘identity.’ If it gets lost (when someone joins a cult, for example), it’s noteworthy and can be tragic. If our ideas are equated to our identity, then talking about ideas is very much the act of talking about yourself. And thus the tension is created. Our culture and our economy are built on ideas. Many of our society’s ideas get better over time (you don’t go to the barber for bloodletting any longer–it’s what probably killed George Washington) and yet some of them get stuck. Often, we need a generation to step away before an entrenched idea begins to fade, because the people who have been embracing that toxic or outlived idea see it as part of their identity. As the media realizes that they can improve profits by narrowcasting ideas to people who embrace them as part of who they are, it gets increasingly difficult to have a constructive conversation about many ideas–because while people are able and sometimes eager to change some of their less personal ideas, we rarely seek to change our identity. It doesn’t have to be this way. If you’re doing a jigsaw puzzle and a piece you thought fit in a spot where it doesn’t actually fit, that missed fit is viewed as useful information. Go ahead and try the piece in a different spot–that’s not a threat to your identity as a puzzle solver. In fact, your identity as a puzzle solver is tied up in the idea that if the evidence shows a piece didn’t fit, you simply try a new spot, you don’t feel threatened or disrespected. The most successful problem solvers are people who have embraced this simple method–your current idea isn’t your identity, it’s simply a step closer to a solution to the problem in front of you. One way to define our identity is to fall in love with an idea (often one that was handed to us by a chosen authority). Another is to refuse to believe our identity is embodied in an idea, and instead embrace a method for continually finding and improving our ideas. "
1120,A long lead time,"May 30, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/a-long-lead-time/,"Books are written almost a year before they come out. Tweets take about 24 seconds to launch. Which world would you like to live in, book-world or twitter-world? If you were designing an ad campaign for your project that would run in three years, what would it say? Can you write the resume or Linkedin profile you’d like to have in seven years? Seven months? Long lead times force us to focus on the destination itself, not the bumps or the detours. The deadline for submitting your long lead time announcement is midnight tonight. A chance to hurry up and then stick with it. "
1121,“Take your time”,"May 29, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/take-your-time/,"It means two very different things. When a person or a marketer takes your time, they’re stealing. Something irretrievable is gone. If your time is taken for selfish reasons, if it’s wasted, there’s no good way to get it back. On the other hand, when you have enough confidence to take your own time, to take your time to be present, to do the work, to engage with what’s in front of you right now, it’s a gift. This is precisely what time is for. We’re not in a race to check off as many boxes as we possibly can before we are out of time. Instead, we have the chance to use the time to create moments that matter. Because they connect us, because they open doors, because the moments, added up, create a life. "
1122,How to miss a deadline,"May 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/how-to-miss-a-deadline/,"In my earlier post, I opened a discussion about how to avoid missing a deadline. But what happens if you can’t avoid it? Projects are always on the frontier, combining elements and ideas and effort to do something that’s not been done before, not quite the way we’re doing it here and now. And so, bold projects sometimes fail to make their deadline. Even if we build systems and use buffers, sometimes it doesn’t work. Some thoughts: [Even better, check out out my previous post and create approaches so you don’t miss the deadline in the first place.]  "
1123,How (not) to miss a deadline,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/how-not-to-miss-a-deadline/,"Deadlines are valuable, and deadlines are expensive. Organized systems and societies need deadlines. It would be impossible to efficiently build a house if the subcontractors could deliver their goods or services whenever it were convenient for them. Movie studios and book publishers schedule their releases months in advance to allow distribution teams to plan their work. Software is dependent on subsystems that have to be in place before the entire program can work. Along with the value that synchronized deliverables create, there are also real costs. Not simply the organizational cost of a missed deadline, but the significant damage to a reputation or brand that happens when a promise isn’t kept. And there’s a human cost–the stress and strain that comes from working to keep a promise that we might not have personally made, or that might be more difficult because someone else didn’t perform their part of the dance. In the wide-open race for attention and commitments, the standards of deadlines have been wavering. For forty years, Saturday Night Live has gone on at 11:30. Not, as its creator says, because it’s ready, but because it’s 11:30. That’s the deal. On Kickstarter, this sort of sacrosanct deadline is rare indeed. “This charger will ship in six weeks!” they say, when actually, it’s been more than a year with no shipment date in sight. Or with venture capitalists and other backers. “We’re going to beat the competition to market by three months.” Sometimes it feels like if the company doesn’t bring wishful thinking to the table, they won’t get funded. Given that choice, it’s no wonder that people get desperate. Wishful thinking might not be called lying, but it is. We should know better. Earning the reputation as someone (a freelancer, a marketer, a company, a leader) who doesn’t miss a deadline is valuable. And it doesn’t happen simply because you avoid sleeping and work like a dog. That’s the last resort of someone who isn’t good at planning. Here are some basic principles that might help with the planning part: Like most things that matter, keeping deadlines is a skill, and since it’s a skill, we can learn it. [More on this in my next post on what to do if you can’t avoid breaking your promise.] "
1124,Date certain,"May 27, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/date-certain-3/,"This is very different from “someday.” Choose any date you like, as far in the future as you like. But a date, circled on the calendar. By that date, what will you have implemented? What will be in place? Where will you be, what will you be doing? Way more powerful than someday. "
1125,"Sunk costs, creativity and your Practice","May 26, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/sunk-costs-creativity-and-your-practice/,"“Ignore sunk costs” is the critical lesson of useful decision making. The thing you earned, that you depend on, that was hard to do–it’s a gift from your former self. Just because you have a law degree, a travel agency or the ability to do calligraphy in Cyrillic doesn’t mean that your future self is obligated to accept that gift. We hold on to the old competencies and our hard-earned status roles far longer than we should. The only way to be creative is to do something new, and the path to something new requires leaving something else behind. New decisions based on new information are at the heart of leadership. But you can’t make those decisions if you’re also busy calculating how much the old decisions cost you.  Creativity is the generous act of solving an interesting problem on behalf of someone else. It’s a chance to take emotional and intellectual risks with generosity. Do that often enough and you can create a practice around it. It’s not about being gifted or touched by the muse. Instead, our creative practice (whether you’re a painter, a coach or a fundraiser) is a commitment to the problems in front of us and the people who will benefit from a useful solution to them. I built a workshop on creativity that’s run by the folks at Akimbo. The fourth session starts this week. If you’re ready to get serious about your art, whatever form it takes, I hope you’ll check it out. "
1126,Industrial scale and brittleness,"May 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/industrial-scale-and-brittleness/,"Look at that banana, just look at it. Bananas are a modern miracle. They’re cheap, nutritious, and readily available. And just about every banana you’ve ever eaten (if you live in the Northern Hemisphere) came from the same tree. Not just a similar tree, the way oak trees are all similar to one another. The same exact tree, which was planted in a hothouse in England about a hundred and fifty years ago. The Cavendish banana tree (named after the family that’s now called the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire) is sterile. It has no seeds. The only way to grow one is to take a cutting from an existing tree and basically grow a clone. Because the tree was optimized for yield and taste, we end up with plentiful, delicious, cheap bananas.  Until a blight arrives. And the virus that’s just around the corner is almost here, and it will wipe out every single Cavendish tree on Earth in just a few more years. There have been real environmental side effects all along, but at scale, they become impossible to ignore. Or consider the legal system in my country. It grew from a fairly informal and resilient (if not always fair) way to keep the peace and settle disputes into a behemoth, which combines the prison-industrial complex with a very expensive civil suit system that’s beneficial to many of the key players but ultimately insensitive to those that can’t use it to their advantage. Check out Rohan Pavuluri’s new TED talk about bankruptcy, or Bryan Stevenson’s urgent talk on criminal justice. People aren’t bananas, and the injustices that the legal system has created have always been shameful. But at scale, immense scale, they’re even worse. Industrial scale seems to pay off. Until it doesn’t. And then it’s on us to change it, while there’s still time. "
1127,The consequence,"May 24, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/the-consequence/,"Attitude follows action far more often than action follows attitude. We change our mood as a result of how we act. If you want to feel a certain way, begin by acting as if you do. On the other hand, if you truly want to accomplish something, waiting for the mood to strike is ineffective. "
1128,Code words,"May 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/code-words/,"That’s all language is. “Banana” is not a fruit. It’s a word that we use in English to identify a fruit. And code words work beautifully as long as the person you’re seeking to communicate with understands the word the way you think they do. Often, when people with goodwill and shared values end up disagreeing, it’s because they didn’t understand the code words that were being used. In fact, it might be the only reason. "
1129,The right amount of time,"May 22, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/the-right-amount-of-time/,"Eventually, the culture figures out how much time we’re supposed to spend on something. They call it the “right” amount. How long an education should take, or an RFP. How fast to deliver on an order. How long to shop around for a new car. How much time to spend with a patient. How much time should be devoted to learning a new skill or engaging with a new idea… If you spend about the same amount of time as everyone else, you’re likely to get about the same amount of benefit. There are two other choices, worth considering: Changes in the culture often happen when someone is gutsy enough to reorganize the time stack. "
1130,The urgent changes,"May 21, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/the-urgent-changes/,"It always does. Perhaps you remember when the most urgent issue of the day was the relationship between the US and Cuba. Or the argument you were having about what flavor the wedding cake should be. The very nature of ‘urgent’ means that it can’t and won’t persist. Important, on the other hand, might hang around for a long time. "
1131,Insignificant digits,"May 20, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/insignificant-digits/,"Who’s a better student? The one with a 3.95 GPA or the one with 3.96? Neither or both, actually. These metrics are foolishly and incorrectly precise. The decisions that led to this average had far more than a hundredth of a point of randomness and judgment calls along the way. Who’s richer? Someone with 3 billion dollars or someone with 3.1 billion? They’re both the same. They can buy anything they want and one won’t run out of money before the other. And the same goes for clickthrough rates, body temperature and most of the other ‘measures’ of our life that deserve air quotes around them. Just because we can increase the digits doesn’t mean we can see more clearly. "
1132,Wholesale and retail,"May 19, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/wholesale-and-retail/,"Up close, face to face, in the specific, it’s difficult to dismiss the humanity of others.  It’s only when we decide to industrialize the process, to do it all at once, to boil it down to numbers–that’s when we begin to disconnect. One at a time. Because it might feel like a slog to you, but it matters to them. "
1133,To stay the same,"May 18, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/to-stay-the-same/,"Willem de Kooning said, “I have to change to stay the same.” Because whatever system we’re in is changing. Because every step we take changes the ground we walk on. Because while you’re busy trying to keep it all together, someone else is working just as hard to change it again. Some organizations, artists and leaders work to disrupt and innovate. And some seem content to close their eyes and will things to be exactly as they were yesterday or last year. Between the innovator and the laggard, though, is most of us. Surfing and dancing with possibility, simply to continue to serve and keep our promises. What you do isn’t how you do it. What you do is the promise you make to the people you serve. If the people change, then the specifics of your promise have to change as well. [Thanks to Will for the quote.] "
1134,“That’s not fair”,"May 17, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/thats-not-fair/,"When we say this, we might not be as accurate in our description of the situation as we believe. Perhaps we mean, “that’s not what I was hoping for.” Or we might mean, “if you knew how hard I worked, you would have made a different decision.” Possibly, we mean, “if you understood the world the way I do, you’d agree that this outcome isn’t fair.” We rarely complain about fairness when the world lines up the way we hope it will. Even (or especially) if the outcome was unfair to someone else. There’s an enormous amount of unfairness all around us. People who don’t get the benefit of the doubt, advantages that are multiplied, systems that are rigged. But right here, right now, it’s possible that what just happened was fair, though it was also disappointing. "
1135,Good fences,"May 16, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/good-fences/,"Hand washing used to be controversial. Before Ignaz Semmelweis did his groundbreaking work in proving that disease spread when doctors didn’t wash before and after treating patients, hygiene was ignored. In fact, it took decades for the system to change. Today, of course, it’s understood that doctors, food service workers and everyone else ought to wash their hands to protect those around us. Doctors don’t wash their hands because they enjoy it, they do it because that’s what doctors do. Disease evolves.  As it spreads from one person to another, a disease reproduces and has a chance to mutate. And those mutations create new problems, problems that we may be ill-equipped to deal with.  And disease is frightening. When it collides with culture, culture often demands we stand still. We stick with what we know, with what feels safe, with the status quo. Because to do otherwise means that we have to acknowledge that perhaps one day, the disease will win. It’s easier to sell a new fashion or a sports team than it is to sell public health. Like most of the human challenges we face, it’s a marketing problem, a chance to use words and affiliation and possibility to create change. There’s a long history of culture pushing back on the smart, generous, safe interventions that ultimately become standard. Because the status quo is the status quo precisely because it’s good at sticking around. When we have a chance to make things better for the people we care about, we usually realize that this is exactly the thing we hope to do. But first, we need to see what our choices are based on and where they lead. "
1136,Conventional and famous,"May 15, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/conventional-and-famous/,"We can gain a lot of clarity if we insert the right words into daily conversation. “That’s a good college,” is more accurately stated as, “that’s a famous college.” Or perhaps, “That person is beautiful,” might be better as, “that person is conventionally beautiful.” So many choices and measures seem obvious. But the obvious part might come from the fact that they are simply conventional and famous, not valid or useful. "
1137,Starting and finishing,"May 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/starting-and-finishing/,"Sometimes the rule is: You don’t have to finish, but you do have to start. And sometimes the rule is: You don’t have to start, but if you do, you have to finish. When building a personal habit, it might make sense to embrace the first rule. You don’t have to run all the way, every day, but you do have to get out of the house and start running. And when making promises to a group where trust matters, the second rule definitely applies. "
1138,Denialism is not skepticism,"May 13, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/denialism-is-not-skepticism/,"Resolutely refusing to accept a conventional understanding is a statement of certainty. That’s different from honest skepticism. The skeptic offers an open mind and is clear about what would be necessary to earn enthusiastic support. The denialist, on the other hand, is sure. Now and forever. This certainty probably doesn’t come from the matter being discussed. Instead, it’s based on external factors, a story, a cultural connection, something that is fueled by the feeling that comes from refusing to examine the issue, not by honest inquiry. Skepticism is gutsy, denialism is based on fear. "
1139,"Magic, persistence, imagination and more","May 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/magic-persistence-imagination-and-more/,"Magic first: Acar and the folks at Penguin are offering a limited-edition deck of special cards to go with The Practice. It launched today. Persistence: Today is the 200th episode of my podcast Akimbo. I don’t blog about it here often, but wanted to thank my producer Alex DiPalma and thank you for listening as well. It’s a labor of love, and it’s also among the top 1% of all podcasts. You can check out episodes here and transcripts here and subscribe here. That’s years and years of weekly audio, via the magic of podcasting. Imagination: Jacqueline Novogratz and Tim Ferriss talk about her new book on Tim’s podcast this week. Hearing two of my friends so thoroughly talk about work that truly matters is a wonder, and I encourage you to check it out. And more: Erica Dhawan’s book on digital body language just arrived, and it’s a salve for exhausted Zoom users (all of us). Steve Wexler’s new book on data visualizations, charts and graphs is worth checking out when it ships next week. And the blog and book and podcast that will change your life the most is the one you create.  Go make something. "
1140,Selling hours,"May 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/selling-hours/,"This might be the workplace question of the decade. Does the boss buy your time or your productivity? In the pre-industrial age, when we worked from home (“cottage industries”) workers got paid by the piece. As we moved to factories, it shifted. Many workers preferred a reliable regular paycheck, and owners decided to profit by investing in productivity and keeping the upside. When new machines show up, the workers don’t get paid more, but the boss makes more. Now, as work-from-home promises/threatens to become a norm for many knowledge workers, the question is back. Some bosses are demanding workers return to the office, and some managers have spent the last year forcing people to endure endless zoom meetings. The mindset seems to be that if your time is what got purchased, the boss wants to be sure you’re spending all of that time at work on work, not, who knows, tending for an ill family member or something. But as it gets easier to measure productivity and contribution, and as it gets easier to outsource any task that can be described clearly, there’s a fork in the road: If we’re not buying or selling hours, what, exactly do we measure and how are we compensated for it? Are workers ready or open to getting a commission, a profit-share or a per-piece price? And if we’re not selling our time but our contribution, does that further self-center the culture? And if we are buying and selling hours, how does that work when surveillance capitalism bumps into workers needing flexible schedules and the trust that it takes to develop leadership and creative contribution? Is it okay with you, the boss, if one of your workers dramatically increases productivity through some outsourcing or tech shortcuts on their own nickel and then goes home at 2 pm every day? Is it okay if you have another worker who works until midnight every night but doesn’t get nearly as much done? What about a team of five deciding to skip most of their meetings, coordinate through a shared doc and put the time they save into going for a walk or thinking about the next breakthrough? If it’s truly about what we produce, how many people on the team are aware of how much they produce? What would happen if they were? The theory of the firm was based on two key assumptions: That workers needed to be in physical proximity to each other, and that communicating with and measuring outsiders was simply too expensive to scale. For a lot of knowledge work, neither is completely true any more, and so we have to reckon with what the right size of a ‘firm’ even is. The very nature of the factory and employment is completely up in the air. Instead of bragging about how many employees a company has, how big the office is, how many folks are in any given meeting… some leaders may start optimizing for how few they need to get the work done.

1141,Faster! Faster?,"May 11, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/faster-faster/,"This simple free tool lets you speed up just about any video you watch in Chrome. And it’s not difficult at all to speed up audiobooks or podcasts, just look for the button in your favorite player. If the topic lends itself to you absorbing the information faster than the person is presenting it, this simple hack increases the amount you can learn by 30%, which is huge. On the other hand, if you’re simply speeding things up because you are in a hurry to get through it, it might be better to not do it at all. "
1142,Why the blockchain matters,"May 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/why-the-blockchain-matters/,"But first, let’s understand some words… Bitcoin is not the blockchain. If the blockchain is a printing press, Bitcoin is a kind of paper money. There are countless things that one can do with a printing press, in fact, it changed the world, but the invention of paper money isn’t even one of the top 100 most important outputs the printed press created. Cryptocurrency has a terrible name. Most people associate “crypto” with spies and secrets. And a currency is generally backed by a nation, with a treasury, an exchequer and banks. It’s more accurately thought of as a token. If you went to an amusement park, you might buy a bunch of tokens or tickets to go on the rides. And if you run one of the rides, you collect the tokens, which at some point, you can trade in for a different sort of value, probably currency. If people need tokens and they’re scarce, they go up in value. If people think that tokens are going to go up in value, they might buy them in anticipation of that. And the things that people do to get tokens can range from simply buying them with paper money (!) to performing various tasks (like the ride operators in the example above). And, if a lot of people own tokens, they’re likely to do things that make tokens go up in value. Thus, an ecosystem is born. Okay, so what’s the blockchain? It’s a database. Unlike most databases, it’s not controlled by one entity and it’s not easily rewritten. Instead, it’s a ledger, a permanent, examinable, public database. One can use it to record transactions of various sorts. It would be a really good way to keep track of property records, for example. Instead, we have title insurance, unsearchable folders of deeds in City Hall and often dusty tax records. There are databases everywhere around us (Facebook, for example, is mostly a database–who are the users, who do they know, what do they do?). Because the internet rewards people who own networks so handsomely, these organizations continue to gain in power. Google began by building a database on top of the open internet, and they’ve spent the last twenty years relentlessly making the internet less open so they can fortify the power of their databases and the attention they influence or control. And that’s the first reason that the blockchain matters—because there’s a chance that it might lead to more open, resilient, market-focused networks and databases. It’s only a chance, though, because all the hype around the tokens sometimes makes it seem more likely that financial operators will simply seek to manipulate unregulated markets for their own benefit. The second reason might support positive change. The existence of tokens and decentralization means that it’s possible to build resilient open source communities where early contributors and supporters benefit handsomely over time. No one owns these communities, and we can hope that these communities will work hard to serve themselves and their users, not the capital markets or other short-term players. Consider a project like Wikipedia. Tens of thousands of people have devoted millions of hours to working to build it. 5,000 active editors are responsible for most of the work that we benefit from every day. This is unpaid work, done for the community and for the satisfaction and status that comes with it. But of the top 100 websites, there are very few that are built on this model. Now imagine a blockchain/token project in which contributors earned tokens as they built it and supported it. Over time, the decentralized project would go up in value. As the ecosystem and the market delivered more and more utility to more and more people, the users would need to buy tokens to use it. And the holders of tokens would receive either a dividend or have the ability to sell their tokens if they chose. Early speculators would attract more attention, and people with more skill than capital could invest by contributing early and often. As the project reached a steady state, the stakeholders would shift, from innovators and speculators to people who treat their daily contributions as a job without a boss. Innovators could build on top of this network without permission, creating more and more variations and choice using the same underlying database. One way to consider this: The open web led to a huge leap in the number of useful databases that we all use (things like Zillow, Instagram and even Tinder). They were fairly cheap to launch and run, and once the network effect kicked in, the profits were significant. Investors were eager to fund the next one, because the odds of a big win dwarfed most of what they could choose from in traditional businesses. But dominant players are now working to make the openness of the web (the thing that allowed them to grow in the first place) less open. Google and Facebook and others push to make their stock price go up, not to serve users and others who now understand they have little choice in the matter. The distributed nature of the blockchain, combined with this novel way of funding early contributions means that the network effect may very well bring powerful new databases to the fore, creating new ways for us to interact. It’s hardly going to be perfect. There’s the issue of how the blockchain itself is run. If it’s run on the original method—proof of work—it’s likely to be a carbon disaster, getting worse as it succeeds. Fortunately, there are new approaches on the horizon (with great names like ‘proof of stake’ and ‘sharding’) that might address these problems. For the typical user, the existence of the blockchain itself won’t matter, just as you don’t need to know how many volunteer editors Wikipedia has to benefit from using it. The reason the blockchain matters is that it is an agent of change. Just like the transistor and yes, the printing press, when an agent of change shows up, it often leads to shifts that we probably didn’t expect. Understanding it now is more productive than simply being forced to deal with it later. "
1143,Jargon vs. lingo,"May 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/jargon-vs-lingo/,"Jargon is intentionally offputting, and lingo reminds us how connected we are. They might look similar, but the intent is what matters. Jargon is a place to hide, a chance to show off, a way to disconnect. Lingo, on the other hand, allows us to feel included. "
1144,Mouth to mouth resuscitation,"May 8, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/mouth-to-mouth-resuscitation/,"It might be the best way to save someone in distress. But it doesn’t scale. You can only offer this sort of lifesaving intervention to one person at a time. Often, we get stuck because we try to take our useful local magic and somehow make it for everyone. Perhaps we’ll need a different approach when it comes to serving more people. Not because it doesn’t work. It does. Because it doesn’t work at scale. "
1145,"Shortages, momentum and the search for meaning","May 7, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/shortages-momentum-and-the-search-for-meaning/,"A general malaise is not new. Sociologists have been writing about it since the Second World War. Today, of course, the malaise isn’t simply general, it’s also specific. There’s too much pain and disconnection and uncertainty in the world. And yet, there are technological marvels, new opportunities and many people who have enough resources to meet their needs. For someone with enough, two things can get in the way of a life filled with meaning: Affluence and stasis. When we don’t have enough to eat, don’t have a roof over our heads, don’t have something that we need and can imagine getting, it’s not a general malaise, it’s a specific one. If you’re in this position, life is hard indeed. On the other hand, spoiled kids are spoiled by parents who have already figured out how to cover their basic needs. When people stop focusing on making a contribution or wrestling with urgency, it’s easy for them to feel a sense of ennui. And stasis is the feeling that nothing much is going to improve. In wartime London, under attack eighty years ago, food was scarce and life was dangerous. But those that survived recall it as being a great moment (even if it was something that they’d very much like to avoid repeating). Compare this to the widespread dissatisfaction described by people who grew up expecting things to get better (momentum) who are now coming to the conclusion that it might not happen. “Compared to what,” is the question that gets asked at work and home every day, and if the ‘what’ is yesterday, it’s difficult to keep a positive promise forever. Day trading on better is a rough ride. As we enter a post-industrial economy where good jobs are going to continue to get more scarce, creating a positive cultural dynamic-one in which the social contract can deliver meaning-is more urgent than ever. The constant awareness that’s pumped in via the media rarely matches the experiences (positive or negative, exciting or not) that many people choose to experience every day. That mismatch often translates into unhappiness. "
1146,The benefit of the doubt,"May 6, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/the-benefit-of-the-doubt-5/,"Rarely talked about, and the heart of marketing and more than that, of culture. We can’t possibly know precisely what’s inside the book or the box or the bottle before we buy it for the first time. We take meds or go to the movies in anticipation of an outcome, and we give the producer the benefit of the doubt (or we don’t go, because the doubt is too much for us to handle.) And we do the same thing with people. Who we hire, who we are afraid of, who we marry. We can’t know, not for sure, not until our experience with them is complete. And we make all of these decisions without a conscious thought. When we persistently and consistently do it incorrectly, we suffer. We create injustice, we miss out on opportunities, we fall prey to scams. The more we generalize our benefit of the doubt (and worse, the amplification of the doubt) the more damage we do. The internet has overwhelmed us with data, and some of it (but not much) is actually turned into useful information. Some of that useful information is helping us see how long we’ve been mistaken about the benefit of the doubt in so many of the biases and actions we take (and don’t take). Examining how we instinctually make these choices is a powerful first step in making better ones. "
1147,The weather problem,"May 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/the-weather-problem/,"Meteorologists on TV spend most of their time talking about how the weather is right now, right outside. And progress for TV weather often looks like more accurate reporting of the current precipitation, temperature and windspeed, along with nicer graphics. That’s not the same as actually predicting what the weather will be tomorrow. We can probably agree that more granularity in how the weather is right now isn’t particularly interesting. It’s an easy trap to fall into, because spending time on what’s provably true is way less risky than deciding what’s important and using it to predict the future. Our best work involves sorting the important from the rest, along with bringing a point of view and experience to complicated problems. Problems that are interesting because there isn’t a proven, correct answer. The wind chill factor is best left to an automated device. We don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows, but figuring out how it’s going to blow tomorrow is a great skill. "
1148,“But how will you know?”,"May 4, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/but-how-will-you-know/,"It pays to know what something is for. It helps us figure out how to do it better, how to allocate resources and how to know when we’re done. Much of what we build or invest in is complicated. It serves multiple purposes, has to please many constituents and has competing priorities. So the question: “How will we know if it’s working?” is a powerful one. It opens the door to a useful conversation about what it’s for. "
1149,An alternative to hustle,"May 3, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/an-alternative-to-hustle/,"No one wants to be hustled. To be pitched and pushed and most of all, pressured into buying something. Hustle culture has been around for a long time, but the internet–and new forms of it in particular–seems to amplify the feeling. Three elements of hustle stand out for me: The folks at Akimbo (an independent B corp) have been quietly building a series of interactive workshops that help people build value and show up in the marketplace without hustle. By doing good work that you can be proud of. Here’s what they’ve got coming up: The flagship altMBA has already helped more than 5,000 people transform their careers and their lives. The Regular Decision Deadline is tomorrow, May 4th for altMBA’s July 2021 session. Ramon Ray’s The Small Business Workshop starts tomorrow, May 4th, and you can enroll now. It’s back for its third session. Real Skills, a one-day non-conference is happening on May 14th (tickets available now). No speakers, no Powerpoints, simply small-group interaction designed to change the way you and your team create possibility. This is the fifth session, and many people have done it more than once. The Creative’s Workshop, session four, starts in a few weeks and enrollment is open now. In this workshop (which led to my book The Practice), you’ll learn to find your voice and ship work you care about. Now in its fourth session, participants have been amazed at how deep and wide this work can go, and how powerful the connections created within cohorts can be. And bestselling author Bernadette Jiwa is back with the seventh session of the Story Skills Workshop. This is an essential foundation for anyone seeking to be heard, to make a difference and to engage with people to make change happen. Bernadette’s breakthrough approach is proven to be effective. You can check it out today.  When you’re ready to level up, it’s possible to learn to make a bigger impact. "
1150,When it doesn’t work out,"May 2, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/when-it-doesnt-work-out/,"Possibility has a flipside. We need possibility to do our best work. To believe that it might work. To understand that if we do our best work and bring our full selves to the project, we have a shot at achieving our goal. Hope is fuel. Perhaps we’ll make the sale, be admitted, create a hit, change someone’s mind, invent a breakthrough, play the notes beautifully, open doors and create magic… But we might not. And if we don’t, what then? The first opportunity is to learn from what happened. That possibility was there, but we guessed wrong, or missed a cue or need a new skill. Perhaps we have to find a way to get the benefit of the doubt or simply need more practice and experience. But, with apologies to Gödel, maybe there is no solution. Maybe the thing we thought was a problem wasn’t a problem to be solved (because problems have solutions) maybe it was simply a situation or even a dead end. Given who you are, what you know and what you’re dealing with, there actually wasn’t the possibility for success, even if it seemed there was. Or perhaps there was luck involved, and this time, the luck wasn’t on our side (perhaps 20% of the applicants who are qualified get in to famous colleges, which means that kids who do their best still have just a 1 in 5 chance of admission). If there was no acceptable solution, or there was more bad luck than we hoped, then there’s no room for shame or blame or recriminations. All we can do is honor the situation and work to find the next thing, another opportunity to contribute or grow. Spending cycles on blame (of ourselves or others) is time we can ill afford to waste.

1151,Compared to what?,"May 1, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/05/actually-im-not-that-good/,"Organized sports, particularly for school-age kids, present a real challenge. The results are easily measured and are on just one axis. Points scored. Winning vs. losing. If we teach a child to identify with the outcomes in this way, we might create arrogance. If you win, after all, you must be better than the others. This is where the big man on campus comes from, the push for dominance and the brittle self-worth that can lead to bullying. And of course, it’s not just sports, and it’s not just high school. But in any scarcity-driven competition, sooner or later, you’re not going to win. You’re not going be state champ, national champ, world champ… Sooner or later, if you’re honest, you’ll need to acknowledge that winning isn’t going to happen. And then what happens? Economic utility almost always occurs when we’re good at things that aren’t easy to measure. And when the things we’re good at are additive, infinite and generous it can be something we embrace for the long haul. Because in those areas, it’s possible to be useful and skilled and make a contribution, every single time. If you have a chance to play a game that’s based on scarcity and winner-take-all, perhaps it pays to play a different game instead. "
1152,Confusing identity with strategy,"April 30, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/confusing-identity-with-strategy/,"Who we are isn’t the same thing as what we do. But sometimes, what we do can change who we are. Our identity describes the person we see in the mirror, the groups we identify with, the version of ourselves (and reality) that we come back to over and over. “I’m not a writer,” or “I’m not an entrepreneur,” or “I’m not a leader,” are fairly definitive statements. But when the world changes, opportunities change as well. All of us struggle when our identity doesn’t match the reality of the world around us. In the face of that confusion, it’s tempting to abandon possibility and to walk away from an opportunity simply because it doesn’t resonate with the person we are in this moment. But only when we do something new do we often begin to become someone new. "
1153,Uncountable,"April 29, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/uncountable/,"A mass noun is one that doesn’t take an S when we have more. “Butter” and “Information” are both uncountable in use, because when we only have only one unit of butter (or information) we use the same word as if we have four or six units. Butter is butter. Uncountable words are understandably difficult to measure at a glance. They don’t fit easily into the industrial mindset, and we’re often pushed to find things that are less mysterious. But it turns out that uncountable words like trust, honesty, commitment, passion, connection and quality are a fine thing to focus on. "
1154,Knowing it can be done,"April 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/knowing-it-can-be-done/,"We can improve and magnify things in very short order. Light bulbs, elevators, website technology–give it some time, and people will pile on and all of the important metrics will be sharpened, made more efficient and more powerful as well. That’s not really the hard part. The hard part is doing it when people aren’t sure it can be done. And in that stage of development, taking notes isn’t nearly as important as taking leaps. If you do it once, we’ll figure out how to do it again. "
1155,You can’t beat the algorithm,"April 27, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/you-cant-beat-the-algorithm/,"When a new medium shows up that allocates attention, someone comes out ahead. They win a Google search, amass a ton of FB followers, hit the jackpot on Twitter or even Clubhouse. “They picked me!” and the attention feels inevitable. Others see the pennies from heaven and rush in to follow, eager for their share of traffic. But there is no “they” and you weren’t picked. The algorithm needs to send attention somewhere, and for a while, it sent it over there. But it almost certainly won’t last. Because the ecosystem is changing, all the time. You can’t post on a same platform twice, because the second time, it’s not the same platform as it was last time. We have a chance to do work we’re proud of, and to do it for people who care. And maybe we can do it in a way that will lead them to tell the others. Traffic from an algorithm isn’t the point, it’s a random bonus. No sense being a puppet, especially if you can’t be sure who is pulling the strings or why. "
1156,Decoding the sign,"April 26, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/decoding-the-sign/,"A “Deer Xing” sign isn’t there to tell the deer where to cross the road. It’s there to let drivers know that this is the spot where deer often choose to cross the road. Because deer can’t read signs, and even if they could, they probably wouldn’t bother to obey them. People, on the other hand, are far more likely to be killed by hitting a deer than they are by a shark bite. A good signmaker is aware of “who’s it for” and “what’s it for.” In this case, the hope is that drivers will be more careful. Too often, signs of all kinds (metaphorical signs, not just physical ones), are simply ALL CAPS YELLING about how the signmaker is frustrated about something they can’t control. If you can’t influence something, why are you yelling about it? "
1157,Untenable,"April 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/untenable/,"You can build a city below sea level, and it might work for a while, but sooner or later, the water will win. Trends don’t determine whether we’ll be able to accomplish something tomorrow. But seeing and then understanding the trends allows us to work with the wind at our backs, instead of fighting it. Consider demographics, technology and science. All three are inexorably moving, and while they can be ignored, sooner or later, they catch up with our project and push against it. We can deny the facts of the world around us, with passion or even vitriol, but trends compound. When you can, focus on something tenable. "
1158,Competition vs. activation,"April 24, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/competition-vs-activation/,"Innovators rarely have a competition problem. The challenge isn’t that your market is buying from an alternative provider–the challenge is that they’re buying from no one. The work we do and the stories we tell when we seek to create activation are dramatically different from the mindset of competition, and yet the lessons from our culture (sports, mass merchants, politics) are all about competition. “We’re better than them,” is a competition slogan. That’s very different from, “things could be better,” or “you’re missing this new thing,” or, “people you admire are already using this.” If you want to grow, you’ll need to get someone to not only decide that you’re worth their time and money, you’ll need to motivate them to act now instead of later. "
1159,The host’s rules,"April 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/the-hosts-rules/,"The language we use, the standards we adhere to, the kind of interactions that are permitted–this is up to the host. You’re at a dinner party, and if you want to be welcomed back, you’ll need to be aware of the way things are around here. On the other hand, if you insist on rules that are out of sync with the sensibilities and standards of those you invite, don’t be surprised if they choose not to return. It all begins by understanding who is acting as host. It might be you. "
1160,Ending it gracefully,"April 22, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/ending-it-gracefully/,"Just about every business, every initiative and every intervention fails sooner or later. Since that’s demonstrably true, it’s worth considering how you intend to fail when the time comes. You can pull out every stop, fight every step of the way, mortgage your house and your reputation–and still fail. Or, perhaps, you can quit in a huff at the first feeling of frustration. The best path is clearly somewhere between the two. And yet, too often, we leave this choice unexamined. Deciding how and when to quit before you begin is far easier and more effective than making ad hoc decisions under pressure. "
1161,The discard pile,"April 21, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/the-discard-pile/,"Walking away from something that we’re used to, even if it’s unjust or inefficient or ineffective–it usually takes far too long. Fear, momentum and the status quo combine to keep us stuck. And so it builds up. The cruft calcifies and it gets in our way, making our world smaller, our interactions less human. What used to be normal is rejected and obsolete. It turns out that the status quo is the status quo because it’s good at sticking around. But brave people stand up and speak up and take action. And far too slowly, the system starts to change. Sunk costs are real, but we must ignore them. Culture changes, our standards evolve, opportunities arise. Better is possible… if we care enough to walk away from what was and brave enough to build something new. "
1162,The map is not the territory,"April 20, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/the-map-is-not-the-territory/,"And that’s a feature, the reason the map exists. The phrase reminds us not confuse the diagram or model or overview of the situation with the situation itself. Because they’re not the same.  We make a map so we can leave things out. By leaving things out, we can help people focus on the core concepts we’re trying to get across. And so, the map of the London subway is not actually the London subway. In fact, it’s not even geographically accurate. That’s okay. The job of the map isn’t to show us precisely where each station is, the job is to make it easier to get around London by showing us a theory of the subway. And the words someone uses don’t accurately convey everything they’re feeling and thinking. They simply stake out some of that in a way that the speaker hopes will express the point they’re trying to make. When we decide what to leave out, we’ve made a series of decisions about the story we’re trying to tell with the parts we leave in. "
1163,Unsponsored,"April 19, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/unsponsored/,"When we do our work without regard for a third party, simply to serve the reader, the customer or the story, we’re creating something that’s unsponsored. The third party shows up when we’re encouraged (by payment or other means) to have multiple objectives. And those usually bring compromise. When our goals are aligned with those that we serve, we have a rare chance to maximize both. It’s worth seeking out. We’re not unsponsored. We’re sponsored by the very people we’re engaging with. "
1164,Backward about coming forward,"April 18, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/backward-about-coming-forward/,"If your comment is helpful to anyone else, then it’s generous indeed. Holding back is selfish, because it deprives the group of your insight at the same time that it normalizes non-participation. If you’re wondering, so is someone else. "
1165,Investments and expenses,"April 17, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/investments-and-expenses/,"One goes up in value, the other doesn’t. One creates value over time, the other doesn’t. It’s fun to imagine that our expenses are investments, but if they were, we’d call them investments. Our tools can be re-used, and our assets have value to us and to others. Skills can be an investment, compounding as they grow. Expenses, on the other hand, fade away. "
1166,Everyone is rational,"April 16, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/everyone-is-rational/,"But if that’s true, then why don’t we all agree on the right next step? It could be because everyone has a different experience, different data and different goals. Or, it could be that you are the only one who’s rational. And it could be that we all like to tell ourselves we’re doing the right thing, but ultimately, all we can do is make choices based on how we see the world. The way we see things drives our choices, and, of course, our choices change the way we see things. "
1167,Bad Company,"April 15, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/bad-company/,"The arc of institutions, including governments and corporations, particularly public ones, bends toward short-term thinking, bullying, anti-competitive behavior and laziness. The antidote is persistent vigilance and heroic leadership. The organizational math is compelling. When a toxic employee shows up, it might be easier to simply work around him. When competitors engage in graft or corruption, the easy path is to compete in the same way. It’s only fair. And when employees are rewarded for short-term actions that lead to short-term stock gains, the bad behavior compounds. Some theorized that cutthroat competitive markets were the antidote to the corroding organization. After all, if your team is losing the game, you’ll get your act together–it works in baseball, they say. The problem is that short-term competitive markets reward short-term competitive thinking, which, while it might diminish sloth, does little to help in the long run. The entropy of organizations means that difficult conversations and a positive ratchet of culture change are unlikely to occur on their own. But there’s an alternative. The alternative is the leader (regardless of her title–authority isn’t the point) who says, “not on my watch.” This is the person who realizes that today at work never happens again, and this opportunity to make things better won’t present itself another time. Of course, it’s exhausting, because you have to do it every day. But that’s why it’s such an extraordinary opportunity. Not simply as a competitor, but as a human. To make things better. "
1168,Can you see it?,"April 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/can-you-see-it/,"Do you notice that you’re dressed dramatically differently than everyone else at the event? That you’re driving at a different pace than everyone else? That your question at the end of the talk lasted four times longer than anyone else’s? That your band’s new single is half the volume of everything else that’s being pitched to this program director? That your code isn’t commented and everyone else’s is? There’s absolutely nothing wrong with being different from the crowd. In fact, it might be the ideal path forward. The problem begins when you don’t see what’s not matching up. The best way to transform the path is to see the path first. History doesn’t always repeat itself, but it usually rhymes. "
1169,“You’re not that good”,"April 13, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/youre-not-that-good/,"These are the three problems with creative work. The first is that when we begin, we’re not that good. This is a fact. The breakthrough for anyone on this journey is adding the word “yet.” It doesn’t pay to pretend that we’ve figured it out before we have. It’s counterproductive to adopt a brittle attitude in the face of criticism. In fact, during this stage, “you’re not that good,” is precisely what we need to hear, because it might be followed with insight on how to get better. The second is that once we start to build skills and offer something of value, some people are going to persist in believing that we’re not that good. Fine. They’ve told us something about themselves and what they want and need. This is a clue to offer our leadership and contribution to someone else, someone who gets what we’re doing and wants it. The smallest viable audience isn’t a compromise, it’s a path forward. Find the folks who are enrolled and open and eager. Serve them instead. The danger is that when you hear rejection during this stage, you might come to believe that you’ve accomplished nothing, as opposed to realizing that you might simply be talking to the wrong people. And the third comes full circle. Because it’s possible that in fact, we’re not that good yet, and there aren’t enough people who want what we’ve got. We’re simply not good enough for this part of the market. So we embrace that truth and begin at the beginning. We’re not good enough yet. We haven’t practiced enough, found enough empathy, understood the genre well enough and figured out how to contribute. Yet. At least for this audience. And then we get better. Sooner or later, these three problems become three milestones on the road to making a difference and doing work we’re proud of. PS today’s the best day to sign up for the Freelancer’s Workshop offered by Akimbo. I hope you’ll join in… "
1170,Identity is often used against us,"April 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/identity-is-used-against-us/,"Identity feels permanent, powerful, emotional and fragile.  Identity has been used to unite college alumni (“we are!”), political factions and groups of all kinds. Criticism is not in short supply, especially lately, and criticism aimed at us, at our core self, is particularly hurtful. “I don’t like you,” is hard to wrestle with. That’s why ad hominem attacks on appearance and other permanent attributes we all have are so difficult to live with. But “you” is not the car you drive, the kind of wine you drink or how you feel about a certain issue in our society. Those are choices. Those are tastes. Those can be changed. When I say I don’t like your idea, I’m not saying that I don’t like you. And if we’ve been persuaded by marketers and politicians that everything we do and say is our identity, then it gets very difficult to learn, to accept useful feedback and to change. Evolving our choices and our tastes is part of being human. Establishing your identity as someone who is not static, open to change and eager for better makes it far easier to engage in a world where some would prefer us to do precisely the opposite. "
1171,All things being equal,"April 11, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/all-things-being-equal/,"Those are four words that are often overlooked when we focus on the rest on the sentence instead. “All things being equal, pick the cheapest option.” Or, “All things being equal, go with the one that creates new opportunities.” Or perhaps, “All things being equal, stick with what you’ve got.” The thing is, all things are rarely equal. We rush over the equal part and race to the second part of the clause, going for the cheaper one or whatever the organizational default is. It’s worth a cycle or two to realize that we might be missing nuances in our decision making. All things are rarely equal. "
1172,The plan for day 100,"April 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/the-plan-for-day-100/,"What do you want to be doing 100 days from now? What change do you seek to be making? With which skills? Surrounded by which people? For that to happen, day 99 will need to be different from today. And so will day 98. In fact, so will tomorrow. If we keep focusing on ‘what’s next’ we might never get around to doing the work we need to do to get us to day 100. PS happy day 100 of 2021. "
1173,Perfect is not the same as perfectionism,"April 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/perfect-is-not-the-same-as-perfectionism/,"Perfectionism is a cudgel and a way to hide. Perfect is the often-attainable outcome of meeting spec. “That’s perfect!” says the delighted patron. Modern perfect: A plane that doesn’t crash, a bus that leaves on time. Surgery that fixes a broken valve and a computer program that doesn’t cause a kernel panic. These are the building blocks of our built world. Perfectionism is a way to berate others for not meeting imaginary standards. Or berating ourself as a way to avoid shipping the work. The perfectionist desires an outcome that can never be achieved. That’s why they’re a perfectionist–to hide behind the impossible. Few things outside of mathematics are ever truly perfect. But our definition of spec gives us room to do the work. The bus that comes early does no one any favors. Making promises and keeping them is the path of someone who seeks to contribute. We need better specs, usefully functioning systems and more reliable promises.  Holding back for too long because it could be somehow better than spec, though, is a way to avoid contributing. And using power or privilege to insist that others meet our ever-increasing but ever-less-useful standards is unhelpful. Better? Sure. Work for that. But perfectionism is a defect. "
1174,“What’s the hard part?”,"April 8, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/whats-the-hard-part-2/,"A useful way to get in sync. “What’s the hard part” is a question that everyone on the team should be able to answer. But you won’t find out unless you ask the question. You might discover that many people think the hard part is directly related to what they do all day. And you might discover that some people insist that the hard part has nothing to do with what they do all day–even if it does. What is the difficult work that, if it went well, would transform the impact of this project? Where are the projects worth focusing on, the things that would be difficult to outsource in a productive way? When we roll all of this up to the enterprise, it’s up to the CEO to be clear about what the hard part really is – the solvable problem that if it were solved would make a significant difference for the enterprise. Almost all the cycles involved in creating and building something aren’t particularly difficult. They’re important, certainly, we can’t ride the bike unless it has wheels. But wheels aren’t hard to find and purchase at a fair price. A team’s awareness and focus on the hard parts dramatically shifts the prospects for the project. "
1175,Fixing Zoom calls: Looking better and feeling better,"April 7, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/fixing-zoom-calls-looking-better-and-feeling-better/,"It’s time to get serious about how we show up in remote meetings. For a year, we slogged through it, but it was exhausting. Not only did we feel lousy at the end of the day, but other people rarely saw us at our best. Now that it’s clear that the nature of work and meetings has changed forever, perhaps this is a good moment to embrace what’s possible. I’ve put together a rig in my office that is noteworthy for two reasons: Here’s a short sample. And here’s a photo of what it looks like from my side. Here’s how to do it. First! It’s free, it takes about one minute and will change the way you feel at the end of the day. In Zoom, find the button for HIDE SELF VIEW. (Here’s a link). What this means is that as in real life, you won’t be able to see yourself. It turns out that looking in the mirror all day wears us out. You’ll have to change the setting at the start of every meeting (this should be high on their list of things to fix) but it’s pretty easy. By hiding your face from your screen, you can focus more on everyone else in the meeting. Second, also free: rearrange your workspace so that light is not coming from behind you.  The next steps cost more in setup and money, and I’ll cover them from easiest to most involved. Part of the magic of video meetings is that without a commute or fancy equipment beyond a phone or a laptop, people could join. But it’s become clear that it’s possible to deliver more fidelity and impact by investing in some tech. Just as we don’t hesitate to buy a new outfit for a big meeting, or pay $500 for a plane ticket, these are investments, and in the scheme of your career, they’re pretty reasonable–and your boss should pay for them: Get some LED lights. They’re incredibly cheap now (here’s a sample, but shop around.) Set them up to the left and right of your screen, a few feet behind it. Get an external DSLR camera and hook it up to your Mac or PC. This is a much bigger commitment, but the difference it makes is startling. You’ll need a camera, a tripod, and a capture box. Again, all three have alternatives, feel free to shop around. I use this capture box, but your mileage may vary. (And scroll down to the end of this post for a camera alternative) How it works: The camera goes on a tripod and sits just above and slightly behind your computer screen. The HDMI output goes to your capture box and then into your computer. In Zoom, change the camera from your computer to the camera. Done. It also pays to get a power cable for your camera so it doesn’t run out on you. (You can add a microphone while you’re at it). And then, there’s one last step, which has been the biggest leap for me since the self-view insight.  When you look at the camera in a zoom call, you’re not looking at the person you’re talking with. You’re staring over their head if you’re looking at the camera, or, possibly, you’re looking at them, but it appears to them that you’re looking at your keyboard. Either way, there’s no eye to eye connection. This is unnatural. You’d freak out if you had a real life meeting with someone who never made eye contact. And it’s really tiring, because you end up spending your time not doing something humans evolved to do, which is look at each other. The alternative? A beam splitter. These are used for teleprompters. It’s basically a piece of fancy glass, at an angle, on top of a monitor or screen. Behind the glass is the camera. You can look directly at the glass, and the camera behind it, but instead of looking at the glass and the camera, what you’re actually looking at is the teleprompter or the stuff that’s on the screen. It’s magical. This setup is now far cheaper than I expected. Here’s a typical beamsplitter with hood and mount, and here’s a monitor that should fit with it. Total cost under $300. [or if you’ve already got a late-model iPhone or iPad along with a Mac, there’s a new app called Reincubate Camo, which is a much better product than the name implies. It allows you to skip buying an external camera and use the device tethered to your Mac instead. You’ll still need a tripod, still and you can probably make it work with the beamsplitter…] The entire setup, all of the things that I’ve listed above, comes to less than $1,000–less than half of that if you already have a camera or use Camo. If you go to a meeting a day, that’s a few dollars a meeting over the course of a year. It’s not for everyone, but if you are looking for the tools to be more productive, I hope it helps. "
1176,Jobs to be done,"April 6, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/jobs-to-be-done/,"The dog needs to be fed, there’s a blog post to write, a report is due, there’s a meeting at 10, this form from the bank has to be submitted… We can measure our performance (and our days) by how well we’re doing the jobs to be done. They focus our attention and our effort and create positive outcomes when we do them on time (and negative ones when we don’t). 12 or more years of school are nothing but this. Training in awareness of jobs to be done, and applying the minimum amount of effort to get those jobs done. Show me your list of jobs to be done and I’ll have a good idea of how you spend your time and the impact you’re making. Easily overlooked, though, is the process of how something gets on our agenda or doesn’t. Working on voting rights, paying attention to voices unheard, grabbing possibilities for learning or growth or contribution–these are easy to ignore if they’re not on the list of jobs to be done. And the people who do have these on their list… part of their job is to put their issue on our lists. As soon as you sign up for a social network, it becomes a job to be done. And the moment you take investment for a new company, your jobs to be done completely change. This gets meta pretty quick: one of the jobs to be done is to be clear about what the jobs to be done are, and whether or not they are the right jobs.  And another one of the jobs to be done is helping other people see that the things we care about belong on their list of jobs to be done. If all you’re doing is the jobs you used to do, you’re certainly missing out on the contributions you’re capable of. "
1177,Getting better,"April 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/getting-better/,"The optimism and possibility that come from training and learning in groups is a miracle. It means that, with a little effort, we can level up, become more productive and enjoy the work more tomorrow than we did yesterday. The folks at Akimbo are offering some proven and tested workshops… here’s their schedule for signups in April: The altMBA is the first and most powerful workshop of its kind. The July session has its Early Decision Deadline tomorrow, Tuesday. Ask someone who has done it–70 countries, 5,000 alumni so far. The magical Podcasting Workshop, with Alex DiPalma, has enrollment beginning tomorrow. It’s now in its eighth session, and there are thousands of podcasters out in the world today because of the foundation and framework this community workshop created for them. It will clarify your thinking and help you find your voice. And the fabled Freelancer’s Workshop begins in about a week. You can sign up today and be sure you don’t miss a thing.

1178,Enrollment,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/enrollment/,"It’s more productive to offer directions to someone who has already decided to go on the journey. “How do I get there?” is a much easier transaction than, “you must go.” When there’s mutual enrollment, we call it alignment. If people in the organization are all committed to a similar destination, management becomes more like coaching. In fact, we end up calling them a team instead of a company or a division. Instead of using authority, discipline and extrinsic rewards, teams that are enrolled in the journey are more likely to look for signposts of progress. Instead of focusing on shortcuts, competition and scarcity, teams that are enrolled are more resilient, cooperative and committed. Public school has confused us about how important enrollment can be. That’s because organized schooling is mandatory, and ‘enrollment’ is simply something that happens on paper, not emotionally. It’s far easier to coach a spirited cricket team than it is to teach those very same kids improper fractions. That’s obvious–in the first case, they’re enrolled in the game, and in the second, they’re simply complying with as little effort as possible. As Anthony Iannarino says, “too many leaders use their organizational authority instead of inviting people to an adventure, one with meaning, and one that will require growth. Leaders mistakenly believe everyone is motivated by money.” There’s a hierarchy to enrollment. At the most primitive level, it’s a desire to evade punishment, to avoid banishment, to stay alive and preserve the status quo. There are no dreams here, simply fear. Sometimes, this evolves into a mutually beneficial entanglement between the boss and the bossed. The enrollment turns into a desire to please, a figurehead-focused loyalty and dedication that often ends poorly because there’s nothing beyond the dyad. Without external signposts, solipsism and dittoheads result. More common and more resilient is the enrollment in the tribe. “People like us do things like this.” This is the culture we each choose to live in, the narrative of what it means to choose to be an insider. Status roles and affiliation in a perpetual dance. Enrollment in the group seems to be the dominant form of the human condition, and it’s a place where many leaders and marketers do their best work. But peer-to-peer enrollment can co-exist with the individual’s desire for meaning and contribution. This is where dreams live and leaders come from. When people enroll in a journey to make things better through effort and contribution, they’re finding a source of inspiration and sustenance from within. Money, cash money, is a blunt instrument used by organizations and individuals to short circuit much of the hierarchy of enrollment. The idea is that it’s a multi-purpose signifier, an easy way to say, “whatever you seek, whether it’s money for food or money to build a hospital wing, do this and you’ll get some.” And then, to make it even more brutally effective, money as an inducement is combined with the threat of banishment, with keeping someone on the knife’s edge of survival, either financial or emotional. But money is a story, and it’s a story that is interpreted differently by different people in different moments. When we default to a simple number, we dehumanize the transaction and fail to see what people really need and want. Where does enrollment come from? It’s certainly easier to start by hiring or leading people who are already enrolled. This is what happens with Major League Baseball calls someone up from the minors. They’re not trying to persuade this person to like baseball, and the promotion from sub-minimum wage to hundreds of thousands of dollars isn’t the lever, either. Dreams realized is enough. But where do the dreams come from in the first place? I think it might be a combination of two things: Enrollment is a combination of what we do and what we’ve been surrounded by. Appropriate difficulty followed by learning. Peer support and peer pressure. Expectations understood and perhaps met. Small steps that lead to an appetite for effort and outcomes.  It’s almost impossible to manage someone to enrollment, but we can lead them there. "
1179,Three kinds of ‘fied’,"April 4, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/a-seat-at-the-table-2/,"Qualified means that you’ve done the work, earned our trust and could be invited to join us. More than ever, our current technology and the lack of gatekeepers mean that your body of work could earn you the benefit of the doubt and give you a chance to speak up. Disqualified is what happens if you make big promises but don’t keep them, or if you expose intent that isn’t in alignment with what the rest of us expect or need. Unqualified is rare. As in, “you have our unqualified support.” Getting the benefit of the doubt long after most people would have lost our trust is a hard-won privilege. It’s hard to earn unqualified support, and if you do, careful not to waste it. And too often, before we even begin looking at skill, we’re judging people for other reasons. That’s wrong and it’s wasteful as well. Being confused about what makes someone qualified or not perpetuates injustice. "

1181,The 30-foot rule,"April 2, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/the-30-foot-rule/,"If you’re designing a package, a cover, a fashion or even a meme… The goal is to have it be recognizable from across the room. That doesn’t mean it has to be loud or interruptive. But when we’re looking for it, we should be able to pick it out of a crowd. ‘Across the room’ isn’t about distance, it’s about the emotional gap, about clutter and about the status quo. Being distinctive is a choice, and it’s not an easy one. Because it requires you to stand for something and to serve a specific audience, not everyone. A visit to the supermarket demonstrates the power of this approach. Justin’s peanut butter, Pirate Booty snacks and the distinctive Coke bottle all pass the test. So do the best book covers. But it also applies to the way Linda Oh plays the bass, your therapist answers the phone or Kenji Lopez-Alt writes a recipe. Distinctive isn’t easy. But it’s worth it. "
1182,No fooling,"April 1, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/04/no-fooling/,"When the world was small, our understanding of ‘reality’ was consistent, which is why a good April Fool’s joke felt right. It tweaked the normal just enough to cause us to wonder about what else might not be as it seems. But the onslaught of manipulated media and amplified division has pushed us away from our small circle of reality. Now we’re aware that so many people have a different lived experience than we do. And we are exposed–sometimes several times a minute–to falsehoods, scams and bullying. The first of April was a day when we were supposed to be aware that not everything was as it seemed, that we should be on our guard. And now, exhausting as it is, every day is like that. I’m hopeful that our culture is resilient enough to get back to the truth.  Show your work. Earn attention and build trust. Every day. Too much spin simply makes us dizzy. "
1183,Errors in personification,"March 31, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/errors-in-personification/,"“The sun is trying to break through the clouds.” “The virus doesn’t like it when people stay home and isolate.” “The computer didn’t expect you to type that.” Of course, the sun, the virus and the computer aren’t people. And genes aren’t actually selfish, and new data demonstrates that we don’t really have a lizard brain. But these aren’t errors at all. It makes it easier to predict what a non-human is going to do if we imagine that it has motivations and preferences that are like ours. Two problems can arise, though: The first is when we assert human motivations that don’t actually do a good job of prediction. For example, imagining that events are motivated by some sort of unrelated specific superstition or narrative. The second is more problematic: It happens when we personalize other people–imagining that they’re not just humans, but they’re us. “If I were you…” is not always a useful predictor, because you’re not me. And vice versa. Everyone has their own history, their own biases and their own irrationalities. Personification is a useful shortcut if it helps us make smart predictions about others, but it’s a trap if we assume that we’re the only ones who are right. "
1184,A thing about ‘normal’,"March 30, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/a-thing-about-normal/,"Normal is the thing many don’t notice. Until it changes. And then we can’t unsee how much we had failed to pay attention to.  Who’s on the short list for consideration, who is given the benefit of the doubt, who gets a head start… We begin to notice the people that are artificially selected to seem like the right ones, who are then supposed to be better and anointed as normal. I was thrilled that Unilever has decided to get rid of the word ‘normal’ on their personal care product labels. Because when it comes to people, normal is an artificial construct, the center of a statistical bell curve but not a standard that we ought to seek to achieve, even if we could. Normal is a distribution, not a person. "

You know, the one with a nut bolster for added strength and versatility. What’s it for? Can I use it to open a paint can? Well, sure you can, but you could find easier and cheaper substitutes. And you might get paint on the screwdriver, which would make it much less effective for its real job. Can I use it to turn this Phillips-head screw? Well, possibly, but you’ll probably strip the screw. Can I use it to stir my coffee? Well, sure, but why? This all seems obvious. And yet, we can ask the same questions about your website, your advanced degree, your office building… Or this meeting, that job description or the choice to work a nine-hour day. What’s it for? If it’s a tool, not a destination, what’s the tool for? It doesn’t have to be expensive, all-purpose or exactly the same as the others are using. It simply needs to do the job you need it to do better than any other alternative method. "
1186,Celebrity Art (priceless/worthless),"March 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/celebrity-art-priceless-worthless/,"Why are some paintings so valuable? Works by Rothko or Matisse are worth millions. The Mona Lisa is truly priceless. There are four reasons, all working together, all quite relevant today as we remake our culture around digital goods: Beauty/decoration. Since before the 20,000 year old cave paintings in France, we’ve been putting things on our walls. Things that are beautiful, or remind us of important stories, or simply our humanity. It happens regardless of income or culture.  Status/scarcity. When gold became revered for its scarcity, it began to show up in the decorations of households that aspired to be seen as high status. The same happened with spiritual relics and items from antiquity. A decoration that is scarce and in demand acquires a sort of cultural beauty that some people seek out. The printing press. Until 500 years ago, no given painting (or tapestry) was seen by many people. And then, quite suddenly, images began to spread. Durer sold many thousands of the eight editions of his woodcut, and it was one of the first famous pieces of art. And the Mona Lisa? It’s so valuable because it was stolen just as newspapers (in color!) were becoming widespread. Her face was on the front page of newspapers around the world, ensuring her celebrity for generations. While the fame and cultural currency that the printing press created was a boon for artists, art collectors and dealers, it was also a huge problem. If a print could be had for a few dollars, what good is the original? How to satisfy those that sought status from the decoration on their walls? First and best version. And thus the last pillar. An original oil painting is truly different from a signed print, which is different from the mass market poster. People wait in line to see a famous painting. They gasp in its presence. They take selfies with it, and it elevates the way they feel about themselves and the world. Museums exist to show us what we all own, our shared cultural heritage, the output of our culture in the form of original work created by artists with something to say. I’ve sat in the Art Institute for hours, simply breathing the same air as a Magritte. I grew up at the Albright Knox in Buffalo, with the DeBuffet’s, the O’Keefe’s and the Still’s. The Marisol is an old friend. They were worth the trip. There used to be museums that forbid people from taking photographs. Over time, they’ve come to realize that this is foolish, because sharing the photographs don’t take anything away from the value of the painting, they add to it (though the sometimes annoying act of the person with a flash or a shutter click is a different story). The top of the painting market is 50 billion dollars or more a year. Wealthy people and institutions trading scarce originals, and sometimes, perhaps, exhibiting them, for the public or for people who come over for dinner. When there’s a huge signed Jill Greenberg on the other side of the dining room table from you, it’s unforgettable. But now, we’ve taken the printing press to a whole new level. That has made some existing paintings more famous than ever. But it has also created a billion images that were never paintings in the first place. There are millions of painters who aspire to be at the most expensive tier of working artist creating for the auction houses and collectors, but very few achieve this goal every year. And there are countless collectors who buy paintings hoping that there value will soar, but most fail to succeed. The art market has shifted from something that supports art to something that is mostly a market. Some collectors bought art they didn’t like, simply because they were persuaded that the system would make it increase in value or that their perception of status was so shaky that they needed the next big thing. Some painters were pushed to create painting that would go up in value instead of work they believed in. Museums ended up with tens of thousands of paintings in storage. Wealthy collectors put priceless paintings into tax-free havens, simply as a hedge, not for any of the emotions that painting originally set out to produce. And now, if you’re a fine artist, hoping to make a living selling canvases for far more than they cost to produce, beauty is insufficient. The market for this sort of status is demanding curation and approval and yes, celebrity. And if you’re a cyber-person, intent on pushing NFTs (the abbreviation for Non-Fungible Token, unhelpful shorthand for ‘an unduplicatable digital code that’s easy to trade and speculate on’) then it’s worth noting: Digital tokens aren’t beautiful. Digital tokens will never make someone gasp. No one wants to see your hard drive. It’s quite difficult to display the status or beauty of something that isn’t connected to 20,000 years of cultural expectations, institutional embrace and design evolution. And if you can’t display your status or enjoy the beauty, then it’s simply a speculative trade. People buy and trade stocks in order to make a profit. Most of them are largely indifferent to what the stock certificate looks like. I think we’re always going to be hooked on status, and we’re always going to seek beauty. I’m not sure, though, that just because we can marketize and digitize something that it will inherit so many of the cultural tropes that are at the core of the human experience. "

There are four quadrants, and the thing you offer can fit into one of them. Perhaps you make a low-priced treat, something that people want. Wrigley’s gum or Heinz ketchup, or an app that’s fun to use. Because it’s cheap, it might appeal to the masses. Because it’s a ‘want’, you’re not going to kill anyone if it doesn’t work now and then. In the other corner, you might choose to sell pacemakers. Sure, your profit per unit is in the thousands, but the room for failure is precisely zero. You won’t sell a lot, and every single one of them better work. The other two corners are also fascinating in their own way. Perhaps you want to offer a luxury good, something that’s clearly a want, and not a matter of life and death. You won’t sell many of your $15,000 handbags, but that’s okay, because the margins are great. But it better increase my status! And finally, there’s the tempting but difficult quadrant of low-priced goods that the user feels are mission critical. This is a vial of insulin or a web service that backs up data in real time (which can feel like life or death). Tempting, because people are always happy to pay a bit less for something they really need. And dangerous, because if you fail to invest in keeping your promise, everything falls apart. "
1188,Cons at scale,"March 26, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/cons-at-scale/,"Traditional con men do their work one person at a time. It’s a laborious process, earning trust and the benefit of the doubt before ultimately ripping someone off. Toward the end of my dad’s life, shameless/shameful phone salespeople did just this and stole his trust, his time and his money. Like most things, industrialists want to do it faster and bigger. Scammy direct mail used to be obvious even at a distance. The labels, the stamps, the typography–it all signaled that this wasn’t personal. And the occasional phone salesperson, calling from a boiler room–we could tell. Now, as data acquisition continues to scale and become ever more granular, the hustle is getting more personal. It’s in an uncanny valley–almost real, but not quite. And of course, the distance keeps getting shorter. So the mail merge, the phone spam, the faux intimacy of a stranger. They continue to blur the lines between personal and personalized.  The end result is going to be a shrinking of our previously-widening circle of trust. The benefit of the doubt is priceless. I have no patience for people who want to take it away from us. "
1189,And who are you really?,"March 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/and-who-are-you-really/,"There’s a desire to celebrate our “authentic” self. But perhaps our considered self, the one that shows up when we’re doing our best to be consistent, generous and professional–that’s our authentic self. And the voice that slips out when we’re tired, stressed or busy is simply an incomplete and lesser version of who we actually are. We’re the sum total of the interactions we choose to create and the changes we contribute. "
1190,"Certainty, accuracy and leadership","March 24, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/certainty-accuracy-and-leadership/,"Certainty: Resolute in the face of criticism and implacable when confronting evidence to the contrary. ‘Never in doubt’ is more important than being right. The need to prove strength and consistency often ties us into knots, particularly in a world with new information and insight arriving so often.  Accuracy: Aware that the sum total of our current assertions is a measure of our wisdom, which means that disproven hypotheses should be abandoned as soon as the truth is made clear. The scientific method is a process, not a lab coat or a textbook. Changing one’s point of view is a virtue, not a flaw. It seems clear that for just about anything that we can measure, if it really matters, accuracy is a better trait than certainty. And yet our instincts and our media cycles seem to push us toward certainty instead. "
1191,Public companies are too often out of alignment,"March 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/public-companies-are-always-out-of-alignment/,"The public markets can offer a company quite a bit: Cash right now. Liquidity for the future. A currency to help recruiting and retention. And public companies come with a giant caveat: They are owned by people (the shareholders) who might sell out at any moment. And new ones can take their place in an instant. This flexible ownership is part of the attraction of the stock market, but it also means that you can’t count on the people and institutions that own your organization taking a long-term view. (Long-term for them might even be a week in the future). As a result, the others that the organization seeks to serve: The environment, their customers, the employees, the culture… often lose out. Because thanks to Milton Friedman’s mythology, the primacy of the shareholder (the one who drives the stock price, the very stock price that drives management) means that every time these companies seek to serve one of their other constituents, they have to do a sort of dance, explaining to shareholders why, after all, really and truly, what they’re actually doing is serving the shareholders. Not just serving them, serving them right now. And, thanks to the short-term interests of many people who trade stocks, there’s pressure to own shares that go up the most today, not a company you’re proud to own for the long run. Sometimes, the enlightened and powerful leadership of a company is able to ignore the whining of the shareholders. If you don’t like where this bus is going, sell! But over time, that resolve often fades. I saw this first hand at Yahoo. When everyone who works for you and around you is watching the stock price, it’s hard to decide to do the right thing. If you want to run an organization you’re proud of, choose your ownership as carefully as you choose your employees. "
1192,The confusion about “sorry”,"March 22, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/the-confusion-about-sorry/,"“I’m sorry that your cat died,” does not mean that I killed your cat. But, “I’m sorry that I stepped on your foot,” does mean that I stepped on your foot. In creating connection and trying to make amends, we often get confused by the two kinds of ‘sorry’, and don’t apologize because we believe the problem wasn’t our fault. “I’m sorry that you had to wait two hours while your car was being serviced.” That’s a valid sentence, even if it wasn’t your fault that the schedule was overfull. “I’m sorry that you’re stranded here and you’re going to miss the big meeting. I know it was important,” is a useful thing to say even if you didn’t cause the snow storm. “I’m sorry” can simply mean, “I see you.” "

It doesn’t apply to anything we’ve ever purchased. It doesn’t apply to any project we’ve sponsored. Or anyone we’ve ever voted for, dated or befriended, either. In fact, it’s a great excuse for the things we’re afraid to do, or where our inclination is to say no anyway. If you’re hoping for inaction, look for perfect. "
1194,Ten reasons to write a book,"March 20, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/ten-reasons-to-write-a-book/,"More than ten, actually. Millions of books will be published this year and for good reason. People rarely regret the effort. Everyone has their own, but here are some of the reasons to get you started: It clarifies your thinking. It leaves behind a record of where you are in this moment. It’s clearly not going to be a worldwide mass-market bestseller, so you can focus only on the people who want to hear from you. It’s a project that is completely and totally up to you. Because it’s a generous way to share. As hobbies go, it’s energy-efficient, takes up very little space and is portable. Because then you get to write another one. It will increase your authority in your field. We need to hear your ideas, they matter. And then you become an author. It’s not that hard to publish it when you’re done. The publishing is a bonus, a way to seek completion, not the point of the exercise. And… it’s not as lonely as you think. PS if you sign up for my friend Kristin’s community of practice, you can do it together. With others on a similar journey. It’s generative, filled with possibility and fun.  "
1195,Resilience,"March 19, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/resilience-3/,"The world is going to change, and resilience is our best response. It’s not about building things that always turn out the way we expect. Bulletproof is too expensive, too rigid and requires perfect knowledge of the future. Resilience is a commitment to a design, an attitude and a system that works even when things don’t turn out the way we planned. Especially then. Instead of designing for the best case scenario, we make the effort to consider how our work thrives when the best case doesn’t arrive. Because that’s far more likely. Sailors know that fixing on a point on the horizon is a good way to survive a storm. Flexibility, community, and a sense of possibility can go a long way. That doesn’t make it easier, but it’s our best path forward. "
1196,The dance between the long tail and the short head,"March 18, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/the-dance-between-the-long-tail-and-the-short-head/,"When distribution is scarce, the hits are powerful indeed. AM Top 40 radio meant that if you made that list of 40 hits, you were going to sell a huge number, and if you didn’t, you were gone. Giant movie screens meant a few movies could play for months and own the market. Limited independent bookstores kept a hit on the bestseller list for up to a year. And then, when the long tail arrives, there’s a riot of variety, with most of the available offerings selling few indeed (most videos on YouTube have fewer than 25 views) but the ones on the shoulders do far better than they ever would before. This happened to movies in the 1990s when the number of screens multiplied, and to cable TV when the premium networks were okay with 3 million viewers for Mad Men. Excited creators start to imagine infinity. There will be room for an unlimited number of Kindle books or YouTube videos or Netflix shows… And that’s when the pendulum starts to oscillate a bit. Because the media business remains a business, and it’s largely built on attention, and attention is scarce and it’s hard to scale. So instead of an infinite number of successful titles, the market begins to segment. Instead of one blockbuster movie like Jaws that owns the summer for an entire nation, there are multiple markets, multiple audiences. But within those segments, there are still hits. Short heads built on multiple long tails. Yes, having the most popular podcast in the world is quite valuable. But having the most popular podcast for a particular audience is valuable as well.  And we continue to segment for as long as the attention can be lumped together in valuable ways. But, at the same time, we live in community, and we have a thirst for the big hit, the one that ‘everyone’ is talking about. The disconnect occurs when producers and creators try to average things out and dumb things down, hoping for the big hit that won’t come. Or overspend to get there. The opportunity lies in finding a viable audience and matching the project’s focus and budget to the people who truly want it. And the dance continues. "
1197,The things we go back to,"March 17, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/oh-the-places-youll-go-back-to/,"If you’re used to a messy desk, cleaning it will probably be a temporary measure. Credit card companies have discovered that if a person carries $2,000 in debt with a $3,000 credit limit, they’ll probably have $4,000 in debt if the credit limit gets raised to $5,000. People who live with drama at work will almost certainly invent new drama (of any scale) if the existing drama fades away. The world is real, and opportunities and pain are unfairly and unevenly distributed. At the same time, our narrative and our habits are real as well, and they work to prove themselves right. We organize our lives to maintain the pressures and boundaries we’re used to. We’d like to pretend we’re just going to bear with it until we get through this urgency, but we’re usually lying to ourselves. A new habit takes at least thirty uncomfortable days to form, and a new habit is unrelated to the external forces (positive and negative) that we’re so good at finding and embracing. "
1198,The revolution in online learning,"March 16, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/the-revolution-in-online-learning/,"Not education, learning. Education is a model based on scarcity, compliance and accreditation. It trades time, attention and money for a piece of paper that promises value. But we learn in ways that have little to do with how mass education is structured. If you know how to walk, write, read, type, have a conversation, perform surgery or cook an egg, it’s probably because you practiced and explored and experienced, not because it was on a test. We’re in danger of repeating the failed approaches of education in an online setting, and today I’m launching a series of lectures about the difference–and how to make online learning work. Opening doors for people so that they can learn is an extraordinary opportunity, one that focuses on possibility, not compliance. No one that I know of has clearly described the elements of this new revolution, so I decided to share what I know.  Since founding the altMBA and Akimbo workshops more than five years ago (it’s now an independent B corp) I’ve been exploring what it means to build new approaches to online learning that work, that scale, and that are effective. The workshops have had a significant impact on more than 20,000 people in 75 countries. I’ve heard from bestselling authors, founders and high school teachers, all wondering about the best practices for this new moment in learning. The results that students have achieved in the workshops are completely off the charts. Better completion rates, astonishing amounts of interaction and growth, and most of all, lives transformed.  As 2021 arrives, there’s a huge uptick in learning companies being founded and funded, independent teachers looking for new platforms as well as institutions shifting gears with online learning coming to the fore. Google is launching certificate-granting courses, and schools are continuing to grapple with what it means for students to be remote. Alas, many of these efforts are unlikely to succeed at their stated goal of creating learning interventions that actually work. Some will be popular because they focus on entertainment instead of learning. And some will remain stuck in the old models of management and compliance. Fortunately, some of these new efforts will actually facilitate learning for the people who engage with them. We’ve seen all this before, and my hope is that people who are responsible for what’s getting built will learn from our experience. We’re at the very beginning of a worldwide transformation in how people learn.  If you’re a teacher or an organizer, an investor or a leader, I hope you’ll take a few hours to learn about learning. I’ve put what I know into a short series of recorded lectures (not a workshop) on Udemy. (There’s a coupon to save you a few bucks–it’s valid for the first 500 people who sign up.) I’m aware of the irony in creating lectures about the power of workshops over lectures, but in this case, I wanted to put a stake in the ground that people could explore on their own and with their teams. We have a chance to build a future based on contribution, possibility and insight. And we can do it at scale. The educational regimes of the last century have distracted us. It turns out that the obvious and easy approaches aren’t actually the ones that we need to focus on. When we commit to outcomes, the path is more clear. "
1199,Technical generations,"March 15, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/technical-generations/,"“What’s a fax machine?” There are people working today who don’t know. In the 1980s, I produced a book about VCR tapes and video stores that’s so obsolete, you can’t even find a used copy any more. Technical generations keep getting shorter–A hard drive from ten years ago is probably not going to work with your new laptop. Contrast this with us. Human generations have been chronicled for thousands of years. We know who begat who.  Lee De Forest, father of radio, was raised by people who voted for Abraham Lincoln, but he died when Bruce Springsteen was twelve years old. That’s not many handshakes from “The Battle Hymn” to “Blinded by the Light”… During that same period of time, we invented and moved on from radio, live TV, nationwide magazines, color TV, cable TV, Compuserve, Yahoo, GeoCities, The Globe, MySpace and 10,000 other steps. I’ve lived exactly half my adult life in the 20th century and the other half in the 21st. The cycles keep getting faster, but not the human generations. This means that we’re either bringing a bit of insight and wisdom to the changes, or allowing ourselves to be whipsawed, brainwashed or blindsided by all of it. Up to us. "
1200,In search of amusement,"March 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/in-search-of-amusement/,"Business models rework the world. Organize assets. Add labor. Sell something for enough money that you get to do it again, but more. That’s how we ended up with a $5 chicken in many pots, a car in front of many houses and a world that’s been paved. One cycle at a time, one dollar at a time. Originally, business models were primarily about needs. You need food, I’ll build a farm. You need shelter, I’ll build houses. As parts of the world have gotten richer and richer, though, the money that’s spent (which is what business models are based on) has shifted largely to wants. One millionaire buying collectible cars spends far more than 100 families buying beans or lettuce. Marvel spent $400,000,000 to make Avengers: Endgame. Because there was a business model in place that made it a reasonable investment choice. What if we wanted to cure river blindness or address ineffective policing as much as we wanted to watch movies? The business model would shift and things would change–in a different direction. I’m not sure there’s an intrinsic reason that watching a particular movie is more satisfying than solving an endemic problem. We’ve simply evolved our culture to be focused on the business of amusement instead of the journey toward better. "

And it’s also true that shooting fish in a barrel is pretty easy if there are enough fish and the barrel is small enough. You can’t have both. Either you approach the world as a widely dispersed bunch of opportunities where you’re never specific or on the hook.

On one hand, it celebrates the status quo and scarcity. On the other, it’s a mark of transitions, evolution and diversity. The people inducted into Cooperstown or some other hall of fame in 2021 probably don’t look or act the way the founders of that institution imagined. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is accepting votes right now, and Fela Kuti is up against Iron Maiden and other stalwarts of the genre. And his nomination helps us understand what Scott Page means when he talks about the value of diversity within organizations. There are no all-clarinet orchestras because the combination of instruments is precisely why orchestras work. Pythagoras discovered the fifth hammer, the one that doesn’t sound quite like the others–and that is the hammer that makes the chord work. Fela Kuti was from a country 2/3 the size of the USA, and yet Nigeria has few musical stars in the US. His impact can be felt in just about all the music we hear, because his music was different, singular and remarkable. If some of the musicians in the Hall had never existed, rock and roll would not be that different. There are easily available substitutes. But sometimes, a skilled, passionate and talented voice changes things. Change can happen when a person’s contribution is unanticipated and boundary-stretching. As Carole King’s was. As Fela Kuti’s was. Change isn’t easy to recognize as it’s arriving, but it’s impossible to forget once it’s here. "
1203,Practical elegance,"March 11, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/practical-elegance/,"The 16-foot canvas Prospector canoe made by the Chestnut Canoe Company is not the fastest or the lightest or the cheapest canoe but it is an elegant canoe. Practical elegance is something that is available to all of us. If we choose, it can become the cornerstone of our work. Some of us make a thing and many of us make a system. What makes something practically elegant is that it’s better, smoother, cleaner, more understandable, kinder, more efficient, friendlier or more approachable than it needs to be. Microsoft Windows was never particularly elegant, as you could see the nuts and bolts underneath it. It was clunky, but it got the job done. On the other hand, the Macintosh-for at least 20 years-was surprisingly elegant. When it broke, it broke in an elegant way. It knew things before it asked us to type them in, it had a smile on its face–it seemed to have a sense of humor. When we create something with practical elegance, we are investing time and energy in a user experience that satisfies the user more than it helps the bottom line of the company that made it. Ironically, in the long run, satisfying the user is the single best way to help the bottom line of a company that doesn’t have monopoly power. When a designer combines functionality with delight, we’re drawn to whatever she’s produced. That’s the elegance we’re searching for in our built world. An enemy of practical elegance is persistent complexity, often caused by competing demands, network effects and the status quo. The latest operating system of the Mac is without elegance. When it crashes, and mine has been every few hours for the last week, it crashes poorly. The kernel panic reports are unreadable, by me and by their support folks. The dialogue boxes aren’t consistent, the information flow is uneven and nothing about the experience shows any commitment to polish, to delight or to the user. Practical elegance doesn’t mean that the canoe will never capsize. It means that the thing we built was worth building, and it left the user feeling better, not worse, about their choice. Too often, “customer service” has come to mean “answer the phone and give a refund.” But customer service begins long before something breaks. It’s about a commitment to the experience. Creating delight before it’s expected. Building empathy and insight into the interactions that people will choose to have with you. Of course this takes effort. So do all the other things that go into a product or service. Apparently, though, this effort is perceived as optional by some. As soon as a product or system creator starts acting like the user has no choice, elegance begins to disappear. "
1204,What does it stand for?,"March 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/what-does-it-stand-for/,"A common writer’s trick is to introduce a new term by telling you its origin or what the initials stand for. SMERSH, KAOS, THRUSH, UNCLE, GIF, NFT, SCUBA, CIA, NSA… you get the idea. But knowing what the initials are for doesn’t tell us what it means. And learning who coined a word (and why) is interesting but not the point. We need a new word when the old words are insufficient to express a shared understanding. And the new word is a placeholder for a story. If we share the same story about a word, about its place, its possibility and its promise–then we know what it stands for. New words give us new ways to understand the world, because new words come with stories attached. And disagreements often happen simply because while we’re using the same word as someone else, we’re not telling the same story they are. "
1205,"“Well, it seems great to me”","March 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/well-it-seems-great-to-me/,"Of course it does, you made it. If you shipped it to the world (or even showed it to a colleague) it might be because you liked it. You made it for yourself. But if your music, your graphic design, your website–whatever your work is–isn’t resonating with the market, it might be because you forgot to make it for them. Empathy is at the heart of design. What do people in this group think looks great? What do they need? Make that. "
1206,The cataclysmic breakdown of networked systems,"March 8, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/the-cataclysmic-breakdown-of-networked-systems/,"When each car is separate, they’re dumb, and they break one at a time. When they are part of a networked system, one software glitch can break them all at once. If we use power off the grid, each house creates its own heat. If we benefit from an efficient system of distributed power, a rolling blackout can take them all offline at once. Networks create significant efficiencies at the same time that they produce value that would be impossible without them. And so, relentlessly, we’re hooking everything together. Along the way, it’s worth reminding ourselves just how valuable resilience is. The only kind of network breakdowns we notice are the cataclysmic ones. The benefits of a network are immediately forgotten when the whole thing breaks. "
1207,The sixth layer,"March 7, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/the-sixth-layer/,"Humans differentiated themselves 100,000 years ago by developing the ability to have a detailed memory. Not just “where did I hide the acorns” but rich and diverse memories about people and places. Only a few thousand years ago, we amplified this by making those memories permanent. Telling a story to someone else dramatically increases our memory capacity. Then we started making and saving our notes. And then we developed a common language so we could share those notes with others. The library and the cloud meant that your memory could become my memory too. And only recently we added search, so the memories and insights of a billion or more people could be easily accessed. The sixth layer, now appearing, is an intelligence that prompts us and tells us what is out there before we even decide to search for it. No wonder we’re a bit dizzy. We just multiplied our minds by many orders of magnitude. It’s easy to confuse someone else’s memory (or manipulation) with our hard-earned ability to remember things that actually happened to us.  And we’re now realizing that we have the power (and perhaps the obligation) to use shared knowledge to make better, more thoughtful decisions. And to intentionally edit out the manipulations and falsehoods that are designed to spread, not to improve our lives. "
1208,NFTs are a dangerous trap,"March 6, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/nfts-are-a-dangerous-trap/,"Like most traps, they’re mysterious and then appealing and then it’s too late. An NFT is digital treasure chest, a status symbol and an apparent item of value. Like a Pokemon card, or an original Picasso drawing or the actual frame of a Disney animated film from 1955, NFTs are designed to be the one and only, a shred of non-fungible reality in a world gone digital. You either own this thing or you don’t. To make it really clear, consider Honus Wagner. A Honus Wagner baseball card is quite rare (Wagner didn’t permit the card to be made because he wanted nothing to do with cigarettes, foreshadowing some of the stuff below) and so there were fewer than 200 all in before production shut down. One of the cards last sold for more than $3,000,000. Owning a Honus Wagner card doesn’t mean you own Honus Wagner. Or a royalty stream or anything else but the card itself. For years, this was part of the business model of the collectible card industry. Make billions of cards, most get thrown out, some rookies get famous, some cards go up in value. Now, consider an oil painting. Perhaps it was stolen a long time ago, or became famous for other reasons. It’s the one and only. If you somehow owned the Mona Lisa, it wouldn’t mean that you own the woman who is portrayed in it, or any part of DaVinci, it would simply mean you own a canvas, one that others also want to own.  People can look at images of the Mona Lisa all day long without compensating you, because you simply own the original trophy, not the idea… But having it on your wall gives you a feeling, and telling other people you own it gives you another, slightly different feeling. It’s worth noting two things about the art example: So what’s an NFT? It’s a digital token (the same way a Bitcoin is a digital token) except it’s a one and only, like a Honus Wagner, there’s just one. One of these tokens might refer to something else (a video of a basketball shot, an oil painting, even this blog post) but it isn’t that thing. It’s simply a token authorized by the person who made it to be the one and only one. (The NBA has already sold more than $200 million in video clip highlight NFTs)… And so the trap: CREATORS may rush to start minting NFTs as a way to get paid for what they’ve created. Unlike alternative digital currencies which are relatively complicated to invent and sell, it’s recently become super easy to ‘mint’ an NFT. I could, for example, turn each of the 8,500 posts on this blog into a token and sell them on the open market. The more time and passion that creators devote to chasing the NFT, the more time they’ll spend trying to create the appearance of scarcity and hustling people to believe that the tokens will go up in value. They’ll become promoters of digital tokens more than they are creators. Because that’s the only reason that someone is likely to buy one–like a stock, they hope it will go up in value. Unlike some stocks, it doesn’t pay dividends or come with any other rights. And unlike actual works of art, NFTs aren’t usually aesthetically beautiful on their own, they simply represent something that is. BUYERS of NFTs may be blind to the fact that there’s no limit on the supply. In the case of baseball cards, there are only so many rookies a year. In the case of art, there’s a limited number of famous paintings and a limited amount of shelf space at Sotheby’s. NFTs are going to be more like Kindle books and YouTube videos. The vast majority are going to have ten views, not a billion. It’s an unregulated, non-transparent hustle with ‘bubble’ written all over it. THE REST OF US are going to pay for NFTs for a very long time. They use an astonishing amount of electricity to create and trade. Together, they are already using more than is consumed by some states in the US. Imagine building a giant new power plant just to make Christie’s or the Basel Art Fair function. And the amount of power wasted will go up commensurate with their popularity and value. And keep going up. The details are here. The short version is that for the foreseeable future, the method that’s used to verify the blockchain and to create new digital coins is deliberately energy-intensive and inefficient. That’s on purpose. And as they get more valuable, the energy used will go up, not down. It’s an ongoing waste that creates little in ongoing value and gets less efficient and more expensive as time goes on. For most technological innovations the opposite is true. The trap, then, is that creators can get hooked on creating these. Buyers with a sunk cost get hooked on making the prices go up, unable to walk away. And so creators and buyers are then hooked in a cycle, with all of us paying the lifetime of costs associated with an unregulated system that consumes vast amounts of precious energy for no other purpose than to create some scarce digital tokens. [Here are some other views on this]. I wrote a book about digital cash twenty years ago. This is precisely the sort of cool project and economic curiosity that I want to be excited about. But, alas, I can see the trap and I wanted to speak up with clarity. I would usually make this into an episode of my podcast, but Everest’s article deserved a link and more focus, so here you go. Let’s walk away from this one. "
1209,“I’m just browsing”,"March 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/im-just-browsing/,"We see it all the time, and not just in the store, with a catalog or on a website. You can tell the committed students from the ones who are simply skating by. You can figure out who’s reading the book because they’ve got something at stake and who’s simply wasting time. When we adopt the posture of commitment, something extraordinary happens: The lessons get more profound and useful. The questions asked get more specific and urgent. The connections that are made get deeper. The reason that most online videos and blog posts seem to come and go is because we use a browser to interact with them. “What’s next?” is asked too often. Perhaps it would be more useful to imagine that this is the very last thing we get to engage in before we have to commit to our work… "
1210,The most important meal of the day,"March 4, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/the-most-important-meal-of-the-day/,"Who decides the rhythm of your day? When are you at your best, when do you drag? In the old days, when we worked on the assembly line or even in sync at the office or at school, there were good reasons to adopt the timing that was assigned to us. But perhaps it makes sense to take control and listen and notice and work with our patterns, not against them. High school students perform better when the school day starts later. So let’s organize around that. If a workout at noon makes your afternoon more effective, it’s hard to see why you need to do it at 5 am in a world that’s digital and more asynchronous than ever before. If your day is better if your first interactions are positive ones, why not organize a daily call with peers with nothing but that in mind? And even if your schedule isn’t completely up to you, you might get to decide when to tackle mindless chores and when to work on the creative elements of the new plan. When to read blog posts and when to write them. You may get to decide when to have meetings that challenge your intellect vs. those that require patience… And yes, we even get to decide what to eat for breakfast. Tony the Tiger notwithstanding. "
1211,The weight of repetitive tasks,"March 3, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/the-weight-of-repetitive-tasks/,"As I write this, they’re laying a brick wall outside of my window. Each brick weighs about five pounds. There are a thousand bricks in this wall. And every brick is moved, one by one, from the truck to the cart to the wall. Over time, any inefficient move is costly indeed. Watching professionals do it gives me more admiration than ever for their commitment and grace. If we’re lucky enough to work indoors, with free snacks and podcasts in the background, we might not get physically exhausted the way we would moving thousands of pounds of bricks. But the cognitive and emotional toll of repetitive tasks is real, even if doesn’t leave callouses. The discipline is to invest one time in getting your workflow right instead of paying a penalty for poor digital hygiene every single day. Hacking your way through something “for now” belies your commitment to your work and your posture as a professional. Get the flow right, as if you were hauling bricks. "
1212,A seat at the table,"March 2, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/a-seat-at-the-table-3/,"Harvard, Dartmouth and Stanford are always full. The value of their degree is largely based on scarcity. There are always more people who want to get in than they will allow. That’s intentional. Artificial scarcity to create a credential that appears valuable. Harvard has enough endowment and tech to offer 50x as many degrees as they currently do. Now, though, online learning is upending the equation of scarcity. Do students invest all that time and all that money because they believe they’re going to learn something, or is it simply that they’re going to be awarded a scarce credential?  Because sooner or later, learning wins out. The paper fades, but what you know and who you become lasts. It’s March (wow) and a year of uncertainty, pain and unrest may be beginning to recede. And over the years, the team at Akimbo has seen that the March sessions of their workshops are often the best attended and most powerful. Something about spring (up here) and autumn (south of here) seems to challenge people to take action and to make a difference. The Marketing Seminar is back for its 11th session. It’s the most powerful and most popular marketing workshop in the world. More than 10,000 people have been through it (that’s more marketing wizards than Harvard, Wharton and Stanford graduate in any given year) and now it’s your turn.  Enrollment opens today and the first lesson starts soon. The altMBA deadline for First Priority applications is next week, March 9. The August session is your chance to level up, and early applications are given priority. Writing in Community is back as well. There’s plenty of room for your book in the world, but what you may need is a cohort to help you get it done. Kristin Hatcher leads a group that commits to writing together and publishing together. It opens for signups on March 16th and you can claim a spot on update list by visiting the site today.  And in just a few weeks, the fabled Story Skills Workshop returns. Bestselling author Bernadette Jiwa has taught the world about the magic of story–in branding, in leadership and in communications–and this workshop represents your best chance learn from her and from each other. It opens on March 23, but sign up today for updates. There are tens of thousands of reasons that people just like you have decided to learn something. Akimbo (now an independent B Corp) is built to make it possible for people to lean into possibility, to connect and to learn. These four workshops are the best way I know to make a difference. Each is different, each has a different pace, structure and purpose. But together, they represent a clear, powerful and proven vision for how each of us can level up and learn to contribute. And there’s room for you. PS here’s what a student posted just this morning as part of the 60th lesson in TMS10… "
1213,A letter to your future self,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/a-letter-to-your-future-self/,"We often send metaphorical letters to our past selves, berating the choices we’ve made. We express regret about missed opportunities or past mistakes. It’s easy to blame our younger selves for the mess we’re in. What would you say to your future self? And how would you feel when you read that letter in a few months or years? Maybe you’d discover that the crisis or cataclysm you’re facing right now didn’t turn out quite as badly as you feared. Maybe you’d express some optimism that you could turn into action. And maybe you’d develop some empathy for your past self, who was just doing the best you could. "
1214,Avocado time,"March 1, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/03/the-perfect-avocado/,"The perfect avocado… Sometimes they’re too hard, and often, they’re rotten. But every once in a while, you’ll nurture an avocado until it’s at the peak state of flavor and texture. You certainly aren’t going to waste it. You’re not going to sacrifice it to some sort of smoothie, or even hide it in a sandwich. That’s for the other kind, the less precious ones. And yet… This Zoom call we’re on, the precious one, where all the right people are on the call, at the same time, ready to see and be seen–you’re really going to spend the first ten minutes having us go around the room and say our names? Really? This gathering we all came to, back when we could, or when we can again–we’re really going to sit at tables for 10, shouting at each other, while we tolerate loud music and eat lousy food? This interaction we’re having with the busy professional, the one that we’ve waited for, you’re going to spend it reciting things that we already wrote down on a form? Face-to-face is like a perfect avocado. The cost of in-sync time, real-time interaction time, that’s time that we don’t get again. Time is priceless. But the moments when we have a chance to connect, to be in sync, to bring out the best in each other–that’s time that’s worth cherishing. Don’t waste it if you can. Treat it like avocado time. "
1215,“Count me in”,"February 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/count-me-in/,"That’s the opposite of, “count me out.” Either you seek to unite and be part of it. Or to divide and watch it go away. Whatever ‘it’ might be. We can seek to trigger those we’ve decided are our enemies, undermine the standards and burn it all down. Or we can commit to the possibility that together, we can create something that works. It’s not that hard to realize that even if we can’t always see the gunwales on the boat, we’re all in the same one. "

In Cervantes’ day, ’tilting’ was a word for jousting. You tilted your lance at an enemy and attacked. Don Quijote was noted for believing that the windmills in the distance were giants, and he spent his days on attack. Change can look like a windmill. When we say, “the transition to a new place is making me uncomfortable,” we’ve expressed something truthful. But when we attack a windmill, we’ve wasted our time and missed an opportunity to focus on what matters instead. When my dad taught at the University of Buffalo, the heart of his MBA classes was teaching about the ‘change agent’. This is the external force that puts change into motion. The change agent, once identified, gives us an understanding of our options and the need to respond, not to react. Every normal is a new normal, until it is replaced by another one. "

And if you try to spread the peanut butter on the plate and then add the bread, it will fail even worse. Like so many things, the order is not optional. And yet, we often do the least-scary or easiest parts first, regardless of what the order of operations tells us. "
1218,Grievance and possibility,"February 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/grievance-and-possibility/,"We might be settling scores or we might be opening doors. It’s up to us. Grievance and possibility have confusing roots.  Grievance isn’t about grieving. In fact, it’s the opposite. Grievance is the narrative of getting even.  Possibility doesn’t itemize everything that’s possible. Instead, it focuses on the side effects that come from acting as though things are possible. Grievance looks back and possibility looks forward. Organizations and relationships that are focused on grievance care a lot about their share. About the competition. About maintaining ‘enough’. Organizations that are focused on possibility care a lot about how big the pie is. About innovation. And about what’s next. You can build a relationship or a career on grievance or on possibility. And you can run a justice/penal system that way as well. Possibility begets more possibility. Opportunities multiply. And, alas, grievance leads to more grievance. Because it’s the fuel that keeps the narrative going. Organizations/partnerships/systems that are usefully focused on possibility don’t deny that there are reasons for grievance, that there have been actions and omissions that must be addressed. In fact, they adopt a posture of forward motion as the best way to address the problems that came before.  One challenge is embracing the effective and generative approach of possibility when we’re sure that we’re entitled to grievance. Toward better. "
1219,Ranking the unrankable,"February 24, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/ranking-the-unrankable/,"Weight is a useful measure. 10 pounds is twice as much as 5 pounds. Measuring things and then ranking them effectively enables us to make better choices and to scale up our operations. Sometimes, though, in our rush to standardize and process a complicated world, we begin to measure things that can’t be easily measured, and then, since we’ve measured them, to aggressively rank them. Smart isn’t easily measurable. Neither is beautiful, good or successful. And especially happy. A high SAT score is a measure of whether or not you scored well on the SAT. That’s it. A bank balance is a measure of how much money you have in the bank. That’s all. In the face of the difficulty the system has in measuring things that don’t measure, we create proxies. Things like popularity as a proxy for whether a work of human creativity has worth or not. It’s a method built to process commodities instead of people, and it’s running amok. A precision ranking is nothing but a number, an inaccurate and ultimately useless stand-in. These proxies are created and spread and relied upon by a system that craves certainty and order. Realizing the fraud of the proxies might help us get back to what matters instead. "
1220,The reverse value/luxury curve,"February 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/the-reverse-value-luxury-curve/,"For most products and services, we rate them on a curve. Of course the seat on the discount airline was cramped, but that’s okay because it was cheap. Of course this Camry doesn’t look or ride like a Porsche, don’t be stupid… But, the opposite is true in the high end. When luxury goods are compared to luxury goods, the narrative is, “this one must be better, in absolute and relative terms, precisely because it’s more expensive.” And so hiring McKinsey costs 10x more than hiring a former McKinsey consultant. And so it’s worth more.  And so $150,000 elephant-sized stereo speakers (yes, they exist) are far better than $5,000 speakers (can’t you see?) This goes beyond the standard understanding of a Veblen good. Because in addition to being more expensive, these super-luxury goods are less effective, harder to use and generally a pain in the neck. That’s part of their appeal. (And yes, the same is true for corporate luxury goods, like software and IT consulting…) Price accordingly. And listen to the reviews with a careful skepticism. "

All the time, every day. Having ideas is part of the human condition. The right questions might be: Are you exposing yourself to new inputs and new situations, and challenging yourself to find more interesting ideas? Are you pushing the ideas you have further, making them more complete, turning them from hunches to notions to ideas to theories? Are you publishing your theories, sharing your reasoning and having your ideas collide with the real world in service of making things better? "
1222,Careful what you wish for,"February 21, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/careful-what-you-wish-for/,"Because wishes don’t always come true, but wishing takes a lot of time and energy and focus. What you wish for determines how you’re spending a juicy part of your day. If you wish for something you can’t control, that might fill you with frustration or distract you from wishing that could lead to productive work. Better to wish for something where the wishing itself is a useful act, one that shifts your attitude and focus. "

The call was the call. Same is true for cable–what you watched didn’t matter to them. The reason retail banks are so frustrating to many customers is that because they began with a geographic focus, they’re dumb about who their customers are. They underserve or overserve in random ways. And in trying to serve everyone, they end up doing a lousy job of serving anyone. But there’s no longer a reason for a provider to be dumb. They can optimize for you and your needs. They know what you’ve done and they should be able to guess what you might want next. Not to do this to you, but with you and for you. “You can pick anyone and we’re anyone” is a lousy slogan. How do you make your pipe smarter than that? "
1224,Algorithms give or they take,"February 19, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/algorithms-give-or-they-take/,"If there’s scarcity, we need to make choices. Who gets hired, what website shows up at the top of the search results, who gets a loan. And while we can make those choices on a case by case basis, at scale, we rely on algorithms instead. A series of coded steps, inferences and decision-making heuristics that ostensibly get better as they gather more data. At this point, it’s clear that algorithms are remaking our culture. They drive how social media networks surface content, how search engines highlight websites, how AI makes decisions about who flies or doesn’t, who gets a loan or doesn’t, it’s everywhere, all the time. And algorithms are not neutral. They can’t be. Every decision has consequences, and unlike the pythagorean theorem, there isn’t a right answer, simply a choice about now or later, all along a spectrum. An algorithm takes when it finds a selfish or defective element of society and magnifies it for short-term profit. It finds habits or instincts that individuals might have and exploits them to do something that benefits the algorithm-maker without leaving the culture or the user better off in the long run. And an algorithm gives when it amplifies the better angels of our nature, when it helps us do the things we’d like to do in the long run, for us and the people we care about. A challenge for anyone programming at a monopoly, a public company, a well-funded startup or even a non-profit in search of donors is this: Do you have the guts to build an algorithm you can be proud of even if it doesn’t pay off as well in the short run? Because if the answer is no, blaming the system isn’t going to help anyone. You are the system, we all are, and given the power of invisible and leveraged algorithms, it’s essential that they be created and maintained by people who understand that they’re responsible for the impact they make. More on this here and here. "

At least you won’t get blamed if something goes wrong. It turns out that we don’t need an abundance of caution. We need appropriate caution. They’re different things. Abundant caution is wasted. Things like ripe avocados and morel mushrooms are terrific to have in abundance. By definition, though, abundant caution is not only more than we need, it’s more than is helpful. Because we get hooked on the feeling. We can always make a risk ever smaller. But the cost is that we will increase other risks. Please don’t avoid appropriate caution. It matters to you and to the community. But seeking reassurance and peace of mind by trying to drive risk to zero doesn’t get you either one of them.

(And I’m talking about any middleperson–a gallerist, a TV network, a movie studio, a label–they’re all publishers). One risk is the time and money spent attracting and supporting the creator/artist. And the other risk is curatorial. They are risking the trust and attention of the audience by choosing THIS instead of THAT. If they develop a reputation for having good taste (in however the audience defines that) they earn more attention and trust and the benefit of the doubt. The great publishers might not be famous (Motown was, and The New Yorker is) but they change the culture. TED takes a risk when they put someone on the main stage or feature a video online. And a podcaster takes a risk when they choose a guest.  The artist gets two benefits. They get the benefit of being picked: cash, editing, the emotional solace of being selected and supported. And they get the benefit of curation. They reach a scarce audience with help from an organization that’s good at that, and is willing to risk their permission asset to support the artist’s work. The internet has pockets where all of this is intentionally undermined, often by organizations that adopt the mantle of publisher when it’s convenient. The Long Tail is Chris Anderson’s term for a library with infinite shelf space, one where the rules of scarcity don’t apply in the same way. The internet platform doesn’t care how many different titles they carry, and in fact, benefits from carrying all of them. Spotify and YouTube and Amazon don’t actually care what you listen to or watch, as long as you come back tomorrow. Because they have nothing much at stake when it comes to content, and because they are focused on scale, they defer to an algorithm. It’s the mysterious program, by now so complex that no one knows exactly how it works, that decides what works get attention. Even the people who work there guess at what the algorithm wants. And this has consequences. Look up a recipe online. It’s a very different experience than finding a recipe in your favorite cookbook. The recipes online offer nearly infinite variety, but they’re largely untested, and they’re formatted in a time-wasting upside-down sort of way because someone decoded that this is what Google’s algorithm would like.  Look at most of the junk in the app store, or most of the content in social media. The algorithm sorts through everything, and when anything can make a buck, anything will. Of course, there are enormous benefits to the long tail. It gives creators who don’t match an existing editorial paradigm a chance to be heard. It gives readers/listeners/watchers a chance to discover things that would have been unpublished in the old model. And it creates room for discussion and access where it might not have existed. But… Publishing to an algorithm is not the same as publishing to an audience. If the creator has no publisher and no permission asset, then being heard is dramatically more difficult. As is getting paid. And living in a culture that’s driven by profit-seeking algorithm owners is different as well. Because without curation, who is responsible? Who is guiding the culture? Who pushes the boundaries or raises the standards? Wikipedia has 5,000 curators who work overtime to keep the site from becoming yet another example of Godwin’s Law. Sites that only obey the Long Tail and the primacy of the algorithm have fewer standards. They view curation as a last resort, and if mass is the standard, then mass is all that will be rewarded.  It’s tempting to hope that there’s a hybrid out there. But for that to exist, the algorithms have to work for creators and publishers, not the other way around. The publishers have to embrace the cost of curation, focusing on what they want to promote and paying the price to do so, owning the upside and downside of that intervention. Culture is almost always improved not by what the masses want tomorrow, but by what a small and dedicated group of people are willing to commit to for the long run. “People like us do things like this” is the recipe for culture. Creators: It’s possible (perhaps required) to not wait to get picked by a traditional publisher. At the same time, we benefit when we realize that the algorithm isn’t rooting for us and quite probably is working against us. The only winning approach is to earn permission and a direct connection with our fans and then act as curators for ideas (and as our own publishers). Platforms: It helps to acknowledge that you’re not actually a publisher, that ceding decisions to the crowd and the algorithm and walking away from curation might make you a landlord, but you’re not incrementally improving the culture. Yes, it’s possible to find a middle ground, as Netflix has, but it requires awareness, persistence and discipline. You probably won’t find this post by searching for it on Google, because they moved my blog down in the results a really long time ago. That’s okay, I’m not writing it for them, I’m writing it for you. "

Because that’s what we report–that perhaps 240 times in a college career, you sat down for a test and did well on it. That’s hardly the same as doing well in school. Where do we look up insight on your resilience, enthusiasm, cooperation, curiosity, collaboration, honesty, generosity and leadership? Because it seems like that’s far more important than whether or not you remembered something long enough to repeat it back on a test. "

Imagine that you have a daily drive. Half of it by distance is on dirt roads where your car can drive 10 miles an hour. And half of it is on a good road where you can drive 50 miles an hour. Which is a better choice: Trading your car in for one that can drive 22 miles an hour on the dirt road but no better on the highway? Or one that can do no better on the dirt road but 200 miles an hour on the highway? OR! Imagine that your factory has two kinds of machines, all fully busy. Half of them can process steel with an accuracy rate of 2 in 10. The other half can do it with 80% accuracy. Which is a better investment: Tuning the lousy machines into 30% accuracy or making the newer machines perfect, with no errors at all?  And finally, what’s the best way to improve fleet mileage? To get the 14 mile per gallon Hummers to upgrade to Toyota Camrys, or to get the Camrys to convert to infinite mileage electric cars? In all three cases, because you can’t average averages, the answer is to improve the laggards. Here’s the arithmetic if you’re curious. And we should be curious. Because it feels safer, more productive and easier to go after the devices or systems or people that seem to be so close to getting it right. But it’s the laggards that cost us the most. "

In the Northern Hemisphere, early March offers perfect weather for shipping, and a blissful shortage of Hallmark holidays and cheap chocolate. Megan Giller and I have put together a series of interviews (and tastings!) of dark chocolate and we’re inviting you to tune in. Find out all the details here. The short version: In March 2021, on my Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram pages, I’ll be posting live interviews and tastings with some of the greatest chocolate makers of our time. And you can pre-order the bars and taste along if you like. If you’ve got chocolate in hand, feel free to join in with comments or live feedback as we go. Dark chocolate, made by hand, by artisans who start with the bean and take it all the way to the finished product–it’s special. There are tones and notes and flavors that you can learn to taste. It’s fun to share. It’s an affordable luxury–you can buy the equivalent of a $500 bottle of wine in chocolate form for $11 or so. You can even get snobby and talk about trinitario and porcelana beans… And the people who grow the beans, the farmers, are some of the poorest people in the world, often at the mercy of a heartless industrial food chain. The bars we’ll be tasting are all from producers who pay their farmers significantly more than the clearing price. If we can spread the word about this craft, they’ll all do better. Thanks to Megan for helping me make this happen, and thanks to everyone who makes things a little more delicious, bringing care and dignity to the world at the same time. "
1230,Your big break,"February 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/your-big-break-2/,"Some people get one. Most people don’t. But, if you’re reading this, it means that you’ve received more than one, perhaps a countless number of, little breaks. Access to tools, the benefit of the doubt, decent health, occasional peace of mind. Little breaks. Over and over. Little breaks get you into a room, but they don’t guarantee your performance. Little breaks get you a glimmer of trust or opportunity, they give you a microphone and a chance to share your dream. Little breaks don’t always announce themselves the way big breaks do. Little breaks compound, one often leading to another. Or they don’t, creating false momentum and then disappointment. Sometimes little breaks pretend to be big ones, and sometimes they’re hiding in plain sight. Little breaks are easy to ignore and thus are wasted. Little breaks don’t like being waited for the way big breaks do, because while you’re waiting, you’re wasting the little breaks you’ve already gotten. "
1231,Flavors of indies,"February 13, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/flavors-of-indies/,"Independent workers, founders, creators and organizers are often lumped together with a simple term, but that one-size-fits-all model fits no one. You might be an entrepreneur, building a significant business by borrowing money to buy machines or to develop a market, focused on creating value, improving your leverage and eventually selling the company when it reaches scale. Or you could be a bootstrapper, focused on avoiding financing while building an organization that pays for itself as it scales. It’s a different discipline from the first moment to the last, one that brings freedom along with responsibility. Perhaps you’re a freelancer, getting paid when you work, and aware that your labor and your craft is how you make a difference. The only way for a freelancer to make a bigger impact is to have better clients, which is a project unto itself. And it could be that you are committed to running a small business, the backbone of our culture, a craft that works at the right scale and doesn’t worry a lot about what the business magazines have to say. I hope you’re not a tech-bro, building a make-believe business that’s somehow valued at a billion dollars even though it has no visible business model. You could happily be an impresario, someone who produces, arranges and orchestrates an event or a movement. (Just posted, a long lost lecture on this). Whatever you choose, choose! Being confused, seeking the best of each of these while experiencing the worst of all of them is no way forward. Indies create possibility, they shape the culture and they make things better. We need you more than ever. "
1232,The easy way down,"February 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/the-easy-way-down/,"Ski slopes are marked by difficulty. The green circle indicates the easiest slope, the one that will get you to the base of the hill the fastest, with the least amount of risk or drama. Why would anyone choose to ski down on the difficult black diamond run instead? Most passionate skiers would ask the question differently: why wouldn’t you? The point of skiing isn’t to get to the bottom. The point is how it feels on your way there. I’m wondering why this insight is so hard for us to embrace when it comes to learning or personal engagement or art or the work we do each day? There are speed bumps along the way, opportunities unevenly distributed, and unforeseen problems. But none of them get better when we decide to always seek the easy way to the end. "
1233,Avoid the clown suit,"February 11, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/how-to-get-better-at-graphic-design/,"How to get better at graphic design… There are more amateur and semi-pro graphic designers working today than at any point in human history. Presentations, instagram posts, websites, the cover of your kindle book or the logo for your podcast–anyone who’s touching a phone or a computer is called upon to do design, and most of us could get better. Understand the difference: Simply throwing type or a picture up will definitely put the information in front of people, but it won’t carry with it all of the care, insight and professionalism you want and need. We don’t tolerate typos in commercial products, and the market has the same feeling about design that’s lazy or out of place. Graphic design represents an emotional commitment to the work. Long before we read the words or understand the images, we see the layout. Kerning and color and weight and form arrive in our brains before we have decided what the words on the page actually mean. You wouldn’t wear a clown suit to a job interview, and yet people dress up their ideas in clown suits all the time. Getting better: If you are sure that you’re already good enough and that feedback is simply annoying, you’re probably not reading this. For the rest of us, there’s the chance to say, “I’m going to move to a higher level, and that means leaving this level behind.” Don’t defend your work with the generous critic. The entire point of getting better is to eagerly abandon the approaches you were taking on your way to gaining new skills that are more effective. The picture in your head: This is a huge step. If what you’re designing looks right to you, then it’s never going to improve. The leap here is to go shopping. Find ten websites that succeed by whatever measure matters to you. Go to a bookstore and find ten book covers that represent the level of authority and professionalism you seek. Go to the Dieline and compare 40 package designs. Check out the difference between the photos you’re taking and the ones that are on the most successful online retail sites. Find some heroes. Understand the genre you’re working in. Make the picture real: And now–copy them. Step by step, learn what you need to learn to make something as good as your heroes. A direct copy is not what you’re going to publish, but at least you’ll understand how to add the level of care and signalling and understanding of genre that’s needed to get the emotional element of your point across.  Once you know how to do good lighting, color choice and typography, you are welcome to abandon it. But it certainly pays to know how and to make it your choice. "
1234,Living on the delta,"February 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/living-on-the-delta/,"“What’s different?” Because we rarely notice what’s the same. It’s not easy to focus on the chronic. In fact, it’s really difficult. Too often we are in organizations that are highly leveraged, living from quarter to quarter, or we’re depending on clients or bosses from day to day. Too often, we don’t have enough in reserve to focus on anything but what’s changing or what’s getting the spotlight. It’s the chronic issues that end up causing the most pain. Systems at work that never get better, or problems that fester. For too long, there have been lousy schools, inequitable opportunity and the pain of grinding poverty. There have always been innocent people in prison and unheard voices in need of our help. There has long been graft and inefficiency and the tragedy of preventable illness and discomfort. But we’ve too often turned away from those issues, from the things we’re accustomed to, because they appear to be the same as they were. The status quo is there because we’ve accepted it. We might have worked hard on some of the issues, but it seems impossible to be on our toes about all of them, all of the time. And marketers have pushed us to focus on the new movie, the new crisis, the new tech… When sudden change hits, it’s easy to get focused on it to the exclusion of everything else. It’s the delta, the change, the acceleration–it attracts our gaze. And we can’t turn away, or it feels like we can’t. The media is in the delta business. That’s all they do, that’s what they get paid for, and they work to maximize our addiction to it. Not everyone is lucky enough to be able to spend time away from the delta, but if you can, it’s worth the effort. ,The problem with living on the delta is that as we strap into a rollercoaster of external change, we forget to work on the problems we have the opportunity to improve.

1235,The last thing and the first thing,"February 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/the-last-thing-and-the-first-thing/,"The new ritual, even more than checking the windows and doors before bed, is to check the incoming. Doom scroll a bit, check Slack and email and make sure there are no loose ends. And then the ritual continues, first thing in the morning as we check the overnights, to make sure everything is still okay. What if, instead, just for a week, the last thing we did was make a list of exciting opportunities for the future? And if the first thing after waking up was doing some morning pages and jotting down what we’re looking forward to? There’s plenty of time to check the windows and doors during the rest of the day. "
1236,The surprising problem with ranked-choice voting,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/the-surprising-problem-with-ranked-choice-voting/,"By every measure I can think of, ranked-choice voting is a superior way to hold a modern election. When a group of people want to decide something at the national or even the organizational level, having everyone rank their options is a net positive. The mechanics are much easier in an age of computers. If one option comes out ahead among the majority, you’re done. If not, throw out the least favorite outcome and recount, using the second choice of people who had voted for the eliminated candidate. Continue the process of elimination and recounting until you have a candidate that is the most acceptable to the most people. This process tends to reward candidates who are less divisive and more willing to listen to multiple points of view. It also leads to an outcome that is easier for more people to live with. The surprising thing? In a recent primary in New York, some people had trouble with the new method. It’s not that the method of voting is particularly difficult. The problem is that we’ve trained ourselves to be RIGHT. To have “our candidate” and not be open (or pushed) to even consider that there might be an alternative. And to feel stress when we need to do the hard work of ranking possible outcomes, because that involves, in advance, considering acceptable outcomes that while not our favorite, would be acceptable. This is hard work that’s worth doing.  And we don’t have to wait for a public election to do it. It’s a fine way to organize our choices not only in small groups, but on our own. "

Here’s the calendar: The Bootstrapper’s Workshop is back for its fifth session. It’s about a specific sort of business, beyond freelancing, where you build a business bigger than yourself without raising money from a bank or an investor. I’ve done this and it’s thrilling. It opens for sign ups today, February 8. The altMBA returns, with more than 5,000 alumni around the world, this is the flagship at Akimbo. More than a third of all students are reimbursed by their employers, because organizations are discovering how effective it is. The Regular Decision Deadline is tomorrow. The Real Skills Conference is also back for its fourth session. It’s open for signups now, and it takes place for two hours on February 19th. A conference without speakers or snacks, it’s about connection and possibility. Check out the details here.

1238,Toward nimble,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/toward-nimble/,"Is ‘nimble’ a good thing? Should we seek to be flexible, resilient and quick to be able to shift and adapt? Because often, it seems as though we work to create an environment where it’s difficult indeed to be nimble. We buy expensive assets, lock into long-term systems and fail to ignore sunk costs. We set foundations in concrete instead of using a lightweight tent… In consistent times, there’s leverage to be found in investing in the status quo. But when we’re unsure about where the next shift is going to come from, perhaps investing in flexibility makes a bit more sense. "
1239,Blaming the user,"February 7, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/blaming-the-user/,"In the early days of tech, the acronym of choice was, “Read the friggin manual.” If an engineer uttered RTFM in your direction, it meant that whatever happened was your fault. Tech is a powerful tool, and if you want to use it, do the work. Over time, as user interface became user experience, and as organizations sought to serve ever larger audiences, UX designers began to take responsibility for how people would engage with their websites and software. For a while, if the software didn’t work for the intended user, that was the software’s fault. “We’ll make a better interface” is a much better motto because it puts the responsibility where it belongs. But the overhang was still there. In many companies, “user error” was a problem for the user to fix. Organizations were pitching convenience and simplicity, but the moment the user made an error, the messages were curt, the wait on hold was long due to unusually heavy call volume, and if it didn’t work for you, well, we’ve got enough users, it’s cheaper for you to go somewhere else. As my colleague Mark Hurst points out, this contempt for the clueless user has been multiplied dramatically by the stock market. Now, many large companies have decided to use UX against their users, all of their users, by turning our experience with their websites and networks into one that serves their needs, not ours. It feels more convenient in the short run, perhaps even fun, but it’s designed to create lock-in, a permanent network effect and, as soon as practicable, a persistent source of cash flow. In the latest crop of apps, the heavy-handed push toward compliance is truly obvious, from the very first interaction. And in the ones that are already dominant, the veneer of customer focus is fading fast. If you’re not paying, you’re the product, not the customer. And sometimes, even if you are paying, the long-term impact of your quest for convenience might not be what you were hoping for. The long-term consequences of our network choices are long indeed. "

What if you replaced “doing” with “improving” or “reinventing” or “transforming”? When we do our job, what happens to it? Does it go away, to be replaced by tomorrow’s endless list of tasks?

1241,"Circles, networks and the trust layer","February 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/tribes-and-the-trust-layer/,"The internet clearly has a trust problem. As with most things, it helps to start with the Grateful Dead. After their incarnation as the Warlocks, they became more than a band. It was a family on the road. There were people who gave up their careers to follow them around, living on buses… they were seeing thirty or forty shows a year. You traded tickets, did favors, built relationships. People in the family knew that they’d be seeing each other again soon. And then, in 1987, Touch of Grey went to #1 (their only top 40 hit) and it attracted a huge (and different) crowd to the shows. Reports were that the intimacy and trust disappeared. Glen Weyl points out that the internet was started by three tribes, as different from each other as could be. The military was behind the original ARPA (and then DARPA) that built and funded it. Professors at universities around the world were among the early users. And in San Francisco, a group of ‘hippies’ were the builders of some of the first culture online. Because each of these groups were high-trust communities, it was easy to conclude that the people they’d be engaging online would be too. And so, as the tools of the internet and then the web were built out, they forgot to build a trust layer. Plenty of ways to share files, search, browse, chat and talk, but no way to engage in the very complicated things that humans do around identity and trust. Humans have been in tribal relationships since before recorded history began. The word “tribe” appears in the Bible more than 300 times. But the internet isn’t a community or a tribe. It’s simply a technology that amplifies some voices and some ideas. When we don’t know who these people are, or if they’re even people, trust erodes.  When a site decides to get big fast, they usually do it by creating a very easy way to join, and they create few barriers to a drive-by anonymous experience. And when they make a profit from this behavior, they do it more. In fact, they amplify it. Which makes good business in the short run, but lousy public policy.  Twenty years ago, I wrote that if someone goes into a bank wearing a mask (current pandemic aside) we can assume that they’re not there to make a deposit.  And now we’re suffering from the very openness and ease of connection that the internet was built on. Because a collection of angry people talking past each other isn’t a community. Without persistence of presence, some sort of identity and a shared set of ideals, goals and consequences, humans aren’t particularly tempted to bring their best selves to the table. The system is being architected against our best impulses. Humans understand that local leadership, sacrifice and generosity build community, and that fights and scandals simply create crowds. Countless people are showing up, leading and pushing back, but algorithms are powerful and resilient, and we need some of them to be rebuilt.  Until there’s a correlation between what’s popular or profitable and what’s useful, we’re all going to be paying the price. "
1242,A simple missing word,"February 4, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/a-simple-missing-word/,"“Yet”. You can append it after any sentence related to your journey of achievement and contribution. “I haven’t finished the project” “I haven’t learned how to juggle” “I haven’t made the sale” YET. And along the way, “Yet” turns “can’t” into “haven’t.” Yet isn’t the result of brazen persistence. It’s what we earn with learning, insight and generosity. —- PS I just finished George Dyson’s latest, Analogia. It’s a stunning tour de force, a wide-ranging book that includes a heartbreaking chronicle of the genocide of Native Americans, riffs about Project Orion (a spaceship powered by atomic bombs) as well as a three-hundred-year arc of the past and future of computers and our co-evolution with them. I could see this book being the only thing studied over the course of a semester, it contains so many rich eddies, currents and insights.

1243,Egomania vs. ego strength,"February 3, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/egomania-vs-ego-strength/,"People talk about ego like it’s a bad thing. But our desire to do a good job, our self-trust, our willingness to dance with fear–these are fuel if used properly. Egomania pushes us to ignore useful feedback, to bristle at input and to refuse to do the work to get better at our craft. It’s actually a sign of fear and weakness. Ego strength, on the other hand, makes us eager to learn more, engage with the market and figure out what it will take to have the project actually succeed. "
1244,Chasing the cool kids,"February 2, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/02/chasing-the-cool-kids/,"Quick! Get on Myspace, it’s where all the good stuff is. Wait! Better build your following on Facebook. It’s a land rush and once you amass enough followers… And Pinterest. Definitely. What’s your Twitter handle? Will you be live tweeting the presentations at SXSW? Let’s get your show on Quibi… Build an Insta and a Finsta… Did you see how much they’re making on Substack?! Blogs are dead. The urgent advice usually ends with “blogs are dead.” Like Groundhog Day, we keep repeating the same pattern. Any platform that’s reasonably open has a long tail. That means that a few people get most of the traffic and most people get very little. If there’s money involved, that’s definitely what happens. Statistically, whatever you build online isn’t going to get a lot of traffic. There are no magic shortcuts in open systems, because the short head depends on scarcity. By the time you show up to chase the cool kids, it’s probably too late to guarantee a sinecure. What’s the alternative?  Publish. Consistently. With patience. Own your assets. Don’t let a middleman be your landlord. Yell at Google for blocking your emails and hope it’ll work eventually. Continually push for RSS and an open web. With patience. Getting picked is great, when it works. Someone needs to be in the spotlight and it might as well be you. In the meantime, catch your breath, show up and contribute. It all adds up.  "

Over time, you might get fancier or more skilled at the tactics of how you present each thing you hope to say, but what if we took a step back and used intention to come up with a strategic framework for the deck. Overall question: Who is this presentation for? And the follow-up: What change are we seeking to make? If you’re not trying to cause an action or some other change in attitude or belief, then what’s the purpose of the deck? And then, for each sequence of slides, the questions are: What did this person believe before we got here? What do I want them to believe after they see this? Brick by brick, step by step, your slides conspire to cause this change to happen. The font you choose, your grammar, the size of the letters, the quality of the picture–each of these tactical decisions has a purpose. What’s the change I want this element to contribute to? The sequence of slides, the tension as you move from one to another–it has a purpose. It may very well be that your purpose is to create deniability, to get the meeting over with, to have a digital record that you did, in fact, do the work, express your effort and get it off your desk. But it’s entirely possible you can accomplish even more than that. Most of us played with blocks when we were kids. Building structures that seemed magical. Do that. "
1246,The stuff in the margins,"January 31, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/the-stuff-in-the-margins/,Do you have to use all the time in the brainstorming session? Fill in the entire page of your creativity notebook? It turns out that many of the best ideas we have start out as filler. Stuff in the margins. Last-minute extras simply to fill space. Because the stakes are low and our defenses are down. 
1247,Belief and knowledge,"January 30, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/belief-and-knowledge/,"They’re different. Knowledge changes all the time. When we engage with the world, when we encounter data or new experiences, our knowledge changes. But belief is what we call the things that stick around, particularly and especially in the face of changes in knowledge. While more knowledge can change belief, it usually doesn’t. Belief is a cultural phenomenon, created in conjunction with the people around us. The easy way to discern the two: “What would you need to see or learn to change your mind about that?” "
1248,Panes of glass,"January 29, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/panes-of-glass/,"We have windowpanes because glass used to be really expensive. Panes allowed us to use smaller sheets, with the added bonus that if one broke, you could simply replace part of the window. Today, big sheets of glass are much cheaper, and many windows feature fake panes of glass–a process that uses one big sheet with moldings crisscrossed over it. Of course, this actually costs more to create than a simple window would. We’re overpaying to reproduce the effect that we originally put into place to save money. If you look around, you’ll realize that we make choices like this all the time when new technologies arise. Cruft is a comfort. "
1249,The coordinators,"January 28, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/the-coordinators/,"Fashion is everywhere. It’s not simply the clothes you chose to wear today  (and the ones that haven’t seen the outside of your closet for years). It’s the music that you’re loving right now, songs you wouldn’t have tuned into ten years ago. It’s the way we understand how the world works, which policies make sense to us and what sort of food we eat. Even the investments we make or the debts we incur. It’s the rhythm of our days, our priority list and our urgencies as well. Almost none of our choices in the world are the result of independent direct experience. Instead, we make them in the context of culture, of our surroundings, of ‘people like us do things like this.’ We choose to align with a segment of the culture and take our cues from them. Sometimes, there’s a coordinator. Forty years ago, fewer than 100 people determined what songs were going to be the popular ones, the ones that ‘everyone’ would be listening to next week. And a consortium of industry titans decides what colors are going to show up in appliances a few years from now.  We might want to believe that culture simply happens, that it’s organic, distributed and based on millions of independent decisions. And sometimes it is. But more often, there’s an instigator and a benefit for someone along the way. While many fashion systems are more open and permeable than before (there aren’t three TV networks, there are a million YouTube channels) there are still gatekeepers and narrative setters. How does the coordinator decide? Are they working in your best interests? Are they erratic, self-deceiving, elusive, selfish, or perhaps a long-term thinker? Do they have a bias toward reality and resilience or is it simply a hustle? In Latin, the expression is Cui Bono. Who benefits? If it’s you, if it’s us, then fashion is working for us. On the other hand, if it leads to negative outcomes, disappointment and disconnection, it’s worth asking if it’s something we want to keep doing, even (especially) if it feels right in the moment. Because everything we do feels right in the moment. It’s not a secret conspiracy and it is a choice. Who decides today what’s going to be important tomorrow? "
1250,Asking for the second favor,"January 27, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/asking-for-the-second-favor/,The first favor is when you ask a friend or colleague to do something for you. The second favor is when you ask them to do it precisely the way you would do it. They’re not related. And the second one costs more. 
1251,Useful redundancy,"January 26, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/useful-redundancy/,"There’s a section in the greeting card store for “New Baby” cards. I’m not sure what other kinds of babies are available. But the ‘new’ reminds us of why we are sending the card. And “Happy Birthday” goes without saying as well. The person knows it’s their birthday, and of course you want it to be a happy one, that’s why you sent a card. While a blank on the front of the card would probably have just as much information value, saying it more often than is necessary is precisely the point of the card. Sometimes, we assume that the person we’re engaging with knows exactly what we mean and want to express. But that assumption is often wrong, and a little redundancy can go a long way.   PS it’s launch day for The Podcasting Workshop. A perfect chance to build a practice of speaking up, consistently and generously. And it’s also the last day to join The Creative’s Workshop. "
1252,Famous conductors,"January 25, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/famous-conductors/,"Here’s a useful metaphor: Famous conductors are often judged for an hour or two on stage. They wear expensive clothes, make dramatic gestures and receive ovations. They also get paid a lot to carry a very little stick and they’re the only one on stage who doesn’t make noise. But it turns out that none of these things are what makes a great conductor. What we’re not seeing: It’s a form of leadership that happens in private, but once in a while, we see it on stage. "
1253,The pinging,"January 24, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/the-pinging/,"A friend left her phone near me. Over the next half hour, it pinged and chirped. I felt myself getting anxious and a little antsy… These were not pings for me, not on my phone. They weren’t sounds that my phone even makes. It doesn’t matter. The training has been going on for years. We’re caught in a Pavlovian game in which we’re the product, not the organizers. Someone else is ringing the bell, and it’s been happening for so long we don’t even realize how deeply the hooks have been set. "
1254,Your big idea,"January 23, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/your-big-idea/,"It’s probably not completely original. It’s probably not breathtaking in scope. It’s probably not immediately popular. But… it’s definitely worth pursuing, consistently and persistently for years and years. If you care. If it’s generous and helpful and worth the journey. All the big ideas that made a difference follow this pattern. "
1255,Each one leads to more,"January 22, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/each-one-leads-to-more/,We can choose to commit to a recursive and infinite path that elegantly creates more of the same. We can choose possibility. We can choose connection. We can choose optimism. We can choose justice. We can choose kindness. We can choose resilience. And we can decide to take responsibility. Each leads to more of the same. 
1256,The trap of busy,"January 21, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/the-trap-of-busy/,"Everyone who wants to be busy is busy. But not everyone is productive. Busy is simply a series of choices about how to spend the next minute. Productive requires skill, persistence and good judgment. Productive means that you have created something of value. Perhaps your self-created busy-ness is causing you to be less productive. "
1257,Tolerance,"January 20, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/tolerance/,"It means two things: In high-quality manufacturing, producing to tolerance means that all the parts are as identical as possible. Getting the tolerances precise permits cars to be made more reliably, and for production to run more effectively. In human beings, tolerance creates resilience. Tolerance of different abilities and preferences makes it easy to work with diversity of thought and approach and expertise, enabling better outcomes. Tolerance doesn’t mean permitting behavior that undermines the community. In fact, it requires that we put the community first. Instead, it’s a willingness to focus on contribution instead of compliance. We need to choose wisely. Are we working with machined parts or with people? "
1258,Arguments and outcomes,"January 19, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/arguments-and-outcomes/,"The purpose of marketing is to cause change. If we’re trying to build a movement, raise money for a non-profit, sell a product, change lifestyles, build community–these are all marketing activities that exist to change the way people act. The project usually begins with clarity. The cause is just, the harm is real, the product is better. The work is worth doing, there’s an urgent need for change, it’s real. But sometimes, the original arguments, as valid as they are, don’t work. In fact, they rarely do. People don’t all line up to donate or work out or sign up from the very start. You can put in the energy to have your pitch get heard, but the early ones often fall flat. It’s only as the arguments become more clear, or change, that they begin to resonate. And yet we can get stuck with a certain orthodoxy. An early argument can become the only argument. The story that the group tells from the start is the right one, and anything else is a disappointing compromise, even if it leads to the action you sought in the first place. In general, there are three things that cause people to change their actions: Status roles involve whether this action will move someone up or down in the estimation of their peers or competitors.  Affiliation is related to status, but more specific. It’s “people like us do things like this.” In the words of the Rolling Stones: He can’t be a man because he doesn’t smoke, the same cigarettes as me. And convenience is the hallmark of a semi-lazy decision–it’s just easier. Using these three drivers, you can look at the spread of helmets in the NHL, or electric cars in California or Nike sneakers everywhere. We can see it in the decline in smoking in some communities, or the rise of a popular style of music as well. The originators of these and other ideas didn’t begin with status, affiliation or convenience, but that’s what ended up working.  "
1259,Three types of kindness,"January 18, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/three-types-of-kindness/,"There is the kindness of ‘please’ and ‘thank you.’ And the kindness of “I was wrong, I’m sorry.” The small kindnesses that smooth our interactions and help other people feel as though you’re aware of them. These don’t cost us much, in fact, in most settings, engaging with kindness is an essential part of connection, engagement and forward motion. And then there is the kindness of dignity. Of giving someone the benefit of the doubt. The kindness of seeing someone for the person that they are and can become, and the realization that everyone, including me and you, has a noise in our heads, a story to be told, fear to be danced with and dreams to be realized. And there’s another: The kindness of not seeking to maximize short-term personal gain. The kindness of building something for the community, of doing work that matters, of finding a resilient, anti-selfish path forward. Kindness isn’t always easy or obvious, because the urgent race to the bottom, to easily measured metrics and to scarcity, can distract us. But bending the arc toward justice, toward dignity and toward connection is our best way forward. Kindness multiplies and it enables possiblity. When we’re of service to people, we have the chance to make things better.  Happy Birthday, Reverend King. "
1260,Pleasing the unpleasable,"January 17, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/pleasing-the-pleasable/,"There are bosses, customers and partners who will never be happy. And sometimes, despite the futility, we work to please them anyway. Because that can be a compass. It can help us do the work that will satisfy others (or ourselves). It can also be a trap, an endless treadmill of disappointment that leads nowhere in particular. We should be clear about which one we’re on. Because working to please the pleasable is a lot more likely to pay off. "
1261,Is mood a gift or a skill?,"January 16, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/is-mood-a-gift-or-a-skill/,"Some days, we wake up with optimism and possibility… we’re able to find more reserves, connect better and do more generous work. That might be because the outside world has handed us good news and opportunities, or it might be because the chemicals in our brain are particularly aligned… I think it’s fair to assert that sometimes, our moods are handed to us. But it’s also clearly true that we can do things to improve our mood. Morning pages, meditation, exercise, positive thinking, the right audio inputs, who we hang out with, the media we consume–it’s all a choice. And if it’s a choice, that means it’s a skill, because we can get better at it. "
1262,The difficult choice of disappointment,"January 15, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/the-difficult-choice-of-disappointment/,"All forward motion disappoints someone. If you serve one audience, you’ve let another down. One focus means that something else got ignored. If you create something scarce, someone won’t get their hands on it. The very act of creation means that it won’t be the ideal solution for everyone. On the other hand, with certainty, we know that doing nothing disappoints an even larger group of people. The opportunity is to find someone to delight and to embrace the fact that someone is not everyone. "
1263,Born to run (things),"January 14, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/born-to-run-things/,"The first half of Bruce Springsteen’s autobiography makes some things abundantly clear: He had no natural ability to play the guitar. In fact, after his first lessons, he quit, unable to play a note. He had no singing talent. Every group he was part of needed a lead singer, and it wasn’t him. And just about everyone dismissed him. Audiences walked out, his first agent simply stopped returning his calls and bandmates gave up and moved on. He didn’t even know how to drive a car. Not only wasn’t he dating in high school, he wasn’t even cruising around town, being a charismatic rock star. Talent is overrated. Skill is acquirable. Showing up is something almost every creative leader has in common. In business, in the arts, in society. Consistently shipping the work, despite the world’s reaction, despite the nascent nature of our skill, despite the doubts. And community is essential. The people you surround yourself with can reinforce your story, raise the bar and egg you on. After the fact, the community becomes an integral part of your story of success. But first, you have to commit to the journey. [That’s what happens in the Creative’s Workshop.] For more on the creative commitment, check out this extraordinary conversation between Brian Koppelman and director Ron Howard. "
1264,Burned out/burned in,"January 13, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/burned-out-burned-in/,"Burned in is what we look for in an electronic device. It’s working perfectly, in the groove. Burned out is what happens if we abuse it. Burn-in comes from a practice, a generous, persistent approach that’s within our control. Burn out, on the other hand, is often caused by trying to control things that we can’t possibly control. As a result, we waste cycles and create a pattern of stress. Even though it seems as though the world is trying to steal our focus and our energy, ultimately, in each moment, it’s our choice to make. We can decide to create possibility and contribute. Toward better. "
1265,Shipping creative work,"January 12, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/shipping-creative-work-2/,"Of course you can.  If you care enough. It’s not easy, it might not work and it takes effort, but the opportunity is there. It helps to do it on purpose and it helps to do it in community. I’m excited about the possibilities for 2021… Here are some things you can do that will make your work more effective: The Creative’s Workshop is back.  It inspired my bestselling book The Practice, but it adds an entire dimension to the commitment of making and shipping work that matters. In the Creative’s Workshop you’ll be part of a mutually supportive cohort of people who are ready to do the work. Creative work is thrilling and it makes a change happen. This workshop leads to an extraordinary shift in our expectations and productivity. The thousands of people who have been part of it report that it’s truly a game-changer in their career and the way they approach their work. And next week is the Early Decision Deadline for the altMBA’s May 2021 session. More than 5,000 alumni in 70 countries have discovered the difference it can make. And a sneak preview: The Podcasting Workshop is back for its seventh session, with enrollment beginning January 26th.  These workshops work because the people in them are enrolled in a journey, ready to do the work together. They’re all run by my friends at Akimbo, an independent, mission-driven B corp. Go make a ruckus. [I’ll try to do these workshop updates once a month here on the blog. Please share with someone who is ready to make a difference.] "
1266,Choose your Jones wisely,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/choose-your-jones-wisely/,"We’ve been brainwashed into keeping up with the Joneses. Paying attention to our peers and staying ahead, just a little bit. But if you’re in that trap, it’s probably worth considering who your Jones’s are. A hard worker might feel lazy at a sweatshop on Wall Street. A shopper in love with luxury goods might feel inadequate on Fifth Avenue. “Compared to who?” If comparing yourself to a different set of peers is going to motivate you or give you peace of mind, by all means, switch. It’s up to each of us, isn’t it? "
1267,Understanding “popular”,"January 11, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/understanding-popular/,"Popular doesn’t mean better by any absolute scale. Popular simply means that more people like this thing than that thing. Popular isn’t an act of genius. Popular is either an intentional act (to serve a particularly large, homogenous audience) or a lucky break. The most direct way to become popular is to serve the audience that made the last thing popular. By that definition, popular almost always means ‘not better.’ It simply means that you found a large group and gave them what they wanted. The world likes popular, but it doesn’t have to be your goal. "
1268,Natural technique doesn’t exist,"January 10, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/natural-technique-doesnt-exist/,"It’s amazing how much we can get done simply by trying. Whether it’s writing or golf or sales, when we show up and do our best, we can make things happen. But then, our internal horsepower becomes insufficient. As we seek to make a bigger impact, we discover that powering our way through obstacles is simply too difficult. And so we need to learn technique. Technique is the unnatural approach to a problem that, with practice, becomes second-nature. Technique is the non-obvious solution that amateurs and hard-working beginners rarely stumble upon on their own. The commitment to a practice opens the door to finding a more useful technique. You got this far because your natural approach was helpful. But to get to the next level, you’ll need technique, which, by definition, isn’t something you come by on your own. If there are people who are playing at a different level than you who are embracing an approach that feels unnatural to you, you may have found the technique that you’ve been missing. "
1269,Gravel tennis,"January 9, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/gravel-tennis/,"A friend was pointing out that he couldn’t play tennis on his driveway because it was made of gravel. While it’s true that it wouldn’t officially be tennis, that it wouldn’t be the tennis we might have expected, we can’t be sure that gravel tennis isn’t a good game. It might even be a better game. Markets, competitions and canvasses are rarely ideal. Surfing only works because the waves vary so much. If you’ve got gravel, it might pay to try out some gravel tennis. "
1270,Why isn’t there a line at the library?,"January 8, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/why-isnt-there-a-line-at-the-library/,"If any other institution was giving away essential items, it would be a sensation. The grocery store, the car dealership, even the laundromat would have a line out the door. And now that we’ve moved many elements of the library online, it’s even easier to access. A century ago, information was truly scarce and books were far more expensive than they are now. A decade ago, obtaining the instructions on how to do something was difficult indeed. “It’s too expensive,” or “I can’t get access to it,” used to be really good excuses. But they obscured the truth: “It’s too much work.” And that’s the answer to the question. It’s too much work to change our minds. It’s too much work to dance with the fear of failure. It’s too much work to imagine walking through the world differently. That doesn’t have to be the case. We can refuse to be brainwashed into accepting the status quo, and we can commit to finding the others, engaging with them and leveling up. If we care enough. "
1271,The tumblehome,"January 7, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/the-tumblehome/,"Chestnut brand canoes dominated the Canadian wilderness for years. One reason is that they were shaped with a tumblehome. If you leaned the boat over, the boat leaned back, providing stability. The more you leaned, the harder the boat worked to stay upright. This is the resilience that leads to stability, not brittleness. It is the hallmark of a system that is aware of the forces on it and responds with just enough to keep things steady over time. Tumblehome provides support, but it also requires ongoing effort, care and focus to keep a system functioning. The tumblehome doesn’t take care of itself. Every existing system persists because it has a sort of tumblehome. And if you want to understand a system, it helps to see where the tumblehome lies. "
1272,Mode switching,"January 6, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/mode-switching/,"What’s the point of sorting the silverware when you empty the dishwasher–why not simply put all of it in the drawer in a random order, and then pick out the cutlery you need when you need it? It’s the same amount of sorting, after all. We intuitively understand the reason. If you take a minute to sort the forks, knives and spoons all at once, you won’t have to spend ten seconds every single time you want to find a fork. The cost of changing gears is higher than we give it credit for. The web has persuaded us that everything is miscellaneous, that sorting things carefully and keeping them where they belong is a waste of time–because we can simply find them when we need them. But switching to ‘find mode’ breaks our rhythm and eliminates the useful serendipity that happens when the right things are near each other, right where we expect them to be. "
1273,Pain is real,"January 5, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/pain-is-real/,"And it is unevenly distributed. The only way we have to understand someone else’s pain is to consider it in comparison to our own experiences. It’s a bit like our taste buds: If something is described as chocolatey, but you’ve never tasted chocolate, you have no clue what they’re describing. It’s easy, then, to dismiss the pain that others report, physical or emotional, if it differs from our experience. Even if you’ve never felt this particular pain, the other person is feeling it, right now. Perhaps you’ve felt the pain before and don’t think it’s that bad–your customer’s experience might be different. You might have been insulated from fear or the trauma that has magnified the experience for the person you’re engaging with. Even if the circumstances wouldn’t have caused you to feel this particular pain, that might not be true for your friend. And even if you can’t imagine the feeling, it’s still real for them. Pain ignored is still pain. And pain acknowledged is a first step toward easing that pain. "
1274,The ruts,"January 4, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/the-ruts/,"It’s not an accident that dirt roads end up with deep ruts on them, that moguls on hills get steeper and that we find ourselves slipping back into the very things that exhaust us at work. Once the pattern starts to be grooved, we repeat it, which only makes the groove ever deeper. Habits are habits because in many ways, they’re simply easier in the moment. A significant challenge in learning (as distinct from certified ‘education’) is that learning requires us to break old habits and walk away from old ruts. It rewires our instincts and helps us see the world in a new way–not just see it, but act differently in it. It’s incredibly difficult to lever yourself out of a long-term rut. A community and a curriculum can make a huge difference. That’s why I created the altMBA five years ago. It wasn’t designed to be a knowledge-delivery tool (the internet does that just fine, all the time, for free). It’s designed to be a habit-breaking, habit-forming, rut-reducing tool. And the best way to break a habit is to model and then commit to a new habit. Tomorrow’s the regular deadline to apply for the next session of the altMBA. If you’re ready to leave your rut behind, I hope you’ll consider it. [The altMBA is part of Akimbo, which is now an independent, mission-driven B Corp. I’m thrilled at what they’re building.] "
1275,Infrastructure,"January 3, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/infrastructure-2/,"If you want to see wisdom and maturity in action, look for someone (or a community) investing in infrastructure before it’s too late. Part of what makes my part of the country so lovely is that the trains work, the water is clean and the health department inspects restaurants. But for the last fifty years, around the world, few communities have invested enough to maintain the systems they were smart enough to build. Now, my block loses power for days at a time after a storm… And it’s far more dire elsewhere. In our personal lives, we can coast on a particular credential or bit of knowledge for years. And then one day, we realize we’re obsolete. The idea is the same: We need to plant our trees before we want the shade, and fix our systems before they break. "
1276,2030,"January 2, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/2030/,"I just installed new smoke detectors in the house (definitely worth the hassle and low expense) and the batteries now last ten years. There’s a little spot on the side of the detector to write the year you installed it. I’m wondering what the person (maybe me) who changes the batteries a decade from now will think when they see “2020” written on the side. Whatever happens over the next ten years, if history is any guide at all, the year we just finished will be mostly a faded memory. What will matter more than what just happened is what we decide to do with where we are, daily, persistently, generously, for the next 3,650 days. Here’s to possibility, to justice, and to betting on the future. "
1277,A simple 2 x 2 for choices,"January 1, 2021",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2021/01/a-simple-quadrant-for-choices/,"Our life is filled with projects. We invest time, effort or money, and perhaps we get a result. It’s useful to have a portfolio of projects, because not all of them are going to work. The 2 x 2 grid looks like this: It might be simple, but it’s not always easy. Success doesn’t always mean money, it just means that you got what you were hoping for. And while every project fits into one of the four quadrants, there’s no right answer for any given person or any given moment.. Here are some of the traps that are worth avoiding: On the other hand, consider a portfolio of projects. Some of them have a very high likelihood of working out, and each one of these outcomes is pleasant, if not game-changing. Play often enough, though, and your persistent generosity will pay off. And then, mix into that some of the moonshot projects that most people are afraid to take on. They’re afraid because they have equated “low chance of success” with “risky.” They’re not the same. Risky implies that failure will cost a lot. It won’t. You can thrive with this strategy because you have a portfolio, and because you realize that “unlikely” is not the same as “not worth trying.” The best portfolios are persistent (because patience is a rare skill), they’re generous (so others root for you to succeed) and they build on each other (because then, even the ones that don’t work increase your chances for the next one to work out). Here’s to a new year filled with possibility. "
1278,Toward better,"December 31, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/toward-better-2/,"Well, that was interesting. Tragic. Heartbreaking. Painful. Difficult. Have more people ever been happier to see a year go away? I’m posting this a few hours early just to clear the decks a bit faster. Our attitude doesn’t have to be driven by the outside world, but sometimes, they overlap. The outside world provokes, persists and insists on changing the story we choose to tell ourselves. And one reason we invented the calendar was to keep the outside world at bay as we reclaim agency over how we’ll choose to act–to respond instead of to react. For those of you keeping track, 2021 is the product of the prime numbers 43 and 47. If you were looking for a reason to be optimistic, that’s as good as any. Thanks for caring and thanks for leading. Here’s to justice, health and peace of mind as we choose an attitude of possibility and resilience in 2021. "
1279,A different urgency,"December 30, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/a-different-urgency/,"For many people, work consists of a series of urgencies. Set them up and knock them down. Empty the in-box, answer the boss, make the deadline. Over the next few weeks, there may be fewer urgencies than usual. That’s the nature of coming back from a break. What if we used the time to move system deficiencies from the “later” pile to the “it’s essential to do this right now” pile? Improving a system returns our effort many times over. Fix your supply chain. Dig deep into your communication rhythms. Figure out the priority list. Quit the tasks that are holding you back. Walk away from dead ends. Add rigor to your processes. Understand the difference between the things that feel urgent and those that are truly important. None of this works if you do it temporarily. The point is to create and fix systems with finality. Identify a class of projects that your team will do instead of you and then never do them again. Reorganize your data archiving approach and then stick with it. Build a system for lifelong learning and then maintain the commitment. In any given moment, an urgency that feels like an emergency gives us the permission to abandon our systems and simply dive in and fix it, as only we can. And this permission is precisely why we get stuck, precisely why the next urgency is likely to appear tomorrow. Resolutions don’t work. Habits and systems can. Most of us are so stuck on the short-cycles of urgency that it’s difficult to even imagine changing our longer-term systems. Amazingly, this simple non-hack (in which you spend the time to actually avoid the shortcuts that have been holding you back) might be the single most effective work you do all year. "
1280,Bonus: A game design history…,"December 29, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/direct-marketing-branding-and-game-design-history/,"Two videos for when you might have time. For no really good reason, I filmed this long riff about my experience with the early days of video and adventure games. Probably more 1980s game history than you wanted to know. Rewatching them, I’m reminded of how many lucky breaks I’ve had, how often I got the benefit of the doubt and how being in the right place at the right time can change so much. Alas, I didn’t mention many of the people who did the extraordinary work of programming, of organizational development and of believing in possibility. I’m grateful to have worked next to hundreds of people who spent years battling the odds to invent the future. "
1281,The most important blog post,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/the-most-important-blog-post/,"It is on the most important blog. Yours. Even if no one but you reads it. The blog you write each day is the blog you need the most. It’s a compass and a mirror, a chance to put a stake in the ground and refine your thoughts. And the most important post? The one you’ll write tomorrow. "
1282,If you don’t know you have it…,"December 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/if-you-dont-know-you-have-it/,"then you don’t. (Not yet.) Cleaning out the fridge after a power failure, I found three half-empty containers of anchovies. Because they magically migrate to the back of the fridge, every time I had needed some, I ended up opening a new jar, because the old ones were invisible. Not just invisible if I had looked for them, but so invisible that it never even occurred to me to look for them. And this is even more likely to happen with the data on your hard drive. If you don’t know to look for it, if you don’t believe it’s there, it might as well be deleted. And of course, this applies to our lost skills, confidence and experience as well. It’s worth putting in regular effort to remind ourselves of what we’ve already got and how it has served us in the past. "
1283,Stand up and fight,"December 27, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/stand-up-and-fight/,"One of Woody Guthrie’s resolutions was to “Wake up and fight.” But he wasn’t talking about being a bully. Or picking a fight at the local bar. He was talking about changing the culture. He was challenging himself to push back against the doubters, and even more than that, to overcome his own self-doubt. The culture is created by all of us. It might feel as though it’s done to us, but it’s also created by us. Wake up, stand up and fight. Make things better. "
1284,Amplify possibility,"December 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/amplify-possibility/,"“People like us do things like this.” Social media understands this. It also knows that people like points, likes and something that feels like popularity. The social media companies optimized their algorithms for profit. And profit, they figured, would come from engagement. And engagement, they figured, would come from confounding our instincts and rewarding outrage. Because outrage draws a crowd. And crowds establish culture. And a desire to be the leader of a crowd reinforced the cycle. And so the social networks created a game, a game in which you ‘win’ by being notorious, outrageous or, as they coined the phrase, “authentic.” The whole world is watching, if you’re willing to put on a show. That’s not how the world actually works. The successful people in your community or your industry (please substitute ‘happy’ for successful in that sentence) don’t act the way the influencers on Twitter, YouTube or Facebook do. That’s all invented, amplified stagecraft, it’s not the actual human condition. Many of us have an overwhelming need to rubberneck, to slow down when we pass a crash on the highway. This is odd, as most people don’t go out of their way to visit the morgue, just for kicks. And yet… I hope we’d agree that if people started staging car crashes on the side of the road to get attention, we’d be outraged. That’s what happening, and the leaders of social networks pretend that they can’t do a thing about it, just as Google pretends that they can’t control the results of their search algorithm. The shift that the leaders of the social networks need to make is simple. In the long run, it will cost them nothing. And within weeks, it will create a world that’s calmer, happier and more productive. Amplify possibility. Dial down the spread of disinformation, trolling and division. Make it almost impossible to get famous at the expense of civilization. Embrace the fact that breaking news doesn’t have to be the rhythm of our days. Reward thoughtfulness and consistency and responsibility. You can do this. Enough already. "
1285,The two levers of modernity,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/the-two-levers-of-modernity/,"First: If you come up with an innovation that creates value, that value is multiplied a million-fold because now you can share it outside your village. Second: If you build a community, the network effect creates increasing amounts of value as more people use it. And the pothole: As we race to create value, it’s easy to forget that it’s unevenly distributed. A safety net isn’t perfect, but it’s better than no net at all.  Rising tides lift all boats, but we’re not boats. "
1286,Reasons people donate,"December 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/reasons-to-donate/,"It’s urgent It’s certain to work It’s close by Everyone else is It might happen to you Only someone as caring as you will choose to make a difference Only someone as smart as you can understand something this complicated It will raise your status with your cohort Others are suffering Time’s almost up People like us do things like this It’s the right thing to do You are suffering It’s a longshot worth pursuing To create justice It comes with a tote bag It’s an obligation Your parents taught you well We’ll be proud of you Because right here and right now, nothing would feel better than making a donation… [more] "
1287,Fortunately,"December 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/fortunately/,"In the midst of all of it, some people are still able to trust. To trust in others, to trust in possibility and to trust themselves. And… we’re surrounded by opportunity. we often get a second chance. there are still problems to be solved. we learned something. there’s another advance, right around the corner. And always, there’s a chance to make things better. "
1288,The seeds we plant,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/the-seeds-we-plant/,"2020 was a terrible year for too many people. So much trauma, dislocation and illness. Everyone has their own stories, and everyone suffered (unevenly and unfairly) from the extraordinary shifts in our lives. And yet, seeds were planted. Five or ten or twenty years from now, people will remember projects that were started, connections that were established, realizations that occurred. Doors were opened, babies were born and changes were made. Few people celebrate forest fires, but we’re all eager to walk through the sylvan glades that follow. If you were kept from planting all the seeds you hoped to in 2020, that’s okay. Because the best time to plant more seeds is always right now. Or perhaps tomorrow. I’ve benefited from countless lucky breaks through the years of this career, and many of them are the result of the people I’ve been fortunate enough to work with, listen to and teach.  To help create an institution of scale and impact, Akimbo the platform for learning that I’ve been talking about on this blog for years is now an independent B corp. In 2020,  the leadership and coaches at Akimbo have shown up in ways that no one could have expected, and the tens of thousands of alumni are grateful for all of it. Thank you to each of them, and to you. For caring and for leading. "
1289,Did it do what it was supposed to do?,"December 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/did-it-do-what-it-was-supposed-to-do/,"That’s not often the same as, “I did my best.” Quality has a very specific definition: Did it meet the customer’s requirements? Any experience, product or deliverable that meets that spec is deemed to have met the quality standard. If it doesn’t, it’s not of quality. And so we need to begin with, “who’s it for?” because the customer might not be who we think it is. “Was it a good wedding?” might mean, “did the host feel fully seen, empowered and celebrated?” or it might mean, “did you have fun?” or it might mean twenty other things. The second question goes along with that, which is, “what’s it for?” This product or experience, what did the customer hire it to do? Again, being clear about this is the only way to improve what we’re doing. Only after we answer these two questions can we dig into how to be more clear about what we’re offering and to whom, along with how we can make our work more effective and efficient. [And then it gets complicated…] What if there’s more than one “who”? What if instead of trying to please one customer, you have a variety of customers? Or if there are internal constituents, or non-paying entities who have a say in it? What if you try to do it again? Which elements could be improved? Become more efficient? Have less impact on the workforce or the environment? Become more reliable? And what if the organization is more than just a few people? Where do processes, supply chain management and systems come into play? But we still have to begin at the beginning. Who’s it for and what’s it for? "
1290,"Guests, hosts and landlords","December 22, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/guests-hosts-and-landlords/,"The landlord acts like he owns the place, because he does. The landlord makes the rules and has the power to enforce them. The host acts on behalf of those that are being served. “Gracious” is the goal. And guests realize that they’re in a fortunate position and try not to abuse it. As Dave Winer has pointed out, the web has no owner. We’re all guests, except when we have a chance to be a host. Acting like a landlord is counter to what makes the whole thing work. The same might be true for the places you hang out as well. "
1291,Hiding ideas,"December 21, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/hiding-ideas/,"Some people hesitate to share an idea because they’re worried it will be stolen. In general, these people are afraid of success, not failure. An idea unspoken is a safe one, which not only can’t be stolen, but it can’t be tested, criticized, improved or used in the real world. "
1292,Beyond a shadow,"December 20, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/beyond-a-shadow/,"How certain do you need to be? When presented with a new opportunity, or a risk to be avoided, do you have any doubts? Because there are always doubts. And then we multiply it, waiting for the doubt to go away, for it to not only be a shadow of what it was, but beyond that…  The desire to avoid change is rarely held to the same standards as progress. By the time the shadow is gone, it might be too late. "
1293,“The way we’ve always done it”,"December 19, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/the-way-weve-always-done-it/,"There’s a lot to be said for tradition, for stability and for the foundation that the status quo gives us to move forward. But, if we were on the spot to analyze our day, our processes and our assumptions, how many things do we do simply because we are in the habit? It’s impossible to try every option, to explore every alternative and examine how every culture or competitor does things, but… If we don’t even know we’re doing things by rote, when will we be restless enough to try to make them better? "
1294,Blunders and mistakes,"December 18, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/blunders-and-mistakes/,"In chess, a blunder is a mistake that no one can excuse. Even one blunder and you’re probably going to lose. In our vigilance to avoid blunders, sometimes we try to eliminate mistakes as well. For understandable reasons, we spend a lot of time trying to avoid blunders and minimizing mistakes. But if that’s all we do, we’ve given up the chance to do something magical. If you’re working on the frontier, if you’re leading, creating or inventing, you’ve signed up for mistakes. That’s the price of innovation. After the fact, it’s easy for an attempt at great work to look like nothing but a blunder. But it might simply be a mistake that we can learn from. "
1295,What’s your game?,"December 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/whats-your-game/,"Someone who plays Monopoly every week, and always uses the little silver hat as their playing piece and always buys Boardwalk if he can–he may think that this is his game. That’s way too literal. Someone who trades pork bellies on the floor of the commodities exchange might believe that she has a particular affinity to pork bellies, and that the specific is the game. Still too literal. In the first case, the ‘game’ isn’t the silver hat, the properties or even the Monopoly set. The game is the way it feels to engage with the regular group and the thrill of trading and perhaps winning. It would be possible to replicate or even surpass this game by playing Othello instead, or scouring garage sales to sell hidden treasures on eBay… In the second case, the ‘game’ might actually be the thrill of the trade. Or it might be the satisfaction the trader gets from having an easily measured indicator (wealth) go up. Or it might be the status that comes from being richer than the folks you went to high school with… We invent all sorts of trappings and decide that the trappings are our work. They’re not. There are only a handful of games that most people decide to play… games that have boundaries, other players, connections and outcomes. You can switch from one set of trappings to another much more easily than you imagine, particularly if you focus on the basic building blocks of your game instead of the outward appearance. If someone takes away your playing piece, don’t fall into the trap of deciding you can’t play a game any longer. If someone tries to persuade you that the game is to make as much money as possible, realize that they need more insight and imagination. Whenever you can, it might pay to seek to create a game that works for you and for those you seek to serve. Because those games are the sustainable ones and the ones that you can play for a long time to come. "
1296,New decisions,"December 16, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/new-decisions/,"“I was wrong,” isn’t something you hear very often. Particularly from people in power, or folks who have gone out on a limb espousing a belief. It’s far easier to persuade someone to make a new decision based on new information. That way, they can be right now, and they can also believe that they were right before. "
1297,The problem with a mic drop,"December 15, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/the-problem-with-a-mic-drop/,It’s fun to say the perfect thing at the perfect time. Mic drop. The problem is that then you have to bend over and pick up the microphone. Conversations take more effort but tend to be worth it. 
1298,A place to write,"December 14, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/a-place-to-write/,"One reason that successful and prolific singer-songwriters are prolific is that as soon as they’ve written a song, they can record it and publish it. And a huge advantage of having a daily blog is that the software is always open, waiting for you to write something. Your story doesn’t have to be a book, it is simply your chance to make a difference. “Here’s what I see, here’s how you can be part of it.” When we remove the pre (finding the pen, the paper, the notebook, the software) and the post (finding a way to publish it), it turns out that we write more often, and writing more often leads to writing better. It doesn’t have to be perfect, it can simply be the next thing you do. The patterns matter. Streaks work. All part of your practice. "
1299,Seeing differently,"December 13, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/seeing-differently/,"Here are some books for the end of the year… fifty years of ideas that have helped me understand the world differently: Gödel, Escher, Bach — Before meta was cool, Douglas Hofstadter won a Pulitzer Prize for this intricately created examination of math, art and music. Caste — My book of the year. Wilkerson helps us see how persistent and hidden the indoctrination of race and status lie in our culture. Understanding Comics — Another meta book, and a masterpiece of explanation and insight.  The Red Queen — There are a ton of very cool books on evolutionary theory and this one is particularly good. Knocking on Heaven’s Door  — Lisa Randall’s explanation of physics will change the way you look at the world. Guns, Germs and Steel — Another classic, it has earned its spot in the canon. An explanation (not without controversy) of how the world ended up as it did. This is what the study of geography is actually about. The Beginning of Infinity — After you read Randall, this book will take those ideas and expand them. A lot. Impro — This book transformed the way I saw human interaction, and had a significant impact in the creation of This is Marketing. What Technology Wants — Kevin Kelly has changed my mind over and over again, and this one is the one I think about the most often. The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas — A short story from Ursula LeGuin that you will never forget. Debt — An astonishing look at 5,000 years of human history by the late David Graeber. The Jazz of Physics — A great book, even (especially) for people who think they don’t like either. When Things Fall Apart — Each of Pema’s books is special, and the audio books in particular. This is a fine place to start. Books are an extraordinary device, transitioning through time and space, moving from person to person and leaving behind insight and connection. I’m grateful every single day for the privilege of being able to read (and to write). And writing doesn’t always have to take the form of books. Check out this prize-winning video: "
1300,The paradox of discernment,"December 12, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/the-paradox-of-discernment/,"The typical ten-year-old violinist can’t tell the difference between a cheap instrument and a Guarneri. A harried traveler simply wolfs down a hamburger, not really worried or aware of its provenance or flavor. And a bureaucrat buys whatever is cheapest and meets spec, without regard for how well it is designed or the supply chain that created it. Enthusiasts will work their whole lives to be able to tell the difference in how an orchestra sounds, or how the chocolate is tempered or the simple elegance of thoughtful engineering. And then, once we do, the incompetent or mediocre stuff isn’t worth much. In order to appreciate the truly great work, we often end up becoming disappointed with the rest. "
1301,Whining,"December 11, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/whining/,"Toddlers whine. Most adults figure out how to lose the habit, because it’s toxic. And yet it persists. Whining is a seductive package deal. When it works, it gets us attention, it lowers expectations, it gains sympathy and it forces people to identify with our pain. And it helps people feel as though they’re not responsible. Often, the amount of whining is totally unrelated to the level of discomfort, and it seems to increase with how much privilege people perceive they deserve.  So why avoid it? Because it changes our outlook on the world. When whining becomes a habit, we need to continue it, so we begin to interpret events as opportunities to prove that our whining is justified. And because over time, people hate being around a whiner. The selfish desires of the habitual whiner eventually become clear. We realize that our shared reality is the world as it is, and that the whiner isn’t actually being singled out. And through practice, we learn that the best way to make things better is to work to improve them, not to demand special treatment. Reminding myself of the perils of whining is helpful indeed. Optimists run the risk of being disappointed now and then. Whiners are always disappointing. "
1302,Jot,"December 10, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/jot/,"An almost magical idea, a tiny little word, a chance to make it real. If someone tasks you with carving something profound into a block of granite, the emotional overhead is probably too high to do our best work. But if you simply want to jot something down, all you need is an iota, a tiny glimpse of what might work. It turns out that just about all granite-worthy ideas begin as jots. Simply jot. "
1303,Welcome and problems,"December 9, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/welcome-and-problems/,"“You’re welcome,” is not the same as, “it’s my pleasure.” and “No problem,” is not the same as, “I’m happy to help.”  These sentences are the closing parentheses of a simple conversation that opens with “thank you.” We have to say something. The “thank you” demands acknowledgement. It could be, “okay, now we’re even.”  Or we could express satisfaction at having the ability to make a contribution. We can continue the infinite game instead of simply walking away. That might be more satisfying all around. A wave is more powerful than a grimace. "
1304,Predicting the future,"December 8, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/predicting-the-future/,"Humans do it all the time. Sometimes with great success. Not just easy-to-measure and profitable endeavors like sports betting or the stock market, but essential human interactions like, “what’s the best way to welcome a kindergarten student on the first day of school,” or “If we arrange the intersection this way, traffic will flow better.” In matters of public health and engineering, the ability to have a good idea about the repercussions of our work is urgent. When dealing with a prognosticator, it’s worth asking three questions: “What’s your track record?” It’s unlikely we’ll be right every single time, but once we adjust for luck and statistical anomalies, do you regularly outperform the others, or are you simply loud about it? “Can you show your work?” It’s hard to trust someone who has a secret method. While this might be a competitive requirement, it’s more likely that the person has simply had a lucky streak (streaks are statistically likely). “Have you taught your method to others?” This is a variation of the previous question. If people are using the method to successfully predict the future in other areas, then we’re seeing a resilient and robust approach to understanding how the world works. Rules of thumb (the topic of my very first book, co-authored 34 years ago) are a stand in for the sort of rigor that is far more common today. With our predictions etched into the memory of the internet and more data available than ever before, we ought to be better at predicting what’s going to happen next and determining who’s good at that and who isn’t. But belief is a strong force, widely held, and sometimes it takes us a while to realize that confidence and volume are not a replacement for seeing things as they are and understanding how they work. "
1305,On getting a fancy MBA…,"December 7, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/but-what-about-the-mba-programs/,"If I was admitted to a prestigious business school and scheduled to begin in January or even September, I’m pretty sure I’d defer. Take a gap year, take two. For many students, the two most important parts of the top-tier MBA are getting in and getting out. It’s about selection and certification. For the last seventy years, the most famous graduate schools in business have been honing a particular model of teaching and value creation. They excel at a sometimes-magical sort of classroom experience, one that uses exclusivity and status and real-time high-stakes interaction to create an esprit de corps as well as occasional moments of real growth. And when the programs work, the $350,000 in tuition and opportunity cost for two years can be repaid with a fancy job that brings leverage and impact to the certified graduate. The scarce degree is a signaling mechanism for a certain group of consultants and investment banks eager to hire people who have been filtered out and paid their dues as a way of showing commitment to a specific career. It’s predicted that more people will apply this year than ever before. In uncertain times, the process feels reassuring. For most students, the elite MBA is about the prize at the end, not the learning or the experience. Due to the pandemic, many of those in-person interactions moved online. And if the schools are honest about it, the interactions they offered online aren’t very good. Instead of the result of nearly a century of improvement, they’re often slapped together, and they’re filled with compromise. The people who built them weren’t charged with improving what was on offer on campus, they were supposed to come up with something that would either augment it or be a less-expensive and less-prestigious alternative for people who couldn’t participate in the ‘real’ program. My alma mater was proud to have shifted online in a matter of weeks, but they certainly realize that if it didn’t have the fancy name on it, it wouldn’t have been worth much. After a semester or even a full year of this, it’s quite possible you won’t have really gotten to know your peers, nor will you have learned much more than you could have from a close reading of twenty books. And for many, that’s okay, because they’re paying for the certificate, not the learning. I wrote about this twenty years ago… When I taught at the NYU graduate school of business, I was amazed. Not by the caliber of students, which was very high, but at how little emotional enrollment and intellectual curiosity many of them had in learning what was on offer. A few realized how much they could learn, but many of the students were simply concerned with what was on the test. When I started the altMBA five years ago, I probably chose the wrong name for it. Because I didn’t set out to replace the business school. Instead, the goal has always been to use a new medium in a new way, to create a thirty-day experience that does what it does better than it could be done any other way. As a filtering/certifying/sorting mechanism, the elite MBA remains a profitable path for the few people who end up at McKinsey and similar institutions. But most of us don’t have those jobs and don’t want to do that work. Instead, we have the opportunity to level up and figure out how to find more relevance and impact in the work we choose to do. We don’t need a certificate–instead, it’s about learning to see and exploring how to make an impact. The altMBA and its parent, Akimbo, are now independently owned and run, a B Corp. committed to doing work that matters. But the mission hasn’t changed–to use this new medium in a productive way to help people level up. If you’ve been wondering, “is this all there is to work,” it might be a good time to check out the altMBA. If you’re ready to lean into the process and the learning, without giving up your day job or focusing on scarcity, the altMBA could be a good fit. No teachers, no gurus, no tests, no accreditation. Simply community in service of finding a better way forward. The Early Decision admission deadline is tomorrow, Tuesday. If you know someone in traditional education who is eager to push their medium forward, I hope you’ll point them to what they’re building at Akimbo. At 2% of the cost, it shouldn’t be better than what the famous schools are offering online, but I’m pretty certain that it is. Education and learning are often very different. And online is not simply the same as sitting in a very big classroom but with a keyboard. It’s an entirely new form of pedagogy, one that’s about doing, not complying, about possibility, not coercion. We have the chance to make things better. To learn and to lead. Together. "
1306,Trading trust for attention,"December 6, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/trading-trust-for-attention/,"The old adage was always wrong. “Say whatever you like, but spell my name right.” And now it’s even more of a trap. The temptation to get the word out is overwhelming. There’s so much noise and so much hustle going on that we might believe that it’s okay to trade our standards and principles and position for some attention. At least for a minute or two. The latest viral video is for an online dating site, and it features Satan as one of their customers. Nicely shot, sort of funny, with just the right amount of inside humor, there’s no arguing that it got attention. But it burned trust. It established an image that contradicts the position they worked hard to earn for more than a decade. There have always been shortcuts to attention. But the only purpose of advertising of any kind is to cause action, and action only happens when there’s trust involved. "
1307,Treats,"December 5, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/treats/,"The only way to train a group of sea monkeys is by triggering an instinctual reaction. The best way to train a dog is with tiny tasty treats, combined with calm and consistent feedback. Some dog owners resist this approach, because it doesn’t seem like the dog is really engaged or paying attention or learning anything if there’s too direct a connection between the actual treat and the action of the dog. It’s tempting to resort to punishment instead, because it’s not only immediate, but for some trainers, it can relieve frustration and requires less patience. But punishment creates trauma. Humans make up a lot of stories about what motivates us, but sooner or later, many of our stories involve feedback. We’re not sea monkeys, but we’re well aware of how the world around us treats us. The most persistent changes in behavior happen when the story is so ingrained, we forget all about the feedback that reinforced it in the first place. But it still started with the desire to be seen, to be treated with respect, to receive the dignity we each deserve. Ring a bell? "
1308,Insulation from the user experience,"December 4, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/insulation-from-the-user-experience/,"When a small enterprise offers a lousy user experience, the person in charge learns about it, fast. Customers leave, visitors bounce, complaints roll in. It’s expensive and it undermines the goals of the organization. Fortunately, in a small organization, the person with the ability to make change happen hears about it and can take action. In a large organization, like my bank, the resources to make things better are dramatically bigger and largely underused. That’s because the person who should take action has other priorities. Not only aren’t they exposed to the valuable feedback that frontline workers get (because the organization doesn’t reward ‘bad’ news), but they haven’t prioritized getting the user experience right. It seems more important to please the boss, go to meetings and keep the numbers on track than it is to fix what might not feel broken. Spend some time in the store. Visit your own website to get work done the way a customer would. Answer the tech phone calls for a few hours. And figure out how to turn the user experience into a metric that’s as easy to measure as how much money you made last month. "
1309,Generalizations work (until they don’t),"December 3, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/generalizations-work-until-they-dont/,"Unlike natural phenomena like orbiting planets or geologic formations, there are no consistent and perfect laws of human behavior. If we’re talking about groups of people, if we’re teaching, leading or trying to predict future behavior (all three are related) then we’re making a generalization. And perhaps we don’t realize it, or aren’t clear that we are. “In general, in many settings, most kindergarten kids have trouble getting through a long day without a nap.” That’s not quite the same as, “all kids need a nap.” Useful generalizations are essential to productive interventions and generous leadership. Without generalizations, it’s almost impossible to begin to serve people. And there lies the trap. If we stick with them too long, or insist that they are absolute, or fail to seek out the exceptions that all generalizations have, then we end up excluding or ignoring people who need to be seen. Which betrays all the work we set out to do. We begin with a market or an audience, but we ultimately serve the individual. "
1310,Understanding the automatic self,"December 2, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/understanding-the-automatic-self/,"How do you act when you’re not thinking about how you act? When no one is looking and when you’re just doing what you’re doing… That’s the automatic self. No narrative, no second-guessing. Now, here’s the real question: Has your automatic self changed since you were a kid? If it has (and I hope it has) then that’s all the proof we need that the automatic self isn’t a given, it’s not hard-wired and it’s not permanent. In fact, it changes from practice. It’s a skill. We can learn to be the ‘authentic’ version of ourselves that we’d like to live with. It takes habits, learning and feedback. And the commitment to become a better version of ourselves. "
1311,Shopping is not the same as buying,"December 1, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/12/shopping-is-not-the-same-as-buying/,"Just about everyone over the age of fifteen, anywhere in the world, engages in the market in some way. We need things and we buy them. That’s not what shopping is. Shopping is the act of imagining what you might want. It’s the thrilling but risky exchange of money for something that you’ve never purchased before. Something that might be better than you hope, but it might not. In some communities, shopping is so foreign and risky that it simply doesn’t happen. Shopping is a cultural activity, with styles and approaches varying depending on who you are and where you live. Shopping releases chemicals in our brain. In many cases, particularly with luxury goods, it’s this emotional shift that we’re actually paying for, not the thing we’re buying. The trillion-dollar industries that are based on shopping as a sport (as distinguished from buying what we need) are relatively new, but have been around long enough that many of us take them for granted–normal activities that appear to have always been around. Money is a story. Your story is probably different from everyone else’s. Our relationship with debt, savings and earning money is extraordinarily complex. Consumer credit has turned from a convenience and useful bridge into, for many people, a trap. Gift cards, garage sales and self-storage units start to reveal just how many layers we’ve built up around our commitment to shopping. In small doses, for many people, shopping can produce happiness. But it doesn’t usually scale. More stuff might not be the substitute for the things that we truly want. "
1312,The monopoly distinction,"November 30, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/the-monopoly-distinction/,"At enlightened companies, leaders are smart enough to ask, “how do we make things better for our customers?” They realize that this simple ratchet leads to loyalty, word of mouth and more customers. At monopolies or companies that seek to act like them, the question is, “how do we make things better for us?” "
1313,The persistence of hierarchy and status roles,"November 29, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/the-persistence-of-hierarchy-and-status-roles/,"REM was one of the most respected indy rock bands. You’d think that a group that somehow managed to thread the needle between whatever authentic means to them and huge popular success could walk away from traditional measures of who’s up and who’s not… In a long-ago Rolling Stone article, lead singer Michael Stipe said that he had never heard a song from Mariah Carey and in fact had just learned how to say her name. There’s a difference between focusing on your lane and denigrating the others in your field. In the same article, bandmate Michael Mills expresses disappointment that even though they recorded at Prince’s studio in Minneapolis, he never stopped by to say hello or even invite them to the party on Friday. Turtles all the way down, turtles all the way up. High school persists. It’s possible to use the status hierarchy as a sort of fuel, a way to motivate yourself to push a little harder. But it is also possible, and far more resilient, to use connection and possibility as fuel as well. The best lesson of high school might be that everyone has a noise in their heads, everyone feels uncomfortable and everyone would appreciate a little kindness and respect. "
1314,"More popular (and cheap, too)","November 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/more-popular-and-cheap-too/,"If Harper Lee had written To Kill a Mockingbird today, there’s no doubt that the salesforce and the marketers would have pushed for a catchier title, probably with better SEO. And it’s hard to imagine that Waiting for Godot would have ever been performed on Broadway. On a similar note: What would happen if instead of taking elements out of our work in order to make the product cheaper, we put things in instead? What if we made it better? It’s tempting to race to the bottom. The problem is that you might win, and then you’ll have to stay there. Worse, you might try and come in second, accomplishing not much of anything. Linkbait is a trap, because it brings you attention you actually don’t want. The alternative is to be idiosyncratic, specific and worth the effort and expense. What would happen if you made something important, breathtaking or wonderful? The race to the top is not only more satisfying, it’s also more likely to work.  And then you get to live there. Doing work you’re proud of, without excuses. "

1316,The grateful pumpkin,"November 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/the-grateful-pumpkin/,"It might not be autumn where you live, but the iconography of the large orange pumpkin travels around the world. People carve faces into them, stick a candle inside and use them to ward off the darkness. Perhaps we could consider writing on one instead. Inscribing all the things we’re grateful for, all the people who show up in our lives. We could highlight our heroes, our friends, the selfless people who show up for the community instead of simply looking for a shortcut… We could even remind ourselves of the systems, situations and dynamics that we take for granted. Seeing that pumpkin every day is a great way to remind myself of how extraordinarily lucky I am. Even when it seems as though the news is an unending litany of selfishness and tragedy, it’s possible to find someone who made a difference. Thank you for caring, for showing up and especially, for leading. "
1317,Butterfly hunting,"November 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/butterfly-hunting/,"Ideas are like that. The successful editor, curator or entrepreneur doesn’t go hunting ideas to kill them, but to celebrate them, identify them and dance with them. And a brutal, all-out frontal attack won’t work. It’s not about raising a ton of money or insisting that the world supply you with only the good ideas. Quibi failed because of the hubris of believing that the ideas could be conjured on a schedule. And countless middlemen have struggled with the dead-end of only wanting to embrace the good ideas, which are often impossible to distinguish from the others at a distance.  Sometimes, you need to look more closely, to reconsider or to circle around again. And sometimes we go butterfly hunting and find nothing at all. Fred Hills, who published fifty New York Times bestsellers (including my first one) died a few weeks ago. He took the quest literally, and used to go butterfly hunting with Nabakov. His belief in my book was matched by the trust he offered me and so many authors to find our voice and share it. Chris Meyer was another butterfly hunter, patiently connecting, leading and challenging, turning on lights in a way that made everyone in the room see the possibilities that lay just ahead. The ideas are there. It might take patience to nurture them. [HT to Lisa DiMona.] "
1318,Subconscious pre-filtering,"November 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/subconscious-pre-filtering/,"It’s entirely possible to believe that your ideas come from the muse, and your job is to simply amplify them. And that successful people are lucky because the muse keeps giving them useful and powerful ideas. I’m not sure that’s what successful people do. All of us get an endless supply of ideas, notions and inklings. Successful people, often without realizing it, ignore the ones that are less likely to ‘work’, and instead focus on the projects that are more likely to advance the mission. It’s possible to get better at this pre-filtering. By doing it out loud. By writing out the factors that you’re seeking, by explaining to someone else how your part of the world works. Instinct is great. It’s even better when you work on it. You can find more on this in The Practice, my new bestselling book. I’m blogging about it weekly on Medium. And talking about it on some extraordinary podcasts around the world. And we just started the eighth season of my podcast, Akimbo. "
1319,Today is Worldwide Backup Day,"November 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/google-is-not-your-friend/,"Google is not your friend, it’s a tool. It’s been 2,702 days since they shut down Google Reader and people still remember. Or consider that Google can shut you out of all their services with no recourse or appeal possible. All your data, photos, calendars, emails… gone. But yes, you can back up your data. Do it today… Visit this page to start the process. It’s free. Hopefully, you’ll never need it. Press a few buttons and back up your data to a cloud service so that it’s in two places–This should happen automatically, but since it doesn’t, it’s worth doing. The internet was originally designed as a resilience machine, designed to heal itself and work around interruptions. And the essence of it was a distributed, peer-to-peer network that worked precisely because it was open. As data is hoarded, manipulated and monetized, that original intent has been turned upside down. Resilient systems don’t have to trend toward monopoly. In fact, it’s better when they don’t. And don’t forget to backup your data. [PS the post from earlier today was skewed by homonyms.

And of course, the answer is often “yes.” If you’re waiting on an unavoidable delay, then you’re not stalling. If you’re making things better in a way that the customer will notice, then you’re not stalling. If you’re finding that the spaces in between are giving you joy and sustaining you, then you’re not stalling. But… If you’re holding back and looking for a reason why, and that reason is replaced by another reason, then… you might be stalling. "

1323,"A paradox of community, belief and reality","November 20, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/a-paradox-of-community-belief-and-reality/,"Belief happens when we combine community with emotion. It’s a way for us to see and understand the world, at the same time that we engage with some of the people around us. Belief is a symptom of shared connection, and community makes us human. Reality, on the other hand, is widely experienced and consistent. Gravity doesn’t care if you believe in it or not, it’s still here. And that jar of jelly beans has the same number of beans in it, no matter how many times we count them. When belief doesn’t match our experience of reality, stress occurs. This stress can surprisingly make community stronger. There’s very little community among people who believe that the Earth is a sphere, no meetings or conventions of the round Earth people. That’s because you don’t need belief to know that the Earth is round.  There is a long history of building community cohesion by encouraging members to ignore the facts of the world around them. The disconnect between what’s out there and the emotions that lead us to believe something that isn’t real can actually make a community tighter. Sometimes, the disconnect between belief and reality is precisely the point. When the disconnect gets really large and the community becomes more insulated, cults arise. But in our modern age, this stressful disconnect between belief and reality also makes it difficult to spread the word. The outsider may be hesitant to sign up for the stress that belief in non-real things can cause. As more and more information is just a click away, and as our culture fractures into a long-tail of filter bubbles, the chasms between belief and reality become more profound. But beliefs change, and reality persists, and so the cycles continue. "

1326,“Until further notice”,"November 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/until-further-notice/,"Of course, every rule, every announcement and every policy is in place until further notice. We say it as a form of throat clearing. A way to make the announcement seem more official and specific. We repeat the redundant as a form of gift wrap, a way to be sure that it feels both urgent and impersonal. “May I have your attention please” is another wasted phrase that is actually self-cancelling on inspection. In this case, it acknowledges that attention is being taken, whether you want to loan it out or not. This patina of bureaucratic civility exists to let the bureaucrat off the hook. But it also is a signal to the listener that an official is speaking up. We should use it (or not use it) with full knowledge of the signal we’re sending. It’s the seat belt training video, the do not remove tag on our mattress, the ‘your call is important’ filler on hold and the ritual of singing a not-very-good song to people we care about every single year. If you look around the built world, you’ll find these tropes and filigrees just about everywhere. As media changes, we strip away the old ones and invent new ones to fill their spot. Use them (or not) as a way of sending a message of awareness and authority. "
1327,The right answer,"November 16, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/the-right-answer/,"Which is better: Feeling like you were right the first time or actually being correct now? When we double down on our original estimate, defend our sunk costs and rally behind the home team, we’re doing this because it’s satisfying to feel as though we were right all along. On the other hand, if the outcome is important and we’re brave enough to learn, we can say, “based on what we know now, we should change course, because the other path is actually a better way to go forward.” More often than not, there are moments when we’re wrong. We can either acknowledge that we were wrong yesterday, or we can curse ourselves by choosing to be wrong going forward. Flexibility in the face of change is where resilience comes from. "

Which would make it awfully difficult to do important work, work that stands out, work that people would go out of their way to find. When difficulties arise, it might very well be good news.

If this customer closes, then I’ll invest in my education. If we get this finished, then we’ll focus on that. Too often, the ifthen is nothing but a stall. As a result, we burn trust, and worse, postpone a future we’d like to spend time living in. Take your ifthen’s seriously. The future always happens sooner than we expect. "
1330,The incoming,"November 13, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/the-incoming/,"Standing at my desk this summer, it had just turned 10 am, and I realized that I’d already: Heard from an old friend, engaged with three team members on two continents, read 28 blogs across the spectrum AND found out about the weather and the news around the world. Half my life ago, in a similar morning spent in a similar office, not one of those things would have been true. The incoming (and our ability to create more outgoing) is probably the single biggest shift that computers have created in our work lives. Sometimes, we subscribe or go and fetch the information, and sometimes it comes to us, unbidden and unfiltered. But it’s there and it’s compounding. One option is to simply cope with the deluge, to be a victim of the firehose. Another is to make the problem worse by adding more noise and spam to the open networks that we depend on. A third might be, just for an hour, to turn it off. All of it. To sit alone and create the new thing, the thing worth seeking out, the thing that will cause a positive change. "
1331,The gift of results,"November 12, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/the-gift-of-results/,"When Ignaz Semmelweis pioneered statistics in order to save countless women from dying in childbirth, his fellow doctors refused to believe him. They ignored his work, didn’t wash their hands and it was another twenty years before his insights on the spread of disease were adopted. We live in a faster, more competitive world than he did. When Jethro Tull wrote about the rotation of crops, many farmers continued to do things in the old way. Over time, though, the yields don’t lie. You don’t have to like the idea, but you can see that it works. Results show up. They’re easy to see, easy to measure and they persist. The bridge falls down or it doesn’t. Market share goes up or it doesn’t. We can view results as a threat, or see them as an opportunity. It depends on whether we’re defending a little-understood status quo or seeking to make things work better. Results don’t care about our explanation. We need a useful explanation if we’re going to improve, but denying the results doesn’t change them. As the world has become ever more filled with results, it has crowded out each individual’s personal narrative of how the world works. Particularly in times of change and negative outcomes, this can cause a lot of distress. Our narrative is ours, and it informs who we are and the story we tell ourselves. Beliefs are powerful. They’re personal. They can have a significant impact on the way we engage with ourselves and others. But results are universal and concrete, and no matter how much we’d like them to go away, there they are. When people talk about how modernity has changed humanity, they often overlook the fundamental impact that results have had. Competitive environments create more results, at greater speed, and those results compound over time. We still need a narrative and we still need our individual outlook. But over the last century, we’ve had to make more and more room for the systems that create results. Our shared reality demands it. "
1332,Second cousins,"November 11, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/the-fish-and-the-bicycle/,"Being smart often has little to do with being persuasive.  And yet we often assume that one leads to the other. We spend years and years educating people to do well on tests in the belief that this will make them smart. And we assume that they’ll figure out the persuasive stuff on their own. We conflate the two on a regular basis, assuming that charisma or followers or influence is somehow aligned with insight, foresight, and learning. The good news is that being persuasive is a skill. If you’re smart, we’ll all benefit if you’ll also invest the effort to find a way to lead. "
1333,A theatre of dominance,"November 10, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/a-theatre-of-dominance/,"Organized sports often turn into a play about status roles and dominance. Bullfighting, pro wrestling, even hockey, are about who’s winning, who’s losing and who’s in charge. But they are also theatres of affiliation. The fans celebrate their unity as well as their divisions. The pomp and circumstance are a form of culture. There are insiders and outsiders, and the right way and the wrong way. When a sumo champ breaks protocol, the crowd isn’t happy. When the people next to you are wearing the same jersey as you, neither of you is headed onto the ice, but both of you feel like you belong. The symphony has the same elements. The affiliation of players in tune, of familiar music from the canon, of an audience that knows not to clap between movements. But it’s also the dominance of the European-trained conductor, bringing his passion and will to bend the performance to his wishes. One way to understand what’s happening in the office or on the news is to look at it through these lenses. The theatre of affiliation happens when groupthink sets in, when we’re wondering what others will think of a new idea, when we go out of our way to play the long game and to be kind and thoughtful. “People like us do things like this.” And this always dances with the theatre of dominance, when we see someone shortcutting to gain market share, or subjecting a co-worker to abuse in a meeting. It leads to a reinforcement of caste and stereotypes, and yet it persists. “I’m winning.” Affiliation is the infinite game of culture building, sustainability, cooperation and resilience. Dominance is an instinct as well, something we see in many successful species, and particularly when the game that’s being played is tweaked to reward dominators, it often returns. When you’re in one mode, it’s tempting to believe that everyone else is too. But depending on which pocket of culture you’re in, which ticket you bought, what state your persona is in, it might be that you’re not seeing what others are seeing. Getting in sync requires doing the emotional work of changing state long before we start using words and rational concepts. When in doubt, assume the people over there might be engaging in a different sort of theatre than you are. "

It takes a lot of energy to get the thing started, and the orbit is the goal–there are still satellites up there, circling, decades after launching. Even after twenty of them, a book launch feels uncertain. After all, you’re asking people to add one more thing to their reading list, something that no one has read yet. It’s an act of trust and kindness and support that I still don’t take for granted. Thank you. Launches are often characterized by a rush, a series of shortcuts and not enough patience. But it turns out that a successful launch often takes years, because the leaps we ask people to take require trust and confidence. When I look down the list of people who pre-ordered, who supported the multi-pack, who read the blog, who spread the word, who took the workshop, who shared their ideas, who lent their voices, who asked good questions, who believed… I’m overwhelmed. Thank you. The Practice launched a week ago, (only a week? for many of us, it feels like months ago). It was one of my most successful book launches, hitting #1 in its categories and getting a great response from readers. I appeared on some terrific podcasts (you can listen to some of them here) and even worked with thousands of you in a workshop setting. The work you ship, the practice you engage in, your own cycle of launches and orbits–it creates our culture and makes things better. I’m grateful for your attention and for the ability to do this work with you. Also! today at 3:30 EST (UTC-5) , I’ll be talking with my friend and colleague Bernadette Jiwa live on various social media channels (find us here).

Especially then. It’s this gap between the short-term and the long-term that makes a principle valuable. If your guiding principle is to do whatever benefits you right now, you don’t have principles of much value. But it’s the valuable principles that pay off, because they enable forward motion, particularly when it feels like there are few alternatives.

Is this good for me right now? Does it help my family? Is it scarce? Does it raise my status? Will this help me be part of a group I care about? Would my mom be proud of me? Will I get blamed? Is there a shortcut? Is it safe? Is it thrilling? How will I feel if they run out? Will it make the pain go away? Is it forbidden? [And then, maybe, if we’ve got many choices, “how much does it cost?”] "
1340,The spaces in-between,"November 4, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/the-spaces-in-between/,"It’s comforting to have a snappy answer or the certainty of knowing not only how it is, but how it happened and precisely what happens next. But sometimes we don’t know. And in those moments, we are left with our first principles. To focus on possibility, on the change we seek to make, on showing up as an even better version of the person we hope to be. Especially when it’s hard. "
1341,A new book and some excitement to go with it,"November 3, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/a-new-book-and-a-raffle-to-go-with-it/,"Today is ship day for my new book, The Practice. Medium asked me to do a weekly series about creativity. The first two posts are now live. Also! I’m doing a Facebook Live (to be reposted later on Insta, etc) today at 4:15 New York time. Come with your questions about the magic of shipping creative work. This week, some of the best podcasters I’ve ever met are rolling out podcast interviews on creativity that might resonate with you… And, for the next 24 hours, you can enter for a chance to win some rare, out of print or simply fun backlist items from my attic of past projects and provocations. Find the form to enter right here. There are only 100 prizes, and I’ll do my best to deliver before the end of the year. Included in the prize pool: The behemoth, an 18-pound, 800-page collector’s item. The titan, the follow-up, similar in size, and profusely illustrated with amazing photos from Thomas Hawk. Sleeves of alternate collectible covers for This is Marketing. The super-rare LP edition of my reading of two of my past books. These are beautiful, even if you don’t own a record player. Winners get five copies to share. The cut crystal Purple Cow award, and just a few of the scarce remaining Purple Cow milk cartons. Several other cool items, too scarce to mention here. You can’t win if you don’t enter. I started doing online contests and sweepstakes in 1990, so this is a special thirtieth-anniversary celebration. You get a bonus entry for every copy of The Practice you buy. Here are some pics of available goodies:                    “The magic is that there is no magic.” Simply the satisfaction of doing the work. "
1342,The useful crisis,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/the-useful-crisis/,"The Cuban Missile Crisis was an actual crisis. The world was hours away from being annihilated–gone forever, all of us. Since then, the media has exploited (and invented) crises on a regular basis, now more than ever, often at the expense of focusing our attention on chronic conditions, which are the real challenges. Today’s election day in the US, and the whole world is watching. Even with mail-in voting, it’s mostly a one-day thing. A useful crisis, a chance to encourage millions of people to get involved, at least a little. The last time around, only 80,000 votes separated the outcome, a truly tiny fraction of the population who didn’t show up and vote but could have. While the Tonkin crisis accelerated the US’s involvement in Vietnam, it was the chronic and persistent war that truly took a toll. We notice the amplified moments but the long haul is often invisible. And media like Twitter make it 140 times worse. A crisis doesn’t have to be a negative event. A wedding is a crisis–one ceremony, one day, over and done. All eyes, all attention, all on this moment. That’s why we do it–even though the chronic condition of the marriage itself is always more important. And we do the same thing for job interviews and product launches as well. Today’s the launch day for my new book, The Practice. People asked me why I would waste the focus and crisis of a launch on a day when everyone is going to be talking about something else. I did it partly because I know you can handle two things at once, and would probably want to find something to fill your time while you were waiting for the results. And mostly because The Practice is about the long haul, the persistent posture of creation and possibility. I’d love to have an exciting launch day (I’ll be posting some hoopla details later today) but I’m far more interested in what the people who go first do with the book after they read it. Tomorrow, next month and next year. It doesn’t make sense to waste a good crisis, but it also hurts us when we are only concerned with them. Please vote today if you can, and then let’s all try to find a way to work together to figure out how to focus on the persistent, chronic conditions that we can each do something about.

1343,What do you get and what does it cost?,"November 2, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/what-do-you-get-and-what-does-it-cost/,"This is pretty easy to discuss when we’re discussing buying an ice cream sandwich. It costs $2, you get an ice cream sandwich. It gets a little more nuanced when we talk about what $2 means to you, what the freedom to choose is worth, the guilt or joy you get from eating a sugary dessert all on your own, the fun of sharing it with a friend, your narrative about hormones and livestock… Maybe it’s not that easy after all. And so we get to the sometimes subtle calculation of voting. Tomorrow in the US is voting day. It apparently doesn’t cost anything to vote–just a few minutes of time. But it actually can feel like it costs a lot, because it comes with cognitive load, with decision making, with a feeling of power or futility or connection or loneliness. If you don’t vote, it’s a lot easier to deny any responsibility. A year ago, I was standing in line at an ice cream stand in Syracuse, NY. A person in front of me took more than two minutes (a long time when it’s a long line!) to make up their mind, and even let two other people jump ahead because it was so hard (which means, also, so fun) to be undecided. That’s a choice, and the date certain of voting pushes us to move through that state… But along with these costs, voting comes with the feeling of participation. Even if you don’t think your vote counts, others do. People are paying attention, and over time, it adds up. And it comes with the feeling of generosity, because you can vote to advance the well-being of someone who needs to be seen even more than you do. If you’re a habitual non-voter, it’s worth wondering for a moment about the calculation you use to keep that streak going, and perhaps consider exploring the feelings that come when you break that streak. Not just tomorrow, but in all the ways, and on all the days, when we don’t speak up, don’t raise our hands and don’t vote. "
1344,"Omission, commission and the places in between","November 1, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/11/omission-commission-and-the-places-in-between/,"If you accidentally leave the gate open and foragers end up destroying 1000 acres of crops, the guilt feels different than if you went and actively burned down the fields, even if the damage is identical. In our society, we treat errors of omission differently from the decision to commit a crime. But there are countless places in between. What if you should have known? What if you could have known but didn’t bother to do the work? What if you promised you’d do the work to find a path, but then didn’t? One reason we hide is that we’re afraid of being on the hook, of making a promise we can’t keep, of showing up and taking responsibility for our intentional actions. But, as information becomes more widespread and our leverage increases, we’ve already put ourselves on the hook. Could, should and would not only rhyme, they exist on a continuum. "
1345,Absolute value,"October 31, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/absolute-value/,"It’s time for the annual window painting competition in my little town. Store owners allow kids to have a 2 foot by 4 foot piece of window to paint a scary/funny/punny Halloween billboard, and the winners get a certificate. And every year, parents not only help, they often take over and do all the work. The thing is: Not one of these entries, ever, has been the best in the world. None has been perfect or even worthy of hanging in a gallery. It’s not a worldwide absolute competition. It’s relative. Relative to what you’re capable of. You’re not running the race against everyone else. More often than not, you’re simply running it against yourself. [And as long as we’re thinking about the Grateful Pumpkin and seasonal reasons to be thankful, a reminder that in the US, Thanksgiving is in three weeks. The annual Thanksgiving Reader is available for free download and easy at-home printing. Designed by Alex Peck, he and I are offering it to families so that we can create a new tradition. This year more than ever, even if it’s by Zoom.] Don’t eat cheap chocolate! "
1346,A/B/C and the problem with skipping a step,"October 30, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/a-b-c-and-the-perils-of-skipping-a-step/,"Striving to be asleep is a difficult leap. On the other hand, committing to lying still is do-able. Lying still makes it more likely you’ll get to the next step. Hoping to grow your business by word of mouth by willing your customers to talk about you isn’t nearly as productive as making something worth talking about. Skipping a step is frustrating and usually futile. "
1347,The successful scientist,"October 29, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/the-successful-scientist/,"The scientific method is the most powerful invention humans have ever created. It’s not just for people in white coats and in labs. The scientific method has changed what we wear, what we eat, the health of our families, the way we earn a living–the world as we know it is a result of a simple process of hypothesis, testing and explanation. Unfortunately, school and other systems in our world focus on just one or two of the elements necessary to do it well. There are very few contentious arguments in our world today that couldn’t be more quickly resolved if all involved were willing to act in good faith and work their way through the steps together. Because if you seek to lead or to change minds, if you’re working for better, then you’re a scientist. "
1348,“All anecdote and no data”,"October 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/all-anecdote-and-no-data/,"That’s a criticism, of course. A report, study or testimony that’s all anecdote with no data carries little in the way of actionable information. On the other hand, if you want to change people’s minds, “all data and no anecdote” isn’t going to get you very far. We act on what we understand, we understand what fits into our worldview and we remember what we act on. "
1349,Back in the tube,"October 27, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/back-in-the-tube/,"There are two kinds of mistakes. One is the sort where failure is not noticeable because failure means that you didn’t engage with an audience. If you do an art show and no one comes, no one realizes that your art show failed. The other is harder to walk away from. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. When you engineer collateralized debt obligations that merge together mortgage streams, inextricably linking the healthy ones with the others, it’s a mistake with real consequences. Confusing the two types of errors is a recipe for tragedy. If we can figure out how to organize and plan for the first type of resilient failure, it’s far easier to experiment. "
1350,Misgivings,"October 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/misgivings/,"If you’re not having any second thoughts at all, it’s probably because you’re not thinking it through enough. The hallmark of the true believer is that there’s no room for judgment. For everyone else, misgivings are a sign that you’re carefully considering the problem at hand. "
1351,Popular vs. good,"October 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/popular-vs-good/,"They’re not the same. We often strive to have both, but that’s unlikely. The price of having one almost certainly involves losing the other.  We often end up compromising something to get both and fail. Better to have one than neither. "
1352,The thing about sunk costs,"October 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/the-thing-about-sunk-costs/,"Tomorrow is another opportunity. There are thirty people over there who are just waiting for you to help connect them, lead them or make things better. But if you’re still defending the stuck project over here, the one you put so much into, you won’t be able to show up for them. Customers, partners, clients and students who need your voice or your product aren’t going to benefit from it because you’re working so hard to dig yourself out of a previous hole, a situation that is now harder than ever to work your way through. It’s easy to focus on the problem right in front of us, and to decide that this problem, and only this problem, is the problem for us to solve. But there’s a cost to everything, and the opportunity lost when you’re doing this is just as real, even when you don’t notice it. Of course, we don’t create contribution by flitting from one thing to another whenever things get difficult. But we also sell ourselves short (and harm the people we’d be able to serve) if we’re unable to quit a project that’s gone sideways. What happened yesterday already happened. It’s a gift and an asset from your previous self. You don’t have to accept if you don’t want to. "
1353,Big business vs. small business,"October 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/big-business-vs-little-business/,"Small companies create almost all the jobs. They are the insurgents, the agents of change. Big companies are a backbone, reliable providers of goods and services. Big companies operate at a scale that most of us can’t even imagine. The two points of view often conflict. And each can learn from the other. Net neutrality is an argument between freedom of innovation by small business vs. control from big business. Campaign finance reform is an argument against big companies and their leaders buying the outcomes of elections. It’s not always about capitalism vs. the alternative. It’s often about the status quo vs. what’s next. Worth noting: A small business is not a big business that hasn’t grown up yet. It’s different. A small business has an owner, someone who can make decisions without meetings, who can listen to customers and who can embrace the work at hand. If you run a small business, I hope you’ll check out the new workshop from my friend and colleague Ramon Ray. The folks at Akimbo are working with Ramon to help connect small business people on their journey to making a bigger impact. It works better together. "
1354,“That’s not what I meant”,"October 22, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/thats-not-what-i-meant/,"Disagreements among people who mean well usually begin with that emotion. You meant to say something or agree to something, but the “other side” didn’t hear it that way. That’s enough for a customer to walk away forever. That’s enough for a lawsuit. Because denying the experience of the other person doesn’t open the door for re-connection. Forward motion is possible if we can extend the sentence to, “That’s not what I meant, but that must be what you heard, how do we fix this? Will you help me make things right again?” If we can agree on intent, it’s a lot easier to figure out how to move forward. "
1355,Cross the bridge and join the dragons,"October 21, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/cross-the-bridge-and-join-the-dragons/,"53 years ago, early in her career, Joni Mitchell recorded this song. It’s not something most people will want to listen to often. Shortly after that, she became the one and only Joni Mitchell. But first, she had dues to pay. That’s the work of practice and discernment and skill. You’re not born with genius, it’s a skill. You might have to sing more than one song like this before you end up with the art that resonates with your audience. "
1356,The limited-edition pre-launch of The Practice,"October 20, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/the-limited-edition-pre-launch-of-the-practice/,"My new book ships in two weeks. It’s about the human process of shipping creative work, regardless of what sort of job we have. It’s about trusting yourself. Mostly, it’s about getting back to becoming the person you seek to be. You can find details on the book (and links to pre-order) here. For the true fans, I’ve put together exactly 400 sets of limited-edition swag. If you order the special 12-copy set of the book from Porchlight, you’ll also get a large handful of cool stuff, including a hand-lasered writer’s block, a set of letterpress hand-printed pages, six (of 12) collectible storage packs and a magical surprise that contains actual magic. If you’re the sort of person who likes to go first, or wants to share a book with your peers, today’s the day. There aren’t many… [update 10.21 end of day–now a bestseller on Amazon, thank you. And the 12-packs are sold out…]          "
1357,“I hate this restaurant”,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/i-hate-this-restaurant/,"Back in the old days, I took someone to a local Italian restaurant for dinner. As we looked over the menu, complete with regional specialties and handmade pastas, he started to sulk. With a sullen look, he said, “I want a hamburger and french fries.” Somehow, the patient kitchen staff figured out how to produce this out of thin air, and a tantrum was narrowly averted. But I’ve been thinking about that interaction a lot. In his mind, “restaurant” meant, “a place where I can get a hamburger and french fries.” If you look at many 1 star reviews (of books, of music, of restaurants) this is precisely what you’re going to see. A mismatch of expectations. A mismatch that is blamed, completely, on the person who created the work, not the critic. It doesn’t matter that the thing was clearly marked. It doesn’t matter that the thing was extraordinarily well-produced. And it doesn’t matter if just about everyone else experiencing it was thoroughly delighted. Because for this spoiled, under-informed and impatient patron, it failed. This failure comes from a few contributing factors, all amplified by our culture: First, you can’t know if you’re going to like an experience until you experience it. All you know is your understanding of what was on offer. And because there are so many choices and there’s so much noise, we rarely take the time to actually read the label, or we get carried away by the coming attractions, or we just don’t care enough to pay attention until we’re already involved. [And marketers are complicit, because in the face of too much noise, they hype what’s on offer and overpromise…] Second, because many people are afraid. They’re afraid of the new and even more than that, afraid of change. Most people in our culture would like to be entertained not transformed, lectured at instead of learning. Third, the double-edged sword of giving everyone a microphone means that we’ve amplified the voices of dissent at the same time we’ve given people a chance to speak up about their desires. This means that mass culture is far more divisive than it ever was before, and it also means that bubbles of interest are more likely to be served. And so the fork in the road: You can either turn your operation into a cross between McDonald’s and Disney, selling the regular kind, pandering to the middle, putting everything in exactly the category they hoped for and challenging no expectations… Or you can do the incredibly hard work of transgressing genres, challenging expectations and seeking out the few people who want to experience something that matters, instead of something that’s merely safe. "
1358,Better and cheaper,"October 19, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/better-and-cheaper/,"That’s a pretty powerful combination. Some customers gravitate toward the option that offers ease, quality and convenience, while others prefer low price. If you can do both… One way we’ve seen that done is with scale. Many people prefer the big box store to the local merchant. Not only is it often cheaper, but the selection might be dramatically better, the parking might be easier and in some rare cases, the service is better as well. How is this possible? Because volume pays off in almost every way that matters to the customer. Another way is with proprietary insight. If a company has a production process, a patent or some other barrier, they can often deliver something faster and cheaper… a barrier that a competitor without that shortcut can’t overcome. A third way is with herculean effort. When the people who work on the team simply care more. Caring is work, and caring is in short supply. An organization staffed with smart people who care can often run circles around a lazier competitor. Most of the time, though, you’re probably unable to rely on one of these approaches. If that’s the case, the next best option is to choose. To actually be better (regardless of price) or to actually be cheaper. But pretending that you have both doesn’t work very well. It costs a lot but it’s worth more than it costs. "
1359,Unacceptable,"October 18, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/unacceptable/,"The word has a very specific meaning, which is why it’s so powerful. If we accept behavior that’s unacceptable, we’re compromising on something that we thought was too important to compromise on. And that’s how we end up with the unacceptable becoming commonplace. "
1360,Two kinds of limbo,"October 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/two-kinds-of-limbo/,"Uncomfortable limbo happens when we’re seeking firm footing and there isn’t any. The discomfort comes from not knowing, from our unlimited desire to get through it to the other side. And comfortable limbo is a place to hide. We lull ourselves into complacency, because the limbo of being in between feels safe, with no responsibilities. Amazingly, two different people can experience the same limbo in totally different ways. It’s not the limbo that’s different, it’s us. "
1361,We like what we choose,"October 16, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/we-like-what-we-choose/,"Not the other way around. It feels safer to say that we’re born with talents and gifts, that we have a true calling, that we’re looking for what connects with our passion. That’s not useful (because it means you spend a lot of time shopping around) but it’s also not true. New research confirms that random choices lead to preferences, and then it follows that preferences lead to habits and habits lead us to become the person we somehow decide we were born to be. If you had grown up somewhere else or some time else, there’s little doubt that you’d prefer something else. The things we think we need are simply the things we’re used to. And if you like what you like simply because you have a pattern, that means that you might be able to like something else if you could develop new patterns. In short: If we commit to loving what we do, we’re more likely to find engagement and satisfaction. And if what we do changes, we can choose to love that too. "
1362,Two kinds of momentum,"October 15, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/two-kinds-of-momentum/,"There’s the unalterable momentum of physical objects as understood by physics: objects in motion tend to remain that way. A fast-moving baseball hitting your head hurts more than a lobbed one. But usually, momentum is only conceptual, and it’s based on our habits and our difficulty in understanding (and ignoring) sunk costs. We stick with a pattern, a leader, an employee or a project much longer than we should. The behavior that keeps someone from getting hired is trivial compared to what it takes to get fired. And at some level, that makes sense. When we’re not committed yet, the cost of looking around and switching our choice is small. But once we’ve emotionally committed to a cause or a project or a person, the cost of change is high, partly because it involves feeling as though we made a mistake. But compounding that initial choice by doubling down on it is the actual mistake. Digging a deeper hole rarely gets us to the other side. "
1363,Show no work,"October 14, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/show-no-work/,"There are two sorts of projects. In the first, you’ll need to show your work. Show us why the logic holds up. Tell us how this has happened before. Explain the best practices you’ve learned from and the standards you’re following. In the second, you’re taking a leap. Simply guessing or going on instinct. Either path can work, the problem is when we confuse them. Perhaps we’re doing something that is based on what’s come before, but we refuse to examine, measure or compare, insisting that history doesn’t apply. Or worse, when we’re going on instinct and assert that it’s actually a reliable, proven path forward. If the stakes are high and the outcome needs to be reliable, we hope you’ll be able to show your work. And when it comes to the part of the project that’s yours and yours alone, the part that isn’t based on what’s come before, show no work. And plan accordingly. "
1364,The power of community and the trap of opt-out,"October 13, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/the-power-of-community-and-the-trap-of-opt-out/,"In Colonial America, they had private fire departments. If you didn’t voluntarily pay your dues, the firemen wouldn’t put out a fire–they’d watch your house burn and make sure it didn’t spread to your neighbor’s house. [or this!] While this is a vivid way to ensure that everyone pays their dues, it’s such an inefficient way to support the fire department that it was replaced with the smarter alternative: a smaller tax on everyone, automatically collected. Even if a few manage to avoid paying their share, the blanket protection, which also leads to fire inspectors and building codes, clearly makes the case for universal protection. We don’t let citizens opt out of paying their taxes, because community works better when group consensus leads to group action. It’s more efficient to provide services this way, and far more important, it creates a culture of ‘us’, which changes behavior from selfish to generous. There’s a balance, neither extreme works. It’s up to us to think hard about where the (unstable, hard to find) balance lies. "
1365,Persistently irrational,"October 12, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/persistently-irrational/,"When people around you do something that makes no sense or is self-defeating, it might not be because they’re stupid. It’s more likely that they don’t believe what you believe, don’t see what you see or don’t want what you want. It might be different measures of time, of status or desire. If we hope to understand behavior, and ultimately to change it, we need to see the stories behind it. Because, in many ways, we’re all irrational sometimes. "
1366,Figure and ground,"October 11, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/figure-and-ground/,"When does it snap into focus? Because we don’t like to be wrong. And more than that, we don’t like to be confused. So when we encounter something new, we pause for a second until we think we get it. Then we lock it in, and it’s ours. But what if we’re wrong? What if our understanding of what we encountered wasn’t useful, accurate or true? Suddenly, there’s a conflict. A conflict between being wrong and being confused. Because the only way to stop being wrong is to be momentarily confused. To jump from one state to another. The magic is in waiting a few beats before you lock it in. Getting comfortable with ‘confused’ is a stepping stone on the path to becoming wise. "
1367,It turns out that ‘beiger’ isn’t a word,"October 10, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/it-turns-out-that-beiger-isnt-a-word/,"Perhaps it should be, given how much time is spent trying to make things more and more beige. Bland is not a helpful goal. The goal could be to become useful, remarkable and worth seeking out. To do something that’s hard to replace, groundbreaking or thrilling. Generous work that makes things better. Beiger doesn’t help. "
1368,Agreeable,"October 9, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/agreeable/,"You can be agreeable without agreeing. In fact, most of the time, we’d rather spend time with people who have a different point of view but are willing to be agreeable nonetheless. It’s far better than the alternative. "
1369,Attitudes are skills,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/attitudes-are-skills/,"Three words that changed my life. Once you realize that you can improve, amplify and refine the things that other people call attitudes, you may realize that they are skills. Which is great news, because becoming better at a skill is something we’re able to do. Some people call these, “soft skills.” That’s because they’re not easy to measure. But for me, they’re real skills. The skills that actually determine how far we’ll go and how it will feel to work with us as we move forward. Akimbo is hosting the third Real Skills Conference on Saturday, October 17 from 3 to 5 pm ET. You can find all the details here. It’s truly a conference. No keynotes, no experts, simply a group of people who want to understand what it means to level up by seeing what’s possible and then deciding to do something about it. If spending an afternoon with people like that in service of making a difference would be helpful, I hope you can join in. "
1370,The cold open,"October 8, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/the-cold-open/,"No one ever bought anything on an elevator. The elevator pitch isn’t about selling your idea, because a metaphorical elevator is a lousy place to make a pitch. When you feel like you’re being judged and only have a minute to make a first impression, it’s tempting to try to explain the truth and nuance of who you are, what you’ve done and what you’re going to do in the time it takes to travel a few floors. That rarely works. The alternative is the elevator question, not the elevator pitch. To begin a conversation–not about you, but about the person you’re hoping to connect with. If you know who they are and what they want, it’s a lot more likely you can figure out if they’re a good fit for who you are and what you want. And you can take the opportunity to help them find what they need, especially if it’s not from you. Too often, we feel rejected when in fact, all that’s happened is a mismatch of needs, narratives and what’s on offer. Instead of looking at everyone as someone who could fund you or buy from you or hire you, it might help to imagine that almost no one can do those things, but there are plenty of people you might be able to help in some other way, even if it’s only to respect them enough to not make a pitch. No one wants to be hustled. "
1371,The clarity (and risk) of graphs,"October 7, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/the-clarity-and-risk-of-graphs/,"You might not agree with something you read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal or The New York Times, but at least you understand it. There’s simply no way a sentence like this would make it through the editing process: “Are we not pure? “No, sir!” Panama’s moody Noriega brags. “It is garbage!” Irony dooms a man—a prisoner up to new era.” And yet, major publications continue to post graphs and charts that are nonsensical and redundant at the same time. Following their lead, we’re busy putting similar junk in our presentations and brochures as well. Consider this one from a recent issue of the Times. (click to enlarge) Why are the months on the vertical axis? Why is it symmetrical, repeating all the information? Most important… what is it trying to say? If you don’t know what you’re trying to say, not saying it with a graph is a good way to hide.    "
1372,Better clients,"October 6, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/better-clients/,"That’s it. Two words. If you’re a freelancer, that’s the hard part. The important part. The part that will open the door to the work you seek to do. Better clients challenge you. They support you. They spread the word. They pay on time. They pay more and expect more. Everything else will take care of itself if you focus on getting better clients. It’s possible, but alas, unlikely, that better clients will simply appear. That outsiders will realize how hard you’re working and will show up. Alas, while it may seem unfair, it turns out that you don’t get better clients simply by working hard. It’s much more productive to take the steps necessary to attract them and keep them instead.   Today’s the best day to sign up for The Freelancer’s Workshop. The team at Akimbo is running it again because it works. It will change the way you do your work, whatever sort of freelancing you do. The Akimbo secret isn’t the videos, it’s the ability to learn together. To be surrounded by your peers, to challenge and be challenged by sharing your insights with people on a similar journey. "
1373,The first rule of the game,"October 5, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/the-first-rule-of-the-game/,"“All players must agree to not cheat.” It’s simply too difficult to enumerate all the rules necessary to engage with people who don’t have goodwill about the process. If you want to cheat, you’ll figure out how to cheat. When all the players enroll in the spirit of the game, the game works. No matter what the game is. Cultures and industries change. They often embrace the idea of fairness and a mutual respect for agreed-upon rules. But, over time, the spirit of the game can fade–and it incurs a cost on all the participants, because it’s difficult to move forward if you’re not sure what the rules actually are. As the stakes have risen in marketplaces–of ideas, of commerce, of governance–it’s become more acceptable to play to win while cheating. To buy a slot on a bestseller list, to coerce or to collude, or to rig an outcome of one sort or another. No one wants to be hustled. Breaking the first rule ensures that the rest of the systems will be under great stress. Let’s play or let’s not play. But cheaters aren’t welcome. "
1374,What does it mean to be smart?,"October 4, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/what-does-it-mean-to-be-smart/,"Termites and squirrels are successful. They’ve persisted through millennia, and they do things to survive that we could never figure out. They have good instincts. But they’re not smart, not smart in the sense that we hope a leader or a colleague will be. That kind of smart requires you to be open about how you do your work, how you make choices and the sort of change you seek to make in the world. There’s no need for a smart person to change the story or be evasive or lie, because that’s not part of being smart. You want a smart heart surgeon, because she can tell you precisely why she’s going to do one procedure instead of another one. This kind of smart also requires domain knowledge. Smart people have done the reading, and they understand what has come before. They know that history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes. And they’re not interested in making a mistake that they could have avoided with informed preparation. And a smart person, in addition to revealing their methods and goals, and being alert as to what works, most of all, will change their methods and goals based on what they’ve learned. Look around you. If you’re seeing buildings that don’t fall down, public health systems that are functioning and products that delight you, it’s because a smart person did the difficult work of creating them. "
1375,Walking away from the idée fixe,"October 3, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/walking-away-from-the-idee-fixe/,"“It’s going to be exactly like THIS. It has to be, and I don’t want to hear otherwise. Don’t you believe in me?” The wedding with the perfect dress, the perfect cake, the perfect groom. It doesn’t matter that the family, the finances and yes, our spouse all don’t want it. The business with the famous venture capitalist behind it, the IPO, the business model. It doesn’t matter if the people we seek to serve can’t support that. The musical career with a debut at Carnegie Hall, the glowing reviews and the fancy record deal. It doesn’t matter that the practice and the compromises make you unhappy… There are industries in place that groom us to do things a certain way. Not because it’s good for us or our mission, but because it’s easier or more profitable for them. In fact, you can make a ruckus online without venture funding (most people who do don’t have it). In fact, you can have a happy marriage without a big wedding. And in fact, you can happily write your novel without Random House publishing it. I know you’ve been proving the naysayers wrong for so long that by now it feels like a regular part of the journey. It’s entirely possible, though, that the folks who are pointing out that the industry’s path might not be your path have a point. For every person who has proven the skeptics wrong, there are a hundred who should have listened to them and done the work they cared about instead of keeping track of the wrong metrics. Begin at the beginning: who are you serving? What does a successful contribution look like? "
1376,The arc and the arch,"October 2, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/the-arc-and-the-arch/,"They sound similar, but they’re not. An arc, like an arch, is bent. The strength comes from that bend. But the arc doesn’t have to be supported at both ends, and the arc is more flexible. The arc can take us to parts unknown, yet it has a trajectory. An arch, on the other hand, is a solid structure. It’s a bridge that others have already walked over. Our life is filled with both. We’re trained on arches, encouraged to seek them out. But an arc, which comes from “arrow,” is the rare ability to take flight and to go further than you or others expected. "
1377,"“Well, that’s a dumb idea”","October 1, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/10/well-thats-a-dumb-idea/,"As dumb as selling shoes, an item that comes in 100s of sizes, over the internet. As dumb as expecting people to find a date or a spouse online. As dumb as building an encyclopedia that anyone can edit. You get the idea. Electric cars with 100-mile range, vegan hamburgers, milk made from oats, free college courses… The next breakthrough is almost certainly going to be something really dumb. Or perhaps merely obvious and unoriginal. "
1378,Lottery thinking,"September 30, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/lotteries-and-raffles/,"Ironically enough, lottery thinking is a chronic problem. Lotteries of all sorts grab our attention and change our agenda. A lottery is an almost random event, a longshot, one that promises to change your life (for the better if it’s a money thing, for the worse if it’s medical, etc.). The simple and immediate nature of the outcome is an essential part of the lottery’s power. Getting hit by lightning, finding the perfect job, having a djinni grant three wishes–these are all lotteries. We spent billions of dollars keeping liquids out of carry-on luggage for no rational reason. It was simply a negative lottery, one that momentarily got the public’s attention and then became part of a narrative about control. There’s a mismatch between how vivid an outcome is and the odds that make that outcome likely or important to our daily plans. High media attention plus sudden change plus low odds tend to focus our minds more than the opposite. The problem with lottery thinking is that it takes us away from thinking about the chronic stuff instead. The pervasive, consistent challenge that will respond to committed effort.   PS relevant aside: The other day I was passed by someone who was headed toward me, at high speed, in the middle of the street. He was on an electric skateboard. He had on a face mask, of course, but it was askew. He wasn’t wearing a helmet and he was vaping, all at the same time. Go figure. "
1379,Professional wrestling,"September 29, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/professional-wrestling/,"It’s a theater of status. Professional wrestling isn’t about wrestling, of course. It’s about who’s up and who’s down. The stated rules are there to be broken by some of the participants, and it’s not professional in any useful sense related to the sport of wrestling. And the metaphor is powerful in many areas of life. But we can’t understand the metaphor without understanding the forms of status that are on offer. There is the status of affiliation. This is about belonging, about knowing and living with the rules. It’s about weaving together the culture and this affiliation leads to a form of popularity. And then there is the status of dominance. This is about winning at any cost, cheating and subjugating. It’s about unraveling the culture in service of just one aim–victory over the others. Professional wrestling creates tension between the two forms of status. We know that we all benefit from affiliation, but often are swayed by the avenging dominator if we see ourselves in them. The theater of status happens in our daily lives. It’s who sits where at the meeting, or who gets to announce that the Zoom session is over. It’s the insurgent and the status quo. It’s the dramatic back and forth between someone who seeks power and someone who is tired of being told what to do. The successful affiliator doesn’t seek to out-dominate the dominator. Instead, affiliators weave together enough persistent community pressure to get things back on track. And sooner or later, people realize that the triumph of the dominator, while it can be painful, is short-lived. "
1380,Here I am,"September 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/here-i-am/,"When we say, “here, I made this,” we’re not seeking credit, we’re taking responsibility. To be seen, to learn, to own it, to do it better next time. Hiding is too easy. And hiding is a trap. "
1381,“What time is your flight?”,"September 27, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/what-time-is-your-flight/,"Why do cab drivers ask this question? It’s not like they can get to the airport any faster. It simply serves to create tension where no tension is helpful. There are a hundred ways to introduce tension into a conversation. It’s worth doing it with intent, when it serves a function. "
1382,The magic of trade-offs,"September 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/the-magic-of-trade-offs/,"If you make a laptop more powerful, the battery life will suffer and it will get heavier too. Trade-offs. If you make a plane bigger, it won’t land at every airport, and it will cost more to fly, even if you don’t sell all the seats. Another set of trade-offs. Good engineers don’t whine about trade-offs, because they realize that they’re the entire point. If there were no trade-offs, we wouldn’t need their help, there would be no interesting problems worth solving. In our work and our lives, we can train ourselves to say, “oh, good, an interesting trade-off.” "
1383,"One at a time, over and over","September 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/one-at-a-time-over-and-over/,"It’s 2018, a special night out. The restaurant shouldn’t have been as disappointing as it was. The room was beautiful, the staff was trying hard, the menu was ambitious–and yet it fell flat. I realized that the problem is one that many of us face: All shift long, there’s a lot to do. Another plate to fire, another customer to serve, another plate to clean. And yet this customer doesn’t care about all of that. For any given diner, this may very well be the only time he or she will ever eat here. For any given diner, this dish, this interaction–that’s the only chance you’re going to get. It doesn’t matter to them that you have 100 tops to serve in the next hour. It doesn’t matter that the last week’s worth of customers all left happy. To this customer, there’s just this one time. Over and over. Just this one time. Over and over. "
1384,When can we talk about our systems?,"September 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/when-can-we-talk-about-your-system/,"Your team is down by a few points and the game is almost over. What play should you call? [When can we talk about the system of drafting and training that got your team to this situation in the first place?] Your back hurts and you think you need surgery to help with the pain. [When can we talk about the technique you use when you go running every day?] Your employee shows up late regularly. How can you get them to care more? [When can we talk about your hiring and leadership approaches?] There’s racial injustice and unfairness all around us. [Can we talk about persistent indoctrination around caste?] You just had an argument with your brother. What’s the best way for him to see that you’re right? [When can we talk about the narratives your family has developed for generations?] Universities and local schools are in crisis with testing in disarray and distant learning ineffective… [When can we talk about what school is for?] It’s comfortable to ignore the system, to assume it is as permanent as the water surrounding your goldfish. But the fact that we have these tactical problems is all the evidence we need to see that something is causing them, and that spending time on the underlying structure could make a difference. In a crisis, there’s maximum attention. And in a crisis, we often discard any pretense of caring about systems and resilience and focus only on how to get back to normal. This is precisely why normal is what normal is, because we fight to get back to it. Changing the system changes everything. And it might be even less work than pouring water on today’s tactical emergency. "
1385,What does “shortly” mean?,"September 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/what-does-shortly-mean/,"When a client or customer asks when a project is going to be done, an answer offered might be, “soon” or “shortly.” Frustration ensues. It ensues because “shortly,” means: “I’m not sure” and “I don’t want to be responsible” and “you shouldn’t ask.” It creates little in the way of connection, and doesn’t project confidence, authority or even care. “Shortly” is a one-word way to say, “go away.” The alternative is to seek to understand and to work to be understood. If the customer is double-parked, a better answer might be, “it will definitely be less than ten minutes, give me your phone number and I’ll call you the moment it’s done.” If the engagement manager is trying to juggle priorities and dependencies, a better response might be, “would it make things easier if we could narrow down the delivery date to a two-or-three day span?” And if the client is simply curious to understand why she hasn’t heard from you and whether you’ve got this under control, perhaps the answer is, “the dilithium crystals shorted out, the new shipment is promised for Monday and in the past, it has taken two weeks after arrival for us to complete the testing.” It might not be done, but confidence is restored. You sell what you sell, but you also sell the story we tell ourselves about your relationship with the work (and with us). "
1386,Dancing with belief,"September 22, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/dancing-with-belief/,"All of us believe things that might be inconsistent, not based on how the real world actually works or not shared by others. That’s what makes us human. There are some questions we can ask ourselves about our beliefs that might help us create the change we seek: Is it working? If your belief is working for you, if it’s helping you navigate a crazy world and find solace, and if it’s not hurting anyone else, it’s doing what it’s supposed to do. Often, beliefs are about finding human connection and a way to tell ourselves about our place in the world, not as an accurate predictive insight as to what’s actually happening. And beliefs are almost always about community, about being part of something. Is it helpful? Air traffic controllers and meteorologists rarely believe that the earth is flat. It’s a belief that would get in the way of being competent at their work. If your beliefs are getting in the way of your work, of your health or the health of those around you, or of your ability to be a contributing citizen, it might be worth examining why you have them and how they got there. Did you decide to have these beliefs or did someone with an agenda that doesn’t match yours promote them? Is it true?  True in the sense that it’s falsifiable, verifiable, testable and predictive. Falsifiable means that the belief is specific enough that something contrary to the belief could be discovered (“there are no orange swans” is a falsifiable belief, because all we need to do is find one orange swan). It’s not necessary for a belief to be scientifically true, in fact, it undermines the very nature of belief to require evidence. Once there’s evidence, then whatever is true is true, whether or not you believe it. Do you need it to be true? Which means that much of what we do to somehow prove our beliefs are true is wasted time and effort. If a belief is helping you make your way through the world, if it acts as a placebo and a balm and a rubric, then that’s sufficient. The problems occur when some people use our beliefs to manipulate us, when they prevent us from accomplishing our goals or contributing to the well being of those around us. What would change your mind? If we decide that our belief is actually true, we owe it to ourselves to be clear about what would have to happen for us to realize that it’s not. One of the frustrating things about conspiracies and modern memes is that as soon as they’re examined or contradicted, they’re simply replaced with a new variation. It’s one thing to change beliefs because the scientific method shows us a more clear view of what’s happening, it’s totally different to retreat to ever more unrelated stories in the face of reality. Sometimes, it’s easier for people to amend their belief with one more layer of insulation than it is to acknowledge how the world is likely to work. "
1387,Crossing from the early adopters to a larger group,"September 21, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/crossing-from-the-early-adopters-to-a-larger-group/,"I’ve blogged many times about the chasm. That’s Geoffrey Moore’s term for the gap between the small part of the market populated with people who like to go first, and the larger group of people who want to get involved with something that’s proven, popular and effective. The early adopters ask, “is it new?” The early majority ask, “did it work?” and perhaps, “what’s everyone else doing?” Longtime readers of this blog know that I do my work for early adopters. The smallest viable audience is sufficient to make an impact, and it allows me to focus on the people who are enrolled in the journey forward. But if you delight the early adopters, they spread the word. That is how the chasm is crossed–not with fancy ads or clever hype, but because the people who are engaged do the generous work of telling the others. We’re launching the first lessons of the tenth edition of The Marketing Seminar this week. With more than 10,000 alumni, it’s the most popular workshop on the Akimbo platform. And it works. That’s why the 8,000 people who took it after the initial launch decided to join in. Not everyone goes first. Almost no one does. That’s how our culture changes–when the few early adopters tell the others. And so each of us has to persist and continue to show up in the marketplace, doing the work and earning the trust of people who don’t get a thrill out of going first. People don’t show up when you launch. They show up when they’re ready. "
1388,Time to get back to magic,"September 20, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/time-to-get-back-to-magic/,"Most of the time, the phrase is, “it’s time to get back to work.” This means it’s time to stop being creative, stop dancing with possibility, stop acquiring new insights and inspiration–and go back to the measurable grind instead. Maybe we’d be better off saying, “I need to get back to making magic.” Because that’s what we’d actually like to be getting paid to create. "

Not the things that are important. Because the important things require nuance, patience and understanding. They require an understanding of goals, of the way the world works and our mutual respect. If someone keeps coming back to an irrelevant, urgent or provocative point instead, they’re signaling that they’d rather not talk about the important thing. Which is precisely what we need to talk about. "
1390,Getting the joke,"September 18, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/getting-the-joke/,"“But why is this important?” When we encounter a fashion, a film or some other cultural artifact that the critical establishment has celebrated, it’s easy to not understand it. Taste, after all, is unevenly distributed. But you don’t have to like something to understand why someone else thought it was important. To move the culture forward, we need to have the empathy to imagine what others are seeing, liking and talking about. Once you get the joke, you don’t have to laugh at it, but it definitely makes it easier for you to tell the next one. "
1391,Questions for the founder,"September 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/questions-for-the-founder/,"A friend shared a new business idea with me yesterday. Some business model questions came to mind, asked here rhetorically. If you get them right, everything else is easier: How will you get new paying customers? Why will your paying customers tell their friends and colleagues? Will this business work at a scale that you can both achieve and are happy living with? Is it easy to start? If it is, what will keep others from starting it? How do you avoid a race to the bottom where you’re trapped making a cheap commodity as a middleperson? Will it get easier as you go? Why? What incentive do customers have to stick with you instead of switching to a cheaper or more convenient choice? Businesses that are cheap to start, depend on providing a useful service at a cheap margin and are largely fungible or invisible are often difficult to turn into thriving enterprises. Customer traction, the network effect and emotional connection can change this, particularly if you build them in from the start.   "

Of course we don’t decide on who should have positions of authority or who should be trusted based on their skill at Scrabble. It’s simply a game.

It’s hard to imagine that most people would look forward to taking lessons. In the piano or arithmetic or anything else. You take medicine. You take your punishment. It’s unwanted but grudgingly accepted. The term gives away the intent behind it. Learning is different. Learning is something we get to do, it’s a dance, an embrace, a chance to turn on some lights. You don’t take a workshop. You are part of one. "
1396,In support of the hard-working teacher,"September 12, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/in-support-of-the-hard-working-teacher/,"Sometimes I talk about the education-industrial complex on this blog, rarely with kindness. I captured much of that in Stop Stealing Dreams. Readers will see that not once have I criticized a hard-working teacher who meant well. That’s because it’s the bureaucratic industrial system that’s at fault here, not the teachers. Now more than ever, with teachers scrambling with remote learning, personal health and the shifts in our culture, they matter. Teachers matter because they have the guts to buck the dominant test and measure system. Because they show up with care and energy, and because they lead. By time spent, what percentage of the typical school experience is spent on: tests, test prep, comportment, homework, memorization, the curriculum and the social pressure of fitting in? And what percentage is spent on daydreaming, inventing, creating from scratch, doing it without a manual and finding new solutions to difficult problems? I don’t think it’s an accident that we spend a fortune on high school football and almost nothing on creative writing hackathons. Change is going to come from parents and from teachers who care. The system defends the system, and the system requires adherence and stability. The massive shift to remote learning opens the door to slip in the kind of challenging problem solving and connection that we need right now. We have to hurry, though, because surveillance and more testing is probably right around the corner. "
1397,The honest mistake vs. the intentional act,"September 11, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/the-honest-mistake-vs-the-intentional-act/,"Even though the harm may be the same, we’re much more likely to move on from an acknowledged accidental mistake. Is it because we know that we’ve made honest mistakes ourselves, and the act of forgiving the other person is a way of forgiving ourselves? Or is it because it feels more random and less personal to be impacted by something that was a mistake? Or perhaps, there’s some sort of reparation when the other person apologizes and works to improve… as if our suffering made a contribution for others who will follow. In a third situation, a random accident, where there isn’t a perpetrator, it seems as though we’re the most likely to move on. If the cause is a fellow human, somehow we process misfortune differently. The intention is a double injury. And yet, after the incident, when each of us is faced with the chance to acknowledge that we made an honest mistake, we often compound the problem and turn it into something more like an intentional act, simply because we’ve been taught to avoid taking personal responsibility.

1398,“Because” vs. “and”,"September 10, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/because-vs-and/,"The way you’re feeling… is it because of something that’s going on around you? Or are you simply feeling something and there’s a situation? One way to determine the difference: Has this situation ever happened without you (or anyone, for that matter) feeling the way you’re feeling? [to pick an outdated example, one that someday we might experience again]: “I’m feeling stressed and overwhelmed because there are ten people waiting for a table at the restaurant and we’re falling behind.” Except: plenty of people who run restaurants have experienced ten people waiting for a table without feeling stressed and overwhelmed. It’s not the line that’s causing the stress. It’s your interpretation of the line. You’re overwhelmed and there’s a line. "
1399,Who is good at discovery?,"September 9, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/who-is-good-at-discovery/,"Apple has carefully guarded the podcast directory, persuading podcasters that ‘winning’ here is the shortcut to building a popular podcast. But they’re terrible at introducing podcasts to new listeners, terrible at developing a point of view that enables the industry to thrive or even grow. Compare this to Netflix. They’re terrific at surfacing content and helping people find things that they end up liking. Netflix, for economic and marketing reasons, has limited the number of ‘shows’ they have to promote, but within their set, they continue to delight. Compare this to YouTube–if you follow the ‘recommended’ path for just a handful or two of clicks, you’ll end up with something banal or violent. Google built its entire business on the mythology of discovery, persuading millions of entrepreneurs and creators that somehow, SEO would help them get found, at the very same time they’ve dramatically decreased organic search results to maximize revenue. Bookstores were pretty good at helping people discover new books, and in some situations, Amazon’s even better. Often, though, particularly on the Kindle and with Audible, Amazon does little indeed to help people find serendipity as they think about what to engage with next. (And putting recommendations up for sale to the publishers is shortsighted and greedy, imho). In music, Roon’s ‘radio’ feature does a startlingly good job of introducing me to songs I thought I already loved, even though I’m hearing them for the first time. Given how much our culture depends on finding out what’s new, it’s surprising that few have figured out how to be smart about it. If you’re a creator, the truth remains what the truth has been ever since Yahoo tried to sort the web by hand: the best way to make a hit is to build something for the smallest viable audience and make it so good that people tell their peers.

1400,"Self-directed, project-based learning","September 8, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/self-directed-project-based-learning/,"Why do educated people too often fall for foolish scams and conspiracy theories? The problem is that no one taught us to understand. Instead, we are pushed to simply to memorize. To be educated enough to do well on the test, and then to forget what we were taught, because we never actually learned it. Understanding opens the door to insight and to comfort with the data. Understanding is the platform we need to go to the next level… memorizing is a fragile house of cards, with no foundation. And the compliance mindset of “will this be on the test?” simply sets us up to believe the next thing that we’re supposed to learn. We now have a chance to turn this fall’s back-to-school (in the Northern Hemisphere) into self-directed, project-based learning instead of a rush toward compliance and butts in chairs and pencils on tests. Shipping the project, proving it works and then doing it again. Learning by doing. Self-direction unlocks our ability to contribute for a lifetime, whereas preparing for the test ensures that we will always be at the mercy of the person who is giving the test. People are not entitled to their own facts–and understanding helps us discover the ones that matter. From the age of five, many kids are capable of self-directed, project-based learning if we’re willing to turn off the TV and accept that the process won’t immediately lead to sought-after standardized test results. We can create a pattern of teaching people to be curious because curiosity is an engine for learning… it is less predictable but far more powerful than the current alternative: Creating a desire to get it over with combined with the ability to believe whatever the person in power tells us to believe. Learning opens the door to the future we’d like to live in. "
1401,Toward tired,"September 7, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/toward-tired/,"If this was a blog post about running, I’d definitely be teaching things that would make you tired. And if you want to learn anything about making a difference, being creative or leading, you should ask the person teaching to cover things that will make you afraid. Because just as you have to figure out where to put the tired when you run a marathon, you’ll need to figure out where to put the fear when you do work that matters. "
1402,Optimism as a choice,"September 6, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/optimism-as-a-choice/,"If your team is up by thirty points at halftime, it’s not optimistic to expect that you’re going to win–it’s a realistic assessment. Optimism is an attitude and a choice. It involves context and focus. We’re not deluding ourselves with the reassurance that everything is going to be okay (because that’s not productive). Instead, we’re committed to finding things we can contribute to, work on and improve. We’re devoted to seeking out useful lessons and to discovering where the benefit of the doubt might be helpful. Positive thinking doesn’t solve every problem. But it’s a much better tool than negative thinking. "
1403,Earned crankiness,"September 5, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/earned-crankiness/,"When an adult chooses to be cranky, it’s much juicier when it’s accompanied by a feeling of entitlement. If we know that we deserve the chance to be angry and disappointed, that we’ve earned it, then we can explore the feeling with vigor. No need to worry about whether we’re being self-indulgent, we can go full throttle because it’s our due. Not only is this an effective way to alienate those around us, but it’s also based on the false assumption that it’s possible to have earned the right to be cranky. Crankiness isn’t a feature. It’s a bug. "
1404,Filling a bottomless hole,"September 4, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/filling-a-bottomless-hole/,"For every journey, there are steps along the way. Tasks that need to be done before you can successfully go on to the next one. But if one of those tasks is one you can never finish, you’re stuck. You can never read all the stuff on Twitter or catch up completely on the news or be sure that everything is alright. Don’t make bottomless holes a checklist task. They’re a sideline, something to work on once you’ve actually done your work. Whatever work that you’ve chosen to do. "
1405,What’s your agenda?,"September 3, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/whats-your-agenda/,"If you write something, speak up or otherwise interact with someone, you probably have a reason. There’s a point to your statement, a goal to your instruction. The change you seek to make. What actions are you hoping to cause? If you don’t have an agenda, you’re probably sitting by quietly, or you’re frustrated at your lack of progress toward an unstated goal. An agenda helps build resilience, because it’s a compass, a chance to reset when we’re thrown for a loop. Being clear to ourselves about the change we seek to make makes it more likely we’ll make it.   Head’s up: We’re less than two weeks away from the launch of The Marketing Seminar. This is our tenth session. It’s the most popular workshop we run–there are more 10,000 graduates doing important work around the world. Check it out and sign up for more details today so you can join us at launch. "
1406,Efficient or productive?,"September 2, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/efficient-or-productive/,"When time gets short (for new parents or startup founders, for example) we naturally focus on getting efficient. We can remove extraneous details and distractions and magically get much faster at getting tasks done. But being efficient is not the same as being productive. Productive is the skill of getting the right things done, so that we accomplish what we set out to do in the first place. The work that matters. "
1407,A new normal,"September 1, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/09/a-new-normal/,"Time travelers should prepare for tough sledding. If you went back to 1820 or even 1920, all the sudden changes would discombobulate you. And the same is true for someone who came forward to today. We’ve got a deep-seated desire for things to go back to normal, the way we were used to. But this, this moment of ours is now normal. For now. And then, there will be another normal. There is no “the new normal”. Because that’s definitive. There’s simply the normal of now. A new normal. This too shall pass. "
1408,Famous colleges,"August 31, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/famous-colleges/,"Parents can do their children a favor if, from an early age, kids hear them say “famous college” instead of “good college.” Because there’s very little data that shows that colleges with big football programs or lots of Nobel prize winners are actually good at doing what a college should do for an undergraduate. If you want to spend the time and the money and the debt to go to a famous college, that’s your choice. But don’t be confused into believing that a famous one is a good one. And in this back-to-school moment, it’s smart to not only consider a gap year filled with intention as a way to engage with the world, but to think about what we’re actually buying when we buy a degree from a famous college. Education and learning continue to diverge. In-person, real-time learning is too expensive, too scarce and rarely as effective as it could be, and we’re discovering that a commitment to life-long learning is more important than a four-year sabbatical that costs too much and delivers too little. And good colleges are in a position to do something about this, while the ones that are merely famous will fight hard to maintain their status quo. Scarcity isn’t always needed to create value. The pandemic has created a significant shift in perception, and the repercussions are going to be felt by colleges for years to come–many of them are going to be refactored, restructured or disappear. "
1409,Date certain,"August 30, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/date-certain-4/,"One of the most expensive things a service business or freelancer can do is promise that work will be done by a certain day. Which is something we need to do, of course, but we should charge appropriately. “It’ll be done soon,” should be way cheaper than, “It’ll be done at exactly 11 am on Tuesday.” And one of the most important things we can do to focus our energy and commitment is be prepared to promise a date certain. It sharpens everything. "
1410,Systemic problems,"August 29, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/systemic-problems/,"… demand systemic solutions. First, we have to pay attention. Then we need to acknowledge that a solution is possible. And then we need to commit. To the long, persistent road to altering the status quo. The world is forcing us to pay attention to lingering problems more urgently than ever before. Real change on issues of dignity, justice and health are long overdue Urgent problems are too important to earn only a moment of our attention. Important projects demand that we keep showing up to make the change we seek. Showing up and showing up, at the root and at every turn, consistently working toward systemic solutions. When we think about the problems we’ve solved as a community, this is the way it always happens. Making things better, over time, with focus. Persistent commitment doesn’t lower the urgency of the moment, it acknowledges it. "
1411,"Destinations, risks and journeys","August 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/destinations-risks-and-journeys/,"Where are you headed? The choices you’re making, the effort, the sacrifices—where is the destination? We make choices every day about our destination. And because of those choices, we go on a journey. Along that journey, we take risks but we also experience an internal narrative about those risks. And so, destinations, risks (perceived and actual) and journeys define our lives. It’s possible you’ve come to the conclusion that the destination you’ve chosen isn’t for you. That being a pop star, a successful VP of accounting or a receptionist with a secure position isn’t a life you’d like to lead. But don’t confuse that with the journey. Maybe you’d be happy with the pot of gold at the end of your rainbow, but it’s entirely possible you don’t want to suffer the discomfort and indignities and effort it will take to get to that destination, that you’d like an easier path. You’ll happily take the destination but the truth is, the journey is too arduous. And don’t confuse that with your imagining of the risks along the way. It might be that you want the destination, that you are willing to put up with (or even delight in) the journey but your narrative of the risks and dangers are just too much to handle. When we conflate the destination with the journey and with our narrative of the risks, we have no hope of improving any of the three. Instead, we often pushed to throw out all three at once or embrace them all. But it’s possible, with effort and planning, to make the journey more palatable or the risks feel more tolerable. The destination isn’t the journey. And our narrative of the actual risks is up to us. "
1412,Small adjustments,"August 27, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/small-adjustments/,"Even better than buying a new bicycle is adjusting the seat on your existing bike properly. That’s because the height of the seat changes your power. It’s the point of maximum leverage, responsible for aligning all of the forces you bring to bear on the process. When we begin to think about our work, we tend to focus on the largest structures–what it looks like from the outside. But as we engage with the problem at hand, it turns out that our impact changes based on how we stand, what we believe and the ways we interact with the systems right in front of us. Get the strategy right, then implement small changes, repeated with persistence and generosity. "
1413,Far away is difficult,"August 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/far-away-is-difficult/,"Humans are bad at understanding things that are very far away in scale or time. Atoms aren’t actually made up of tiny particles that are like rocks, but smaller. And planets aren’t simply very large billiard balls. We can only understand the behavior of things big and small by realizing that they’re not actually different versions of something of the size that we can easily see. Things that happened a million years ago are hard to visualize, and we can’t reliably make many guesses about how the world is going to be a thousand years from now (and even fifty is difficult–lately, four weeks is a stretch). Physics is straightforward–except when it comes to things that are very small and those that are very large, when it all gets weird. Different rules apply. Extrapolation is far easier to claim than it is to do. That person across the counter or the web from you probably has very different experiences, beliefs and expectations than you do. Starting with your experience and assuming it matches their own is a trap. Most everyone is very far away. And most feelings act like they are very small (or very large). "
1414,The relativity of time,"August 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/the-relativity-of-time/,"Two things are true simultaneously: We’re running out of time. We have too much time on our hands. How can we be at a deadline and bored at the same time? We always are. Our experience of time relates to engagement, fear, opportunity and the culture. "
1415,From education to learning,"August 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/from-education-to-learning/,"Education is the hustle for a credential. It exchanges compliance for certification. An institution can educate you. Learning can’t be done to you. It is a choice and it requires active participation, not simple adherence to metrics. Learning is the only place to find resilience, possibility and contribution, because learning is a lifelong skill that isn’t domain dependent. Most of the learning moments in our lives are accidental or random. A situation presents itself and if we’re lucky, we learn something from it. We built the altMBA to make learning intentional. The last session of the year is in October, and applications are due tomorrow, August 25th. You’ll be surrounded by a cohort of others, each on their way to leveling up and moving forward. We only do it four times a year, only with a few hundred people, always with our alumni coaches on board. I hope you’ll check it out. Learning is our best way forward, because learning creates community. "
1416,Profit taking is lazy,"August 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/profit-taking-is-lazy/,"Once an organization reaches scale, particularly if it feels like a monopoly, it’s tempting to “take profits.” This means less investment, fewer staff and a lot less care. Those things are expensive. Easier to simply keep the money. And those things involve emotional effort. Easier to simply point to the bottom line, as if that’s the point. Lazy managers dump the emotional labor on overworked frontline staff instead of creating systems that create value for everyone. And lazy shareholders reward quarterly earnings instead of understanding the long-term ramifications of failing to serve customers. “We don’t care, we don’t have to,” is often the last slogan once-great institutions have emblazoned on their door. "
1417,Situational gravity,"August 22, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/situational-gravity/,"All of us are good at rationalizing. It helps us process the world, navigate our choices and live with ourselves. But gravity doesn’t care if you got a lot of sleep last night or not. It’s still the same amount of force. The pavement doesn’t care if you always wear a helmet on your bike, except just this one time when you didn’t, because you were having a video taken. Melanoma doesn’t care that you always wear sun screen, except that one day when you were really busy and couldn’t go back to the house for it. Outside forces don’t care about the situation, because they have no awareness or memory. They simply are. Newton’s law doesn’t care that you were really distracted and that’s why you weren’t wearing a seatbelt, and the virus that infected your friend doesn’t care about why that person in the office decided not to wear a mask, either. People are very good at stories. That’s our core technology. Everything else in the world, though, has no interest in them. "
1418,The opposite of confidence,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/the-opposite-of-confidence/,It’s not anxiety. And it’s not panic. The opposite of confident is not confident. Unsure. Being unsure can be healthy. It can help us focus on how we can make our work more likely to become the contribution we seek. But anxiety and panic have nothing to do with an informed understanding of how the world is unfolding. 
1419,Toward a Zoom agreement,"August 21, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/toward-a-zoom-agreement/,"If you promise not to check your email while we’re talking, we promise to not waste your time. If you agree to look me in the eye and try to absorb the gist of what I’m saying, I agree to be crisp, cogent and on point. If you are clear about which meetings are a waste of time for you to attend, we can be sure to have them without you. If you can egg me on and bring enthusiasm to the interaction, I can lean into the work and reflect back even more energy than you’re contributing. The purpose of a meeting is not to fill the allocated slot on the Google calendar invite. The purpose is to communicate an idea and the emotions that go with it, and to find out what’s missing via engaged conversation. If we can’t do that, let’s not meet. Multi-tasking isn’t productive, respectful or healthy. "
1420,The best available option,"August 20, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/the-best-available-option/,"That’s not the same as perfect. The best available option is always available. Perfect almost never is. If you care enough to contribute, you can care enough to not wait for perfect. "
1421,Like a surgeon,"August 19, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/like-a-surgeon/,"Some jobs need you to show up in person (and for the time being, surgeons are in that category, but with robotically controlled waldo arms, who knows…). But many jobs can be done more effectively with a combination of asynchronous work, video calls and emotional effort. Don’t confuse a long or risky commute and co-work with showing up with your full self. If they don’t need you in person, perhaps it’s better to show up with a great attitude instead of paying the high price it takes to be there on time, in real time. And if they do need you in person, then be there. Truly there. 100% present. It’s the slots in between, where attendance is taken, power is on display and the work is mediocre that cause us a lot of stress. "
1422,Cheating,"August 18, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/cheating/,"There are really only two ways to approach this: “We don’t cheat.” “We cheat when we can get away with it.” The posture of, “our side doesn’t cheat,” is the belief in the validity of the game itself. It’s a statement of moral authority, a promise of consistency and valor. It respects the process. The posture of, “cheat if you can,” is the belief in the ends at any cost. It degrades the system, because if everyone cheats, then there is no system left. Cheaters often brag about their exploits, because they want to normalize them. Sophisticated competitors, the ones who really want to win, understand that cheating destroys the very thing they set out to do. Because once cheating is normalized, the winner is the person who had the guts to cheat the most and destroy the system, not the one who deserved to win. Being against cheating doesn’t mean you don’t want to compete, it means that you do. In every community, on every team, there are people who believe that the only chance they’ve got is to cheat. Our systems persist only when peers in the community step up and insist that the cheater stop. Because being on a team that wins by cheating is ultimately self-defeating. "
1423,Spreading like wildflowers,"August 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/spreading-like-wildflowers/,"Often, people encounter ideas that are spreading like wildfire. The problem with a wildfire is that not only is it out of control, but it leaves nothing but destruction in its wake. Build an idea that spreads like wildflowers instead. "
1424,Wants and needs,"August 16, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/wants-and-needs/,"You’re unlikely to get everything you want. That’s a good thing, because wants are part of what define us. It’s entirely possible that you’ll get most of what you need, though. The trick is in being clear about what you put into each category.

1426,Noodling,"August 14, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/noodling/,"If someone offers you “feedback,” your Spidey sense might start to tingle. Feedback isn’t often part of a warm and fuzzy feeling. “Advice” is better. If you ask someone else for advice, you’re engaging them in your journey. But, as Peter Shepherd points out, “noodling” is the best of all. When we start noodling over an idea, we can be sure that no one is going to get injured. "
1427,Rejected!,"August 13, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/rejected/,They didn’t reject you. They rejected an application. They rejected a business plan. They rejected a piece of paper. They don’t know you. 
1428,The Sunday circular,"August 12, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/the-sunday-circular/,"The “freestanding insert” was a multi-billion dollar business. Printed in bulk, then handed over to newspapers that would insert it into their Sunday paper, it was filled with coupons. In fact, the coupons were the entire point. And the coupons worked. They worked for two reasons: As commerce moves online. the activities are changing, the middlemen are as well, but the two pillars remain. Priceline was a pioneer in this, giving travel shoppers a way to sign up for hassle, inconvenience and insecurity (you didn’t know which airline until after you bought your ticket) as a way to signal to airlines that they cared a great deal about price. Mark Fraunfelder brings us this 200-year-old quote: “Money is the best bait to fish for man with.” — Thomas Fuller, Gnomologia (1732) I’m not sure that’s true. I think our story about money ends up being even more important. [PS I just subscribed to Mark’s brand new newsletter. He’s been writing for and with the net forever, and I’m excited about Magnet.

1429,An extraordinary book,"August 11, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/an-extraordinary-book/,"Great non-fiction helps us see the unseen, plants and nurtures ideas that matter, and, sometimes, can leave us better than we were. Isabel Wilkerson’s new book Caste does all of those things. It uses language, analogy and history to pull together disparate threads into a coherent, devastating whole. Highly recommended. "
1430,Selling your time,"August 10, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/selling-your-time/,"We don’t pay surgeons by the hour. And if the person who cuts the lawn shows up with a very fast riding mower, we don’t insist on paying less because they didn’t have to work as hard. Often, what we care about is the work done, not how long it took to do it. And yet, some jobs, from law to programming, charge by the hour. When you sell your time, you’re giving away your ability to be a thoughtful, productivity-improving professional. Sell results.   [Today’s one of the last days of 2020 to enroll in The Creative’s Workshop. I hope you can check it out.] "
1431,Simple tips for security and serial numbers,"August 9, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/simple-rules-for-security-and-serial-numbers/,"[This probably impacts every person reading this, but few of us get to decide to fix it. I figured it was worth sharing so you can share it…] Don’t require special characters (like ! or worse, ‘) in the passwords created in your app or on your site. You’re simply training people to either forget them or to write them down in an unsafe location. Instead, require long passwords. When you set up a wifi password that others have to use, there’s really no reason to use capital letters, special characters or anything that’s a hassle to type on a phone. Try a phone number instead. Don’t use ‘0’, ‘O’, ‘o’, ‘l’ or ‘1’ in any context where they have to be distinguished–like room numbers, serial numbers or the names of children. This is why zip codes are easier to use than postal codes, and why mixed letters and numbers are worth avoiding. If you’re requiring 2FA (a good thing), don’t rely on email or texts, use an app instead. And don’t make the text code 7 digits (as my former bank did in an effort to pretend that they cared). 6 is more than enough. Instead of serial numbers, companies should consider using three words mushed together, like hey-zebra-fun. This is way easier to read and communicate to others. Imagine how easy it would be to deal with your VIN or computer serial number if you could simply say three words. All the company will need is three lists of 300 common words, which, when juxtaposed, give us plenty of combinations. And a password manager is a worthwhile program to install. If you haven’t, today’s a great day to start. BONUS: It never hurts to say ‘please’ in your forms and other online communications. It’s free. Thanks. PS all of this advice is on the path to obsolete once computers can talk and think and interact just a little better than now. Which is happening. Here’s my recent podcast about it. Marketing bonus: A fun summary of my work from Brendan. "

1433,Drop in,"August 7, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/drop-in/,"One of the most difficult things to do in skateboarding is to learn to ‘drop in’. This is the commitment at the top of the ramp. One moment, you’re standing still, at the abyss, and the next you’re committed, fully engaged with gravity. The worse thing you can do is half. When you sort of commit, you’re likely to fall. The rule is pretty simple: If you’re going to bother going skateboarding, then you’ve already decided. In this moment, you’re not making a new decision. You’re simply acting on what you said you wanted to do in the first place. Decide once. It’s fine to opt-out. But once you decide, there’s no upside in re-litigating your decision, particularly when it leads to needless risk and wasted effort. And of course, you may have realized all the moments in our lives where our hesitation to drop in is precisely at the heart of the challenge.   [Skateboarding details here.

1434,What do you own?,"August 6, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/what-do-you-own-2/,"Your skills. Your reputation. The noise in your head, your attitude, your personal passions… But after that, it starts to diverge. Some own real estate. Some own machines. Some own trademarks, or the permission asset of being able to interact with people who want to be interacted with. If you want to build a career as a freelancer, or a business as an entrepreneur, it helps to own something. Really valuable public companies are worth so much because of the assets they own and the market position they can defend as they grow. A hard-working but disrespected worker (whether an online freelancer or an actual factory worker) struggles because they’re not seen as owning enough. People have choices, and they often choose to hire and do business with entities that own something that they want to use or leverage. As you seek to make a difference and to level up, it helps to come back to that key question: what do you own? "
1435,Posing for selfies,"August 5, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/posing-for-selfies/,"We act differently when we know we’re about to be on display. Aim a camera at someone and they tense up. I guess we call it “taking” a picture for a reason. We feel defensive. Social media multiplies this by counting “likes” (which doesn’t mean someone actually likes us) or “friends” (which doesn’t mean that someone is actually our friend.) The irony is that the people we’re most likely to want to trust and engage with are the ones who don’t pose. They’re consistent, committed and clear, but they’re not faking it. Figure out what you want to say, the change you seek to make, the story you want to tell–and then tell it. Wholeheartedly and with intent. Posing is unnecessary. "
1436,Shipping creative work,"August 4, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/shipping-creative-work/,"If it doesn’t ship, it doesn’t count. If it’s not creatively productive, it’s not helpful. And if we’re lucky, this is the heart of our work. The work of creation in our chosen medium, putting ourselves on the hook, being asked to do something that’s never been done quite this way before. Call this the work of a Creative, with a capital C. Someone who commits to making things better by leading through their work, and bringing insight and magic and utility to interesting problems. It requires us to trust ourselves. To find a voice. To understand systems and genre and craft. After a year of work, we launched the Creative’s Workshop last year. It quickly became the most engaging at-your-own-pace workshop at Akimbo. The people in the workshop gave and received more feedback each day than most people get in six months. And streaks of a hundred days of productive work in a row were the norm. We only do this twice a year, and the new session is open for registration today. I hope you’ll take a few minutes to read the details and check out what previous participants have said about it. The last session was powerful enough that it became the basis for my new book, which comes out in November. If you look for the purple circle on this page, you’ll find our secret discount, which is at maximum value today, but it eventually disappears. Our future depends on the ability of each of us to find a way to make things better. To seek connection, to enable possibility and to open doors for others. I hope this workshop can help. "
1437,Two kinds of decisions worth focusing on,"August 3, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/two-kinds-of-decisions-worth-focusing-on/,"HARD ONES because you know that whatever you choose is possibly the wrong path. Hard decisions are hard because you have competing priorities. Hard decisions that happen often are probably a sign that the system you’re relying on isn’t stable, which means that the thing you did last time might not be the thing you want to do this time. EASY ONES because it probably means that you’ve got a habit going. And an unexamined habit can easily become a rut, a trap that leads to digging yourself deeper over time.   PS The Early decision deadline for the October session of the altMBA is tomorrow, August 4th. If you apply by then, you’re still at the front of the line for admission… Apply here. "
1438,Steal the time from comfort,"August 2, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/steal-the-time-from-comfort/,"Everyone gets the same 24 hours. Reset every day, a fresh start. Some of us are privileged enough to have the choice on how to spend some of that time. We can feel busy, but the busy-ness is largely a choice, a series of decisions we’ve made over the years about the things we choose to do, but have come to believe we have to do. These habits are now comfortable. Walking away from spending that time will cost us comfort. In the short run. But if we don’t walk away from how we spent time yesterday, it’s hard to imagine that tomorrow will be much better than today. HT: This riff from Derek Sivers is still resonating with me. "
1439,A too-simple answer to a complicated problem,"August 1, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/08/a-simple-answer-to-a-complicated-problem/,"The problem: how can we get people what they want and need? It turns out that the simple short-term answer is the market. The marketplace makes it possible to buy a nail clipper made of hardened steel for just four dollars, but only when you’re ready. The marketplace offers some people a solid brass set of the cups and balls magic trick and other people a hand-blown glass vase. The marketplace is hyper-alert and never tires of finding overlooked corners of desire. But the marketplace is not wise. It’s blind, short-term and fairly stupid. Because it has no overarching goal. The market is nothing but billions of selfish people, trading this for that, without regard for what’s next. Left alone, capitalism will devolve into corruption, bribery and predatory pricing leading to monopoly. Left alone, capitalism will pollute rivers, damage our health and create ever greater divides. Capitalism gets us an opioid epidemic, the dark patterns of social media and doom scrolling. Because the market isn’t wise. It has no sense of time or proportion. The only way for the simple answer to solve our complicated problems is for it to have guardrails, boundaries that enable it to function for the long haul. That’s something we need leadership to get done. And it’s more likely to get done if we acknowledge that we need to do it. "
1440,Weasel decisions,"July 31, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/weasel-decisions/,"One way to make a decision with a team or a partner is to clearly make a decision. Have a budget, do the math, lay out the risks and the options and decide with intent. The other method is to weasel your way forward. Act as if. Be presumptive. Hide relevant facts or conceal your fears. Avoid talking about the real issues, figuring that you’ll figure it all out as you go. When you are uncomfortable with here, and it’s really tempting to want to be there, it’s easy to weasel your way forward. It feels urgent and appropriate. It rarely is. "

Working from home instead of commuting. Using a dishwasher instead of the sink… All that time saved. Now that you’ve got the time back, you get to choose what’s truly important to you. How will you spend it? [Time spent on TV and social media has gone up every year of my lifetime]. "

Here are some instructions I read on Quora… Okay, how hard can it be? Actually, it might be very hard. Actually, expertise has value. Actually, just because someone said it on the internet doesn’t mean it’s true. Or useful. Experts aren’t always right. But I’d rather live in a building built by an expert, fly in a plane designed by an expert and yes, have surgery done by an expert. Even barbers get trained. "
1443,The non-urgent advance,"July 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/the-non-urgent-advance/,"Not a retreat, but a chance to advance. Set up a zoom room. By yourself, perhaps. Weird but do-able. Or possibly, bring a coach or a colleague. But only one person. No phones. No internet besides Zoom. Spreadsheets. Pads. Spend four hours in isolation, with nothing to do but figuring out what’s scaring you and what you’ve been avoiding. Spend half a day figuring out the difference between urgent and important. If you’re too busy to do that, it’s probably because you are spending too much time on the urgent. Forward! "
1444,Deliberately lo-fi,"July 27, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/deliberately-lo-fi/,"The resolution of communication has been on a downward slide for more than a decade. Careful hand-tuned typography shifts to endless Helvetica, poorly kerned. Face to face goes to landline phone call goes to cell phone call, goes to yelling into a speakerphone goes to lazy Zoom etiquette. Music goes from live to vinyl to mp3. Much of this is driven by the need to squeeze more and more stuff into a narrow pipe combined with a cultural desire for more instead of better. But… It will flip. It always does. Because better is better. "
1445,Esprit de l’escalier is overrated,"July 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/esprit-de-lescalier-is-overrated/,"The quick comeback. The clever repartee. The ability to, in the moment, say precisely what needs to be said. As the world gets faster, more of us feel the regret of the staircase. The perfect remark, often cutting, comes to us just a little too late. Don’t worry about it. Because as the world keeps getting faster, there’s actually a shortage of thoughtful, timeless ideas that are worth sharing an hour or a week later. "
1446,Defending the status quo,"July 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/defending-the-status-quo/,"Random House isn’t in the bookstore business, they’re in the business of publishing ideas that matter. Audi isn’t in the gasoline business. They sell personal transportation. You’re not in the business of having a job with an office. You are willing to trade time and effort in exchange for money and a chance to do work you’re proud of. When the world changes, it’s tempting to fight hard to maintain the status quo that feels safe. And so, utility companies lobby to ease emission standards, when they would be just fine if the standards were tightened. And so tech companies fight against new formats and new forms of exchange instead of leading with them. And of course, powerful cultural forces fight to preserve their hierarchies instead of figuring out how to thrive with new ones. What we want and how we believe we get it are often two different things. "
1447,Money costs money,"July 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/money-costs-money/,"Because there’s a cost to using it on one thing instead of another. And because the person who invests money has choices, and often chooses the choice that works best for them. Most people would be happy with a hotel that generates a profit of a thousand dollars a day. But if the hotel cost $50,000,000 to build, you’re bust. Time costs money too. That’s not the same as saying “time is money,” which it isn’t. Time is magnificent, hard to stockpile and impossible to recover. But it still costs. Which means that it’s worth considering whether something worthwhile comes back for your investment and your effort. "
1448,Keys on the ground,"July 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/keys-on-the-ground/,"If you find a key and you don’t know what lock it will fit, you haven’t found much. It’s easy to get excited about half the system, but real change and real benefit only happen when both pieces are working together. "
1449,Varieties of disbelief,"July 22, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/varieties-of-disbelief/,"Everyone, without exception, has found some things to not believe in. Things that are demonstrably true that we just don’t want to accept. A bit like a fingerprint, each person’s pattern of disbelief is probably unique. You might believe that water is made of atoms, but that the moon is made of cheese. It’s hard to predict. But the interesting question is: What has to happen for you to change your mind? What standard of proof, from what source, is sufficient for us to accept that something we’re sure wasn’t true, is true? That’s a great place to begin. "
1450,Fake deadlines,"July 21, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/fake-deadlines/,"Slack enables systems to function with more efficiency. That’s because unavoidable delays and errors compound in a system that doesn’t have enough buffer space. But fake deadlines don’t solve this problem. Fake deadlines exist when we can’t trust others (or ourselves) to be clear about our progress or prioritize honestly. So we invent a date before we actually need something to arrive. The challenge is that fake deadlines compound. Once someone on another project realizes that they’ve been outfoxed by a fake deadline, they’ll simply escalate their urgency as well. Or perhaps the provider realizes that we’ve been faking the deadlines, and so now there’s a whole new level of guessing about what the real deadline is. Professionals don’t need fake deadlines and don’t respect them. Instead, we have the chance to build in appropriate slack, get our priorities straight and keep our promises. "
1451,Doom scrolling,"July 20, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/doom-scrolling/,"Being informed is a virtue. It helps us make better decisions and encourages us to take action. Getting hooked on an endless scroll of media inputs is not the same as being informed. There’s long been a business model of urgent news (“man bites dog!”), but now it’s been leveraged, amplified and optimized to suck people in for hours at a time. And division is much easier to sell than progress. If it’s not helping you take action to make things better, what’s it for? "
1452,Commercial vulnerability,"July 19, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/commercial-vulnerability/,"If you have a retail chain that offers: A variety of products at high margins that are easy to ship without being needed immediately in expensive retail locations where the in-person shopping experience isn’t particularly remarkable… Then you’re in big trouble. Even before the pandemic. Because an online retailer is going to offer a better-priced, more convenient, higher-variety alternative and once your best customers try it, they won’t come back very often. That seems pretty obvious, and we’re seeing the retail landscape littered with companies that should have seen this coming but didn’t do anything about it, because they were too busy protecting what they thought they were good at. The question for most of us is: What if the work you do is: compliance-based standardized repetitive not based on innovative or flexible customer interaction… If it is, it’s pretty likely that you’ll be replaced by a combination of robots, AI and outsourcing. If they can find someone or something cheaper than you, they’re going to work overtime to do so. The alternative is to be local, creative, energetic, optimistic, trusted, innovative and hard to replace. "
1453,Inventing narratives,"July 18, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/inventing-narratives/,"That story in your head? It’s invented. It has to be. It might be based on some things that actually happened. The story we tell ourselves might be a useful predictor now and then. The story might even have been put there against our wishes, over time. But it can’t possibly be a complete and detailed understanding of everything. That’s why it’s a narrative. It’s a shorthand, a map–not the territory. It’s filled with shortcuts and mindreading, a personal myth about you and your role in the world. If we find our story isn’t helping us, if it’s inaccurate or distracting or enervating, we can work to change it. "
1454,The benefit of the doubt,"July 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/the-benefit-of-the-doubt-3/,"Sometimes we earn it. Sometimes, it’s handed to us even when we don’t deserve it. And sometimes, we’re deprived of it, through no fault of our own. Everything works better when we have the benefit of the doubt, and offering it doesn’t cost very much at all. And it’s rare enough that we should work overtime not to waste it. "
1455,FOMO and KIMO,"July 16, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/fomo-and-kimo/,"FOMO, of course, is the avoidable malady often known as ‘fear of missing out.’ It can completely undermine a life well lived, because it drives people to follow a crowd out of fear. KIMO is in the past tense. “Knowing I missed out.” This is also avoidable, but in a different way. (I pronounce it K-eye-moh.) I recently joined a club that sends out a liter of olive oil every now and then. And it comes with a newsletter. The newsletter reported that so many people are now members that they couldn’t send everyone the same type of oil, so they split the shipment in half. They then reported, in detail, everything about each of the two oils. I can’t help it. I liked the reporting on the other one better. While I’m confident that the one I ended up with will be delicious, my knowledge of what I missed, so beautifully described, is unavoidable. It didn’t have to be. They could have also divided the newsletter in half. And more helpful, I could simply choose to not feel KIMO if it isn’t helpful. Giving those you serve the satisfaction of knowing that they made a great choice is a fine service to offer. And we can find it for ourselves if we try. "
1456,"Professionals, hacks and amateurs","July 15, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/professionals-hacks-and-amateurs/,"The differences have little to do with skill, and a lot to do with resolve and intent. The amateur contributes with unfiltered joy. There’s really no other upside–create your work because you can, because it helps someone else, because it makes you feel good. The professional shows up even when she doesn’t feel like it. The professional understands the market, the customer and the price to be paid for work that’s worth paying for. But the professional isn’t a hack. A hack is a professional who doesn’t care. The hack has been beaten up enough times that he has emotionally disconnected. The hack has a short-term view, able to do what the client asks, without regard for how it will impact the culture or his long-term prospects. Serviceable is for hacks. Memorable and remarkable belong to professionals and hard-working amateurs. "
1457,What’s your story?,"July 14, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/whats-your-story/,"If you care about it, it’s probably a story. Whether you did well on the job interview. The results of your work to find resources to feed the hungry. Your efforts to engage with your teenagers… We remember Bastille Day, not because we were there, but because the story resonates with us. We vote for candidates because of their stories, and shop at stores that have a story that resonates with us. And it’s a story that determines how people react to an emergency in their town. The last time we took action on an idea, extended ourselves for a friend, and perhaps encouraged ourselves to launch a new project–these happened because the story worked. And it’s possible to tell a better story. It’s on us. We need to learn how to hear stories, figure out which ones are resonating, and do the difficult and urgent work to make our stories more effective. Because if we care about it, it’s worth doing better. There are techniques worth learning and doing the work with others on a similar journey is a powerful shortcut to doing it well. We’re relaunching the Story Skills Workshop with bestselling author Bernadette Jiwa today. It’s not only a place to share your story but it’s a place to learn how to do it better. It’s one of our most popular workshops because it’s proven and because it works. [Look for the purple circle on that page for a time-sensitive discount]. Your story matters. "
1458,Undoing the toxic myth of exclusion and scarcity,"July 13, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/the-myth-of-exclusion-and-scarcity/,"It’s easy to believe that excluding a group increases the benefits for those that are doing the excluding. That division and barriers somehow benefit the people who divide and hoard. That’s true when we’re talking about allocating a truly scarce resource. If you’re on a spaceship that’s headed for Mars, the oxygen you’ve got is all you’ve got. (Unless you have a population with the innovation needed to make more). But in our modern world, a world built on community, connection and the magic that comes from combining ideas, the opposite is true. When people deprive others of education and opportunity, they’re not helping themselves, they’re depriving themselves of the benefits that would come from what others would end up contributing. We don’t benefit from treating others poorly, we pay for it. More programmers, more healthy parents, more scientists, more leaders, more passionate artists, more breakthrough designers, more caring health care providers–it doesn’t crowd out anything. It creates more opportunity for everyone. This is one reason that the faux scarcity of famous colleges is so toxic. Because we don’t have to exclude and sort to help people move forward, yet we do. If you’ve ever heard a clarinet orchestra perform, you can instantly see how this works. Of course, there are no all-clarinet orchestras, because they don’t sound very good.   PS The First Priority deadline for the October session of the altMBA is tomorrow, July 14th.

1459,None of the above,"July 12, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/none-of-the-above-2/,"That’s a comfortable thing to say for some. It lets you off the hook. There are definitely people in every group who prefer “none of the above,” regardless of what’s on offer. Because none of the above is also a choice, something that’s offered without being offered. Being against might feel easier than being for. "
1460,Systems design and the front line,"July 11, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/underwater/,"If you experience lousy service or poor quality, it’s probably not solely the fault of the person who talked to you on the phone, dealt with you at the counter or assembled your product. It’s the boss. The boss didn’t design the system properly, didn’t align incentives, didn’t invest in training. The boss isn’t thinking hard about hiring the right people. And the boss isn’t listening. As a result, the frontline workers are often undertrained, underresourced and overscheduled. But, and it’s a huge but, those very same frontline workers don’t have to suffer in silence. They can provide a useful conduit of information and feedback. They can model how it could work better and establish a model for those around them. Not because it’s easy, but because it’s important. The top-down nature of the industrial entity is rapidly being replaced by the power of peer-to-peer learning and leadership. There’s no top and no bottom. Simply the ranks of people who care enough to make things better. "
1461,Sixty orbits,"July 10, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/sixty/,"Birthdays are contagious. No one actually remembers the day they were born, other people remember it for you. And the way we celebrate them is cultural, a shared process that keeps changing. People keep track of birthdays, and today used to be mine. Sixty of them. It doesn’t feel like it’s been that many. Time flies when you’re busy. Lots and lots of projects. Countless friends made, lessons learned and ideas shared. Quite a journey, with lucky breaks and advantages again and again, beginning with my parents, the cultural identity, time and town where I was born… I wouldn’t have been able to go on this journey without you, thank you. But today’s not my birthday (no need to send an email or a card). I’ve never really liked my birthday (it’s a long story involving a non-existent parrot), and the only reason for this post is to talk about who owns my birthday now. What happens if we start celebrating our birthdays differently? Today belongs to the 20,000 + people who are on their way to a permanent supply of clean drinking water because readers like you brought their birthday (and mine) to charity:water. Thank you. Now, particularly now, when the world is in pain and when so many people are wrestling with health, the economy and justice, it’s more urgent than ever to think of someone you’ve never met living a life that’s hard to imagine. And today, because it celebrates a round number, I’m hoping you will join in and help us break charity:water’s birthday record. And maybe donate your birthday too. Better still, if you subscribe as a monthly donor, you become a core supporter of a movement that changes lives with persistence and care. How it works: If you have the ability, I’m hoping you’ll click here and donate to charity:water to celebrate what used to be my birthday. And either way, I’m hoping you’ll also donate your birthday to them. Because when it’s your turn to celebrate a missing parrot or a lost cake, you can ask your friends, and they can do what you just did. It’s hard to visualize 21,000 people, mostly kids, fighting illness because the water in their village is undrinkable. That’s about three times the population of the town where I live. Thanks to all of you, my projects, including this blog, have already raised nearly a million dollars to build long-term solutions to this problem. Will you help me double that? Even one kid who lives the life he or she is capable of is worth this blog post and worth your support. Thank you. "
1462,Take good notes,"July 9, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/take-good-notes/,"Everyone is entitled to their own experience. In fact, that’s all we ever get. Our own take on the world around us, informed by where we’ve been and where we seek to go. Sometimes, we get the chance to hear about someone else’s experience. In those moments, it’s tempting to use the opportunity to explain a situation, to excuse or even to persuade. Perhaps it pays to simply take good notes. Acknowledge what you’re hearing. Encourage and amplify and find empathy. There are plenty of opportunities to expound on our version of the world. Every once in a while we have the rare chance to explore someone else’s. "
1463,The magic of the countdown,"July 8, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/the-magic-of-the-countdown/,"Thea von Harbou invented the countdown. 10, 9, 8… It works. It focuses the attention of everyone involved and ensures that we’re truly alert for what’s going to happen next. It helps that the numbers go down, not up (because up might never end). And it helps that as we get closer to lift-off, tension goes up, not down. But what really matters is this: There’s a commitment. When we get to zero, we’re actually going to do this. The commitment has to happen before the countdown can. "
1464,The 100 hour asset,"July 7, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/the-100-hour-asset/,"We’re all so busy doing our work that sometimes we fail to build a skill worth owning. If you invest 100 hours in a rare skill, you’re likely to acquire it. If you could learn to sharpen a tool better than your peers, organize a high-performance database, see the nuances in some sector of cryptography, know how to build a pretty-good WordPress site or really understand the arc of a particular writer’s career, you’d have something of value. Something that anyone who was focused enough to invest 100 hours could have, but few will choose to commit to. String together a few of those, or dig deep and develop a 1,000 hour asset and now you truly have something. There’s huge pressure to fit in, and plenty of benefits if you invest the time and stand out instead. Twenty hours a week for a year and you can know something that puts you in a new category. Access to knowledge isn’t nearly as difficult as the desire to learn. "
1465,The difference between patina and cruft,"July 6, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/the-difference-between-patina-and-cruft/,"Cruft is obsolete. Cruft is broken, discarded, non-functioning refuse that should be hauled away. Patina is the wabi-sabi of positive use. A bookshelf of well-worn encyclopedias (now replaced by Wikipedia) has a patina to it. Simply seeing it reminds us of the possibility of discovery. Patina makes it easier to go forward. Cruft gets in our way. "
1466,“It might not be for you”,"July 5, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/it-might-not-be-for-you/,"If you walk into a noisy bar and ask why they don’t have Chopin on the jukebox, they’re unlikely to accommodate you. The same is true if you go to a BBQ joint and insist on sushi. Most of the brands we truly care about stand for something. And the thing they stand for is unlikely to be, “whatever you want, we have it.” It’s also unlikely to be, “you can choose anyone and we’re anyone.” A meaningful specific can’t possibly please everyone. That’s the deal. "
1467,Are we part of us?,"July 4, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/are-you-part-of-us/,"Liberty is a state of mind. It can be seen as a chance for freedom, or a promise made but not kept. We can choose to be part of something or choose to be apart. Liberty is the offer and promise and requirement of responsibility. A willingness to connect and to offer dignity in response to those around us. Independence is actually about cooperation and interconnectedness. Yet we’ve set up systems that limit what we see, how we connect and insulate us from the hard work that’s right in front of us. One of the most important words I know doesn’t have a simple English equivalent, which says a lot. Sawubona, a Zulu term, means, “I see you.” Not just your face, of course, but your hopes, your dreams, where you came from and where you’re going. It’s not something we’re good at, and I need to do it better. Figuring out the best way to see and understand and care about the people we call ‘us’ can be difficult indeed. And essential. "

You might have been thrilled with the person who almost got the job. 17,000 people apply to a famous college. Only 10% get in. But at least a third were good enough to get in but didn’t get lucky. What happens to their narrative? Selective organizations need to get better about communicating to the people who ‘almost’ make it. And it’s an incredible waste to discard all the knowledge that was gained in the sorting process… how to share it to help someone else?   PS coming soon: A new session of The Story Skills Workshop. You can join the list today to find out more and get updates. "
1469,Our top story,"July 2, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/our-top-story/,"When you talk about your last job, your last vacation, the things that happened when you were 12… What do you lead with? Do you lead with, “I broke my ankle that summer and rarely got out” or is it, “I stuck with my reading regimen and read all of Shakespeare.” Because both are true. The top story is the one that informs our narrative, and our narrative changes our future. "
1470,Stolen ideas,"July 1, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/07/stolen-ideas/,"Is there a difference between someone stealing a potato from your farm and someone stealing your idea? Well, if everyone in town comes and takes a potato, your farm is bust. But if everyone in town comes and takes your idea, you’re more known, trusted and effective than you used to be. During Google’s beginnings, their business and tech plan was available to anyone who stopped by Stanford and bothered to read it. Every popular podcast based on an original idea gave away that original idea the moment the first episode of the podcast was available–long before the podcast itself became popular. When I was a book packager, we ended up publishing about 120 books and pitching another 1,000 that were never published. In all of that time, I can only remember one of our ideas (it was a big one) being stolen from us and published without our participation. That code of ethics created a feeling of intellectual safety. But, at the same time, it was our successful books that were copied the most–and that copying was not just a symptom but often a cause of their success. The internet is a copying machine. Ideas morph and change and spin as they move from one end to the other. Ripping ideas off wholesale and violating intellectual property rights is nothing to be proud of–each of us can do better than that. But holding ideas too tightly in fear of the ripples and echoes they’re going to cause is the real problem. Being original is an opportunity to advance the conversation. Building something of utility with persistence and grace is truly generous, though, and it’s not related to whether or not anyone has ever heard your idea before. "
1471,The simple cure for writer’s block,"June 30, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/the-simple-cure-for-writers-block/,"Write. People with writer’s block don’t have a problem typing. They have a problem living with bad writing, imperfect writing, writing that might expose something that they fear. The best way to address this isn’t to wait to be perfect. Because if you wait, you’ll never get there. The best way to deal with it is to write, and to realize that your bad writing isn’t fatal. Like all skills, we improve with practice and with feedback.   [Mark your calendars: The Creative’s Workshop is coming back in August. Check out this page for details and to get updates.] "
1472,Choices,"June 29, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/choices-3/,"How will we use our gifts? What difficult choices will we make–when it might be easier to hide? Will we waste our advantages and insulation? Will inertia be our guide, or will we follow our passions? Will we follow dogma, or will we leap forward and be original, generous and helpful? Will we choose a life of ease, or a life of service and adventure? Will we wilt under criticism, or will we follow our convictions? Will we bluff it out when we’re wrong, or will we apologize? Will we be clever at the expense of others, or will we choose to be kind? A cynic, or a builder? And we get to decide again every single day.   [PS please consider this session of The Podcasting Workshop. It’s open now for registration.] "
1473,How many moons?,"June 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/how-many-moons/,"How many moons in our solar system? With 8 or so planets, how many moons in total? My guess, when challenged, was 22. I figured Earth had one, rounded up, etc. It turns out that it’s more than 200. Saturn alone has more than 80 moons. That’s a common mistake. We make it all the time. We assume that our neighborhood is like every neighborhood, that our situation and experience is universal. That’s rarely true. Embracing that on the path to empathy is a powerful step forward. "
1474,The stolen address book,"June 27, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/the-stolen-address-book/,"I used to ask, “If you stole Steven Spielberg’s address book, would it help you get a movie made?” The point was that even if you had the phone numbers and names, calling them up and saying you’d stolen them wasn’t worth very much. The data has no value without trust and connection. Now, twenty years later, all the address books have been stolen. Everyone has all the data. Identifying the right people (or spamming everyone) is easy and cheap. Which makes the point even more urgent than ever: Without trust and connection, access to data is worthless. "
1475,Useful explanations of reality,"June 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/useful-explanations-of-reality/,"If we want to understand what’s going on around us, it’s helpful to be able to formulate a resilient story, one that holds up to scrutiny and allows us to make an impact. That story shouldn’t change based on who’s in charge. Which means that we don’t have to ask the head of the chemistry department why a reaction occurred. The theory works fine even if they’re not around. "
1476,Everybody else,"June 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/everybody-else/,"It’s natural to believe that everyone else is as confident, assured, long-term thinking and generous as you are on your very best day. But that’s unlikely. Because everyone else is probably not having their best day at the same time. Once we realize that the world around us is filled with people who are each wrestling with what we’re wrestling with (and more), compassion is a lot easier to find. "
1477,Should schools reward skills or talent?,"June 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/should-schools-reward-skills-or-talent/,"Talent is something you’re born with. Skill is something you earn. Skill comes from commitment and practice and self-discipline. The skill of earning skills is a lifelong advantage. Without a doubt, encouraging kids to leverage their talents is a skill. And yet… Who gets to be the center of the kids’ volleyball team–the tall kid or the one who practices the most diligently and brings the most teamwork to the game? Who gets an ‘A’ in math–the one who can breeze through the tests or the student who asks intelligent questions and challenges the assumptions? Who gets into a fancy college… You get the idea. Leaders talk about developing real skills and encouraging people to develop into their full potential, but too often, we take the short-term path of betting on raw talent instead. And of course, what looks like raw talent might not be. It could simply be our confusion about first impressions compared to the power of commitment, enrollment and persistence. "
1478,Voices vs. noise,"June 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/voices-vs-noise/,"If it’s not relevant, it’s noise. If it’s untrusted, unwelcome or selfish, it’s noise. But your contribution isn’t noise. Not for the right people, at the right time. The internet isn’t a mass medium. The voices online are not for everyone, it’s not the Super Bowl or M*A*S*H or even the nightly news. Nobody reaches much more than 1% of the audience on any given day. But… That tiny slice that does want to hear from you, that needs to hear from you, that would miss you if you don’t speak up–for that audience, you’re not noise. You’re essential. That’s why we built the Podcasting Workshop with Alex DiPalma. Enrollment launches today. Not because we need more podcasts. We don’t. Because we need your podcast. "
1479,What’s at the front of the line?,"June 22, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/whats-at-the-front-of-the-line/,"A study of behavior at breakfast buffets showed that the first item in the buffet was taken by 75% of the diners (even when the order of the items was reversed) and that two-thirds of all the food taken came from the first three items, regardless of how long the buffet is. This means that optimizing marketers usually put the things they most want to sell first. And that smart consumers benefit from adopting patience as they consider what’s on offer. Of course, this game theory applies to a lot more than food. "
1480,Picky vs difficult,"June 21, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/picky-vs-difficult/,"Picky people have consistent preferences and standards. Difficult people change their preferences frequently, and often in response to who is presenting to them or the mood they’re in. It’s pretty easy to figure out which makes for a better client or colleague. "
1481,“That’s a good idea”,"June 20, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/thats-a-good-idea/,"“And then what happens?” Repeat the second question 100 times. Because after every good idea, there are at least 100 steps of iteration, learning, adjustment, innovation and effort. Starting with the wrong idea is a waste of energy and time. But not committing to the 100 steps is a waste of a good idea. We put a lot of pressure on the idea to be perfect because it distracts us from the reality that the hundred steps after the idea are going to make all the difference. Nearly every organization you can point to is built around an idea that wasn’t original or perfect. The effort and investment and evolution made the difference. "
1482,Too long delayed,"June 19, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/too-long-delayed/,"Today is Juneteenth, a holiday that should be more widely observed. It doesn’t mark the date of Lincoln’s proclamation that freed enslaved people, nor does it occur on the day that the 13th amendment was passed. Both were overdue and urgent and important steps forward. Instead, it commemorates the day that a last group of enslaved people (outside of Galveston, TX) heard that they had been freed years earlier. Holidays are symbols. They can cause us to pause for celebration or grief, for togetherness or simply to smile. Holidays are worth recalling because they give us a chance to connect and recommit to an idea that matters to us. This is a holiday about freedom delayed. Change is hard, but delaying what’s right is toxic. Today we can remember just how much we have to do and realize the ability each of us has to see and alter the systems around us. Not simply today, but every single day. A chance to make things better. "
1483,A simple fork in the road,"June 18, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/a-simple-fork-in-the-road/,Some marketers want you to solve their problem. And some marketers want to solve your problem. Eagerly sending prospects to competitors who can help them better than you can is a fine symptom of where you stand on this choice. 
1484,The dominant culture,"June 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/the-dominant-culture/,"One of the great cartoons involves two goldfish in a tank talking to one another. One responds in surprise, “wait, there’s water?” When we don’t see the water, it’s a sign we’re benefitting from being part of the dominant culture. And since we’re not fish, we can learn to see the water and figure out how it is affecting us and the people around us. Visit a country where they don’t speak English and you’ll probably remind yourself all day that you speak English, something you didn’t have to think about last week. You’ll have to work overtime to understand and communicate. Back home, that stress disappears. Living within a dominant culture means being reminded of this all day, every day. When media images, policies and corporate standards tell someone that they are an outsider who needs to fit in in non-relevant ways, we’re establishing patterns of inequity and stress. We need to be clear about the job that needs to be done, the utility we’re seeking to create, but not erect irrelevant barriers, especially ones we can’t see without effort. Good systems are resilient and designed to benefit the people who use them. If the dominant culture makes it harder for people who don’t match the prevailing irrelevant metrics to contribute and thrive, it’s painful and wasteful and wrong. It’s becoming more and more clear to me how much ‘water’ there is in the world I live in. Much of it is needless and counterproductive. Unfair, too. It will take an enormous amount of effort and persistence to reduce it. I’m working hard to see it. Because it’s everywhere. "
1485,Creation/recognition,"June 16, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/creation-recognition/,"If you buy an old painting at a garage sale for $1,000 and then sell it for $25,000, was the change in value due to a change in the magic involved in the creation of the painting, or is it because the market now recognizes the painting for what it is (and was all along)? When Alta Vista refused to pay a million dollars to buy Google, was the problem in the value of what Google had, or in Alta Vista’s recognition of that value? There’s often a significant lag between the creation of something useful and when the market recognizes it. That’s an opportunity for speculators and investors, who can buy before the recognition happens. And it’s an opportunity or a trap for creators, who might get disheartened about the lack of applause and upside immediately after they’ve created something. When we look to the outside world for valuation and recognition, we might be confused about the intrinsic value of what we just created. Over time, those things may come into alignment, but that’s rare indeed. Creation plus persistence can lead to recognition. But creation without recognition is still a worthwhile endeavor. [Two new chances to level up, coming soon, by request: If you’re a graduating college senior or junior who has had plans disrupted by the worldwide pandemic, some good news. We’re going to offer our full-scholarship Emerging Leaders program again in August.

1486,Worthy adversaries and useful allies,"June 15, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/worthy-adversaries-and-useful-allies/,"Change happens more efficiently when we have both. Often, they’re not individuals. It could be a status quo or a system. In the early days of the Mac, Jobs chose Microsoft to be Apple’s adversary. But keeping the focus on them too long was an expensive and distracting mistake. An adversary focuses the mission, but it also gives agency and leverage to the opponent. It helps to have accomplices, leverage and a focus for the long haul as well. "
1487,Measuring systems,"June 14, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/measuring-systems/,"I tried to recharge the lithium battery that works with my drill. After twenty minutes, the charger said the battery had failed. Fortunately, I have a second battery. I put that into the charger and it also showed a failure. Neither battery had failed. The charger had. "
1488,Krulak’s law,"June 13, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/krulaks-law/,"The experience people have with your brand is in the hands of the person you pay the least. Act accordingly. (This involves training, trust, responsibility, leadership, dignity, authority, management and investment. It mostly means seeing the front-line people in your organization as priceless assets, not cheap cogs.) "
1489,Invisible insulation,"June 12, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/invisible-insulation/,"I didn’t spend any time yesterday worrying about being eaten by a grizzly bear. Or that I would get cholera from the water in my house. Over time, we’ve built layers of insulation between ourselves and the world. Shoes make it easier to walk around. We can put one foot in front of the other without constantly scanning for rocks or rusty nails. This invisible insulation is a form of civilization. And when it’s unevenly available, it becomes privilege. Just as invisible sometimes, but to make things better, we need to look at it and realize that it’s there and do something. If other people have shoes, it doesn’t make your shoes less functional. But if they don’t have shoes, then everything else they contribute (to you, to me, to everyone) is going to be different. We’ve done a shameful job in failing to offer insulation widely. Access to health care. Clean water. Good schools. Freedom of fear from state violence. And the benefit of the doubt, which is easy to overlook. Because it all adds up, every day, for generations. It’s almost impossible to make a list of all the things I didn’t have to worry about yesterday. We need to work overtime to make that true for more people. "
1490,Fill in the blanks,"June 11, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/fill-in-the-blanks/,"150 years ago, the periodic table of the elements was published. It’s a truly stunning achievement because it predates the electron microscope. It’s a bit like labeling all the colors in a box of crayons in a world with nothing but very dim light. Once the structure of the table was understood, its creator Dmitri Mendeleyev had a problem. Some of the elements that needed to be on it hadn’t been discovered yet. He knew that something needed to fill a slot, but he wasn’t exactly sure what. And so he left the square blank. Which inspired other scientists to go looking for what was needed to fill in that empty slot. Much of the innovation of the internet has worked this way. As well as developments in urban planning, civil society and small business as well. Once you see the grid, you can see the empty boxes. And then go fill them. HT Paul. "
1491,Which bridges?,"June 10, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/which-bridges/,"The head of the Long Island Parkway told Robert Moses, “Legislation can change, but it’s very hard to tear down a bridge once it’s up.” What he meant, what the notoriously racist Moses understood, was that once the systems are in place, they defend themselves. The roads of Boston have all outlasted the buildings. The buildings get razed and rebuilt, but the byways and thoroughfares remain, because the system demands far more effort to change than the road ever did to get built in the first place. The irony of the word ‘bridge’ in this sentence is profound. Because when we say bridge, we usually mean a connection, or a way to move forward. And while these metaphorical bridges are far more fragile than the stuff Moses built, they’re worth building too. Because one way to change systems is to start building connections and tunnels and yes, bridges, that make the old ones shift.   "
1492,Getting what the customers asked for,"June 9, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/getting-what-we-asked-for/,"Why is there so much short-term hustle? Because that’s what we buy. Why is there so much negative campaigning? Because that’s what changes our actions. Why is social media filled with manipulation and vanity? Because that’s what we click on. We buy foods that are engineered to make us fat and we watch shows that are designed to numb us instead of inspire. Not all of us, not all the time. It’s not our fault alone. The gears in the system are too often turned by short-term profiteers and people who seek to manipulate us for their own ends. They need to own the responsibility for their selfishness and not blame us for it. Leadership requires a commitment to make things better. Don’t blame the market. But the system is extraordinarily sensitive to what we click, what we buy and what we talk about. If we can do the difficult and heroic work of acting differently, the system can tell. As soon as we shift to long-term thinking, the market will too. The same thing can happen to our culture if we can shift our timeframe and our focus. "
1493,Without ambiguity: Black Lives Matter,"June 8, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/without-ambiguity-black-lives-matter/,"This isn’t a current events blog. It might be inspired by them, but I try to write something every day that’s worth reading in a month or a year. And so, I choose to ignore the specifics of breaking news, because breaking news keeps changing. Sometimes, though, ambiguity isn’t called for. Sometimes, it’s misunderstood. In my town and my city and my country, we’re coming to grips with issues that have been simmering for far too long. And you’ve certainly heard from people with clear and actionable things about what you can do right now, and about their commitment going forward. I don’t want to confuse anyone about my take on it. Avoiding breaking news is a privilege that I have, because there’s insulation for me. Black Lives Matter. The systemic, cruel and depersonalizing history of Black subjugation in my country has and continues to be a crime against humanity. It’s based on a desire to maintain power and false assumptions about how the world works and how it can work. It’s been amplified by systems that were often put in place with mal-intent, or sometimes simply because they felt expedient. It’s painful to look at and far more painful to be part of or to admit that exists in the things that we build. We can’t permit the murder of people because of the color of their skin. Institutional racism is real, it’s often invisible, and it’s pernicious. And White Supremacy is a loaded term precisely because the systems and their terrible effects are very real, widespread and run deep. The benefit of the doubt is powerful indeed, and that benefit has helped me and people like me for generations. I’m ashamed of how we got here, and want to more powerfully contribute and model how we can get better, together. It doesn’t matter how many blog posts about justice I write, or how clear I try to be about the power of diversity in our organizations. Not if I’m leaving doubt about the scale and enormity of the suffering that people feel, not just themselves, but for their parents before them and for the kids that will follow them. It’s easier to look away and to decide that this is a problem for someone else. It’s actually a problem for all of us. And problems have solutions and problems are uncomfortable. "
1494,Don’t give up,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/dont-give-up/,"When is it time to give up, to stop trying, to settle for what is? Five years ago, when I founded the altMBA, I had no idea what 2020 would be like. I don’t think anyone could have described the confluence of events, the unevenly distributed tragedy of our times, the injustice, the hurt and the illnesses as well. The despair that’s around us is real, and it has exposed many of the fault lines we’ve been papering over. Leadership is needed. People, regardless of where they are or what they do, who can help those they work with move forward. What else to do but to seek to make things better? Start where you are and do everything you can. Today, the hard work of leading, asserting, connecting and contributing seems incredibly difficult. But it’s more urgently needed than ever. Right here and right now. When we ran the first session of our thirty-day virtual workshop, it was something that had never been done before. We had to explain what Zoom was, had to describe a future where online learning was not only possible, but could be transformative, and had to invent a whole new way for people to connect and learn with each other. But, truthfully, we had no idea. It was an experiment, and the 100 people who took that first session knew that, and were eager to give it a try. We just finished our fortieth session. We’ve had graduates from 16 to 80 years of age. In 77 countries. Leaders from some of the biggest companies in the world as well as people who run non-profits, play professional sports or paint. Because making things better isn’t about what you look like or where you work. Making things better is an attitude. The attitude of possibility and the posture of generosity. And then making the decision to own your learning. Don’t stop speaking up, don’t stop leading, don’t stop learning. Don’t stop seeking justice. We can’t give up. Today is our five-year anniversary. 40 sessions, hundreds of coaches, thousands of alumni. And we keep showing up because you keep showing up. You do it with grace and kindness and confidence, even when the world is turned upside down. If you’re suffering from a hardship right now, know that we’re thinking of you. It’s not a good time for us to celebrate our anniversary. It’s difficult to even share the news. So many people in our community and on our team are going through tough times right now, experiencing a world that they never asked for or expected. The best instinct I have in moments like these is to help people choose to lead. To do even better work on the projects you care about. To show up and to lean in and to contribute. In whatever way you can. I hope you’ll check out the materials and faqs we’ve posted here. The final deadline to apply for the upcoming July session is tomorrow. "
1495,Listening is difficult,"June 7, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/listening-is-difficult/,"Hearing happens when we’re able to recognize a sound. Listening happens when we put in the effort to understand what it means. It not only requires focus, but it also requires a commitment to encountering the experience, intent and emotion behind the words. And that commitment can be scary. Because if we’re exposed to that emotion and those ideas, we discover things we might be avoiding. "
1496,The truth about rubylith,"June 6, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/the-truth-about-rubylith/,"Before desktop publishing, the best way to layout a complicated image for printing was to cut a rubylith. Rubylith is a translucent sheet of thin plastic. A craftsperson would carefully cut the ruby, knowing that the parts it covered would reflect the light when the plate was created. It was difficult and painstaking work. That’s all obsolete now. An hour of cutting a ruby is replaced by two clicks in Illustrator. Here’s the truth: images cut by hand with a rubylith weren’t better. They were simply the best available option. As soon as technology allowed people to skip this step, many of them did. The others fought hard, pointing out that their craft was hard-won and that the old way was the better way. Defending your particular rubylith skill is not really a winning strategy. Because everyone else doesn’t care. Defending better, on the other hand, is truly important. "
1497,Average is not the same as typical,"June 5, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/average-is-not-the-same-as-typical/,"We know that the median is often not the same as the mean, but in describing a population, it also pays to differentiate between the average person and a typical one. For example: The average dog owner spends $500 a year on dog food. But the typical dog pamperer spends $5,000 a year (all numbers invented). The reason the numbers are different is that the samples are different. We chop off the outliers in the second set, homing in on the kind of person we’re talking about. This is really useful, because it enables us to be clear about the smallest viable audience. “Our typical customer” is a more accurate and useful way to start a sentence than, “the average person.” Because typical implies intent. “The person we are seeking to serve does this…” "
1498,Maybe everyone else isn’t faking it,"June 4, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/maybe-everyone-else-isnt-faking-it/,"Think about your most deeply-held beliefs. It’s entirely possible that someone who disagrees with you feels just as deeply. Consider your chronic aches, your devastating pain, your persistent allergy–it’s possible someone else has their own version of this, but different. And perhaps, your dreams and desires, the ones that keep you up at night, are similar (but different) from the person sitting right next to you. They’re not making it up. It’s as real as you are. "
1499,Stuck on enormity,"June 3, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/stuck-on-enormity/,"When a problem appears too large, too intractable and too unspeakable to deal with, it’s easy to give up. There never seems to be enough time, enough resources or enough money to make the big problems go away. Perhaps we can start with a very small part of it. One person, one opportunity, one connection. Drip by drip, with commitment. Those are the two hard parts. The insight to do it drip by drip and the persistence to commit to it. "
1500,I can’t imagine,"June 2, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/i-cant-imagine/,"There’s just no way to be sure what it feels like. Other people, people in our lives or out of it, people who look like us or don’t. Your mileage will vary, your experience will be different. Some started with a huge head start, some with a disadvantage they couldn’t possibly deserve. Of course, the “I” is really we. No matter who we are, we can’t truly know what it feels like for someone else. It may be that we can’t imagine what it’s like to be the victim of systemic distrust and profiling. Or what it’s like to worry about putting food on this table for that family. Or what it’s like to be fighting a chronic illness or being unjustly accused of a crime. We can try. We assume it’s just like what happened to us, but slightly different. We can realize that tragedy is unevenly distributed and in constant rotation, but it’s never going to be the same. But just because we can’t imagine–it doesn’t mean we can’t care. We can refuse to magnify our differences and focus on maximizing possibility, justice and connection instead. To take action and to dig in. The leverage we have to see, to speak up and to create long-term change is a difficult weight to carry. Because if we can do something to make things more just, that means that we must. I wish I was better at it. I wish it were easier. We’ll make things better by seeing, by speaking, by doing the work. Even if it’s uncomfortable, especially when it is. "
1501,"Justice and dignity, too often in short supply","June 1, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/justice-and-dignity-too-often-in-short-supply/,"[From two years ago, even more relevant right now] You will never regret offering dignity to others. We rarely get into trouble because we overdo our sense of justice and fairness. Not just us, but where we work, the others we influence. Organizations and governments are nothing but people, and every day we get a chance to become better versions of ourselves. And yet… in the moments when we think no one is looking, when the stakes are high, we often forget. It’s worth remembering that justice and dignity aren’t only offered on behalf of others. Offering people the chance to be treated the way we’d like to be treated benefits us too. It goes around. The false scarcity is this: we believe that shutting out others, keeping them out of our orbit, our country, our competitive space—that this somehow makes things more easier for us. And this used to be true. When there are 10 jobs for dockworkers, having 30 dockworkers in the hall doesn’t make it better for anyone but the bosses. But today, value isn’t created by filling a slot, it’s created by connection. By the combinations created by people. By the magic that comes from diversity of opinion, background and motivation. Connection leads to ideas, to solutions, to breakthroughs. The false scarcity stated as, “I don’t have enough, you can’t have any,” is more truthfully, “together, we can create something better.” We know it’s the right thing to do. It’s also the smart thing. "
1502,Consider a gap year,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/06/consider-a-gap-year/,"Millions of college-age students have to make a difficult decision soon. Spending all that money and time has always been a significant choice, but now it’s more fraught. The accredited institutions that are now suddenly offering students an online education simply haven’t committed the time or effort to actually be good at it. They’re offering something without effectiveness, polish or insight. The alternative is a gap year. Not just for college students, but for high school students and even adults. The gap year has a terrible name. It implies that the year is somehow wasted, that it’s a gap snuck in between the stuff that you’re supposed to be doing. But of course, it’s not that at all. Living is what we’re supposed to be doing. Contributing. Learning. Figuring out how to make things better. The stuff we’re not doing when we’re simply complying–that’s the point. Our compliance years are the gap. And we should commit our time with intention. If you can afford it, this is a powerful moment to invest in the next chapter of who you are and what you will become. For an adult, that’s an expensive commitment. To walk away from your freelance path or your job search to dig in to become the leader and connector and expert you’ve always hoped to become. But for a student, it’s actually a bargain. It’s a chance to step off the carousel of conformity and lockstep obedience and actually commit to a path of your own choosing. Keep your tuition money and put it to work for you, not for some football team. A month, a semester, or an entire year. A chance to create a change, to make an impact, to cause a shift in your posture that you’ll have forever. We’ve become ever more suspicious of the bargain that the industrial world has been offering: compliance in exchange for stability. The alternative is to own your path and to do the incredibly difficult work of choosing with intent and then sticking with it. The discomfort people feel when they consider a gap year is precisely why we ought to spend more time considering it. "
1503,Meeting spec (doing the minimum),"May 31, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/meeting-spec-doing-the-minimum/,"Two ways of saying the same thing. If the bridge needs to hold 20,000 pound vehicles, the client isn’t interested in paying extra for you to build it to hold 30,000 pound vehicles. The spec is clear–15,000 is unacceptable, and 30,000 isn’t worth a penny extra in steel, concrete or pilings. But when we’re bringing our human skills to the work, the spec for a job might state that we need to sit at the customer service counter from 9 to 5, but because “be really nice to people,” is hard to quantify it can feel like an extra if we’re seeking to do as little as possible. Why do extra? After all, the industrial system has squeezed everything it can out of front-line workers. It has taken without offering much in return, stripping people of dignity and respect and treating them like cogs. But acting like a cog in return is hardly a useful form of revenge. Showing up with more than the minimum might turn the job into more than a job. When we show up because we can, when we’re extending ourselves as a matter of choice, we create space. The space to own the work, to personalize it, and to turn it into more than getting by. The current crisis is a vivid reminder of how empty a job focused on getting by really is. Because getting by is a lousy way to spend our days. Playwrights, painters and committed professionals don’t ask, “how little can I get away with?” They view the work as a chance to make a difference instead. Doing work we’re proud of is a fine alternative to being seen as less than human. And spending our days doing as much human work as we can is far more appealing than hoping to do as little as possible. "
1504,Applying effort,"May 30, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/applying-effort/,"How will you spend your resources? If you want to open a can of tomato juice, you can squeeze the sides of the can as hard as you can, for as long as you can, but it’s unlikely to open. You can also focus all of your energy on a very tiny point and perhaps, with the right tools, make a small puncture. But it won’t help you get the juice out. What you’ll need is a can opener, focusing your force at the right sized spot with the right pressure. The same is true for the way we bring an idea to the world. One thing you could do is spam a billion people, once. Another is to identify a single individual and spend a year bringing this person just the right message, with relentless frequency. You’re probably better off with something in between. We can allocate our resources into a portfolio. Even if we don’t know precisely where to put the effort, a focus on the right categories pays off. Too often, we aim too wide (it feels more deniable). And sometimes, more rarely, we aim too narrowly. Every day, we use our resources to make change happen. Which means that every day we get to choose. "
1505,Leaky roofs,"May 29, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/leaky-roofs/,"In many situations, a leaky roof is worse than no roof at all. If there’s no roof, we’re not surprised or disappointed if we get hit with some raindrops. But a roof that leaks has raised expectations and then failed to meet them. Promising us a roof and then breaking that promise might be worse than no roof at all. "
1506,Three paths for a soloist,"May 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/three-paths-for-a-soloist/,"Consider one of three paths. Which works for you? It’s difficult to see how you can do all three at the same time for the same kind of client. All three choices are valid, any could work for you, but it’s worth choosing. "
1507,Dancing with tools,"May 27, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/dancing-with-tech/,"How good are you at Google Sheets? Can you write a query? A filter? Do you know how to install add-on tools to trim extra cells or create a mail merge? If you wanted to learn those things, do you know how to find out how? It’s an interesting litmus test. Sheets is free. It’s not particularly difficult to use. You can explore it in private, with no fear of screwing up. And it’s widely applicable to just about any career or community work you might choose to do. The teenager across the street is far better off teaching herself Sheets than she is doing whatever busywork they’re handing her during the day. If you get good at a type of technology, you’ll find yourself using it often. On the other hand, if you decide that you’re somehow untalented at it (which is nonsense) or don’t take the time, then you’ll have sacrificed leverage and confidence that were offered to you. Of course, it’s not just Sheets, or the web, or even computers. It’s a posture of possibility when it comes to the tools we’re able to use. We can ignore the tools that we have access to. We can fear them. We can understand them. (And, after we understand them, we’re able to hire someone else to use them on our behalf.) We can even master them. "
1508,Your defining moment,"May 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/your-defining-moment/,"It’s easy to wait for it. The movies have taught us that when the music swells and the chips are down, that’s when leaders arrive and when heroes are made. It turns out, that’s not how it works. Our work is what happens in all the moments. Leadership doesn’t simply appear when the script announces it does: it is the hard work of showing up when we’re not expected to, of seeing what’s possible when few are willing to believe. Your defining moment is whenever you decide it is, and you get a new chance to lead every day. Two months ago, we ran our first session of Rising Talent, a special session of the altMBA by and for emerging leaders at Fortune 500 companies. Our month-long sprint connected senior leaders from SAP, Starbucks, Dunkin’ Brands, Citi, General Mills, Lululemon, NBA, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Adobe, Audible, Barclays, Chipotle, Delta, Trane Technologies, Frost Bank, Kellogg Company, Kraft Heinz, MetLife, Qualcomm, Shopify, Slack and Warby Parker. Even though the world was already turning upside down, this extraordinary cohort showed up and did the work, even as they were contributing at a high level at their day jobs. The results reinforced what we’ve been saying at the altMBA for the last five years. Possibility is where you find it. We each have more to offer than the world expects. And growth is something we’re capable of, as soon as we’re committed to seeing what we can contribute. The secret of our workshops is the level of commitment that our students bring. Even in times of turmoil. Enrollment opens the door to action instead of compliance. Our current worldwide tragedy is a slog, but it will have another side. And the organizations that thrive will be the ones that don’t rely on top-down management to go forward. It’s peer-to-peer leadership and innovation that produces resilience, and leadership that turns any moment into a moment where we can make things better. Ishita Gupta has written more about the Rising Talent altMBA here. "
1509,Craftspeople and time,"May 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/craftspeople-and-time/,"Tell us when you’re going to finish. Tell us if you fall behind. Don’t make us ask. It’s difficult for a small organization or a dedicated craftsperson to run an operation as punctually as a large bureaucracy. After all, the bureaucracy exists mainly to be sure that deadlines are honored and variances are not exceeded. Your customers are aware of this. It’s one reason that they chose you–because you’re doing the work yourself, you’re a person, not an industry. Don’t hide this unless you can hide it completely. It’s amazing how much slack people will give you if you’re proactive about what you see and what you know. No need to make promises you can’t keep, and no need to hide from the promises you’ve made. We’re buying the process from you, not just what you’re making. "
1510,A small business isn’t simply a little version of a big business,"May 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/a-small-business-isnt-simply-a-little-version-of-a-big-business/,"Fewer meetings, fewer resources, fewer constraints. The biggest advantage that a small business has is that the owner can look customers in the eye. And vice versa. Instead of policies, groupthink and leverage, the way forward for a small business might be the very thing that fueled you in the start: find out what people need and help them get it. Right away. It’s never been easy to be a small business and it’s even more difficult right now. But resilience and flexibility go together. The first rule remains: figure out what people need and bring it to them. "
1511,A community of practice,"May 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/a-community-of-practice/,"Learning happens mostly outside the classroom. Learning is the difficult work of experiencing incompetence on our way to mastery. And learning opens the door to identity. When someone says, “I am a nurse”, they’ve taken their learning and certification, combined it with their livelihood and announced it as their identity. And this all happens from community. The standards and practices, the support, the status roles. People like us do things like this. If you’re a Maine wooden-boat builder, you do things a certain way. The ocean is the same water that a boat builder in Manila would put their boat on, but the boat is different because the community is different. Even the way we think about formal education, accreditation and contribution is driven by the community of practice we are part of. Communities have often been an accident of birth. Built by geography and parentage, you established your identity and your learning long before you went to school. Now, of course, this is changing. Communities of practice have been written about for decades, but they’re being transformed and amplified by the persistent and permeable nature of the net. When we surround ourselves with a community, it’s inevitable that it changes our identity. Too often, we choose our community by default. The social network sucks us in, or we’re picked for a certain dodgeball team or cadre at school. We have the chance, though, to do it with intention instead. I’ve come to realize that the circles that we’re building at Akimbo are in fact communities of practice. A powerful, productive identity that people can choose to seek out. Click here to see a preview our next one–for people who are ready to write. And here’s a bonus video, a short rant for the Akimbo podcast that I filmed last summer.

1512,Waiting and worrying,"May 22, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/waiting-and-worrying/,"It’s easy for us to choose to worry. The world is upside down, the slog continues, a tragedy unevenly but widely distributed. Worry takes a lot of effort. And worry, unlike focus, learning or action, accomplishes nothing of value. And, at the same time, due to the time-horizon of the pandemic, it’s also tempting for us to simply wait. To wait for things to get back to normal. But all the time we’re spending waiting (for a normal that is unlikely to be just like it was) is time we’re not spending learning, leading and connecting. Waiting is, sort of by definition, a waste of time. But time is scarce, so wasting it is a shameful act. If we decided to simply reduce our waiting and worrying allocation by 50%, just imagine how much we could discover, how many skills we could learn, how dramatically attitudes could shift. We can still wait (even though time will pass either way). And we can still worry (even though it doesn’t do any good). But perhaps we can figure out how to do it less. "
1513,Smart-adjacent,"May 21, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/smart-adjacent/,"You may have seen the miracle sudoku video that spread this week–a good sort of virus, one based on an idea. About half a million people have watched Simon spend nearly half an hour solving a puzzle. No anger, no violence, no innuendo. Merely applied thinking about numbers. How did it spread? There are millions of people who aren’t doing important medical research, creating (or solving) fascinating puzzles or writing breakthrough Broadway shows–but who are eager to find and amplify these ideas. Culture is created by these amplifiers. “People like us talk about things like this.” A good idea isn’t worth much if it doesn’t reach people who can benefit from it. Instead of the quack doctor who goes on TV in a craven attempt to be famous at any cost, they’re willing to be the patient, thoughtful doctor who reads the research and shares useful information, even if the ratings aren’t as high. This is the long-term influencer who earns the trust of a small circle of people. Mostly, it’s people who care enough to model the behavior they’d like to see from those around them. Three days ago, Google once again used its monopoly power and opaque methods to shut down a much-beloved podcast app for ridiculous reasons. Only the outcry from smart-adjacent voices got them to back down. We get what we talk about and we talk about what we pay attention to. Or consider this 14-minute documentary about how Harley-Davidson has relentlessly made bad decisions in serving its customers. Nearly a million people have watched it (that’s as many as a typical cable TV show) because people who didn’t make it cared enough to spread it. We keep seeing proof that cable news and other media don’t simply report the culture, they create it. Each of us now has our own microphone and network, and we get to decide what to program and what to consume. It turns out that spreading the news about things that are smart is, in itself, smart. "
1514,“I’ve dealt with this before”,"May 20, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/ive-dealt-with-this-before/,"There’s a huge gulf between earned expertise and strong opinion. Knowing what others who have come before have done (and having successfully done it yourself) is demonstrably more effective than simply acting as if your opinion matters. Whether you’re dealing a lawsuit, cancer or a sous vide machine, you’re better off talking with someone who has earned their experience. There’s a reason that there are very few loud amateur locksmiths. Either the lock opens or it doesn’t. Untrained voices tend to reserve their work for endeavors in which the results are either difficult to measure or happen far in the future. "
1515,Pique blindness,"May 19, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/pique-blindness/,"If you can study something behavioral on college students, you can bet it gets studied a lot. It’s easy and cheap to run these sorts of tests. Which is how we came to understand the power of pique and the risk of habituation. It turns out that if you see something over and over again, you start to ignore it. And so marketers of all stripes work to pique your interest by making funky little adjustments. They’ll change the speed limit to 57, or hang a sign upside down. In one study, they found that a scientist dressed as a panhandler raised more money when he asked for 37 cents instead of a quarter. (No word about what happens when a panhandler dresses like a scientist.) And so, selfish marketers will put ʇuǝƃɹn in the subject line of an email that couldn’t be less urgent… This leads to pique blindness. Just as bright white snow can overwhelm our retina so we can’t see very well, all of this pique to fight habituation has a downside. It’s creating a culture of hustle and noise that only gets worse. Because then people start using pique blindness as an excuse for ever more pique. One of the real dangers of pique blindness is that we’ll only end up seeing drama, breaking news and the crisis of the moment. The first thing we need to do is not bite the hook. Refuse to reward anyone or anything that uses pique to get your attention. Turn up the filters and walk away. The important stuff will get through even if we filter out some of the urgent. Even more important: as Joni said, “you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone.” Maybe what we need to do is invest daily effort in creating pique around the good things, the important things, the things we treasure. It could be as simple as breaking our pattern, coming up with a new way to walk the dog or greet a friend… It might involve breaking a habit in which a delight has become nothing much more than a comfort. Everyone gets 24 hours of fresh attention, refilled daily. But if we continue to abuse it, we won’t be able to see with fresh eyes and appreciate what’s been there all along. HT to Simon Sinek for the pique. "
1516,Alternatives to perfect,"May 18, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/alternatives-to-perfect/,"“If I can’t make it perfect, is it okay if I try to make it better?” When a project doesn’t come out precisely the way we hoped, when customer service isn’t 100%, when the reality doesn’t match the dream, then what? One option is to embrace your failure. To have your tantrum, to become bereft, to wallow in how unfair the world is. No sense messing up a perfect moment of imperfection. The other option is to put some effort into making an imperfect situation a little less imperfect. Perhaps, with some distance, it might even be a lot less imperfect, or even better than you were hoping for in the first place. Imperfect is a chance for contribution, connection and improvisation. It’s a chance to see the humanity behind the moment you were spending so much energy creating. The alternative to perfect might be better.   [A deadline: tomorrow is the Early Decision deadline for the summer session of the altMBA. If you’ve been waiting to see what you’re capable of, today’s a great day to begin. In a world turned upside down, if you have the chance to level up and contribute, I hope you’ll see what’s possible.] "
1517,But what if it works?,"May 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/but-what-if-it-works-3/,"The difference between science and conspiracy theory/superstition is simple: Good science leads to useful insights. And good science is the cure for bad science. On the other hand, there are no good conspiracy theories, because they are attractive precisely because they’re unproven, imprecise and non-falsifiable. They’re not actually theories at all. They use confusion to create a sense of comfort and control when it’s in short supply. It’s almost impossible to tell a good conspiracy theory from a bad one, hence they don’t work as theories. And good conspiracy theories don’t lead to useful insights, nor do they help drive out the bad conspiracy theories. You can’t productively question someone’s superstition, because it never really thought it was an actual explanation of how the world is. A good scientist has a theory and she’s eager to be proven wrong, so she can make better science. And delighted to be proven right, because she now has a useful insight. Reality doesn’t care whether or not we believe in it, but it’s more useful for all of us when we understand it. "
1518,Bridges and tunnels,"May 16, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/bridges-and-tunnels/,"Robert Moses, the road builder, understood that that building tunnels takes just a little longer and costs just a little bit more. And it turns out that bridges are monuments and create glory for those that find the resources to build them, there in the sky, for all to see. Those are the two reasons why we end up with more bridges than tunnels. (Same is true with work culture and society at large). But tunnels allow all sorts of productivity without calling attention to themselves or those that build them. A tunnel creates progress without changing the landscape. Many times, it’s an elegant solution to the problem for someone with the guts and fortitude to build one. Less glory, more upside. [Moses made consistent errors in his pursuit of glory, just as he undermined thriving communities, particularly those that involved people of color. It was a shameful use of power at the expense of people.] "
1519,Cost and value,"May 15, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/cost-and-value/,"One of my books took more than a year to write, ten hours a day. Another took three weeks. Both sell for the same price. The quicker one outsold the other 20 to 1. A $200 bottle of wine costs almost exactly as much to make as a $35 bottle of wine. The cost of something is largely irrelevant, people are paying attention to its value. Your customers don’t care what it took for you to make something. They care about what it does for them. "
1520,The moral imagination,"May 14, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/the-moral-imagination/,"What do you dream of? We’ve worked overtime to create a sports imagination. Kids dream of dunking a basketball or scoring the winning goal at the World Cup. That’s a pretty new phenomenon. Instant replay, endorsement deals and trading cards make it easy to imagine. We’ve certainly established a profit imagination. Everywhere we turn, the p&l mindset isn’t far away. Add a zero. That’s winning. And there’s a health imagination as well. The ideal of fitness and well-being, the very nature of an immune system that we’re supposed to support. But what about the moral imagination? Visualizing what’s possible. Deciding to do something about it. Wondering (to ourselves and then to the world, “how can I make this better?”) Not because it’s our job or because we’ll win a prize. Simply because we can. We can start where we are and we can make things better.   [PS Acumen has transformed Jacqueline Novogratz’ new book into an online course about moral imagination and our ability to make change happen.

Nobody likes to be hustled. But if you’re hoping to contribute, particularly if it makes you feel a little uncomfortable, then go ahead. It’s probably not too soon. Or never too late.

And why do we choose to take the actions we take? How does that narrative change the way we’ll deal with tomorrow? Lots of things can trigger a change–some local, some global. But once a change occurs, the ripples that spread are almost always in the form of a story. It’s a story that causes us to change our minds, to take action and to tell the others. We don’t know what that book or that project is like until we experience it, but we have to decide now, so we tell ourselves a story. We must make a decision about how to engage with a stranger before we get to know them, and we do that by telling ourselves a story as well. It’s on us to find, spread and ultimately create better stories. We aren’t passive consumers, dandelions in the wind. We’re active agents in what the people around us believe and what they do. We’re relaunching the Story Skills Workshop today. Because it works. Because we need better stories. Because a story will grow your practice, expand your organization and help your neighbors too.

Mass marketing changed that. Now, the goal was to flip the culture, all at once. Hit records, hit TV shows, products on the end cap at Target and national TV ads to support it all. With few exceptions, that’s being replaced by a return to clusters. The cluster might be geographic (they eat different potato chips in Tucson than they do in Milwaukee) but they’re much more likely to be psychographic instead. What a group of people believe, who they connect with, what they hope for… The minimal viable audience concept requires that you find your cluster and overwhelm them with delight. Choose the right cluster, show up with the right permission and sufficient magic and generosity and the idea will spread. We’re all connected, but the future is local. "

1525,Seeing dominance and affiliation in politics,"May 9, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/understanding-dominance-and-affiliation-in-politics/,"In my most recent book, I helped people see how we’re always tracking status roles in the way we make decisions. Who’s up and who’s down? What does this interaction or this purchase do to maintain or change my role? It comes down to “who eats lunch first” and the instinct has been around since the savannah. One place we see this really clearly is in world politics. Some candidates personify affiliation (who is with me/how are we working together) while others depend on dominance to gain and exert power (who am I defeating). Jimmy Carter was an affiliation president. It was important to him to be in sync and to build alliances while diminishing conflict. Winston Churchhill was primarily a dominator, and using that posture, he built alliances that saved the UK in World War II. Likability isn’t always related to this choice of dominance vs affiliation, but it’s often more difficult for a dominator to be seen as likable at the same time. In many settings, dominance can be seen as bluster (if it’s on the surface only) or bullying (when applied in settings of unequal power). In a world of fast media cycles, we see again, again and again the easy optics of domination. Professional wrestling is a sport of nothing but dominance–it’s a theater of status. And as we strip away the long-term from discussions of politics, Twitter and the rest of the chattersphere has created a similar theatre for politics. In the short run, this is satisfying, because people get to feel as though their avatar, the leader who represents them, is moving up, which of course means that they’re moving up as well. Even without a pandemic, the game theory of this short-term measure is flawed. Because in sports, not every team makes it to the finals, and not every wrestler becomes the world champ. And in politics, the repercussions of non-cooperation can last for generations. Bluster is hard to maintain in places where performance is easy to measure. And so it tends to move to places where it’s not as easy to measure output. "
1526,And when does it get boring?,"May 8, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/and-when-does-it-get-boring/,"Almost no one who takes an intro to economics course becomes an economist. One reason might be that within a few days of starting the class, it becomes abstract, formula-based and dull. The same ennui kicks in for having to memorize things in chemistry or world history. We don’t have these fields because we need to employ professors. We have them because they give us a chance to understand and to figure things out. Once you are enrolled in the journey of discovery, decoding a formula or engaging with a taxonomy becomes urgent, not merely an assigned task. Because a testing regime is in place, particularly now when so many other tropes in the education-industrial complex are disrupted, the textbook authors and administrators work together to skip the ‘fluff’ and go straight to the stuff that’s easy to test. That’s not how passion is discovered or nurtured. No one becomes a baseball fan because they read the baseball textbook and did well on the baseball test. The same goes for people who devote their lives to cooking, leading or healthcare. These are journeys that require emotional enrollment, not a good test score. We need to stop holding the future hostage in exchange for an exam. Here’s my TEDx talk on the topic. You can read the free ebook here.    PS the Story Skills Workshop relaunches on May 12. Check out what people had to say right here. "
1527,The downside of authority,"May 7, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/the-downside-of-authority/,"A friend writes, “it is so frustrating not being able to control people.” Of course, there’s a flipside. If you could control people, just imagine how heavy that responsibility would weigh on you. Freedom of choice brings with it the realization that our choices belong to us. One is the choice to lead. The other is the choice to follow. If we make the choice to lead, we need to be prepared to own the consequences of our leadership, even (or especially) if we can’t actually control what others do. "
1528,A situation vs a slog,"May 6, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/vs-a-slog/,"“Wake me when it’s over,” is a natural instinct during a short-term interruption in our usual pattern. A crisis is there to be managed or waited out. The goal of each day is to simply get through it. Until things are back to normal. But sometimes we’re dealing with a slog. Where the number of days is not small enough to simply throw them away. In a slog, the pattern of only getting by undervalues our days and diminishes our ability to contribute. During a slog, we have a chance to accept a new normal, even if it’s temporary, and to figure out how to make something of it. You don’t have to wish for it, but it’s here. There’s very little value in spending our time nostalgic for normal. When we get to the other side of the slog and look back, what will we have contributed, learned and created? "
1529,Books for spring,"May 5, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/books-for-spring/,"Today, the new book from Jacqueline Novogratz arrives. Manifesto for a Moral Revolution is brave, personal and audacious. This is an important book, now more than ever. Please share this with people you care about. Retail truth-speaker Steve Dennis debuts with a definitive book about the future of stores. Remarkable Retail is prescient and practical. Eliot Peper has a new book this month. Veil is about collapse, redemption and heroes. As always, his near-future science fiction will stick with you. Economics in Two Lessons is a thoughtful rebuttal of most of what we think we know about how markets work. I read The Quantum Thief a few months ago, and it’s still resonating with me. Far-flung science fiction, much more relevant than the space opera cover gives it credit for. It’s a great audiobook if that’s your thing. This is the 20th anniversary of The Art of Possibility, the book I recommend more than any other. The audiobook is terrific as well. Cookbooks from Alison Roman (easy crowd pleasers) and Chad Robertson (patient bread). Fanocracy is a handbook and guide for anyone seeking to build a tribal brand in our modern media culture. And I loved Ted Chiang’s Exhalation, a book of short stories. Binge-reading might be the new binge-watching. "
1530,What kind of org?,"May 4, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/what-kind-of-org/,"Maybe you work with an organization. They have systems and charts and boxes. But the very nature of an organization is that someone developed it, figured it out and has to approve its changes. After all, it’s organized. Perhaps you work with an organism instead. An organism constantly changes. The cells develop, die and are replaced. It adapts to the current environment or goes away. If you engage with a culture, if you’re part of an organism, you’ll do better understanding the system that it lives in. The org chart is insufficient. And of course, organisms tend to be more resilient than organizations. "
1531,Forward,"May 3, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/forward/,"Our experience of time always goes in one direction. It might seem to speed up or slow down, but entropy and the outside world conspire to keep things moving from yesterday to tomorrow. Given that nothing is ever going to be the same, and that backwards isn’t an option, our only choice is forward. That’s always been true. As soon as we encounter something, anything, it will never be as it was. Fortunately, we have a chance to make things better. Every day. "
1532,"More information is a competitive advantage, but it’s not enough","May 2, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/more-information-as-a-competitive-advantage/,"Without a doubt, today’s average jazz producer has heard more jazz than any jazz producer working in 1960. And today’s VC has seen more business plans than her predecessor forty years ago. Today’s journalist has read more stories, as well. The same is true for doctors, editors and critics. In any endeavor where there’s a reason to care about more information, more information is available. A lot more. It’s impossible to have read all the books, seen all the movies, heard all the songs. Domain knowledge is required, but domain knowledge is no longer a sufficient competitive advantage, because it’s widespread. After you do the reading, then what are you going to do? Good judgment and a thoughtful point of view are now scarce assets worth seeking out. What have you done with what you’ve learned? "
1533,Reality as an organizing principle,"May 1, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/05/reality-as-an-organizing-principle/,"Mathematicians don’t need to check in with the head of math to find out what the talking points about fractions are this week. That’s because fractions are fractions. Anyone can choose to do the math, and everyone will find the same truth. Most of the progress in our culture of the last 200 years has come from using truth as a force for forward motion. Centralized proclamations are not nearly as resilient or effective as the work of countless individuals, aligned in their intention, engaging with the world. We amplified this organizing principle when we began reporting on progress. If you’re able to encounter not just local truth but the reality as experienced by many others, collated honestly, then progress moves forward exponentially faster. Show your work. One of the dangers of our wide-open media culture of the last ten years has been that the signals aren’t getting through the noise. Loud voices are drowning out useful ones. It’s difficult to determine, sometimes, who is accurately collating and correlating experience and reality and who is simply making stuff up as a way to distract us, to cause confusion and to gain influence. I’m betting that in the long run, reality wins out. That the practical resilience that comes from experimentation produces more effective forward motion. In the words attributed to Galileo, “Eppur si muove.” It pays to curate the incoming, to ignore the noise and to engage with voices who are willing to show their work. "
1534,Today’s special,"April 30, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/todays-special/," I just noticed something about the ubiquitous sign at every diner. On one hand, it means, “the special that was assigned to today.” It’s possessive. But on the other hand, it could simply mean, “today is special.” Because both are true. Plan accordingly. "
1535,"Self, community and motivation","April 29, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/self-community-and-motivation/,"Me & Now vs. Us & Later This is the conflict every culture lives with. Modern industrialism has embraced the extraordinary power of instant gratification and has amplified it by reminding us that only you know what you want and need. Fast food plus the me generation. What you want, when you want it. Years ago, I co-authored a paper that, if implemented would probably have solved our shameful shortage of available organs for donation. In prioritizing people who need a donation, we’d settle a tie by sorting people by how long they’d been on the donor registry. If you’re not willing to sign up to give (one day far in the future) then you don’t get priority to get (when you need it). The self-focused need to be on the list early would essentially eliminate the need for a ranking at all, because humans have been taught to do what helps them now before worrying about later or everyone else. Enough people would panic and race to be on the registry that the shortage would soon disappear. In our culture, turning the “us and later” narrative (you should sign up for the registry to help a stranger one day) into “me and now” (better sign up today or you’ll regret it) is a generous hack. We shouldn’t have to do it, it’s less resilient, but it would work. How then, did the media respond to public health officials to flatten the curve on the epidemic virus (not perfectly, not soon enough, but they did)? They didn’t appeal to, “you should do this to protect strangers from getting sick.” They tried but it didn’t work well enough. They did it by implying, “if you touch someone, you will die almost instantly and quite horribly.” And people, already frightened, embraced the feeling. People generally aren’t wearing masks and socially distancing out of long-term philanthropy and insight about resources and epidemiology. It’s happening because of the panic of self-preservation. A rational, generous, community mindset was effectively replaced by an immediate and self-focused desire to be safe. A generous hack. The selfish dolts on spring break or in bouncy castles didn’t get that memo: they feel fine, why bother being careful? A narrative of “save yourself right now’ is effective in this culture. In other cultures, less industrialized but hardly less sophisticated, an alternative could be a focus on “us” before “me.” Without a doubt, short-term market needs are often efficiently filled by short-term selfish behavior. Resilience comes from a longer-term and more community-focused outlook. The question is: Once people catch the virus and get through it (as most people will) and recover (as more than 9 out of 10 will), what will replace the selfish panic? Cultural pressure is the sometimes unseen force that allows us to maintain civility. It helps us decide what to choose. People like us, do things like this. As we face the need to pay for our recovery, for a new and more resilient safety net and for the shifts that our culture demands, will we have to resort to the short-term and the selfish yet again? Pick your heroes. Whoever you look up to, my hunch is that it’s someone who took a longer and more inclusive view. We can be those heroes. "
1536,Thoughts on “I’m bored”,"April 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/thoughts-on-im-bored/,"If you’re under 14: “Good.” It’s good that you’re feeling bored. Bored is an actual feeling. Bored can prompt forward motion. Bored is the thing that happens before you choose to entertain yourself. Bored is what empty space feels like, and you can use that empty space to go do something important. Bored means that you’re paying attention (no one is bored when they’re asleep.) If you’re over 14: “That’s on you.” As soon as you’re tired of being bored at work, at home, on lockdown, wherever, you’ll go find a challenge. You don’t have to quit your day job to be challenged, but you do have to be willing to leap, to take some responsibility, to find something that might not work. Being challenged at work is a privilege. It means that you have a chance, on someone else’s nickel, to grow. It means you can choose to matter. I’m glad you’re feeling bored, and now we’re excited to see what you’re going to go do about it. "
1537,"And now, what’s next?","April 27, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/and-now-whats-next/,"The last eight weeks have been like no other. An unfolding tragedy, unevenly distributed. An economic freeze. A media frenzy. It’s easy to be exhausted, especially since there’s still quite a lot of slog left to go. Is it too soon to wonder what’s next? And at the heart of it: how can you contribute? Average work for average people is going to be worth less than ever before. Typical employees doing typical work are going to be less respected and valued than ever before. And just as expectations are being shifted, new opportunities will arise. They always do. So what’s next? A commitment to learning and to possibility. The pandemic demonstrated, among other things, that we all have access to each other digitally. That if you want to learn something, the chance is there. That internet connections can be powerful, and that leadership is priceless. The industrial era, struggling for the last decade or two, is now officially being replaced by one based on connection and leadership and the opportunity to show up and make a difference. That’s why we’ve run 40 sessions of the altMBA and why we’re going to run another one this summer. We’re not going to wait for everything to be back to normal, because it never will, and because the best time to contribute is right now. When I launched this four years ago, I had no idea that the world would shift in this way and we’d need new voices and new leadership so much right now. I hope you’ll check it out. Today’s the very best chance to level up. "
1538,A Sunday book reading,"April 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/a-sunday-book-reading/,"Save With Stories is a community-driven fundraiser on Instagram. It features authors and others reading their books for kids on camera, all to raise money for @savethechildren and @nokidhungry. Yesterday, they posted me reading V is For Vulnerable. You can find the video here. It’s a book for adults, but it’s okay to share it with your kids as well. This book was beautifully illustrated by the extraordinary @hughcards. I hope it resonates. I still remember how powerful story time can be. And thanks for what you’re doing to contribute. "
1539,Bulletins vs bulletin boards,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/bulletins-vs-bulletin-boards/,"[Here’s a simple communications hack for small teams and organizations:] When times are changing and you’re adjusting on the fly, it’s tempting to send another alert. The rules at the farmer’s market, the latest schedule for a changing event, the status of a server… When I was growing up in Buffalo, they used to announce school closings on the radio. Twice an hour, we’d huddle around and listen to an endless list of schools (mine started with a W), wasting everyone’s time and emotional energy. The problem with alerts is that they don’t scale. They create noise. Every time you poke everyone with a bulletin, you’ve taken attention away with no hope of giving it back. The alternative is the bulletin board. Want to know how you did on the exam? Go look at the bulletin board. The grades will be posted when they’re ready. Want to know the latest situation before you head out? Go look at the bulletin board. Social media got everyone into the bulletin habit, but we left behind bulletin boards too quickly. And in our digital world, you don’t need to be a computer programmer to have one. Simply create a shared Google doc. It’s free and it doesn’t crash and it’s low tech. (And yes, there are many alternatives that don’t come from big companies). Give people the link to view the doc. Include it in your Facebook post or your last email on the topic. “Click here to see the latest updates.” Don’t worry about whether your tweet or post (a bulletin) moves down the screen, because everyone who cares already has the link to your bulletin board and you’ve trained them to check it when they want to know the status of your event or situation. It’s not a great choice for a high-traffic site, but if you’re trying to coordinate a few hundred people, it’s a lot easier than trusting social media. And you can even share editing privileges with your core team, so there’s no bottleneck for updates. You don’t need to get a programmer out of bed in the middle of the night to update the school closing list. It’s a simple thing to update the bulletin board, to keep making it more up to date and complete as your situation changes. Information on demand is way more useful than information that demands our attention at moments when we’re not interested. "
1540,What brings out the best in you?,"April 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/what-brings-out-the-best-in-you/,"What brings out the worst? One more question: Is it possible to adjust your life so that you show up more often in situations that bring out the best? Can you have an agenda, a rider or an itinerary that makes it more likely that the world around you is what you need it to be? Because if you can’t, there’s one other option: Can you change your posture so that the situations you’re in a lot bring out your best instead of your worst? Ideal situations are often rare—now more so than ever. But we can redefine ‘ideal situation’ if we choose. "
1541,“I tweaked a few things”,"April 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/i-tweaked-a-few-things/,"The easiest way to get a contribution, advice or feedback is to present something that’s 90% done. If you ask too early in the process, if you’re hoping for conceptual insights, you’ll probably be disappointed. Human nature pushes the inexperienced feedback giver to wait until you’re almost done and then to offer feedback on little things. Tactics, not strategy. Colors, not shapes. Which means that you either need to teach your team to be strategic professionals, able to give big advice early… Or create enough room in your (private) internal schedule for redoing the work after someone has ‘tweaked a few things.’ "
1542,New effort vs Old effort,"April 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/new-effort-vs-old-effort/,"Here’s what you had to do to go to a conference in Toronto: Get a passport • Register for the event •  Pack • Figure out how to get to the airport on time • Navigate the TSA • Find a hotel • Get to the event • (I left out about a hundred steps). Here’s what you had to do go to a meeting in your office: Own a car •  Maintain it • Deal with public transport • Risk your life driving to the office • Make sure the dry cleaning was picked up • Navigate evil Bob in reception • (I left out another 100 steps). And here’s what you have to do to be a positive contribution on a Zoom call. The difference is that the first two are expensive, complicated and difficult processes that we’re already used to, so they don’t count. Part of the challenge of a worldwide shift is that all of us have to engage in new effort that we’re not used to. It’s nothing we asked for, and the old effort disappearing doesn’t feel like much of a benefit. But, if new effort is required, we have the chance to do what we’ve always done, which is figure out what works and to commit to it. "
1543,The Fremen principle,"April 22, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/the-fremen-principle/,"If you want to know how to work with new or limited resources, find a population that’s used to not having many alternatives. Of course Harvard and the others are terrible at distance learning. They’ve had four hundred years of in-person lectures, tenure, accreditation and a waiting list to lean on. Our tiny team at Akimbo has run circles around them online precisely because we didn’t have the advantages they do. It’s no surprise that American car companies had trouble shifting to fuel-efficient small cars, because their DNA was about wide roads, cheap gas and growing markets. The Japanese had to make do with none of that. And a home cook who’s used to the unlimited aisles of the modern supermarket isn’t sure what to do when there’s not much to choose from. An Italian grandmother is a better guide in that moment. When we have alternatives, we compromise instead of commit. Find someone who has already optimized for the reality you’re about to enter and learn from them. [The Fremen are the (possibly) fictional natives of the desert planet of Arrakis, who live with very little water.] "
1544,The bootstrapper creates value,"April 21, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/the-misunderstood-bootstrapper/,"The times are nothing remotely like that any of us would have predicted just a few months ago. And many of the institutions and jobs we depended on have changed, perhaps for a long time to come. It’s going to be a slog. And as always, there will be the other side of the slog. Where will the solutions be found? How do each of us choose to contribute? Into this void, it’s possible to show up with something new, something you start, something that solves a problem. One of the most powerful things you can do is build a useful business. An enterprise of value, doing work of substance, filling a need and finding independence. And to do it without raising money from a bank or waiting in line for a venture capitalist to smile at you is where freedom can be found. You’re not a bootstrapper because you are thinking small. You’re a bootstrapper because it offers a chance to chart your own course and to serve your customers without conflict. Innovation almost always comes from individuals who see a chance to make things better. Instead of waiting, they go first. We’re relaunching The Bootstrapper’s Workshop today. We are connecting entrepreneurs seeking to make a difference, and doing it in a proven format that opens doors and helps you think even bigger. Something that matters for the long haul, not just a week or a month. Follow the link and look for the purple circle to save some money on enrollment. It’s at maximum value today.

1545,Don’t know (can’t know),"April 20, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/dont-know-cant-know/,"If your career depends on detection and selection, it’s a helpful fiction to imagine that you’re doing something more than random guessing. College admissions. Greenlighting a movie. Picking stocks. Publishing a book. The data makes it clear, though: while it’s possible to be worse than average at most of these selection tasks, it’s almost impossible to do consistently better than the average. As William Goldman said, nobody knows anything. It’s so much more honest (and efficient) for a selective college to send a letter to the people who meet basic criteria and say, “you’re good enough, but there aren’t enough slots, so we’re going to pick randomly.” Because the truth is that a randomly selected class of qualified people is going to be just as high achieving as any other combination they could create. And if you’re the one who wasn’t picked, don’t sweat it. They don’t know better. They can’t. "
1546,Beware of experience asymmetry,"April 19, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/beware-of-experience-asymmetry/,"There are things you’re going to do just once. Get your tonsils out. Pick a caterer for your wedding. Raise money from a venture capitalist. Apply to college. In these situations, the institutions and professionals you’re dealing with have significantly more experience than you do. Not only that, but they know that you’ll be gone soon and they’ll still be around. In these asymmetric situations, it’s unlikely that you’re going to outsmart the experienced folks who have seen it all before. It’s unlikely that you’ll outlast them either. When you have to walk into one of these events, it pays to hire a local guide. Someone who knows as much as the other folks do, but who works for you instead. Students come and go, but deans last for generations. "
1547,On predicting the future,"April 18, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/on-predicting-the-future/,"Two things: We do it all the time. Constantly. We’re terrible at it. We spend our days guessing how an action will impact the future, and we’re often wrong. And we spend the rest of our days hoping we were right or worried that we weren’t. We try to control the future by telekinesis and anxiety in equal measure. When the future doesn’t cooperate, we spend even more time trying to change the next bit of future so that it ends up more closely matching the future we were hoping for. What if, instead, just for a little while, we simply did our best? And let the future take care of itself. Because even if we don’t fret, the future is still going to take care of itself. All that’s on us is to do our best work. Paying attention to models and the community and the people we serve. "
1548,The message and the messenger,"April 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/the-message-and-the-messenger/,"If your job is giving people good news, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re doing a good job. And the opposite is also true. Often, we conflate the situation with the people involved, but that’s a trap. Our job isn’t to make people happy, it’s to create the promised change with care and professionalism. Going to the dentist hurts less if you have a dentist who cares about you and the process. "
1549,"All models are wrong, some models are useful","April 16, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/all-models-are-wrong-some-models-are-useful/,"That’s what makes it a model. The map is not the territory, and a model is nothing but a stripped-down approximation of what might be happening. By definition, the model for your problem, your organization, your opportunity–it’s not actually the thing being studied, it’s a simplified version of it. At higher magnification, your model is wrong. It has to be in order for it to be a model. And yet we need models. We need a model because if the elegant, pure, refined model doesn’t work, it’s harder to understand why your messy, real-world situation is going to work. Not all logical and structurally sound models turn into successes in the real world, but better to begin with something that makes sense. "
1550,What do you make?,"April 15, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/what-do-you-make-2/,"It’s possible that your job is to make decisions. If that’s what you do, what would it mean to do it more productively? With less hassle or drama? If we make decisions all day, how can we do it better? Because that’s the question every other professional asks about her work. If we make decisions for a living, it might be worth figuring out what would happen if we made better ones. "
1551,Toward better,"April 14, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/toward-better/,"There’s rarely a straight line from here to better. But there’s usually an arc. The slog won’t last forever. And winning streaks aren’t endless either. As we move through time, we’re often presented with opportunities that are carefully disguised as problems. And every day we’re forced to make a choice. The default might be to hold back, but it’s not the only option. The chance to move toward better can become a habit.   [It’s time to find the others, others on a journey like yours, who want to do things the right way.

1552,“But we were comfortable”,"April 13, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/but-we-were-comfortable/,"Some of the shift to digital is unwanted, fraught with risk and lonely. But in some areas, organizations and leaders are realizing that it’s actually more powerful and efficient. So why didn’t you do it before? Because it’s easier to follow. Because it’s more comfortable to stay where we are. Waiting to do something because you’re forced to is rarely a positive approach to growth or leadership. Abrupt shifts against our will may cause change, but they’re inefficient and destabilizing. Next time, take the lead. Not because you have to, but because you can. "
1553,You’re surrounded,"April 12, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/youre-surrounded/,"We all are. Throughout a lifetime, everyone has their troubles–someone might have stubbed a toe, or missed a car payment or be studying for an upcoming exam. Big problems and small. We each have our fear, our grief, our hassle. The thing is, the troubles were local and unique. It was easy to walk away from our drama, at least for a moment, because someone else, everyone else, had something else they were dealing with. For the last month, that hasn’t been true. For anyone. You can’t avoid it, can’t walk away from it and have to work to put it in perspective, because every interaction comes with someone else amplifying the story. But… At the same time the echo chamber around us magnifies our story, we also have the solace of knowing that truly, it’s us. Us together. The boat is really, really big and we’re all in it. This is a slog, and there will be another side. It is unevenly distributed, it’s a tragedy and it’s a challenge. But we’re in it together and with care and generosity, we can find perspective, possibility and hope. "
1554,The unheard voices,"April 11, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/the-unheard-voices/,"Media culture and crisis collide in amplifying the voices of doom, anger and the short-run. Or perhaps empty reassurance and day-trading of emotions. But the other voices, they matter too. The marginalized ones who might not be invited to have a seat at the table. The people who have a long-term view. Folks who see and act on possibility and connection. We hear what we focus on, and what we hear changes how we experience the world. Megaphones don’t automatically create wisdom or even utility. They simply make some people louder. "
1555,Monopoly and network effects,"April 10, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/monopoly-and-network-effects/,"Old-fashioned monopolies rely on some sort of coercion. Perhaps you need to bribe FCC commissioners to avoid net neutrality, or simply influence a local board to permit you to, by law, be the only provider of cable. Or perhaps you set up interlocking trusts that put a stranglehold on any competitors. It’s not pretty, and left unchecked, it eliminates all of the benefits of free markets. Modern monopolies, though, rely on the network effect. People want to join a social network because everyone else is already there. When we see a monopoly that’s driven by network effects, it’s easy to be conflicted. Because, after all, network effects create real value. If there were ten different phone systems in 1962, calling someone else would have been almost impossible. AT&T seemed like a dream come true in comparison to that sort of chaos. What’s missing from this analysis is that interoperability is more possible than ever. Companies that provide a conduit to the network can compete with one another fairly if none of them are the network. Networks, whenever possible, should be peer-to-peer, autonomous and not for profit. The network that delivered you this blog post is all three. There are sections along the way that people and organizations choose to pay for and that definitely make a profit, but the resilient internet, the thing that’s managed to stick around for decades, that has dealt with a huge surge in the last three weeks, outlasts each of them. The community where we live works the same way. While there are businesses at various points along the path, our support and connection and the magic of the people who see us and care about us is inherently peer-to-peer, autonomous and not for profit. And it’s worth celebrating. "
1556,But what could you learn instead?,"April 9, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/but-what-could-you-learn-instead/,"The other day, I was talking to a friend in college. He was complaining about a lousy class he was taking, one that was now significantly worse because it was online. I asked why he was even taking it, and he looked at me like I was nuts. He’s in it for the education, not the learning. A colleague, recently graduated from a famous college, told me about the regime of clickers, used to make sure that students actually come to class and don’t fall asleep while they’re there. The degree is what’s on offer, not fundamental change. For a semester, I taught at the esteemed Stern business school at NYU, regularly ranked in the top twenty of all business schools. In every class, students angled for a way to do less work and have less engagement. One skill they had mastered was relentlessly narrowing the scope of their responsibility. Compare this to the courses I taught at Mercy College, a local community college where most of the students had day jobs or small businesses. In every single session, they demanded more from me. More insight, more learning and yes, more homework. They made me stay late after every class. The difference was stunning—they were there to learn something. None of this is surprising once you see how we got here. Labor struggles with management. Management wants people to put in more effort, and never has enough to be satisfied—because productivity goes up if there’s more output for less money. In response, labor goes on defense and pushes to do less, because if they don’t, management will simply use them up and toss them out. Organized education was built on this same model. There is a regular regime of measurement and testing. There are promotions, demotions and the risk of failing out. And at the end, the prize is a certificate that proves to management that you’re a suitable candidate for labor. Contrast this with the joy of creativity. Of making something magical. Of art. The artist rarely says, “I’d like to do less.” Instead, she wonders how to contribute more, because the very act of creativity is the point of the work. You can learn just about anything now. Thirty years ago, that statement was ridiculous. In just one generation, we put everything you need to know about anything you want to know just a click away. The hard part isn’t access to it, the hard part is finding a cohort and a system that helps you do it. Because learning comes from doing. We talk about ‘learning’ as though it’s as easy and natural as shopping or watching or doing errands. But it’s not. It’s a commitment, one that we regularly make up excuses to avoid. This simple idea from John Smith, for example. Easy to imagine, not that easy to do. Because you’ll have to get good at it as you go. Learning doesn’t have to be expensive to work. Learning takes effort, and it’s hard to find the effort when the world is in flux, when we’re feeling uncertain and when we’re being inundated with bad news. But that’s the moment when learning is more important than ever. [This week, we’re launching the 40th session of the altMBA. And for the people who signed up for it a few months ago, it will be a chance to actually learn something. Not to grind it out in search of a certificate, not to find a chance to do less, but to use the shift in our culture and the rhythm of our ideas to actually learn something. Seeing the nearly 5,000 people around the world who have chosen to go on this journey together is thrilling. Year after year, we see the transformations, the shift in posture and possibility that happens after just a month. We’re looking for a few people to join us in July, I hope you’ll check it out.] This shift is difficult to commit to, because unlike education, learning demands change. Learning makes us incompetent just before it enables us to grasp mastery. Learning opens our eyes and changes the way we see, communicate and act. “What did you learn today,” is a fine question to ask. Particularly right this minute, when we have more time and less peace of mind than is usually the norm. It’s way easier to get someone to watch–a YouTube comic, a Netflix show, a movie–than it is to encourage them to do something. But it’s the doing that allows us to become our best selves, and it’s the doing that creates our future. It turns out that learning isn’t in nearly as much demand as it could be. Our culture and our systems don’t push us to learn. They push us to conform and to consume instead. The good news is that each of us, without permission from anyone else, can change that. "
1557,The panopticon,"April 8, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/the-panopticon/,"There are three ways to tell if people are hard at work in an office: It seems as though only the third one is a useful, long-term way to allow us to do our best work together. The first two can help along the way, but if a meeting or an open office exists as a convoluted way to do surveillance, you’re probably wasting precious energy and trust. And while transferring our work to home makes #1 even easier and #2 irrelevant, I’m still lobbying for #3. "
1558,Helping leaders in college reboot,"April 7, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/helping-college-leaders-reboot/,"We’re announcing a free intensive today, especially for people who are finding their college journey disrupted right now. If you know someone in that situation, I hope you’ll forward this on to them. We’re looking for some students ready to leap forward. To shift from education to learning, from following to leading, from holding back to leaning in. The months and years after school are often fragile. The pressure is on, trajectories are being set, and most of us were probably without a clue. Doing that in the middle of this disruption has to be significantly harder, and we’re trying to help. The typical reader of this blog skews older than that, but you might know precisely the right people for this program. It’s a five-day sprint, a virtual program with daily zoom calls, an insane amount of group work and a shift toward a posture of possibility. You can see all the details and the application here. Please share.   And if this program is not a fit for you, please check out the realskillsconference.com. "
1559,The lifelong fan,"April 6, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/the-lifelong-fan/,"What does it mean that for forty years you’ve been a steadfast and true fan of a team? The Red Sox, perhaps, or even the Montreal Expos. Over time, every player has changed. Every coach. Perhaps the logo, the stadium, the city and even the name. So, what, exactly, are you a fan of? The same is true for car brands, political parties and just about anything where affiliation drives our sense of self and community. People like us do things like this. This instinct is so strong that we suspend disbelief (and create belief) based on something as shallow as what logo is on the box. We confuse our rational understanding of what’s important with our emotional connection to a logo or a team name. It turns out that the name of the team (and the other fans) are a much more important part of our narrative than we realize. Part of being a fan isn’t insisting that your team win every game–in fact, being a fan is defined as showing up even when you’re losing, even when the leaders are wrong, even when logic dictates that this makes no sense at all. Once you realize that being a fan is an important part of your self-worth, the most generous thing you can do is speak up when management is about to do something stupid. Because when the fans speak up, it’s possible that leadership listens. "
1560,Enough little things,"April 5, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/enough-little-things/,"We rarely have complete control over the big issues. But the way we interact with each other, the small kindnesses, the extra effort–it adds up. One after another, day by day. It might be enough to change someone’s day. And then the ripple continues. "
1561,Acknowledgments 2020,"April 4, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/acknowledgments-2020/,"Authors get to put a page in their book thanking people who have quietly and persistently and generously helped. But the page is rarely read, and it comes out infrequently and it’s not so timely. It’s worth taking a second to think about people who are doing more than expected, more than they have to do, more than we can imagine. I’m filled with gratitude for the healthcare workers who have shown up to do the jobs that they never hoped to have to do, risking so much to help people. From docs like Jodi who are beginning their career in the middle of this, to retired nurses who are putting on their scrubs to help out again. And thank you to the frontline workers and volunteers in my town and yours, from the food market to the fire department, from the gas station to the police. They’re showing up and doing it with grace. Thanks to Zoom for dealing with a 20x increase in traffic and not missing a beat. Just like so many other tech companies that are quietly doing what they said they would do. Thank you to the non-profit leaders, entrepreneurs and project managers who have figured out how to pivot on a dime, protecting the jobs of their teams and serving their customers in new and powerful ways. Thanks to every parent who is at home with kids, balancing competing priorities and still being there for the ones who need them. And thanks to resilient and patient therapists, teachers and spiritual leaders who are figuring out how to be there, fully present, even if it’s on a video screen. I’m grateful for the unseen but not anonymous people who are delivering packages, maintaining webservers, fixing the things that break and showing up every single day. And I’m glad that so many people are ignoring the charlatans who are trying to profit from panic and untested remedies, preying on the fear that comes with a pandemic. And proud of anyone who stops clicking on a media channel that’s in the business of profiting from the attention that comes with amplifying that same fear. I’m inspired by the team at Akimbo, working remotely from dozens of locations, shipping important work and connecting our extraordinary community of tens of thousands of people. Thanks to my colleagues at Random Penguin and the rest of the book industry, for focusing on sharing insight and wisdom, simply because they know it’s important, not because it’s lucrative. And to my friends from all over, who are sheltering in place but sharing good vibes in so many ways. And I’m grateful to you, loyal reader, for taking the long view, for leading, for spreading ideas that matter and showing up and doing work that you’re proud of. We wouldn’t have it any other way. If you’re leading despite/because of what’s going on around us, thank you. [This is such a tiny fraction of the people I was hoping to be able to acknowledge. If you’ve got a list to share, I hope you’ll post it somewhere.] (and here’s a list from three years ago) "
1562,The semiotics of face masks,"April 3, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/the-semiotics-of-face-masks/,"It’s difficult to get adults to wear bicycle helmets. (I wrote about this on the blog 16 years ago). The reason has nothing to do with comfort or safety. It has to do with signals. Semiotics is the science of flags, signals and other communications. It studies the very human act of judging something (or someone) based on limited information as we seek the message behind the signal, all in a quest for belonging and social standing. Even more than helmets, face masks make a statement. Ten years ago, if you wore a face mask at work, you were either a surgeon, a carpenter or a bank robber. As they began to spread, mainly in parts of Asia, the mask was interpreted by some non-mask wearers as either a generous act (the wearer doesn’t want to infect others) or something slightly paranoid. Then, when the pandemic first arrived in the US, masks became the focus of hoarding. Like toilet paper, it was a way to sacrifice time and money to get something scarce and reassuring. People weren’t reading scientific journals, they were grasping. The hoarding had the unfortunate side effect of keeping masks from front-line medical workers who needed them. It also created a sense of false security because many of the people who were using them had no clue how to use them properly, causing them to be worse off than if they hadn’t had them at all. If you wore a mask on Main Street as you shopped in early March 2020, it was probably not increasing your social standing. And then, as some newspapers shifted their stance and homemade masks began to appear, the story changes again–worth noting that even fast fashion has never changed this fast. And so the storytelling continues. “Why is that person wearing a mask,” the non-mask wearer asks themselves. Is it to shame me? To let me know that they’re ill and I should steer far away? Perhaps it’s a way of identifying them as anti-social, because, after all, I’m not wearing one… Or maybe they’re smarter than me and I’m behind? The narratives may also be shifting from, “how do I protect myself?” which is a self-directed desire, to, “how do I keep others protected?” This is generally a hard sell in the world of the Marlboro Man, bespoke disposable water bottles and the Hummer. Notice that none of these internal monologues have much to do with epidemiology or public health. The semiotics of social standing and cultural posture happen long before we actively consider the science. Whether or not you choose to wear a mask, drive a Prius or even a pickup truck, it’s worth remembering that because we’re human, we start with two things: What’s the story I’m telling myself, and what’s the story I’m telling everyone else. "
1563,How would you like things to be?,"April 2, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/how-would-you-like-things-to-be/,"We know how things are. How could we not? And we see the emotional rut that so many have fallen into as well. The question is: Will you embrace an emotional posture that models how you’d like it to feel instead? Today, this day, we only get it once. How do you want today to feel on an emotional level? It takes effort. But it’s a choice. We can’t change how things are in any given moment, but we can change how we will approach today. And yes, an attitude can spread. Begin with us. "
1564,Taking it very seriously,"April 1, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/04/taking-it-very-seriously/,"Today, April first, was the day for a particular greeting, the only one except New Year’s that’s simply based on the date. Happy. It was a day that people on the internet understood that it’s possible to act as if and to do it with a smile. To pretend that we’re not on the brink of apocalypse of one of twenty flavors, that nerds are clever now and then, and that most of all, that it’s worth taking a moment before we believe what we just heard and decide to freak out about it. Alas, we’ve been fooled too many times for that to work any more. Fooling has become a business model, and so now, every day is April Fool’s day. Act accordingly. "
1565,Portfolio school: Get better clients,"March 31, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/get-better-clients/,"There’s a tragedy unfolding all around us, unevenly distributed. It’s about health and it’s also about the economy. We are called upon to not panic, to try to focus, to figure out how to make it all work. And many of us are overwhelmed. From health care workers who are burning the candle at both ends to parents with too many demands on their time, it’s been crazy. And if you’re a freelancer, it can be challenging because the steady gigs or the easy gigs might be on hold. If you’re fortunate enough to have time on your hands, what to do with the downtime? If you’re looking for a gig or if you’re hoping for a new client… It’s easy to get stuck waiting. The alternative is not to wait. More time spent fretting isn’t going to help. The alternative is to dig in and build your portfolio. A portfolio that includes three things: ONE: What are you good at? You can dramatically increase your skillset (including your attitude about the work you do) in just a few days of focused effort. TWO: What have you done? You can actually do work, real work, volunteer work, spec work, digital work and you can do it right now. THREE: How have you expressed 1 and 2? When we look at your portfolio, what do we see? You are not your resume. Your prospects are based on the work you’ve done and the way you do it. When you do a good job on your skills, your work history and your expression, you’re more likely to get better clients. Getting better clients is super simple and really difficult. The current environment makes it even harder, which means we need to be prepared for a longer, more difficult process ahead. The benefit of better clients is pretty clear: They challenge you to do better work, they talk about you and your work, they pay on time, they want you to do work you’re proud of and they’re motivated to do more than most people expect. The difficult part is becoming the sort of freelancer that better clients seek out. Because while it’s true that better clients make you a better freelancer, the work is too important to simply wait for them to show up. Particularly during difficult and uncertain times. Maybe this is an opportunity to reset expectations and recommit to the practice. If you’re seeking better clients, I hope you’ll check out The Freelancer’s Workshop. It launches today. You can save some money by clicking the purple circle, which is at maximum value today. We considered canceling this scheduled session of our online workshop, but for many, this is a good moment to take a breath, settle in and level up. These are perilous times, and it’s easy to get pessimistic and stuck. Let’s learn together instead. Here’s to health and peace of mind as we all slog forward together. [At 11 am ET today, I’ll be taking your questions on working from home, freelancing and resilience. We’ll be on Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn, tech permitting–LinkedIn gets posted later.] "
1566,GenC,"March 30, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/genc/,"It doesn’t really pay to classify multitudes by their age–every generation is complex and intermingles with all the others. But it might be a useful way to understand the issues we’ve faced and where we might be heading. Generation C was inaugurated with the events created by Covid-19, and it is defined by a new form of connection. There’s a juxtaposition of the physical connection that was lost as we shelter in place, and the digital connection that so many are finding online. Not just a before and after for the economy, but for culture, for health, for expectations. School and jobs are different now, probably for the long term. No idea or behavior shift has ever spread more quickly or completely in the history of the planet. In seven weeks, the life of every single person on Earth changed, and the unfolding tragedy and the long slog forward will drive expectations for years. Expectations about being part of a physical community, about the role of government and about what we hope for our future. If previous cycles of media were about top-down broadcast (from radio, TV and cable), the last few years have been about the long tail, about giving a microphone to anyone who wanted one. But now, the peer to peer power of the internet is dominating. The Kardashians won’t be as important as 3,000 people with a thousand connections each. Never mind a million people with 100 each. Companies are now competing to see how few employees they have instead of how many. The lattices of the connection economy are racing to replace the edifice complex of the previous one. And if Covid-19 and Connection are the first two C’s, the third one is going to be Carbon. Because we’re going to need to pay. All of us. To pay for the dislocations and to pay for the treatment and to pay for the recovery. Worldwide cataclysms are different from local ones. As we shift gears and seek to revitalize our economy, put people to work and build a resilient future, it might be tempting to drill and burn, and to try to adopt an emergency footing that disregards any long-term future more than a few months ahead. But GenC may be too wise for that. And they may be connected enough to speak up and overrule the baby boomers. A threat and an enemy will focus public attention. For a long time, that enemy was other people or other nations, and an us-vs-them mindset was a great way to get attention or get elected. But just as we came to understand that you can’t bully a virus, you can’t personalize carbon either. The worldwide challenge of carbon is not a problem for someone else, it’s a problem for all of us. Using carbon consumption as a way to pay for rebuilding our community brings all three Cs together. Emergencies are overrated as a response mechanism. Preparation and prevention are about to become a more popular alternative. My generation was the dominant voice for sixty years. A voice that worried about the next 24 hours, not the next 24 years. That’s about to shift, regardless of what year you were born. What can we do that matters instead? "
1567,“I’ll go with my principles tomorrow”,"March 29, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/ill-go-with-my-principles-tomorrow/,"In the short run, it’s easy to abandon what we believe. Deep down, we assume that once things go back to normal, so will we. Organizations end up with bullies, predators and bad actors for only one reason: In this moment, it’s easier to keep them. There’s some sort of urgency that makes asking them to leave too difficult right now, so we put it off for a little while. When we make a “just this once” exception, we’ve already made a decision about what’s truly important. And the same goes for those moments when we’re inclined to be, just for a moment, a bully, a predator or a bad actor as well. Few people decide to be selfish for the long haul. What makes it a principle is that we do it now, even though (especially though) it’s hard. "
1568,Communicating online (the big leaps),"March 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/communicating-online-the-big-leaps/,"It’s not just like the real world but with keyboards. Leap 1: Attention is too easy to steal online, so don’t. Spam is a bad idea. Interrupting hundreds or millions of people doesn’t cost you much, but costs each person a lot. You wouldn’t stand up in the middle of a Broadway play and start selling insurance from the audience. Don’t do it with your keyboard. Permission is anticipated, personal and relevant. Leap 2: There’s a difference between asynchronous and synchronous interaction. We know this intuitively in the real world (a letter is different from a phone call) but online, it’s profound. A discussion board isn’t the same as a Zoom call. It turns out that we can create rich and layered conversations with async communication, but we also have to be just a bit more patient. Leap 3: More than one person can ‘talk’ at a time. In the real world, that’s impossible. At a table for six, we take turns talking. But in a chat room, we can all talk at the same time. Use it well and you can dramatically increase information exchange. But if you try to follow all the threads, or you miss what you need, then it’s actually less effective. Leap 4: Sometimes we leave a trail. Most real-life conversations are inherently off the record because the words disappear right after we say them. But if you use a keyboard, or you’re attached to a server, assume you’re being recorded and act appropriately. And sometimes the people who are talking are anonymous (which never happens in the real world). It’s possible, with effort, to transform business communications (and schooling) away from the top-down, synchronized, compliance-focused, off-the-record, hierarchical and slow status quo to something significantly more fluid and powerful. But we’ll need to do it on purpose.   PS the free co-working space we’re offering has become a successful community hub. Thanks to the Akimbo team for putting so much into creating it, and for the thousands of people who have found energy and solace by being part of it. "
1569,Generous isn’t always the same as free,"March 27, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/generous-isnt-the-same-as-free/,"People have been generous with you through the years. A doctor who took the time to understand your pain. A server who didn’t hesitate and brought you what you needed before you even knew you needed it. A boss who gave you a project at just the right time. Gifts create connection and possibility, but not all gifts have monetary value. In fact, some of the most important gifts involve time, effort and care instead. Money was invented long after humans arrived on the scene, and commerce can’t solve all problems. In this moment when we’re so disconnected and afraid, the answer might not be a freebie. That might simply push us further apart. The answer might be showing up to do the difficult work of connection, of caring and of extending ourselves where it’s not expected. "
1570,Is everything going to be okay?,"March 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/is-everything-going-to-be-okay/,"That depends. If we mean, “Is everything going to be the way it was and the way I expected it to be?” then the answer is no. The answer to that question is always no, it always has been. If we mean, “Is everything going to be the way it is going to be?” then the answer is yes. Of course. If we define whatever happens as okay, then everything will be. Given that everything is going to be the way it’s going to be, we’re left with an actually useful and productive question instead: “What are you going to do about it?” "
1571,Let’s do it together,"March 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/lets-do-it-together/,"As we’ve seen through these challenging times, the real skills matter. The ability to hold it all together, to lead, to bring insight and care to interactions. Too often, we’re pushed to only focus on the easily measured, but each of us knows that the human elements are critical. We’re relaunching the Real Skills Conference. We ran it a few months ago and it was the most effective and extraordinary online event we’ve ever experienced. More than 97% of the participants in this two-hour online conference were still actively engaged at the end of it.

1572,You are your clips,"March 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/you-are-your-clips/,"A divisive radio personality, asking for forgiveness, says to his critics, “don’t judge me by my clips.” Why not? The things we say and the projects we do are our clips. Taken together, they are our contribution. If you don’t want to be judged by a clip of something you said or did, the path is pretty clear. The best resume says, “please judge me by my clips.” "
1573,Moods and actions,"March 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/moods-and-actions/,"The way we feel can be triggered by outside events. And that can change how we act. And the way we act can reinforce how we feel. Of course, the opposite is true as well, and far more in our active control. How we act always changes how we feel. This is a perfect moment for upskilling. For a sprint in learning something that’s difficult to learn. Not because a teacher or a boss made us do it, but because we chose to. Not only do we get to keep that skill forever, but the act of taking control and expending the effort will change our mood. And this is the perfect moment for generous connection. Going way beyond the news of the day, we have the chance to create intimate digital interactions that last. It’s a significant posture shift, one which might change who you see when you look in the mirror. We might not be able to do anything about external events, but we have control over our actions. Sometimes, it’s hard to stare right into that opportunity, because it comes with a lot of responsibility. What will you learn today? Who will you teach? "

Find the blanks, fill them in. Here’s the question: Who decided what the blanks were? We get to write our own, any time we choose.

1575,Day trading emotions,"March 21, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/modern-day-trading/,"When the stock market is on an upward tear, day trading becomes popular. You sit in your basement, surrounded by terminals and tickers, searching for the latest bits of information, hoping to make a profit buying and selling based on what’s happening in this very instant. It’s pretty tempting to day trade your emotions. We’ve piped the voices of a billion people directly into our brains. The loudest, angriest, most frightened people are the ones that are amplified the most. Everyone sharing what’s breaking. The visceral angst of this very moment, over and over. Just as it’s almost impossible to make a profit as a day trader, it’s difficult to be happy when you day trade emotions. But there’s an alternative: Buy and hold. Stand for something. Stick with it. Long-term contributions matter. Today ends tonight and tomorrow starts again, but we only get one long-term life. Add up the sum of our days and that’s who we are. We get what we repeat. "
1576,Calm also has a coefficient,"March 20, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/calm-also-has-a-coefficient/,"Panic loves company. And yet calm is our practical, efficient, rational alternative. If you’re on a crowded plane and one person is freaking out about turbulence, the panic will eventually peter out. If, on the other hand, six people are freaking out, it’s entirely possible that it will spread and overtake the rest of the plane. Panic needs multiple nodes to spread. The same is true with a cabin of 10-year-olds at summer camp. One homesick kid usually comes around and ends up enjoying the summer, because being surrounded by others who are okay makes us okay. But three or four homesick kids can change the entire dynamic. While calm is a damping agent, it’s not nearly as effective at spreading itself as panic is. The library is usually a quiet place because the dominant cultural narrative in the library is to be quiet. Because it’s dominant, the coefficient of its spread is sufficient to keep it that way. We have to expend effort to create environments of calm, because calm has a coefficient that can’t compete with panic when it comes to spreading. And Twitter? Twitter has been engineered to maximize panic. Calm is penalized, panic is amplified. And if you are hanging out in real life with people who spend a lot of time on social media and news sites, you’ve invited all of those people into your circle as well. We can find lots of reasons why fifty years of watching just three dominant TV networks wasn’t ideal. But the combination of oligopoly and the FCC meant that none of them spread panic. They weren’t built for it. When cable “news” showed up, they discovered that panic was a great way to make a profit. Not to make things better, simply to spread anger and fear. If panic is helpful, of course you should bring it on. But it rarely is. Instead: Curate your incoming. Stay off Twitter. Do the work instead. Whatever needs doing most is better than panic. Being up-to-date on the news is a trap and a scam. Five minutes a day is all you need. More on this from Margo. "
1577,Today,"March 19, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/today/,"We only get it once. Why waste it? We can spend it in fear, or we can create possibility for the next person. We can spend it alone, or we can create digital but real connection with someone else. It only takes a day to make change happen. The ocean is made of drops. "
1578,Raft up!,"March 18, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/raft-up/,"There’s safety in numbers. (Virtual, digital connection). Resilience, too. Not to mention inspiration and mutual support. Go start a group. Find the others. Learn together. Meet regularly. If you start the group, you won’t get left out…   At Akimbo, we’ve seen the power of what happens when people connect and work together online. Today, we’re launching a public co-working space, open for the next month. There’s no charge…it’s free. The team has worked hard pulling this together in the last week, and we’re lucky to be able to share this with you. You can find out all the details here. It’s not a workshop or a course, simply a place where you can work from home, together. Instead of a social network, a foundation to feel comfortable as you do your work. A place where you can see and be seen and perhaps a place that will help you organize and lead as we slog our way through this. Together. Hope to see you there.   (And a related video from John Green). "
1579,The conversation,"March 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/the-conversation/,"A short manifesto about the future of online interaction [Feel free to share.] The world is changing. Faster and more suddenly than most of us expected. And beyond the fraught health emergencies that so many are going through, many of us are being asked to quickly move our meetings and our classes online. Fortunately, there are powerful and inexpensive tools to do just that. Unfortunately, we’re at risk at adopting a new status quo that’s even worse than the one it replaces. We can make it better. You have a chance to reinvent the default, to make it better. Or we can maintain the status quo. Which way will you contribute? Rather than doing what we’ve always done in real-life (but online, and not as well), what if we did something better instead? Here’s what we think we get from a real-life meeting: Here’s what we actually get: Real-life meetings are among the most hated part of work for the typical office worker. They last too long, happen too often and bore and annoy most of the people who attend. They can mostly be replaced by a memo (if they’re about transferring information) or they could be better run (if they’re about transforming information.) But at least you’re not in school. The traditional school day is nothing but a meeting. Eight hours of it. In which you are almost never asked to contribute, or, if you are, it’s at great risk, both social and in terms of academic standing. And now, because of worldwide events, local meetings and local schooling are going online. It will lead to one of two things: 1. Just like the ones in real-life, except worse. 2. Something new and something better. Forgive me for not being optimistic, but if what we’re seeing is any guide, we’re defaulting to the first (wrong) choice. It’s worse because you can check your phone, your email and your fridge. It’s worse because you can more clearly see the faces of people who are bored right in front of you who can’t realize you can see them. [Did you know that there’s a ‘focus’ button in Zoom and other tools that shows the organizer when people in the room have put Chrome or something else in front and are only sort-of paying attention? It’s there to ensure compliance and it’s there because we’re figuring out how to not pay attention.] The compliance of the mandatory Zoom meeting is not nearly as firm as it is in real life. It’s like an episode of the Office, except it’s happening millions of times a day. And then when we try to move classes online! First we coerced students to pay attention with grades, withholding what they want and need (a certificate, a diploma, an A) in exchange for them giving up their agency and freedom and youth. Then, because we weren’t getting enough compliance, we invented the clicker. It’s a pernicious digital device that probably had good intent behind it, but like so many things that are industrialized, it’s now more of a weapon than a tool. How the clicker works: Every student at a large university is required to buy one. Yes, you need to spend more of your own money to be controlled. It has built-in ID (it knows who you are) and wifi and GPS. Inside the lecture hall, you need to click. Click to prove you’re there. Click to prove you’re awake. Click to prove you can repeat what the professor just said. Sure, it’s possible to use clickers to produce powerful and engaging discussion. My quick research seems to indicate that this almost never happens. It’s easier to have the student simply pay for compliance in exchange for the certificate. So, we have a few problems: 1. The in-person regime of meetings and school is riddled with problems around status, wasted time, compliance, boredom and inefficient information flow. 2. Moving to online gives up the satisfaction of the status quo, diminishes the ego satisfaction for those seeking status, and creates even more challenges with compliance, boredom and the rest. But… There’s a solution. A straightforward and non-obvious choice. Let’s have a conversation instead. A conversation involves listening and talking. A conversation involves a perception of openness and access and humanity on both sides. People hate meetings but they don’t hate conversations. People might dislike education, but everyone likes learning. If you’re trapped in a room of fifty people and the organizer says, “let’s go around the room and have everyone introduce themselves,” you know you’re in for an hour of unhappiness. That’s because no one is listening and everyone is nervously waiting for their turn to talk. But if you’re in a conversation, you have to listen to the other person. Because if you don’t, you won’t know what to say when it’s your turn to talk. Conversations reset the power and compliance dynamic, because conversations enable us to be heard. Conversations generate their own interest, because after you speak your piece, you’re probably very focused on what someone is going to say in response. You don’t have to have a conversation, but if you choose to have one, go all in and actually have one. And here’s the punchline: The digital world enables a new kind of conversation, one that scales, one that cannot possibly be replicated in the real world. There’s even a special button for it in Zoom, and if you have enrollment and the passion to engage with it, you can use it to create magic. We know, because we’ve done it at Akimbo. We’ve created important and useful conversations for a group of 700 people at a time. More than 97% of the people who joined our online meeting were in it at the end. With no coercion, no diploma, no grades and no clickers. If we want to, we can use Zoom to create conversations, not a rehash of tired power dynamics. We can create peer to peer environments where conversations happen. Here’s how it works: 0. The most important: Only have a real-time meeting if it deserves to be a meeting. If you need people to read a memo, send a memo. If you need students to do a set of problems, send the problems. If you want people to watch a speech or talk, then record it and email it to them. Meetings and real-time engagements that are worthy of conversations are rare and magical. Use them wisely. 1. People come to the meeting ready to have a conversation. If they’re coerced to be there, everything else gets more difficult. 2. Part of being engaged means being prepared. Consider this simple 9 point checklist. 3. Organize a conversation. That can’t work at any scale more than five. How then, to do an event with hundreds of people? The breakout. A standard zoom room permits you to have 250 people in it. You, the organizer, can speak for two minutes or ten minutes to establish the agenda and the mutual understanding, and then press a button. That button in Zoom will automatically send people to up to 50 different breakout rooms. If there are 120 people in the room and you set the breakout number to be 40, the group will instantly be distributed into 40 groups of 3. They can have a conversation with one another about the topic at hand. Not wasted small talk, but detailed, guided, focused interaction based on the prompt you just gave them. 8 minutes later, the organizer can press a button and summon everyone back together. Get feedback via chat (again, something that’s impossible in a real-life meeting). Talk for six more minutes. Press another button and send them out for another conversation. This is thrilling. It puts people on the spot, but in a way that they’re comfortable with. If you’re a teacher and you want to actually have conversations in sync, then this is the most effective way to do that. Teach a concept. Have a breakout conversation. Have the breakouts bring back insights or thoughtful questions. Repeat. A colleague tried this technique at his community center meeting on Sunday and it was a transformative moment for the 40 people who participated. If you want to do a lecture, do a lecture, but that’s prize-based education, not real learning. If people simply wanted to learn what you were teaching, they wouldn’t have had to wait for your lecture (or pay for it). They could have looked it up online. But if you want to create transformative online learning, then allow people to learn together with each other. Connect them. Create conversations. "
1580,Public health,"March 16, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/the-efficiencies-of-public-health/,"[For members of the public, staying at home and sheltering in place isn’t selfish, it’s generous. Social distancing helps keep the virus from infecting others at the same time that it flattens the curve of the spread of the pandemic, giving health facilities a chance to provide care over time.] Public health is efficient, a culture changer and a commitment. It’s not simply a more expensive version of private health. When the water supply is reliable, the air is clean and the public health system is working well, we hardly notice it. Nutrition, access to healthcare and the safety of transport are easy to take for granted. When we hire the government to be responsible for public health, we give up small amounts of independence and money. But it creates enormous benefits, worth far more than they cost. First, it’s cheaper and more reliable for a few trained engineers to test and maintain the water etc. than it is for each person who consumes it to do so. Second, health, like the weather, is something that people bring up in conversation but rarely do anything about. By centralizing action, we make it more likely that something actually gets done. Third, individual humans are bad at long-term thinking. Patient systems often outperform individual actions when it comes to public health. Often, it’s only coordinated action that can help the entire community. And coordinated action rarely happens without intentional coordination. Don’t do it because you finally got around to it. Don’t do it because it is in your short-term interest. Do it because we all need it done. It’s difficult to overinvest in building and running competent public health systems and management. And sometimes we don’t realize how important the system is until we see how unprepared we are. [Which is why, alas, today is a good day to stay home]. Thank you to every public health worker and medical professional who is on the front lines right now. We’re grateful for a lifetime of sacrifices and commitment. "
1581,The ‘should’ Olympics,"March 15, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/the-should-olympics/,"“This is worthy and important and right so I should do it…” sounds like what we say just before we do something. It rarely is. There are an endless number of worthy shoulds in our lives. But these shoulds rarely cause action. We’re moved out of our status-quo stasis by the tension of being left behind, by group dynamics, by the urgency of risk and greed. We’re attracted to novelty and to short-term wins (and even more so, the avoidance of short-term pain). The secret to doing the right thing is to make it feel, at least right now, like the urgent thing instead. "
1582,"React, respond or initiate?","March 14, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/react-respond-or-initiate/,"That’s pretty much all that’s on offer. What will you do next? The first gives us visceral satisfaction and emotional release, and it almost always leads to bad outcomes. Responding is smarter. It requires each of us to think hard about the action and emotion we seek to create after something is put on our desk. And the third? Initiating is ever easier and leveraged than ever before, which, surprisingly, also makes it more difficult to move up on our agenda. In normal times, it’s easy to get into a rhythm of simply responding. Someone else setting the agenda. When things are uncertain, it’s easy to react. But now, right now, is the single best time to initiate. We’re in for a slog, but there will be an end to it. Make things better by making better things. "
1583,Homemade science,"March 13, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/homemade-science/,"Homemade art is essential. It’s the only kind that resonates. A human, doing something that might not work. Something generous. Homemade cuisine is the basis of all the food we eat. A chef, a terroir, a culture, coming together to make something memorable, real and delicious. And homemade solace, the human to human connection of one person to another is at the heart of who we are. But homemade science and homemade engineering are obsolete. That’s because science and engineering are about rigor. Show your work. Do the math. Prove it. Darwin and Newton and Galileo began as homemade scientists, but then they shifted gears and put in the effort to show their work and test their work. That’s the difference between alchemy and calculus. The other elements of our lives depend on feelings and opinion and point of view. But a bridge doesn’t care about whether you’re sure it will hold up a truck. It either holds up a truck or it doesn’t. Your backyard photo of a UFO is insufficient. Putting a stock photo of a doctor on a book of debunked folk myths is insufficient as well. Your conspiracy theories are a waste. Silver beads aren’t going to protect us from a virus, regardless of how much the person selling them wants us to believe that they will. Just because someone has a microphone doesn’t mean that we should listen to them. The obligation to those that would speak up is simple: don’t sort-of do science. Either do it or don’t. If you want to do science and engineering, please do. We need innovation and forward motion. And it often comes from outsiders, from the less-credentialed, from people with a point of view. But be prepared to bring rigor, not just bluster. Show your work. Actively engage in the iterative work to make things better. Professor Lisa Randall said, “The misleading thing about science is that people have epiphanies, those aha moments, all the time. But then someone says, ‘You’re probably wrong,’ and someone else says, ‘You’re probably right.’ Sometimes you do have big insights, and that’s very exciting, but in research, you must balance these moments with a more sober approach. What are we missing? Why has this not been recognized before?” Human beings are complicated creatures. Our beliefs, our culture, our actions–they’re not easily predicted or changed. That’s why marketing is so fascinating. But science? Science is a subset of human activity, reserved for people committed to a method based on the rigorous testing of hypotheses and outcomes. More homemade pseudoscience doesn’t often lead to better results. It’s worth ignoring. "
1584,“Say yes to everything”,"March 12, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/say-yes-to-everything/,"This is a scary strategy. Because it’s no strategy at all. It hands your future over to the inbox, randomizing your path and absolving you of possibility.

1585,Work from home,"March 11, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/work-from-home/,"Three tricky words. Tricky because home used to be a refuge from work. Home is safe, work brings tension. Home is long-term, work might not be. But mostly because the industrial, cog-oriented mindset of work is that you should keep your head down, avoid responsibility and look busy! The factory owner seeks productivity, which equals more, which means pushing people to go faster. The natural response is to hold a little bit back, because if you don’t then you’ll just have to do more anyway. Some might wonder about kids who are homeschooled, because they haven’t been processed by the compliance-focused industrial schooling system. Can they really be trusted in a factory environment, they ask. An aside about the clickers: Large universities now require undergraduates in lecture classes to bring a clicker with them to class. The clicker confirms their attendance. The clicker can be used throughout by the professor to ensure that students are paying attention. The clicker can easily lead to better training. Sort of the way it works on dogs, but backwards. Click training is not going to create the sort of professional who can work from home. It simply pushes us to comply even more closely with a system that monitors us as we work to find an answer that the boss knew all along. And when Harvard sends every student home to take virtual classes after spring break, they give up the social dynamic that is Harvard, but are they also going to learn anything, really? They will if they want to. That’s the key to the whole thing. Unless you’re doing easily measured piecework in the old-fashioned cottage industry mindset (the original work from home job), then the opportunity is to raise your hand, not keep your head down. Some jobs and some schools reward people who lead, connect and volunteer. Slack and other distributed online systems make it easier than ever to build a flat organization. Which makes it more likely that people who want to lead can lead. When you work from home, you can sit back and wait for assignments and hope you won’t get picked. You can be sure to click the clicker when required. Or can you decide to change your posture. With all the time you save by not going to meetings and not commuting, you can run with the opportunity. Turn the freedom into responsibility instead of fearing or hoping for authority. Some jobs don’t lend themselves to this opportunity. If that’s true, you could figure out how to change the organization or go find one that deserves you and your commitment to the work. The best way to work from home is to plan your own agenda, organize your peers, make bigger promises, show up often, lead, connect, innovate and ask hard questions. And then do it all again. You will if you want to. Stay home. Stay home, it’s a good idea. It’s a generous way to help people stay safe. Stay home and lead. In the long run, which is getting shorter all the time, people with a linchpin mindset are valued more highly, given more opportunities and make a bigger impact. This is a chance to enroll in the journey of making a difference. From wherever you’re working. "
1586,Of course it’s a difficult problem,"March 10, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/of-course-its-a-difficult-problem/,"All the easy ones are already solved. Difficult problems are precisely what we signed up for, right? Or, at the very least, the only problems that are left. Difficult problems are rarely solved immediately, and sometimes they’re not solved the way we might have imagined, but with effort, they often yield. "
1587,Stuck at home,"March 9, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/stuck-at-home/,"A friend told me that she was dreading a possible quarantine in response to the worldwide health emergency. “But you work at home,” I said. She agreed with me, but made it clear that when it was her choice, it felt different. The first job is taking care of the people around you and helping others get their health back. After that, we have choices to make. Choices about how to spend our time, how to connect and how to view the change to our lives. What if we committed to watching less Netflix, not more? Fewer news updates, fewer YouTube videos, fewer digital distractions. What if we decided to find a way to connect with people who need us, to lead people forward, to weave something generous for the community? And what if we chose to learn something? All the time not spent commuting or in meetings–a chance to dive deep into the work of McCoy Tyner, or to understand how probability works. Even as we retreat from physical interaction, there’s a huge opportunity to actually connect, to learn and to understand. Panic is a choice, and so is productive generosity. Good health and peace of mind to you and to people you care about. "
1588,When it’s chaos around here,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/when-its-chaos-around-here/,"We have two choices: We can buy into the stress, the noise and the craziness and make it even more chaotic. That’s certainly how it spreads. It feels like the right thing to do–to join in on the anxiety. But it’s not. In fact, the anxiety doesn’t help anyone, and probably makes it harder for those in need. If you’re needed, then help. But if you’re not, if the chaos will get worse if you amplify it, consider a different path. The other path is to take this moment in time to dig deep and figure out what’s next. In the middle of every market interruption, someone starts building a new market. In the midst of a career adjustment, new careers are built. The altMBA has a regular decision deadline tomorrow. The session begins April 20. We’ve engaged with more than 4,000 people around the world over the last four years. The altMBA is not an online course, it’s not video-based and it’s not for a grade. Instead, we’ve committed to finding people who want to work with each other in a journey to level up. You can do it from where you are in your career, and where you are in the world, and a month later, you will have learned a new way forward. The magic of learning is that it’s yours. Even after the chaos subsides. "
1589,"Uncertainty, risk and change",,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/uncertainty-risk-and-change/,"When the world changes, it’s easy to feel stressed. That’s because stress is wanting to do two things at the same time–stay and go. When we’re surrounded by people who are also seeking control over an uncontrollable situation, it magnifies those feelings. It’s okay, probably even helpful, to begin by clarifying the emotions that we’re feeling, especially when we’re apparently talking about something else. Panic is never a useful plan, and it’s even worse if it seems to be about something else. People rarely say, “I wish I’d panicked more.” Day by day, step by step, the present becomes the future, and we make the best decisions that we can. "
1590,Under new management,"March 8, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/under-new-management-2/,"That’s a pretty silly thing to write on the store window. It says to loyal customers, “watch out, someone new is in charge.” And it says to strangers and the apathetic, “this place failed.” If you think about it, though, every day, every store is under new management, if we define ‘new’ to mean, “we learned from what happened yesterday.” Each of us has a chance to be new tomorrow, if we care enough. The only way to get better is to walk away from what you used to believe. And the person you become can’t possibly be the same as the person you were. "
1591,The end of handshakes?,"March 7, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/the-end-of-handshakes/,"In the future, of course, there are no handshakes. Star Trek, Star Wars, even Spaceballs… no one shakes hands. And handshakes haven’t been the standard default for as long as we think–they were codified by the Quakers five hundred years ago, because they were thought to be more egalitarian than tipping a hat or bowing. Today, of course, a handshake is often seen as a threat more than a disarming form of intimacy and equality. In addition to being a vector for disease transmission, handshakes reward a certain sort of powerful personality and penalize people who might be disabled or uninterested in that sort of interaction. And judging people by the strength of their grip doesn’t make much sense anymore. Until a week or two ago, demurring a proffered hand (how antiquated to use ‘demurring’ and ‘proffered’ in the same sentence) was seen as odd and a bit insulting. Today, it comes across as generous. Add to this the fact that in a video call, there’s no way to shake hands. Hat tipping (or perhaps an informal Vulcan salute or simply a smile and a wave) might be making a comeback.  "
1592,The problem for freelancers,"March 6, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/the-problem-for-freelancers/,"Getting found. No clients, no work. And the clients have a problem as well: Figuring out who the truly good freelancers are. A marketplace like Upwork is supposed to solve a classic two-sided problem like this one. But the problem is so difficult that marketplaces often make it worse (and charge too much as well). They make it worse by pushing people to be bottom-fishing cheap commodity providers. If someone searches for ‘logo designer’, there is a huge amount of pressure to be the freelancer who checks all the boxes, has decent reviews and is also the cheapest. The problem with that race to the bottom is that you might win. Compliance and commodity pricing can’t possibly work well for an independent freelancer, because there’s always someone cheaper than you. And clients? Well, every once in a while a good client encounters a freelancer who is worth sticking with. The marketplaces, though, want to be sure to get paid for every hour worked, not simply surface the good ones. Upwork is trying to slip through a change in their terms of service (effective in four weeks) that will subject any client who hires a freelancer they found on their site to a fine of up to $50,000–per freelancer. That’s not good for either the freelancer or the client. The gig economy is based on the magic of finding the right person for the right job. It falls apart when it becomes a commodity marketplace in which each freelancer struggles to be valued for the work they are able to create. For most freelancers, the hard part isn’t doing the work–it’s being tricked into believing that they have to be the lowest bidder to succeed. More on this in our upcoming workshop for freelancers.

1593,Shared objective reality,"March 5, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/shared-objective-reality/,"That’s not the only way we experience the world, and until relatively recently, it wasn’t even the dominant one. The sun rose this morning. You don’t have to agree with me, but a stranger to our disagreement would confirm that it happened. Objective reality is measured. It’s not based on talking points. It’s repeatable and verifiable. When humans share an understanding of how things are objectively, we’re able to make enormous progress, because this objective reality is consistent. It doesn’t matter which group we’re in, or who our leaders are. We don’t have to check with someone else before we can decide if what’s in front of us is true or not. So we can work together to build roads or bridges, to cure an illness or make an omelet. Much of our life is actually driven by shared cultural reality instead. This is what happens when ‘we’ all agree that brides wear white, or that squirrel isn’t worth eating. There isn’t a universal ‘we’, simply groups that define themselves that way. Shared cultural reality is essential to create harmony within groups, but it can drift over time, sometimes erratically, because the compass can change. It can change when leaders insist it does, and it can change in the face of other changes in the culture. Our cultural and our objective realities overlap and often conflict. For example, too often, we’ve made the cultural decision that people of certain races, backgrounds or genders are somehow inferior. In the face of objective reality, the cultural reality is (too slowly) changing. Shared cultural reality can stick around for a long time, again because there’s no agreed-upon compass to point to. It’s surprising but likely true that the most devout cheerleader for a given cultural tribe would have been stoned as a heretic by that same group a hundred years ago. The context shifts. Amplified by the media, divisions over this cultural reality are getting worse. Spin, widely spread, not only seeks to divide us on cultural issues, but resorts to insisting that the objective reality that is challenging those issues isn’t real. By seeking to deny the things we ought to be able to agree on, it sets us back. The other two corners of 2 x 2 grid are: Unshared objective reality. This is the scientist or scholar we call a genius. Someone who sees the objective truth before the others, who is pilloried and then celebrated for challenging the status quo we all will be abandoning one day soon. And unshared cultural reality. This is the artist, the poet or the offbeat person who is living with a different set of cultural rules than the rest of us. The conflict of our time is between people who are challenging our shared objective reality by claiming that their shared cultural reality takes precedence over what we’ve discovered. And vice versa–objectivists who insist that cultural reality doesn’t matter. It does. It makes us human and helps us find meaning. They’re different, but we need them both. One way to accomplish this is to not confuse them. The banana is not a threat to the bicycle.    "
1594,The paradox of selfishness,"March 4, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/the-paradox-of-selfishness/,"Often, we choose to be selfish because we feel insufficiency. “I don’t have that much, how can I possibly share it?” The insecurity that comes from feeling like our foundation is weak or our future is uncertain can cloud our instinct to be generous. Like a drowning person, we cling ever tighter to the life buoy. You see where this is going… The single best way to find sufficiency and confidence and trust and forward motion is to do precisely the opposite of what our instincts might tell us. In an economy based on connection, trust and attention, the posture of generosity is not only the highest-yielding strategy, it’s also the right thing to do. Ideas shared go up in value. Doors opened turn into new opportunities for all.   TODAY is the last day for signups for The Podcast Fellowship. It’s not too late to be heard. Hope to see you there. "
1595,The difference between data and information,"March 3, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/the-difference-between-data-and-information/,"Story. When there’s simply data, it’s all noise. It’s impossible for a human being to absorb data without a narrative. Once we figure out how to turn your features and ideas and benefits and effort into a story, though, it becomes information. And then we can act on it. We have a story problem. All of us do. We’re not doing a good job of developing the empathy to turn all the data we’ve assembled into a story that others can understand. Today, we’re launching the second session of The Story Skills Workshop. Led by bestselling author Bernadette Jiwa, it’s a proven, effective and powerful way for you and your team to learn how to make the impact you’re hoping for. It was the most successful workshop we launched in 2019, and we’re bringing it back for those of you that missed out. Look for the purple circle on the registration page to save some money. I hope you can join us. "
1596,Thoughts on a virus,"March 2, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/thoughts-on-a-virus/,"I’ve been studying digital media “viruses” for more than 20 years, and much of what we have discovered about them comes from the analogy to epidemiology and the behavior of real viruses. Here are some ideas that might be relevant as we come to grips with a slowly unfolding tragedy, and help us with our fears and plans each day. Viruses act like they are digital. A loud concert gets quieter as you move away from it. A chemical dumped in a lake gets diluted as it moves further from where it landed. But a virus starts fresh every time it infects someone else. Often, we act as if that’s not true. Even though it’s organic and living in our body, it’s a code, one that replicates fairly completely as it spreads. It evolves as it goes, but it also recharges with each new host. Viruses are contagious. Epidemiologists measure R0, pronounced R-nought. It’s the measure of how many people a virus in one person will reach. An R0 of 3, for example, means that every person who gets it will infect three more people. Obviously, if the R0 stays above 1, it means that eventually, it will infect every single person. That never happens. What does happen is that the number shifts. When the measles is in an elementary school, it can have an R0 of 20. But, over time, as environmental and other factors come into play, it goes down. Right now, the R0 of Covid-19 is estimated to be between 2 and 3, though it might be higher than measured if there are a lot of mild or unreported cases. As you can see below, more than 2 is very high. Viruses can spread when we don’t know we have the disease. (And of course, there’s an analogy here to malicious computer viruses). Of course, that’s not how memes and YouTube hits work, but it’s very relevant here. The virus has no intent, no goals, no desires, but viruses that spread tend to be viruses that are contagious when we don’t know it and that last a while. It increases their R0 because apparently healthy people walk around spreading the disease. Freaking out around someone who is coughing isn’t helpful, since there are plenty of people who aren’t coughing who may be almost as contagious. There’s a difference between the impact of a virus and its virality. The measles are one of the most contagious viruses we know, and fortunately, they only seriously impact (or kill) a small percentage of the people they infect. Because they infect so many, though, it’s urgent to be vaccinated for measles… to prevent you, or the person you’ll infect next, from being a victim. Here’s a chart from a really helpful article in the Times: (click to enlarge)  It’s very difficult to buy your way out of this. We’ve been trained that a good way to deal with emotional stress is to buy something, but there’s not much to buy. So far, it seems as though most healthy people will have an unpleasant time if they contract the virus, but with fluids and rest, will recover completely. It’s possible you’ll need medical help for pneumonia or perhaps access to oxygen supplements or a respirator, but there’s not very much you can have in your home that will help. However, if you meet the CDC’s definition of warranting medical evaluation—such as the presence of a new cough—it is best to call your doctor or local department of health. You may need to be tested, examined or treated. Big numbers conceal the tragedy of the small ones. If 98% of the people who get a disease end up okay, that can still mean that hundreds of thousands or millions of people don’t do so well. The odds are definitely in your favor, but they’re still odds. There’s a slow-moving tragedy happening, and it’s going to impact people we care about. The ideavirus in the media is preceding the actual virus’s arrival. That means we are experiencing the effects of this twice. Once, when we’re filled with fear of the unknown (with various entities fanning panic) and again when it actually arrives. The R0 varies because of superconnectors and the places in which they hang out. They closed the Louvre for this reason—some people and some places dramatically amplify the average rate of spread of the virus. A mask is not a good luck charm. Medical professionals know how to wear masks and use gloves and proper sanitation to prevent themselves from communicable diseases. Commercially available N95 masks don’t block particles as small as COVID viruses. Watching people walking through airports with their facemasks misadjusted, or touching a surface (the germs can last for days) makes it clear that this is talisman thinking, not actual prevention. Handwashing can work, particularly if it’s done often and well. [Update: it’s become clear that a mask is a good way to keep OTHER people from getting sick.] The thing is, if every person on Earth was isolated for three weeks, we could be pretty confident that we could move on, but the world is a lot more connected than that. We’ve built a worldwide culture of connection, both digital and physical, and while we can slow down the spread of a virus, we can’t stop it. There are so many things we can do to radically improve public health. Everyone can get fully vaccinated for childhood diseases and seasonal risks as well. That alone will save hundreds of thousands of lives a year. We can aggressively campaign against drunk driving and get people to stop smoking. We can clean up the environment and invest in clean water and adequate sanitation. That’s millions and millions of lives saved annually. Each of these problems will kill more people than this virus. It doesn’t pay to panic ever, and in a case like this, getting smart and making appropriate decisions is far more effective than going into a frenzy. Wishing you and yours good health, peace of mind and a quick end to this.   Thanks to Dr. Jonathan Sackner Bernstein for his contributions, all errors are mine. "
1597,The magic wand store,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/the-magic-wand-store/,"Selling magic wands is surprisingly easy, given that they never work. Shortcuts, hustles, hacks and too-good-to be-true are always in high demand. Buyer beware. "
1598,Rhetorical questions about tipping,"March 1, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/03/rhetorical-questions-about-tipping/,"Do you tip more if the food is good? Do you tip more if you buy a fancier bottle of wine? Do you tip more if the bartender or the server comps you on an item? When you split the check, do you look to see how you tipped relative to your friend? And do you tip more if the server recovers from an error that someone else in the restaurant made?   I hope it’s clear that we’re all irrational. That this isn’t really about tipping. And that tipping is inherently an inefficient and unfair way to compensate people… We shouldn’t make everything rational, but we should be careful that we’re achieving what we set out to achieve. "
1599,The days in between,"February 29, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/the-days-in-between/,"Calendars are obviously artificial. Leap year isn’t a thing. Unless we want it to be. A bonus day, to do whatever we like with. Actually, we can have a bonus day whenever we choose, because the cadence of our days is up to us, more than we often want to admit. If you had more time, what would you do with it? "
1600,“What should we remember?”,"February 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/what-should-we-remember/,"Years from now, after this event is long over, what should we remember about it? A week from now, when the crisis hits, what should we remember about this meeting? Tomorrow, when the day gets busy, what would you like me to remember about the discussion we just had? Begin with the end in mind. "
1601,“So far”/”Not yet”,"February 27, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/so-far-not-yet/,"What to do in the face of failure? What happens when you’ve done your best and it still doesn’t get the review, close the sale or win the race? One approach is to embrace the easy path of “did my best” = “failure” therefore, I should give up or simply accept mediocrity. The other, the growth mindset, is to realize that while you did your best, it’s not your best forever, it’s just what you’ve done so far. And that while you haven’t created what you set out to create, the key word, the one you have to remind yourself of daily, is yet. That growth mindset demands advice and collisions with the marketplace. That mindset means that you need to see what those you seek to serve have to say because without that insight, your ‘yet’ might not arrive. By all means, ignore those that aren’t in on the joke, that haven’t signed up for the journey, that don’t want to go where you want to go. For everyone else, though, the answer is, “thanks, wait until you see what’s next.” "
1602,What does ‘better’ mean?,"February 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/what-does-better-mean-2/,"It’s trickier than it sounds. It’s often conflated with ‘quality’ (which means consistent adherence to spec) and ‘luxury’ (which means it costs more than it needs to). Here’s the thing: Swedish matches are better. They might be the best in the world. They do everything a match should do–but better. They light more quickly, burn hotter, and give more match satisfaction. Except you probably don’t have a box in your house. Because you don’t care that much about matches. Because for you (and for billions of non-match-loving people around the world), this sort of better isn’t your sort of better. Your sort of better, when it comes to matches, might be: free and handy. The lesson is simple: better is always in the eye of the beholder.   PS Coming back by popular demand is the Story Skills Workshop, led by bestselling author Bernadette Jiwa.

1603,Overwhelmed is a choice,"February 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/overwhelmed-is-a-choice/,"The internet is infinite. For humans, anyway. In the time you’ve been reading this, more than an hour of video has been uploaded to YouTube. You will never catch up. The thing is, the world has always been infinite compared to human scale. Living on a bucolic farm in the 14th century, there was no need to get bored. You could study earthworms, write a sonnet or have a conversation with your neighbor… We widen or close our lens on the world in order to avoid becoming too bored or feeling too small. When you first encounter a new web service, go on Slack or get back to your computer after a break, it’s natural to feel overwhelmed. Too much to sort. We want a foundation to stand on, but firm footing eludes us for a while. And then we find it again. Because we intentionally make ourselves unaware of the rest of it. Right now, orbiting a distant star, the folks on Planet 10 are having a conflict about something or other. But we have no idea. And right now, someone who works for you has a question, or the store you’re not in is having a problem, or a co-worker is doing something without your oversight–and it’s all proceeding without you, because total information awareness is a fiction. Find your footing and do your work. It’s a choice. "
1604,What’s a fellowship?,"February 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/whats-a-fellowship/,"For five hundred years, a fellowship was understood, Tolkien-style, to be a collection of humans engaged in mutual support. [Definition] It’s hard to imagine something more reassuring, challenging and productive, all at once. To be part of an organized fellowship is a responsibility and also the chance to leap forward. Join the others, people like you, eager to see and to be seen, and most of all, to be of service. (Worth noting that ‘fellow’ it is not gender-specific and in fact is used in the Old Testament in reference to women). A few decades ago, our status and selection-based culture shifted a common meaning of the word to describe a sort of prize. You get picked for a fellowship, maybe you even get some money, and you can definitely put it on your resume. Missing, too often, is the original magic, the idea that the others are there with you, side by side, together. That new sort of fellowship isn’t really helpful to most of us. I’m more interested in the traditional, effective kind. Mutual support and a shared journey. There are organic fellowships everywhere, which sprouted on their own, seemingly out of nowhere, and if you find yourself in one, that’s a wonder to be cherished. They don’t need a name or a published agenda. Simply being in it is sufficient. For the rest of us, there’s the chance to go start one. Start a fellowship, invite some people along, and then do the hard work to keep it going. All for one and one for all.   TODAY we posted the first lesson for our Podcasting workshop. It’s the perfect day to join, to connect and to start being heard. Check out what our graduates have said… Hope to see you there. "
1605,Wasting it,"February 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/wasting-it/,"When you bought your first smartphone, did you know you would spend more than 1,000 hours a year looking at it? Months later, can you remember how you spent those hours? When you upgraded to a new smartphone, so you could spend more hours on it, did you think about how you had spent so much of your ‘free’ time the year before? If we wasted money the way we waste time, we’d all be bankrupt. "
1606,Time shifting,"February 22, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/time-shifting/,"If the people you seek to engage with have a choice, they’re likely to make a choice that’s in their self-interest. The question is: When? Is it in a high school student’s self-interest to light up a cigarette on a Friday night? In the short run, the answer might be yes. Ask that person in forty years if it was a good idea to be tricked by advertising and peer pressure into a lifetime of expense and illness, and the answer is probably ‘no’. When we try to change behavior to make culture better, what we’re actually doing is trying to get people to change their timeframe. The more sophisticated an audience believes it is, the easier it is to help them see that there’s more than the next ten seconds in front of them. Mobs, on the other hand, only care about what feels good in this very moment. The insight is in understanding that perception of time–not just money, not just features, not just narrative–is actually the driving force of much of what is happening when we try to change minds. Not, “is this a good idea?” but “when?” "
1607,Action figures,"February 21, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/action-figures/,"Those little plastic figurines don’t actually move. If we’re being honest, they’re not action figures, they’re remind-us-of-action figures. Many of the totems in our lives don’t actually do anything all on their own. Books don’t read themselves, and flowers don’t love us. But they can represent something. They can remind us of what’s possible. They can trigger us to be in the right state of mind. Consider surrounding yourself with totems that invite generous action. They’re souvenirs of your best self. "

After you get through all the days, then what happens? What if we saw opportunities instead of tasks? Chances instead of risks? "
1609,The free market is elusive,"February 19, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/the-free-market-is-elusive/,"Free markets aren’t particularly common. At the baseball game, the snack vendors sell what the person with the concession tells them to sell. It’s a choice, but Hobson’s choice: take it or leave it. Geography makes the idea of a free market difficult, because only one business can exist in any given spot. Fifth Avenue in New York seems like an epicenter of commerce, but long-term leases and the need for millions and millions of dollars in free cash flow mean that there are actually very few degrees of freedom and not much choice. Free markets are a powerful engine to solve people’s problems, but free markets are difficult to ensure for the long haul. The web cuts through the geography problem. Shopify is fine with a million or even a billion stores–they don’t take up any space. And when the web was young, the free market in ideas was open to anyone with access to a library’s internet connection. But the web rewards network effects and network effects have led to monopolies. Google doesn’t really want a free market in ideas (they hate blogs), instead, they want a market in which they’re the landlord. Facebook enabled a huge outpouring of voices from people who didn’t previously have a microphone, but their algorithms and focus on clicks led toward incentives for outrage as the voices corroded so many elements of our culture. This reinforces the idea that the public doesn’t always want a free market—they’d rather have a convenient one, a predictable one and a safe one instead. And so we have Lyft, a ‘market’ in name only, because drivers can’t name their fares or produce any innovations. Our culture has generally moved, in bits and pieces, from a totally free market (the open cry bazaar on the steppes of Mongolia) to one in which more and more interactions are fenced in due to market power and regulation. We’ve gained a lot in terms of reliability and the management of side effects. But we’ve lost flexibility and speed as well. Most people who bemoan the loss of the free market don’t actually want to live in a world where that’s all there is. At the same time, fighting market power in our quest for better solutions is a worthy effort.   TODAY is the first day for signups for The Podcast Fellowship. This is one of Akimbo’s most popular workshops, and for good reason. If you have something to say and need to be heard, I think you’ll find that a podcast is a great way to share your ideas.

1610,The ones who disagree with you,"February 18, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/the-ones-who-disagree-with-you/,It might be because they are uninformed. It might be because they are misguided in what they seek. It might be because they’re short-sighted. It might be that they are controlled by demons. It might be that they are demonstrably wrong.

1611,But what does “this” do?,"February 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/but-what-does-this-do/,"If you hand an electronics engineer an amplifier, she can take it apart and tell you what it is capable of doing, without reading the manual or seeing an ad for it. If you show a civil engineer the plans for a bridge, he can figure out how heavy a truck could drive over it, regardless of what the sign says. Too often, we resort to hand waving and random hopes for the things we build, merely asserting that our hocus and our pocus will have an effect. But the artifact we leave behind might do little or nothing without the fancy packaging. There’s nothing wrong with the cognitive dissonance that placebos cause. It’s effective indeed. But it works even better if there are actually active ingredients in the potion we’ve created. "
1612,Painting fakes and singing covers,"February 16, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/painting-fakes-and-singing-covers/,"When a pop band goes on the road to promote a hit record, they’re almost certainly re-singing a version of their work that matches what the fan expects to hear, not the daring, original work that they actually might feel like playing that night. And when, twenty years later, they go on a reunion tour, the same is true, but even more so. The band make-up has changed, their tastes have changed, and they’re an oldies act now. Playing covers of their own work. Every once in a while, Pablo Picasso painted a daring new work of art. But most of his 10,000 paintings rhymed with the ones he’d done before. In his words, “I often paint fakes.” Fakes and covers are an essential element of the creative cultural economy. But when we engage with them, we should do it on purpose and not be confused about what we’re getting (or creating). "
1613,Toward perfect,"February 15, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/toward-perfect/,"Draw a perfect circle. Use a compass or a plotter. Now, zoom in. If you zoom in close enough, you’ll discover that it’s not a perfect circle at all. In fact, anything we create, at close enough magnification, isn’t perfect. It’s foolish to wait until you’ve made something that’s perfect, because you never will. The alternative is to continue to move toward your imaginary ideal, shipping as you iterate. Getting better is the path to better. "
1614,You can’t say you can’t play,"February 14, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/you-cant-say-you-cant-play/,"Lenny Levine was a great kindergarten teacher. And he ran his class by this one rule. It means that if another kid comes along, you need to include them in your game. That’s it. It changes everything. It puts an emphasis on connection, not exclusivity. It changes the dynamics of belonging. It weaves together a foundation that crosses traditional boundaries. It’s a bit like giving every kid in the class a valentine’s day card. Some say that it cheapens the sentiment because it’s not about selection, it’s about inclusion. I think we’ve got plenty of selection already. In the adult world, open doors create possibility and that leads to insight and productivity. "
1615,How we do things around here,"February 13, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/how-we-do-things-around-here/,"When you’re beginning a new engagement, a new job, a new partnership, it might be worth agreeing on a list in advance. You don’t have to include all of these, and you don’t have to agree with them (because you can always take the other side) but here are some to start with: We always answer emails to each other within a day, even if it’s just to say ‘got it’. You’re invited as a guest into a purpose-built room in our Slack. We’ll pay your invoices before they’re due. We agree that all of our interactions are off the record, unless we agree otherwise. We’ll never use legalese or intentionally trick you with loopholes in our agreements. Instead, we’ll be as clear as we can and honor what we said, and expect that you’ll do the same. If we’re not sure, we’ll ask each other. We don’t miss deadlines. We don’t sprint at the end, we sprint at the beginning. We don’t make compromises simply because bad planning means that we’re running out of time. We eagerly highlight the potholes ahead, but spend no time casting blame after something fails. We are intentional and specific about the work. “Who is it for” and “what is it for?” are the two key design questions. We don’t use semi-colons or animated emojis. If it’s not working, we’ll say so, and do it with specificity and kindness. We’ll pay a lot but expect to get more than we paid for. No cilantro. Of course. "

1617,The bad client/clueless boss trap,"February 11, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/the-bad-client-clueless-boss-trap/,"“I’m doing this meaningless/damaging/banal work because that’s what the client wants.” There are many variations of this. The plastic surgeon who does hideous work on the faces of people who demand it. The marketer who’s still trying to get teens hooked on smoking. The teacher who blames the curriculum for the boring classroom experience because that’s what the state mandated… It’s a trap, like all traps, because there’s a lot of truth to it. In fact, the client might be misguided or selfish or lazy. In fact, the boss doesn’t care enough. Fine, that happened. But what we do about it is the spot where we either excel or fail. If all we had were great opportunities for insightful clients and bosses, then important work wouldn’t be scarce at all. As professionals, part of our job is to educate our client to keep them from doing something stupid, short-term or selfish. As linchpins, we get to choose our boss, and if you’re unable to persuade them to raise the bar, then the obligation/opportunity is to go do something else. The winning sentence is, “Despite having a lousy client or uninformed boss, we were still able to do great work.” There are two secrets to doing great work: They dance together every day. You get better clients as soon as you act like the creator who deserves better clients. "
1618,Unaided awareness,"February 10, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/unaided-awareness/,"Name a brand of sneaker. Name a flavor of ice cream. Name a dead rock star. If you came up with answers like Nike, Chocolate or Prince, you’re not alone. This is unaided awareness, the ability to name a member of a category without having to choose from a list. It’s tempting to want to be the Nike of your category. It really pays off in group situations, where someone wants to be sure to choose an option that ‘everyone has heard of.’ But unaided awareness isn’t a useful goal. Because most decisions that matter aren’t unaided. Most choices are made with some consideration. What people say about you is even more important than being on everyone’s notorious list.   PS Early Decision for the April session of the altMBA is tomorrow. Ask someone who’s done it. And the very first lesson of the Creative’s Workshop went live today. It’s a perfect day to join us. "
1619,Information wants to be free*,"February 9, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/information-wants-to-be-free/,"*No, that’s not what he said, and no, it’s not completely true. Thirty-five years ago, in a conversation with Steve Wozniak (pioneer of the personal computer), Stuart Brand (founder of the Whole Earth Catalog along with many other foundational disruptions), said: On the one hand you have — the point you’re making Woz — is that information sort of wants to be expensive because it is so valuable — the right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information almost wants to be free because the costs of getting it out is getting lower and lower all of the time. So you have these two things fighting against each other. This is prescient, and it deserves to be quoted or at least paraphrased correctly. Information wants to be free or it wants to be expensive. How can both be true? Information that seeks the network effect, that is most useful when lots of people know it, that changes the culture–well, making this information free is the best way to accomplish this effect. The alphabet wants and needs to be free, because if you had to pay to learn and use a set of letters to make words, it wouldn’t be universally adopted and would fail. The same is true for the pursuit of hit records–getting played on the radio is the goal of the label, even if the radio is giving the music away. The music is ‘worth’ more when it’s a hit. The tension for so many creators is that they’re used to friction associated with their mass-produced work, friction that used to pay them better than it does now. This is the shift that Brand is talking about in half of his statement. But some information is valuable because it creates barriers to entry, gives a few people a head start, confers status, solves a specific problem in real-time, etc. There’s no reason to price the design of a custom addition to a home by a famous architect at free. The person who’s buying it doesn’t benefit from it being free–they benefit from the status that comes from it being scarce. And the information that comes from a meeting that’s only open to paying attendees is worth more because you got to learn it and others didn’t. And Michael Bloomberg is a billionaire because his company sells information to companies just a few seconds faster than they can get it anywhere else. The cost of the information creates scarcity and the scarcity creates value. [This post was inspired by a poorly edited headline and article in the Times yesterday that got the quote wrong and is also remarkably (or sadly, not remarkably) sexist. It’s hard to imagine it having the same tone if it were written about a man.] "
1620,The imbalance between media and advertisers,"February 8, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/the-imbalance-between-media-and-advertisers/,"For a very long time, major magazines and TV networks were very strict about the ads that they would run. The format, content and impact of an ad had to be approved before it showed up on network TV or The New Yorker.  There weren’t many good places to run ads, so the media companies had the power. Now, thanks to algorithmic media buying and the rise of digital, the media company sometimes has no idea who is even placing the ad, never mind how it works or what it’s for. Ads aren’t vetted, they interrupt and they engage in a race to the bottom. As a result, your phone starts blaring an ad when you’re in a meeting trying to check the train schedule. And the biggest digital companies have given up and simply ignore the content and format of their ads. When a media company does try to establish standards, the algorithms simply go somewhere else. The shift has gone from the context the ad runs in (which magazine) to the consumer it is targeted to. And that means that if a consumer sees an ad on platform A vs. platform B, the advertiser doesn’t really care. They’re just picking the cheap ones. Ultimately, this destroys the value of the media company, corrupts our culture and hurts the long-term viability of the brands that have worked so hard to cut corners. It’s possible to stand up and insist on better instead of cheaper. The entire world doesn’t have to look like the worst Android app.   "
1621,“There are several reasons”,"February 7, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/there-are-several-reasons/,"That’s another way of saying, “It’s complicated.” If you’ve got one reason that’s good enough, share that reason. The other reasons are extra, and if you spend a lot of time on them, you’ve just told us that it’s complicated. Difficult decisions, on the other hand, ARE nuanced, and they involve adding up several benefits to overcome several negative outcomes as well. In those cases, it’s worth beginning by highlighting the things we’re going to avoid as a result of making this choice. "
1622,Skill vs Talent,"February 6, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/skill-vs-talent/,"You’re born with talent. You earn a skill. I don’t think there are many places where talent is the key driver of success. The biggest exception might be that a drive to acquire skill could be a talent… Assuming you have that, though, assuming that even once you did the hard work to learn something important, then you have what you need to develop even more skills. Go do that. We need generosity and passion. And even more so, we need people who care to develop the skills to deliver on their promises. "
1623,What’s it for? a simple example,"February 5, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/design-thinking-a-simple-example/,"The lunch you’re catering at the wedding of a friend next week—who’s it for? It might be for the bride, because it’s her special day, so you should make food she likes. It might be for the guests, because they’re the guests, and so you should make something universally appreciated, the way you’d cook for a Super Bowl party. It might be a chance to have an audience for your food, so you can cook to impress. It might be to earn status for the parents of the bride, so nachos are out of the question. It might be to demonstrate conspicuous consumption. Spending far more than you have to in order to amaze and impress the guests. Or it might be to get by without your budget showing, so that prestige is conferred at a lower actual cost. It might be to please the facilities manager, who is a real jerk, and who has power over you. Or perhaps your waitstaff will walk off the job if they have to hand roll and serve 1,000 stalks of asparagus in puff pastry. Begin with a simple question: What’s it for? "
1624,Will you join us? A new workshop for creatives,"February 4, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/will-you-join-us/,"The magic of the workshops we’re running is that we do them together. That’s not how most online education works. Which is odd, because learning almost always works that way. Find the others. Give and get feedback. Learn by doing. See the work, do the work, repeat. Our new workshop launches today. It’s about trusting yourself enough to be seen. It’s for writers, artists and anyone who seeks to create as a professional. The Creative’s Workshop is about understanding genre, showing up to do the work and figuring out what it means to turn pro. It’s a writer’s workshop, a seminar and a mastermind group rolled into one. Not just for writers, but for anyone who seeks to be creative as a professional. This 100-day workshop features interviews with Cyrille Aimee, Eliot Peper, Christian McBride, Gabe Andersen and the extraordinary Patricia Barber. As well as a video interview I did with Cathy Heller and a priceless riff from Brian Koppelman. But most of all, it features you and people like you. Because it works when we do it together. PS if you join us today, click the purple circle on the site. You’ll save quite a bit on tuition. The circle decreases in value each day until it’s gone. Come, make a ruckus.  "
1625,“But I can see it!”,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/but-i-can-see-it/,"Which is closer, the sun or Buffalo, NY? Something might be vivid and clear and right in our face, but that doesn’t mean it’s nearby or accessible. If you’re seeking to get things done, looking for the attainable but hidden opportunities is a productive strategy. On the other hand, if you’re a leader, seeking to inspire, it helps to focus on an iconic goal, one that’s always present, right over there. "
1626,Something’s more interesting than this,"February 3, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/somethings-more-interesting-than-this/,"And now, that’s always true. Whatever you’re doing. No matter who you’re with. Something, somewhere, is more interesting than this. And it’s in your pocket. All the time. As long as the battery lasts. There’s an alert, a status update, breaking news. There’s a vibration or a text, just waiting. Something. Right now. Until infinity. Unless we choose to redefine whatever we’re doing as the thing we’ve chosen to do, right here and right now. "
1627,Again and again and again,"February 2, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/again-and-again-and-again/,"Ruts don’t dig themselves. Most of the time, we’re in a rut because that’s precisely where we put ourselves. Actions become habits, and habits get repeated because they feel safe. The easiest way to make things more interesting is to simply stop repeating your habitual behavior. And that often comes from reacting to triggers. Remove the triggers and you can alter the habits. Tiny changes. Different ways to keep score. Tomorrow comes daily. But we don’t have to take the same route to get there. "
1628,Greater than the sum of the parts,"February 1, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/02/greater-than-the-sum-of-the-parts/,"Some of the greatest buildings of all time were created by unskilled craftsmen using cheap and readily available materials. McMansions, on the other hand, are often created by highly paid workers and endless supplies of expensive materials. Caviar isn’t required to make a great meal… but a talented, thoughtful chef definitely makes a difference. Who is designing your system? Who is putting in an unreasonable amount of effort to make sure it’s magical? "
1629,Zooming in–The magic of looking more closely,"January 31, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/magic-zooming-in/,"Too often, we take what we are offered at face value. The zoom setting is determined by someone else, and in our rush to get onto the next thing, we fail to discover what is going on within. The act of zooming (actually or metaphorically) is a modern thrill, the opportunity to see what was there as we move closer to what is there. Suddenly, new levels reveal themselves to us, and we begin to see the mechanisms that are hidden from us at first glance. My hunch is that once a medical student has understood what makes us tick, people don’t look quite the same anymore. And once you understand how the banking system works, a credit card offer feels a bit different as well. If you want a cool example of how this works, click on this photo of 84 million stars, a composite of photos shot by a telescope in Chile. The ESO telescope is capable of putting together a 9 billion pixel image. But once you click once, you can zoom, again and again and again. Those repeated clicks reminded me of just how vast the galaxy is, more than I ever could have learned from a single picture. It turns out that this vastness is repeated in every system in our lives. If we only care enough to zoom.  "
1630,“This will change your mind”,"January 30, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/this-will-change-your-mind/,"How often is that true? Not very. Changing a mind is difficult work. It won’t happen with a standard intervention, and it probably requires enrollment on the part of the person you’re engaging with as well. "
1631,Choosing to be a citizen,"January 29, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/choosing-to-be-a-citizen/,"Citizens aren’t profit-seeking agents who are simply constrained by rules. Citizens behave even if there isn’t a rule about it. Citizens aren’t craven partisans, voting for party over fact. Citizens do the right thing because they can, even if the short-term cost is high. Citizens live by the rule of community: If everyone did what I’m about to do, would it lead to a useful outcome? Sometimes we call citizens heroes, which is a shame, because their actions should be commonplace, not rare. The myth of success based on short-term self-interest has been disproven again and again. It seems obvious that leaving things better than you found them is a powerful step forward, because you’ll probably be back this way again one day soon. Every successful community, every organization, every family has citizens. It’s the citizens who define the future, because their commitment to the long-term matters. "
1632,In search of reciprocity,"January 28, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/in-search-of-reciprocity/,"If your posture is to give hoping that you’ll earn the moral high ground and thus get something back, you didn’t give first. You gave second. You’re saying, “how can I incur a debt, one that I’m going to use to achieve my goals.” If the words ‘I’ and ‘my’ appear in your reasoning before you get to the work you’re hoping to contribute, then your goal is reciprocity. Calling it generosity merely confuses the issue. "
1633,Luck on demand,"January 27, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/luck-on-demand/,"Alas, not an option. Luck over time is inevitable, though. If you show up with good work and generous action, again and again, sooner or later something that appears to others to be luck will appear. Because luck over time is a symptom of productive contributions. It rarely happens when you need it most, it almost never happens in equal proportion to what feels fair (to you or to others), but it happens. The trap is hoping that a short-term focus on luck on demand will pay off instead. "
1634,"Cars, houses and TVs","January 26, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/cars-houses-and-tvs/,"Compare 1960 to today: Cars are a bit faster, a bit safer, higher in quality and a lot more expensive. Houses are much bigger, a bit more efficient and enormously more expensive. TVs on the other hand, are dramatically bigger, dramatically more efficient, dramatically more powerful, significantly more reliable and way cheaper. For $300, you can buy a 49 inch TV that would have cost a million dollars in 1960. What happened? Cars, with the exception of new electric drivetrains, are basically the same thing they were, except designed with computers and assembled by robots. Houses, with the exception of some prefab edge cases, are still assembled by hand, on location, by skilled workers. And they went up in scale because real estate prices and income inequality went up even more. But TVs–they made a leap. A leap from analog to digital, a leap from tubes to solid-state. Moore’s Law is at work on your television, but it’s been largely shut out of the two largest purchases most people make. When you see computers and networks show up in an industry, it’s easy to predict what will happen next. "
1635,Awareness vs. experience,"January 25, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/awareness-vs-experience/,"We are more aware than ever before. More aware of victims of violence, or a natural disaster. More aware of insane wealth or grinding poverty. It gets beamed to us, regularly. We’re even more often exposed to social hijinks, sports stars or business moguls. We’re aware that people run a marathon, or fast for a week. That they start a business or meditate every day. They know how to code, or to take pictures. But there’s a difference between hearing about it and experiencing it. There’s no excuse for being uninformed. But when it matters, there’s also no good reason for being inexperienced. There’s often a piece of glass between us and the world as it’s delivered to us. That glass magnifies awareness, but it doesn’t have the same impact as experience does. It can’t. Our awareness has been stretched wider than ever in history, but often at the cost of taking away a lifetime of experiences. "
1636,Obese dogs,"January 24, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/obese-dogs/,"Dogs aren’t supposed to have willpower, that’s what they have us for. Marketing changes culture and culture changes us. And then we end up changing the world around us. Not just the dogs, but all of it. It’s probably a mistake for us to wait until profit-driven corporations start to worry about side effects on their own. But the moment we start voting with our attention and our dollars, they’ll begin to respond. We get what we pay for. And sometimes, we pay for what we get. "
1637,The only one who has heard all of it,"January 23, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/the-only-one-who-has-heard-all-of-it/,"…is you. Jerry Garcia performed thousands of times, and he was the only one who heard every performance. The same is true for the work you’ve created, the writing you’ve done, the noise in your head–you’re the only person who has heard every bit of it. Tell us what we need to know. Not because you need to hear yourself repeat it, but because you believe we need to hear it. Take your time and lay it out for us, without worrying about whether or not we’ve heard you say it before. We probably haven’t.   CREATORS: I hope you’ll check out the newest Akimbo workshop. I’ve been working on it for nearly a year. It’s built for people with a craft–for artists, writers, musicians and anyone who has something that they’d like to more effectively share with the world. It’s a modern writer’s workshop, for more than writers, and it happens worldwide. Sign up for more info–we launch in two weeks. "
1638,As simple as necessary (but not simpler),"January 22, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/as-simple-as-necessary-but-not-simpler/,"The convenience regime is in full force. You don’t often earn points by being baroque, rococo or byzantine. Given a choice, people will simply move on to the next thing. “As simple as necessary” is missed by many professionals who should call themselves designers, but don’t. Consider the 30 digit code that Microsoft wants me to type in… 30 digits? That’s more than a quintillion possible combinations. A lot more. Why? Or notice the new user interface for the useful Audio Hijack program… It’s a two-dimensional grid with clickable icons. Why isn’t it simpler? And “but not simpler” is missed, more and more often. Items that are dumbed down to the point where they are too simple to get useful work done. Where the power is hidden from the user, because the user can’t be trusted with it. Apple continues to make things simpler than they need to be, all in the name of short-term convenience. The balancing act is real. It requires empathy, the empathy to realize that not everyone knows what you know and not everyone wants what you want. "
1639,The imprecision of “am”,"January 21, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/the-imprecision-of-am/,"I am 41 years old is a very different statement than I am a vegan. In the first case, there’s not a lot you can do about your “am”. It is an accurate description of a state of affairs over which you have no control. In the second, it simply describes a choice. Anyone who wants to eat a certain way instantly becomes a vegan for as long as they make that choice. The “am” that we think of as permanent identity might actually be a choice, repeated again and again. "
1640,And it bends toward justice,"January 20, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/and-it-bends-toward-justice-2/,"Superman could bend steel with his bare hands. Along the way, we’ve been sold on the idea that difficult tasks ought to be left to heroes, often from somewhere far away or from long ago. That it’s up to them, whoever ‘them’ is. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. quoted Theodore Parker: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” But it’s not bending itself. And it’s not waiting for someone from away to bend it either. It’s on us. Even when it doesn’t work (yet). Even when it’s difficult. Even when it’s inconvenient. Our culture is the result of a trillion tiny acts, taken by billions of people, every day. Each of them can seem insignificant, but all of them add up, one way or the other, to the change we each live through. Sometimes it takes a hero like Dr. King to wake us up and remind us of how much power we actually have. And now it’s our turn. It always has been. "
1641,Everyone is doing their best,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/everyone-is-doing-their-best/,"What if that’s not actually true? Perhaps it’s more useful to consider that in every moment, on every project, no one is actually doing their best. Because there’s always a need to hold a little bit in reserve. Because there are always competing priorities. Because everyone has a noise in their head. Because there’s fear, a hundred kinds of fear. Because no one has actually done the lopsided work of 100% preparation and commitment, not for this precise moment. I’m not doing my best and neither are you. Because we’re not optimized algorithms, we’re people. Okay, now that we can see that no one is doing their best, what are our options?   PS One way to get closer to doing your best is to join The Marketing Seminar. Tomorrow is the final day for registration, but today’s a fine day to join in. And don’t miss tomorrow’s deadline for First Priority access to the altMBA. When you’re ready to discover how much you can contribute, the altMBA is here for you. "
1642,Better than real,"January 19, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/better-than-real/,"A still life painting was supposed to capture a moment in time, something that we’d photograph if only the camera had been invented. And a sauna was a nordic way to simulate a warm afternoon at the beach. But an artistic photograph isn’t supposed to simply be a snapshot. It has to add more than that. And a veggie burger is not simply a pale imitation of a meat burger. It can be something better. The problem with faux is that it’s not enough. "
1643,The Dolittle effect,"January 18, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/the-dolittle-effect/,"Why is the new Dolittle movie so bad? Savaged by critics and viewers, it had: I think the best way to understand why it failed is to look at the reasons above. Ironically, it’s these assets and lack of constraints that created the circumstances that allowed the movie to become a turkey. Too many meetings. Too many self-important voices around the table. And most of all: No one who cared enough or was bold enough to stand up and say, “no.” That would have been enough. If at three or four critical moments in the development of the project, someone had stopped the assembly line until the work was good enough to proceed, everything would have been better. Sometimes, the investments we put in place to avoid mediocrity are the very things that cause it. "
1644,Long-term vs short-term,"January 17, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/long-term-vs-short-term/,"There’s always someone who is more willing to play the short-term game than you are. Someone who is willing to cut more corners, send a more urgent text, borrow against the future, ignore the side effects, abuse trust and corrupt the system–somehow justifying that short-term hustle with a rationalization (usually a selfish one) about how urgent it is. On the other hand… There’s plenty of room to win as someone who takes a longer view than the others.   Here are some updates from a busy week: The Real Skills Conference happens today at 1 pm Eastern. It’s a two-hour virtual conference. Registration closes today at 10 am. Check it out here. My post about Google’s broken promo folder received more than 1,000 responses, sharing details and insight about the hassle it’s causing. The team at Gmail has access to the doc… not sure if they’ve responded to anyone though. The Marketing Seminar has less than a week before enrollment closes. This week, Blinkist launched a series of two-minute long podcasts I recorded for them. A fun six-part blog series I did with the co-author of my very first book, the one and only Chip Conley. And a new video, three things we’ve learned from the altMBA. "
1645,Confusing hunger and thirst,"January 16, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/confusing-hunger-and-thirst/,"If you find yourself stranded in the desert with nothing but an endless supply of chips, you’re going to die within a week. The same thing could happen to you if you had nothing but water to live on–it would take longer but be just as fatal. Hunger and thirst are similar, easily confused but very different. Our culture of corporate consumption tries to persuade us that being hungry is all we need. Hungry to earn more, buy more, save more, spend more. It celebrates the hustler who doesn’t know how to stop, asserting that this person is getting all the fancy prizes because they’re contributing so much. Status is awarded to the unsated hungry person. But they might still be thirsty. Thirsty for meaning and connection. Thirsty for the satisfaction of creating beauty. More hustle won’t satisfy those needs. "
1646,Interaction debt,"January 15, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/interaction-debt/,"When a company is young, with few products and fewer customers, the phone doesn’t ring and customer service is a lonely job. As more customers arrive, each one is made a promise: we’ll be here when you need us. Add more products, and each one carries an interaction load as well. Add shareholders, partners and retailers, and each expects an ongoing interaction as well. The same is true for your social media accounts. While it only takes a minute to open one, it brings with it the promise of hours (or hundreds of hours) of future interaction. And it adds up. If a children’s book author commits to answering the mail she gets from classrooms, each book sold (and each book written) increases the interaction debt, until there’s no time to continue writing. Interaction is a privilege. But it doesn’t often scale. "
1647,Fixing your email promo folder,"January 14, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/fixing-your-email-promo-folder/,"Your promo folder is broken, and our fix for it is a bit stuck. If you use Gmail, you probably have thousands of emails in your promo folder. A quick look will show you that there are dozens of emails moved there by Google that you probably wish you had seen. In the last week, I found several personal notes, several calendar invites (including ones for Google’s own calendar), and newsletters from Tim Ferriss and others. We are finding that 20% of the Slack invites we’re sending to people are ending up misfiled in the promo folder as well. Most of us live with the misfiling because we don’t know about it, because we save so much time on the junk that disappears, and partly because we don’t know how to easily fix it without dragging emails over one at a time. Enough of the writers and orgs I work with were frustrated by the incorrect filing of important mail by Google that I decided to work with my team to build a simple system that with just a few clicks, would move many of the emails you’re missing out of the promo folder back to where they belong. It does this without signing you up for any new lists, without sharing your data with anyone, without reading your email. All we’ve done is built a list of good stuff (our gold list), senders you might have signed up for but are missing. And it’s free. You can see the preliminary page here: 98voices.com And we’ve published our code base for anyone to see on GitHub. But… Google has rejected the script. Even if you want to use it, Google won’t let you. It’s not really clear to us what the problem is, and after six weeks of discussing this with them, I decided to share our impasse here on the blog. This is all we’ve been told, unedited: “Gmail’s tabbed inbox experience puts emails where our users want them to be, based on user corrections. Users may further customize with filters, or disable tabs altogether.”  — Google spokesperson “The Gmail API’s data use policies give our users the confidence they need to keep their data safe. Apps that solely filter or remove filtering options in Gmail are against our policy.” — Google spokesperson   If this issue resonates with you, I hope you’ll take a minute to fill out this simple form to share your feedback with the people who run the Promo folder at Gmail. We’ll share it with them. We’re hopeful that they’ll see that it’s in everyone’s interest to let you easily take control of the folder and get the email you’d like to get out of the Promo folder. Thanks. "
1648,The perfect argument,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/the-perfect-argument/,"Every political structure, every organization, every relationship has at least one. The topic, that once you bring it up, must be addressed. An argument so existential that it cannot be left alone. An argument that gets to the crux of the matter, one that’s so fraught everything else pales in comparison. I can’t even type an example from today’s world here, because if I do, the entire point of the post will be taken over by waves of urgent outrage. Which is my point. The purpose of the perfect argument is to make sure we don’t actually get anything done. The perfect argument is perfect because it never ends, because it is a trap for our focus and our energy. And the best reason to bring it up is that it permits someone to veto the forward motion that was about to happen somewhere else. Perhaps the response is, “you’re right, that’s urgent, let’s discuss it after we fix the problem we’re currently working on.” Or maybe, “we need a forum to make real headway on the topic you want to discuss, but this isn’t it.”   [PS Today, we’re launching sign-ups for The Real Skills Conference. It’s a worldwide video conference that you can do from your desktop. In less than three hours, you’ll have a chance to connect with others on a similar journey. You’ll discover new co-conspirators, learn new approaches and find the confidence to do the work that’s in front of you. It happens on January 17th, hope to see you there.] "
1649,Compromise,"January 13, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/compromise/,"People talk about compromising like it’s a bad thing. But we’re always doing it. Even the most ardent vegan is killing tiny creatures in a glass of water. There’s no economy on earth that is completely unregulated, nor is there one that’s completely state-controlled. We’re never completely at an edge. We can’t be. So now, the question isn’t whether or not to compromise. The question is where we’re going to be on the spectrum. That’s a more useful place to start the conversation.   PS today’s the first lesson in The Marketing Seminar. We’ve assembled an extraordinary cohort of people seeking to do better work. I hope you’ll check it out. "
1650,The dominant media narrative of the day,"January 12, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/the-dominant-media-narrative-of-the-day/,"The thing the media is talking about, in heavy rotation. The breaking news, the one you’re required to give an opinion on. The thing is, if it’s not for you, about you, or something you need to engage in, then who put it on your agenda? The media benefits from turning you into their product, once you give them your attention. Feel free, but do it because you’ve chosen to. Here’s something to consider: the world doesn’t get better when you spend more time engaging with mass media. That’s pretty clear. But it does get better when you spend more time doing things that matter. Actions matter. "
1651,Look in the obvious places first,"January 11, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/look-in-the-obvious-places-first/,"That makes sense, because the obvious solution is obvious because we’ve learned how to solve problems like these. Your car keys are probably on your dresser, not in Santa Fe. Here’s the thing: if the problem is a longstanding one, if it hasn’t been solved in a while, then the places you think are obvious aren’t. Because they’ve already been tried. As time goes on, the most likely site of the solution is further and further away from what you would have guessed. So begin there instead. That’s the new obvious place. Hint: it’s probably a place that feels uncomfortable, risky or difficult. "
1652,Falling behind vs. streaks,"January 10, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/falling-behind-vs-streaks/,"The culture punishes people by reminding us that we’re falling behind. The camera focuses on the person who is winning the race instead of the one who is trying harder than ever before. The bank sends the dunning notice to the person behind on their rent and the lousy grades go to the student who hands in a paper a day late. Fear of falling behind is a good way to enforce compliance. But it turns out that real progress comes not from measuring ourselves against everyone else’s pace, but in building habits. And habits come from streaks. You’re almost certainly never going to win a 26-mile marathon, but if you train every day, you’ll finish one. In building the Akimbo workshops (like The Marketing Seminar, which is open for enrollment right now), we’re committed to creating a learning system where you don’t have to feel like you’re falling behind–at the very same time we’re making it likely that you’ll embrace the posture of seeking a streak. Show up every day. Do the work, return tomorrow. Drip by drip, day by day. Habits lead to commitments and commitments create learning. A culture of streaks can’t help but be mutually supportive. If there’s no behind, then there’s no ahead. But if we’re supporting each other in building new habits, we discover that opening the door for someone else also benefits us as well. "
1653,Patient Capital: How long is the long run?,"January 9, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/patient-capital-how-long-is-the-long-run/,"If you invest in an education, you expect it to pay off in a decade. Invest in a buy and hold investment, and you probably expect a return within a year. Day trade bitcoin and you might be measuring your return over the course of an hour. if you wanted to make a long-term impact on a growing country like India, what would you do? One choice is to invest in the endless emergency of poverty, and help people who need help right this second. This is important and lifesaving work. Another choice is to put some money into a fast-growing company that’s about to go public. And a third option is to invest in an organization that’s bringing off-grid solar to isolated villages. In the third case, it’s possible that your investment won’t pay off for twenty years. But during those two decades, you’ll notice that a little energy leads to enough productivity to create demand and income that can pay for a little more energy. Home by home, village by village, your small investment begins to compound, because it changes the culture and the tools and the expectations that people have about what’s next. A day trader would never take this bet. But a day trader rarely makes an impact. "

1655,"Yes, marketing does matter","January 7, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/yes-marketing-does-matter/,"Because marketers make change happen. That’s the work. Not to run ads, not to sell crap, not to invent hoopla. Marketing makes change. If you’re not proud of the change you’re making, do something else. It turns out that smart marketing is significantly more effective than the other kind. It turns out that showing up with the right work for the right people in the right way is a powerful tool in making change happen. The other kind of marketing gets a bad rap, and that’s well deserved. But real marketing, the marketing that makes things better by making better things–that’s what we need more of. As you might have guessed, it’s time for The Marketing Seminar. We’ve run this live digital workshop eight times already. More than 8,000 people in fifty countries have been transformed by this proven group workshop. We only run it a few times a year. Your boss will pay for it. You’ll work hard and you’ll get back far more than you put into it. The typical student gives and gets more than 500 pieces of feedback in just the first month. (Click the purple circle to save on tuition). The seminar also has a #1 bestselling book, if that’s more your speed. And a video-only course. Do what works for you. We keep doing it because it works. This time it’s your turn. I hope you’ll take a leap and join us. "
1656,The end of ‘someone’,"January 6, 2020",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2020/01/the-end-of-someone/,"The following idea is endorsed by all of these people:  None of them exist. They’re constructs, built by an algorithm. Rights released, happy and smiling, but no one in particular. Fifty years ago, you couldn’t trust the endorsements in direct marketing ads for lousy products: “A miracle!” …Bob Because you knew there wasn’t really a Bob. Twenty-three years ago, when I created a book with the Weekly World News (yes, this is true), I visited their tiny office in Florida. It consisted of three people and a filing cabinet. Inside the cabinet were pictures of 400 people (mostly friends and former friends of the three editors) that would be cut and pasted in the WWN any time they needed a picture of an expert, a citizen or both. They weren’t news and they weren’t the world, but they were weekly. I knew that the Weekly World News was low-brow chicanery, but I have a hunch that not everyone did. In 2019, and perhaps forever, we’re now at a new level, one where the polish of photography or video is no longer any clue at all about the provenance of what we’re encountering. I don’t think we have any clue about how disruptive this shift is going to be. Even the real celebrities we purport to trust (“influencers” deliberately in quotes) are easily bought. It used to be only Rula Lenska who we doubted. There are people and organizations that are racing to break the fabric of community that we all depend on. Either to make a short-term profit or to atomize/vaporize widespread trust to hide from accountability and to slow change. Like all shifts, there will be a counter-shift. But keep your eyes open, because the rules are clearly changing. Remaining trusted and consistent will become ever more valuable as it becomes more scarce. A resolution to be in higher-resolution for those you seek to serve. In the meantime, it’s worth confirming the source before you believe what you see. "

But it was on-point enough to have been worth waiting for ever since I got my first eye exam. For most of us, 2020 is going to be a turning point. Because it’s another chance to live tomorrow over again. A chance to reset, to decide what’s important and what’s worth working for. Not a New Year’s resolution, because resolve is often in short supply. Instead, making the choice to learn to see. A chance to decide to decide. Sure, that’s meta, but it beats the alternative. To not see. To simply accept. To not choose. To obediently follow instead. We’re devoting this year to bringing you a series of workshops that can undo the status quo if that’s what you choose. A chance to see more clearly and even more important, to learn to trust yourself enough to change things for the better.

1663,Two sides of the internet,"December 30, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/two-sides-of-the-internet/,"The architecture of the internet is about choice. That’s where the resilience comes from. Email can take one of a trillion paths to get from me to you. You have millions of pages to choose from when you want to read a blog post or learn a programming concept. On the other hand, the business of the internet is often about no choice. Investors seek organizations that create natural monopolies, businesses with such significant network effects that they can clear the board and create infinite returns. These network-effect businesses succeed at first because the benefits to each user are significant. We voluntarily choose to engage because it’s better (cheaper, faster, more fun) than doing it somewhere else. But then, the implacable desire for ‘more’ kicks in and suddenly, this monopoly isn’t about serving us, it’s about enriching the owners. And so the tension. The tension between the open resilient world of choice and the rigid and inflexible dominant monopoly. "
1664,Top speed is overrated,"December 29, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/top-speed-is-overrated/,"The Amtrak Acela is capable of going well over a hundred miles an hour. And yet, it’s not unusual for a 90-mile ride on the Acela to be only three or four minutes shorter than it would be on a more traditional train. I can drive my Prius from NY to Syracuse faster than I can fly there. Even though a plane has been engineered to have a much higher top speed, the door to door costs of travel (security theatre, parking, checking in, the rest of the last mile once I land) aren’t impacted at all by the top speed of the chosen form of transport. Top speed is easy to measure and fun to work on. But for most of the people you work with, there are dozens of factors that matter more than the easily measured versions of top speed that are talked about. Fix the systems first. Look at the overhead of context switching. Bravery, empathy and other real skills matter far more than horsepower. "
1665,Slow is relative,"December 28, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/slow-is-relative/,"In between the holidays, it all seems to slow down. Most days, there is little traffic on the road (or on websites). Fewer products launched, fewer inbound emails, fewer things to check off a todo list. And yet, if someone in 1820 had lived at the pace we live in December 2019, she would probably have dropped dead from exhaustion. A store in New York that feels slow this time of year might be recording record traffic if it had the same turnout in Scottsdale or Tempe. Two things are true: The world is faster and crazier than it has ever been before. And the world is as slow and predictable as it will ever be again. Bustle and crises are local conditions.   PS The last week of the year is quiet, which leaves time for new plans, new learning and new opportunities.

1666,Distracted by wide funnels,"December 27, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/distracted-by-wide-funnels/,"If you have enough at the top of your interest funnel, you don’t need to be very effective at conversion to seem successful at the other end of the funnel. And so, a billion people visit Wikipedia and 32 million become registered users and 3,800 earn the privilege of being trusted enough to create a new article without oversight. TED has a billion views which leads to 4,000 TEDx events that reach hundreds of thousands of in-person participants and 2,500 end up coming to Vancouver. Kickstarter has millions of visitors, tens of thousands of projects and a few of those do more than a million dollars in revenue. The internet has enabled the wide funnel, but it’s incredibly uncommon. That’s not because the last part of the process is difficult, it’s because the first part–becoming a huge hit–is.

1667,On seeking a category,"December 26, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/on-seeking-a-category/,"A new ice-cream shop opened up downtown. Do you want to go? Every word in that sentence is easy to understand. We know that a ‘new ice cream shop‘ is a bit like the other ice cream shops in our experience, except a little different and probably better. And we know where downtown is. That’s a different question than: Have you subscribed to Prodigy? (1989) Want to see my iPhone? (2008) Did you hear that podcast? (2004) Do you know how to program an Arduino? (2016) When you ask a question about a new entry that’s also in a new category, you’re now trying to do two things: I’ve been living in this state of mystery for three decades. I’ve been asked by generous and interested folks, “what’s email?” as well as, “what’s a cd-rom?” and now, “what’s the altMBA?” First you need to explain the category (which is never glib or easy) and then you can help people figure out whether they want to leap or not. This is one reason why competition is such a gift. If you have competition, now you have others helping you explain the category. With competition, you can say things like, “We’re like Uber, but without the scandals.” "
1668,Toward peace,"December 25, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/toward-peace/,"Peace might not mean getting everyone else to do what you want them to do.

We can begin there. Most of the time, people want to be seen, understood and appreciated. And if we can offer someone dignity, we give them a gift that’s difficult to find. "
1669,Is optimal the point?,"December 24, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/is-optimal-the-point/,"As soon as competitive people start to measure something, there’s pressure to make it better. And once better reaches the maximum level, it’s optimal. But perhaps that’s not really the goal. What about resilient? Or perhaps we could value delightful, stressless or reliable instead. Optimal is ultimately sterile. It leaves no room for much of anything else, including joy. "
1670,The travel agent’s problem,"December 23, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/the-travel-agents-problem/,"Not just travel agents, but all agents. Information scarcity is disappearing. Forty years ago, passengers didn’t know which airline flew where and when. And forty years ago, airlines had no easy way to find out who wanted to fly somewhere. Today, of course, there’s no shortage of information or ability to connect. So paying 10% of their revenue to a human who will use a terminal instead of the passenger using a computer hardly makes sense for the airline. Movie studios used to have to wrestle with information scarcity, and so did talented creators. Actors weren’t sure who was making what, and studios had imperfect information about who to cast. Today, IMDB (and proprietary tools) surface enormous amounts of information for the studios. They know who is working on what, who is a pain in the neck, who can add to the effectiveness of the project. And the creators are part of networks, formal and informal, that get them information faster and more efficiently than a single human often could. The same thing is happening to car dealers. In fact, just about any job where you used to hoard information and charge a fee is now in danger. When your clients know more than you do, it’s difficult to be an old-fashioned agent who is making money based on information scarcity. The alternative is to become a network hub who creates value through information abundance. "
1671,The real scam of ‘influencer’,"December 22, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/the-real-scam-of-influencer/,"Is popular the same as good? Is popular possible? Is popular your goal? There are tens of thousands of humans spending their days trying to be popular on Instagram, buying outfits, wearing hats and seeking their version of cute. People from all backgrounds and genders, hoping to be the next Kardashian. Facebook is filled with anonymous bots seeking to be popular. The highest-paid YouTuber this year was an 8-year old kid. And Twitter is the center of the politi-sphere, with each self-made pundit seeking to outdo the others. Billions of hours spent by millions, mostly for free, to enrich a few social media platforms. The lessons of the high school lunch table run deep. Part of the scam is that the pyramid scheme of attention will somehow pay off for a lot of people. It won’t. It can’t. The math doesn’t hold up. Someone is going to win a lottery, but it probably won’t be us. And a bigger part is that the things you need to do to be popular (the only metric the platforms share) aren’t the things you’d be doing if you were trying to be effective, or grounded, or proud of the work you’re doing. When there’s a single metric (likes/followers), we end up looking in the rear-view mirror when we should be driving instead. Maximizing the benefits for the social media platform you’re on are different than maximizing the benefits for you and those you are leading. "
1672,Nothing is one thing,"December 21, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/nothing-is-one-thing/,"“How was your day?” It’s tempting to answer with just one word. “Fine.” The same way we try to lump a job, a project or a person into a single emotion. As if there’s a prize for brevity, and pressure to categorize a lifetime of experiences and expectations into just a few words or a single feeling. Whatever we’re encountering is a combination of experiences and feelings–from extraordinary to banal to absurd. The real question is, “which part are you focusing on?” If you’re focusing on the part of your day that was “fine”, then you’re ignoring the parts that were a miracle, or disappointing, or thrilling. We get what we pay attention to. Our narration determines what we experience and what we remember. If your narration isn’t helping you, perhaps it pays to focus on something else. “Which part of your day are you experiencing right now?” HT "

1674,On writing a spec,"December 19, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/on-writing-a-spec/,"Good specs force the difficult conversations to happen before they are expensive. If you hand a good spec to a builder or a programmer, the chances that you get back the system you’re hoping for are dramatically increased. For a building, the spec is architectural plans. But give an architect a good spec and she’s much more likely to design a building you’d be happy to live in. This post is mostly about computers and other complicated systems, but the thinking can be used for just about any project where you and your team are asking a system to solve a problem for you. Unlike buildings, computers and other systems change their state all the time, depending on what just happened and what’s supposed to happen next. The spec outlines the inputs to the system and the outputs it creates. If it’s simple, it’s easy to write: Put a quarter into the gumball machine and turn the crank. A gumball comes out. So, at the highest level, we have problems and solutions. I need a gumball is the problem, and the solution is to use this machine to turn a quarter into a gumball by releasing one from an inventory. It gets a bit more complicated when the state of the system might change as the result of previous actions. For example, if the machine is out of gumballs, my spec requires that the quarter be returned. Knowing this, I could also add to the spec that the machine should know how many gumballs are in inventory, and how fast the sales are, so that when it has two or three days of inventory left, it sends a message to headquarters to ask to be refilled. Inputs and outputs. It’s worth noting that my spec doesn’t have to include any information about what gumballs are for, or how much it costs us to make gumballs. We’re defining the inputs and outputs of a system. [It’s totally worth having a different discussion with a different team about your processes, your goals, the people you serve and the problems you seek to solve. Systems work best when they are coherent with what you actually seek to achieve… but we can leave that for another day]. It’s tempting to nail down the precise solutions to each input and output requirement early on. You might decide that the way you’re executing your system should be part of the spec from the beginning. That’s backwards. The system exists for solving problems, and the way the system executes is only there to serve that goal, not the other way around. Maybe you don’t need a 386 processor or a tin roof to solve your problem. Let’s figure out the problem first, and worry about the way we meet your specs second. Grab some index cards and simulate your system. Have each user write down precisely what they want to tell/ask the system and have the person running the system hand back index cards with the results that they can expect. Be clear about the state that the system is in before each transaction and after it as well. The sum total of these interactions is your spec. Bound this with constraints of time and money and performance and you’ve done the hard part. HT "
1675,Successful creatives,"December 18, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/successful-creatives/,"Many of the ones I know are terrible listeners. They don’t actively engage, don’t see the people who are right in front of them, and don’t exercise much in the way of curiosity or empathy. I think they got successful because the idea they had inside of them somehow resonated with enough people that they get to share what they were thinking. But the most reliably successful people I know are precisely the opposite. They are desperate to see and know what’s making other people tick. They actively engage, and they do it with empathy and generosity. The second path is no guarantee, but it’s more likely to work and it’s also a lot more fun. "

1678,Best in category,"December 15, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/best-in-category/,"If you want to please someone with a gift, it’s unlikely that you’ll succeed by buying them a pretty good version of the item in question, even if it’s a great value. Better, the research suggests that you’ll do better to overpay for something in a cheaper category, where it’s obviously the best in the world. This might seem like a hack of the irrational nature of humanity, but if we consider what it means to have a gift exchange, it makes perfect sense. A gift is not a transfer of monetary value. Along the same lines, a monetary Christmas bonus, while rational, might not be as appreciated as something of lower value, precisely because thoughtfulness is difficult to put a price tag on. "
1679,“I don’t know how it could fail”,"December 14, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/i-dont-know-how-it-could-fail/,"That’s a warning sign. So is, “I don’t know how it would fail.” In the first case, you haven’t thought deeply enough (or don’t have enough experience) to imagine how your solution might not work in every case. The best way to make your work better is to get more imaginative about how it could fail to resonate with those you seek to serve. And in the second, once you can imagine that it might not work, it’s really helpful to imagine what failure actually entails. What breaks? What are the side effects? How will you recover? The art of solving problems often involves spending time and energy on what you’ll do when you don’t actually solve the problem. "
1680,Making fairness convenient,"December 13, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/making-fairness-convenient/,"Modernity has caused us to care more about convenience than just about anything. We’ll trade privacy or agency or our ethical standards simply to save a few clicks. That’s a shame. It’s nothing to be proud of. But it’s true. And so, if we want things to be more fair, it helps to make fairness more convenient. Here, for example, is an endless collection of stock photos from Christina Morillo. They’re free, they’re well done and they feature women of color and other under-represented groups. Suddenly, it’s a lot easier to find a photo that opens doors and sets a wider standard for what’s normal. Or consider a company that moves its on-campus recruiting to a college with a more diverse student body. Or an orchestra that defaults to auditioning performers behind an opaque screen. Or a job interview process that uses projects instead of live performance in an unnatural setting. Or a library that uses ramps instead of steps… The well-grooved pathways of habit often cause us to make bad long-term decisions. And often, people run out of energy, time or resolve to do what they know they ought to do, resorting to the easy thing or the practiced thing instead. We know we can do better, but in the meantime, making it more convenient to do work we’re proud of is a good place to start. Fairness might not be more convenient in the short run, but diversity creates measurable value. More in this episode of Akimbo. "

People who knew that they could create fame were careful (often) to bestow it on things and people that they believed had something to offer. As the race for fame becomes ever more breakneck, though, that requirement is fading. While it’s a convenient shortcut, the signal of ‘famous’ is no longer closely related to the desire for ‘good’. "

It’s possible that the example on the screen doesn’t match your experience. It’s possible that you don’t like someone’s politics, but they’re currently doing something interesting… If you can learn something, learn it. It’s tempting to box off all the incoming, to divide it by provenance and to ignore any insight, wisdom or lesson that comes from a questionable/foreign/unfamiliar source. But it’s free. Hiding from it means we can’t benefit from it. We’re more likely to learn from diversity than we are from homogeneity. "
1683,Secession vs. commitment,"December 10, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/secession-vs-commitment/,"Leaving (and the perceived threat of leaving) is a powerful negotiation tactic. When the customer/partner/citizen could bolt at any moment, we act differently. Street vendors know that the prospect is already standing, already on the street, already on their way out the (invisible) door. It changes the dynamic between them, making the short-term the only term. And commitment is a powerful creation tactic. When the parties involved know that they’re committed to a future together, it makes it more likely that they’ll produce a positive new version of how that future can look. Monopolies create unwilling commitment. The customer is trapped. Brands with loyalty earn commitment, and it gives them the freedom to invest in even better work. Nations are now discovering that shifts in loyalty and the transferability of assets are a real issue going forward. One option is to make secession more difficult, the other is to increase the likelihood of individuals choosing to commit. It definitely benefits all concerned to know which path the people you serve are on. And to act accordingly. "

And it’s a choice because the act of being irritated involves the story we tell ourselves. People are rarely irritated by gravity, because gravity got here before us. If you’re telling yourself a story that leads to you being irritated, you’re welcome to change your story. "
1687,Water towers,"December 7, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/water-towers/,"On the top of many apartment buildings (and on a hill in many towns) you’ll find a water tower, a large wooden or metal container holding tons of water. Why bother? It turns out that a pump that slowly and consistently pumps water uphill is way more efficient than the high-powered, high-capacity pump you’d need to meet spikes in demand. By using gravity to assist during times of heavy load, the consistent and more efficient pump gets the job done by planning ahead. We all need a water tower somewhere in our work. "
1688,Only the hits,"December 6, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/only-the-hits/,"The economics are compelling. Start a movie studio, a record label or a book publisher that only markets hits. No clunkers. No filler. Simply the hits. Easier than it sounds. Why doesn’t a musician go straight to a “greatest hits” record and save everyone a lot of time and hassle? Why doesn’t a salesperson only call on people who are sure to buy? Because no one knows anything. You won’t know if it’s a hit until after you bring it to market. Dylan recorded 50 albums. Picasso painted 10,000 paintings. VCs fund hundreds of businesses. Do your best. Then ship.   "
1689,The thing about hot button issues,"December 5, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/the-thing-about-hot-button-issues/,"It’s not that they are buttons. It’s that they’re hot. They’re hot because they get pressed all the time. They’re hot because they’re seductive. It’s an easy button to push, so people push it all the time. And that can get you burned. It can short circuit the point you were trying to make. It turns out that there are plenty of other buttons, often ignored, that people are eager to activate. Plenty of topics and fears and dreams and beliefs that are just waiting to be seen and engaged with. We don’t need the risky shortcut of the hot button. It’s not going to work anyway. "
1690,Losing with style,"December 4, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/losing-with-style/,"The math is compelling. You’re going to lose most of the competitions you enter. How could it be any other way? With a hundred or a thousand or a billion people competing, only one wins. Which means that you’re going to be seen and measured by how you lose, not how you win. The way to win is usually to fit in all the way, to give the judges precisely what they want, to train just like everyone else, but harder. But the way to lose with style is to create possibility. To be creative. To do generous work that’s worth talking about. If you’re going to lose (and you probably will), why not lose with style? "
1691,Attention vs. the chasm,"December 3, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/attention-vs-the-chasm/,"I’ve heard from people who have theorized that Tesla’s window-breaking launch of the super-brutal pickup truck was either an intentional fail (look at all the publicity they got!) or a success (look at all the pre-orders they got!). The thinking goes that all attention is good attention, and that in our ever-faster, attention-starved marketplace, all that matters is clicks. One way they’re thinking about it: Attention is the new innovation. I don’t agree. A decade ago, innovation was the way to earn action from the early adopters. Innovation got you into Wired, innovation gave your fans something to talk about, innovation satisfied people in search of the new. But marketers in search of widespread impact learned an important lesson: Innovation is fun, but innovation isn’t the answer to the challenge of reaching a larger audience. Moore’s Crossing the Chasm helped marketers see that while innovation was the tool to reach the small group of early adopters and opinion leaders, it was insufficient to reach the masses. Because the masses don’t want something that’s new, they want something that works, something that others are using, something that actually solves their productivity and community problems. Therefore, to move to a bigger market, tech companies need the network effect and they need patience. Tim Cook created the profitable engine that is Apple by abandoning nerds like me and focusing on making a low-innovation luxury product instead. Amazon innovates in some areas, but their online shopping (and AWS) are insanely boring, stable and focused on reaching more people. [Note! There’s no requirement to seek a mass audience. It’s a choice. That’s why most of us are better off serving the smallest viable audience, not jumping through the cycles necessary to cross the chasm.] The lesson is simple: Early adopters are thrilled by the new. They seek innovation. Everyone else is wary of failure. They seek trust. Back to Tesla. They’ve spent billions trying to move from a weird nerd vehicle for geeks to a mainstream car audience. And it’s working. The Model 3 is reaching people who didn’t even consider the original Roadster. This type of customer (which means most people, perhaps 80% of any market) is asking questions about reliability and wondering what they’ll tell their friends and spouse if they buy one. (If this sounds familiar, the very same thing happened with the Mac from 1984 until 1998… almost fifteen years of slowly moving to ‘normal’.) Can I trust this brand? Can I trust this product to keep its promises? Can I trust my social circle to applaud my choice? If Tesla was trying to continue along this proven route, the right move would be to make a pickup truck (which is, surprisingly to some, the bestselling single car model in the US) that would have done to the Ford F150 what the Model 3 does to a mid-market Mercedes. Innovative, but not too. Better, in all the ways that the mass market cares about. New, of course it’s new, but new and trustworthy. The first customers would have been innovators (that’s always who the first customers are) but they would have had a story they could easily tell to their friends and family. The story of, “I’m smart and bold and connected and this is obviously a better choice.” But instead, in this new age in which attention is a substitute for useful innovation, they burned that trust by seeking attention instead. The thing is, innovation has long-term benefits for all of us. The craven search for attention at all costs does not. Musicians have figured this out–every new song has to push the envelope, has to somehow make things better and be new enough to matter–but at the same time, they can’t burn the trust of audience they’ve earned to date. The Who can smash guitars and Dylan can mumble, but Kenny G can’t do either. When everyone is a marketer and when everyone has a platform and when everyone can burn trust to seek attention, this is a useful lesson for each of us. Because in the short run, while attention can feel like a proxy for innovation, when it comes to actual commitments, most customers choose trust instead of commotion. "
1692,Deep connection,"December 2, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/deep-connection/,"When someone tells you what you need to hear, instead of what you’re hoping to hear, you’ve found something priceless. This takes care, generosity and guts to achieve. When you offer this gift to someone else, it might seem like it’s unappreciated. But you didn’t do it to be appreciated, you did it because you care enough to work for a deep connection, one that makes things better. Best to devote that energy to people and causes that can run with it. "
1693,The attention crisis is real,"December 1, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/12/the-attention-crisis-is-real/,"It’s all happening at once, and we have to choose. What to read, listen to, answer? A spam from a scammer An @ mention on Slack A voice mail from the boss An email from a customer A DM on Slack A last-minute sale email from a store you’ve never visited A year-old blog post A new blog post A new podcast A …   [sorry, got distracted.] The idea that we can strip mine attention, wasting what we don’t need, is long gone. Like oysters and oil before it, attention is a scarce resource, and we need to use it wisely. Too often, it feels cheaper to simply take what we can get, but when we overreach, the cost in trust is real. And each of us gets the same amount of attention to spend each day. It’s a competitive advantage to figure out how to focus it to get something done. "
1694,The transition to leadership,"November 30, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/the-transition-to-leadership/,"The flawed theory is that A+ students become good leaders. There’s no reason to think that this should be true. Doing well on tests, paying attention to what’s being asked, being diligent in short-term error correction–these are three hallmarks of someone who is good at school. None of these are important once you’re charged with charting a new path, with figuring out what to do next. In fact, they get in the way. We invented the educational regime to produce compliant factory workers. But the most compliant aren’t always suited to be the bravest, the most empathic or the most intuitive. "

1696,Better/worse,"November 28, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/better-worse/,"When things get difficult, is your instinct to invest the effort to make it better, or to set a trap so it all gets worse? Because if things get worse, well, then you won’t have to deal with them much longer. And if things get worse, then you’re off the hook. No longer your problem. If we don’t trust ourselves with making it better, if it’s too fraught with risk or emotionally painful, it might feel easier and simpler to simply make it worse and walk away. Investing in a system, a place, a relationship, a project–that’s a commitment. It puts you even more on the hook. That person who is right in front of you becomes more real and the problem becomes even more urgent.

That’s good for platforms that want to deliver the endorphin hit of a mic drop, but not particularly helpful in sharing complex ideas.

1698,A chance for better,"November 26, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good/,"Perfect is the enemy of good. Of course it is. But that simple sentence becomes more urgent when we realize that nothing (and no one) is perfect. How could it be? And so, if your hero, your cause, your holiday, your background, your relationship… if it’s not perfect, does that mean you should hide it? Be ashamed of it? Be afraid of it? We’re surrounded by injustice, and yesterday was even worse. It’s so easy to find things that are imperfect and criticize them or worse, shame them. Better, I think, to find glimmers of good and seek to amplify them. Mistakes can be seen, errors can be improved upon, progress can be made. But only if we embrace the chance for good. The imperfect is an opportunity for better. "

And we also have the choice to mindfully accept whatever happens next. Acceptance is a choice in the service of our happiness and the ability to try again tomorrow. When we detach our emotional state from the results of our effort, we maximize the chances that our effort will be focused and effective. We’re not trying to control the outcome, simply putting our best effort into creating the conditions that lead to the desired outcome. The opportunity is: "
1701,Knowing the answer before you ask the question,"November 23, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/knowing-the-answer-before-you-ask-the-question/,"The first rule of cross-examination at trial is that you never ask a question that you don’t already know the answer to. Inquiry has a place. Inquiry in the pursuit of science, of discovery and of learning is essential. But inquiry almost never belongs in a presentation. That’s because the presentation exists to communicate what you already know, not to discover something new. That’s why comedians try out their new material in small clubs. That’s why you should try out your job interview answers long before you go on a job interview. And that’s why you shouldn’t throw a steel ball at the window of the new truck you’re launching unless you’re really, really sure it’s not going to break. [Either that, or know that what you’re selling is live magic, the possibility of ‘it might not work,’ the generosity of art in the moment. But they rarely belong in the same interaction.] "

Moving the hole placement is a big deal, accompanied by meetings and oversight. A big shift is whether or not it rained last week. On the other hand, every wave is the first and last of its kind. It has never happened before and will never happen again. Golf is an endless asymptotic journey toward elusive perfection. Surfing, on the other hand, is about wayfinding. A surf park with a repeated wave might be useful for training, but it’s not surfing. Metaphor over, the question is: what’s your job like? It gets a lot easier if you bring the appropriate mindset. It’s hard to surf with a putter. "
1703,The uses of Kickstarter,"November 21, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/the-uses-of-kickstarter/,"A friend reached out because she’s thinking of using Kickstarter to fund her new book. That conversation led to a discussion about what Kickstarter is actually good at and how to use it. It turns out that there are many options (and some misunderstanding as well). The uses of Kickstarter: To raise money you don’t have for a project that you’ll be able to build and then ship to your supporters and people who already know you and trust you. To create a community for an art project that isn’t designed to be a profitable business. To have a temporary online store (instead of something more permanent, like Shopify), where you can run a pop-up and then be done (and move on to the next thing). It’s an effective way to highlight the tension of go/no go. To capture the energy and attention of large numbers of people who don’t know your work (this almost never ever works and is the worst of these reasons).* To give your existing fans and followers an organized way to support you and to see it unfold in real-time. To have a simple, structured place to put your idea. By limiting your options and giving you deniability, it makes it easier for some to move forward. To give you a safe place to succeed as well as to not-succeed. There’s a limit on the time and money you can invest because of the structure of the platform. Most of the time, for most projects, Kickstarter isn’t the answer to the question you’re asking. That’s because it could more accurately be called Kickfinisher–you build a following first, over time, and then Kickstarter is the moment in time that those followers show up for your work. More here.   *Kickstarter is powerful when used as intended. But it’s not very good at creating ‘hits’. It turns out that while 17,000,000 users have, in total, funded 173,000 projects, that’s only about a third of the total. 290,000 projects haven’t succeeded in being funded at all. And only 400 projects raised more than a million dollars each. That means your chances of creating a viral hit that reaches strangers who will engage with your work is about one in a thousand. "
1704,Which signal?,"November 20, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/which-signal/,"We have far more than five senses, and people communicate with us using many of them. You can receive a message via visual inputs, sound, text, smell, taste, touch, temperature, pheromones, sub-sonic rumbling and/or subtle facial gestures. You can feel comforted or jostled, part of a trusted circle or all alone. You can absorb the confidence radiated by a professional or feel the insecurity in someone who is overwhelmed. You don’t have to know how to read Finnish to be able to make a judgment about the quality of a product or its instructions–all you need to do is glance at it. And you decide if you’re going to like a restaurant long before the food arrives. Words on paper were a magical interregnum, a low-cost, editable, permanent way to tell a story as completely as we could while limiting ourselves to nothing but a keyboard. But people have always been hungry for more inputs than this, hence the race to deliver content that moves on its own accord, that spreads more quickly and that activates more visceral reactions than a static book or blog post can.

1705,The Google tax,"November 19, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/the-google-tax/,"Actually, there are two. The first is the tax we each pay so that companies can bid against each other to buy traffic from Google. Because their revenue model is (cleverly) built on both direct marketing and an auction, they are able to keep a significant portion of the margin from many industries. They’ve become the internet’s landlord. The difference between a successful business in New York and an unsuccessful one is just a few percentage points–the successful ones pay 95% of their profit to landlords, while the unsuccessful ones pay 105%. It doesn’t matter if there are competitors to Google in search: the model of bidding for attention is so economically compelling (because attention is so scarce), that companies are going to be paying ever more to reach people in this way–or allow their competitors to do so. The second is harder to see: Because Google has made it ever more difficult for sites to be found, previously successful businesses like Groupon, Travelocity and Hipmunk suffer. As a result, new web companies are significantly harder to fund and build. If you’re dependent on being found in a Google search, it’s probably worth rethinking your plan. The open web (and search… particularly Google) has created huge benefits in access, competitiveness and selection for so many markets. At the same time, there are structural challenges that are making the future less commercially interesting in many ways. Capitalism is an efficient system for surfacing and addressing the needs of consumers. But once it veers toward control over markets by a single entity, those benefits disappear. The existence of DuckDuckGo doesn’t significantly change Google’s position as a monopoly able to dictate how most people experience everything on the web. "
1706,How do you know when it’s ready?,"November 18, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/how-do-you-know-when-its-done-2/,"It’s an important question, one that helps you understand if you have standards and a vision in mind. A great chef knows when a dish is done. She knows that any changes to the temperature or spices will make it worse, not better. Miles Davis knew that Kind of Blue was done. Any more takes and tweaks would have made it less, not more. When I see a mediocre movie, read an unfunny section of Mad Magazine or engage with forgettable services, I wonder if they decided, “well, I’m out of time, so it’s done.” That’s not a useful standard.   PS Today’s the first day of lessons for the new story skills workshop with bestselling author Bernadette Jiwa.

1707,This might vs. this better,"November 17, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/this-might-vs-this-better/,"Most of the time, we approach our tasks with the mantra of, “this better work.” Far better to say, “this might work.” If you’re designing a bridge or a pacemaker, I’m begging you to embrace established norms and build something that’s going to work, every single time. For the rest of us, though, the task is to leap forward, to improve, to explore the next frontier. “This might work” is the slogan for a scientist, an artist and a linchpin. "
1708,Break the lecture,"November 16, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/break-the-lecture/,"In 1805, if you listened to music, you heard it live. Every time. Today, perhaps 1% of all the music we hear is live, if that. In 1805, if you listened to a lecture for school or work, you heard it live. Every time. Today, that’s still true. That’s crazy. Ten years ago, Sal Khan pointed out that thanks to the internet, we should have students watching best-in-class lectures at home, after school… and doing their homework together, with teachers, during the day. (HT to Alison King who wrote about this 26 years ago). That hasn’t happened yet, but it should. If we’re going to persist in creating hyper-expensive live lectures for millions of people every day, perhaps it’s time to change the dynamic. Imagine that there’s an app (I’ll call it Backchannel) and that the lecturer or her assistant has a dashboard. Every student already has a phone. Let’s put them to use. The Backchannel app begins by blocking all other apps–by reporting student participation. If we’re going to do this expensive lecture process in real-time, at the very least you can stop checking Facebook. Second, the lecturer can at any time ask for students to answer a simple question about what’s being discussed. If a lot of students can’t answer the question, time to slow down. On the other hand, the Backchannel app can also act as a tool for students to anonymously let the lecturer (and the system) know that they’re bored. It’s hard to embrace how obvious this is, and yet it doesn’t get done. The app can show via the dashboard how active each student is, by percentage or even by name. Questions can stream in from the app, so the lecturer can get a quick view of what needs to be covered. Students can have a discussion with one another (no private chats, though) about the last few minutes of what was covered. It’s asynchronous and can lead to far more airtime for people who might not be brave enough to raise a hand. And of course, just as the school is rating the students (that’s a core tenet of the education-industrial complex) the students can rate every lecture, every time. What a dramatic shift in power, in attention and in reporting. If we ended up with a classroom where the lecturers were on their toes, where students were actively engaged at all times and where the interactions were far more in sync, wouldn’t that be worth the hassle of putting our devices to better use? We can build this and start using it right now, not someday. If we insist on lectures being the way they’ve always been, which is a one-way recitation, then let’s simply have students watch best-in-class recordings instead of the wasteful act of recreating them live, every time. But if we’re going to do it live, then let’s actually do it live. "
1709,Compared to what?,"November 15, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/compared-to-what-2/,"Are today’s 50 richest billionaires happier than the 50 richest people who lived twenty years ago? It’s unlikely. And yet they control many times as much wealth. If you take a date to the fanciest, most exclusive restaurant in Portland, you may find the satisfaction that comes from having done something exclusive. On the other hand, if you were at that very same restaurant in Los Angeles, it might feel like a disappointing compromise. Same food, different status. A 440-foot yacht isn’t better than a 200-foot yacht, unless we’re measuring ‘better’ in terms of status. And of course, once someone has a 445-foot yacht, then the 440-foot model is a lot less attractive, isn’t it? And that’s why status-seekers need limits. The Citation X can fly at 711 miles an hour. And no matter how much you spend, you can’t buy a jet that will go 800 miles an hour. Because the laws of physics (combined with the laws on sonic booms) make it impossible with our current technology. As a result, the owner of a Citation X can find the satisfaction that he has reached the limit. There are two dangers of measuring happiness along just one axis. The first is that you will be easily disappointed, because the unbalanced approach to maximizing a single variable increases the chance that you will end up behind. And the second is that you might actually succeed in hitting a limit. And then where will you find your happiness? We (everyone around us) come out ahead when we create positive externalities for people who are competing to win. When folks are seeking to compete on who can build the most libraries, endow the most scholarships, and yes, pay the most taxes, it leads to a positive cycle of better. And we challenge our sports heroes to beat each other senseless as a form of entertainment. But only within the rules. Life without limits rarely leads to satisfaction. And billionaires who pay taxes aren’t less driven or less happy than billionaires who don’t. For them, for all single-axis competitors, it’s the game, the hierarchy, the rankings that matter. In fact, that’s true for just about everyone who cares about status. Boundaries are what allow games of status to exist. "
1710,Allies and accomplices,"November 14, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/allies-and-accomplices/,"To be an ally means that you won’t get in the way, and, if you are able to, you’ll try to help. To become an accomplice, though, means that you’ve risked something, sacrificed something and put yourself on the hook as well. We need more allies, in all the work we do. Allies can open doors and help us feel a lot less alone. But finding an accomplice–that’s an extraordinary leap forward. Willie Jackson is leading that conversation in an area where we need it urgently: around race. Once you see it there, you’ll see it everywhere. When do we care enough to lean into the work, the mission or the problem? Even if we think it’s “someone else’s work.” Because it probably belongs to us as well. "

All you need to do to feel busy is to try to get two things done at once–or seek to beat a deadline that is stressing you out. Productivity, on the other hand, has little to do with busy. Productivity requires bringing soft skills (real skills) to the table in service of the generous work you seek to do. Productivity is learned. And productivity takes guts. We just wrapped up the most recent session of the altMBA, and I was thrilled to see the energy and insight each contributor brought to the workshop. The feedback from our thousands of graduates doesn’t vary by country, by profession, by age or by the scale of their project. People are discovering that once they get out of their own way, they can get a huge amount done. Once you see what’s possible, it’s amazing how much you can contribute. Learning is not the same as education, and busy is not the same as productive. Today is the last day to apply for the next session of the altMBA. I hope you’ll check it out. "

We don’t notice people when they’re not in front of us. Of the tens of thousands of people, familiar and famous, that we know, we spend precious little time concerned about the ins and outs of their day. And more poignantly, the same is true for the way the world ignores our day to day as well. Humans’ selfish survival instinct is to be aware of whoever is on stage in front of us, and then to move on to the next urgency. It’s a trap to believe that anyone in the world is as concerned about the noise in your head as you are. Copernicus was right–the world doesn’t revolve around us. Most of the time, the world doesn’t even notice. That doesn’t make your narrative less overwhelming, but it’s a useful reminder that just about everyone would appreciate being noticed a little more. Particularly when they’re off stage. "
1714,Maintainers,"November 10, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/maintainers/,"School trains people to work as maintainers. “The sculptures are all here in the gallery, make sure they are still here at the end of the shift… The floor is clean when you start, make sure it’s clean when you finish… The policy manual has seven rules in it, please don’t break them… The next ten patients are going to need allergy tests…” There are customers to be served, standards to be maintained, work to be done. Important work, no doubt, but not thrilling. A few people somehow avoid these lessons and become instigators, impresarios and disruptors instead. They’re not only dancing with infinity but completely unsure what’s going to work, and yet they are hooked on leaping forward. I think it’s possible to switch from one posture to the other. I know that it’s incredibly difficult, though. And it’s hard to do both at the same time. Choose wisely. "
1715,The difference between memorization and learning,"November 9, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/the-difference-between-memorization-and-learning/,"In order to learn something, you must understand it. You might become so insightful and facile with the ideas that it appears you’ve memorized them, but that’s just a side effect. Rote memorization can be done in some fields, and you can even recite what you’ve memorized to someone else who can memorize it. For example: You can’t learn alphabetical order, you can only memorize it. On the other hand, memorizing anything that you’ll need to build upon, improvise on or improve is foolish. You’ll need to do the work of understanding it instead. "
1716,“As a technologist…”,"November 8, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/as-a-technologist/,"If two people are having a discussion about the resilience of the food chain, and one says, “as a farmer…” it’s likely that this statement carries some weight. The same goes for the opinion of an admiral if we’re talking about naval operations, or a copy editor if we’re talking about grammar. The question is: Why isn’t everyone already a technologist? Given that technology has been the defining cultural and economic driver of the last fifty years, why sign up to be a victim of what’s next?   Bonuses! A new article in the latest issue of the MIT Sloan Management Review. And a recent episode of my podcast Akimbo is worth checking out. It’s about impostors. "
1717,741741 — To be seen,"November 7, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/741741-to-be-seen/,"A few years ago, Nancy Lublin discovered something obvious. Nancy was the CEO of Dosomething.org, the largest teenage charity in the world. In order to keep up with its members, Dosomething shifted their communications from email to texting (yes, that’s obvious, but that’s not what she discovered). Monitoring the effectiveness of the texts, she realized that even though the millions of texts they were sending were clearly announcements, not personal notes, kids were texting back. Texting is such a personal medium that it’s easy to see how the natural thing to do with an incoming text sent with permission is to write back. Within days, Nancy was seeing that many of the return texts were from kids in trouble. Kids who were being abused, or suffering with mental issues. People who needed to be seen. And so, Crisis Text Line was born. Thousands of trained volunteers in the US (741741), Canada (686868) and the UK (85258) fielding millions of text messages from people who need to be seen and heard. Not just teens. It’s not an exaggeration to say that they’ve saved thousands of lives. CTL is running a fundraiser, but that’s not why I’m posting this today. I’m posting it because someone you know might need the number. Humans need to be seen and heard. And when we’re in crisis, the privacy and speed of a text is magical. 741741. Use it wisely. Spread the word. "
1718,The right tool,"November 6, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/the-right-tool/,"Umbrellas are a fabulous invention. You can use one when you need it, but you shouldn’t confuse it with a grapefruit. Just because something is handy doesn’t mean it’s the right tool for the job. "
1719,What are the margins for?,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/what-are-the-margins-for/,"A publisher recently sent me a 1,000 page book. The paper was perfect in its balance between opacity and thinness, but the margins were too small. The production designer made a choice–push the text all the way to the edges, allowing the book to shave 20 or 30 pages in length. Sensible. Except now, every single page seems cramped. The book is tense and can’t relax, and feels faintly amateurish. Why would a missing half-inch strip of white paper matter? All of our media has margins. Even as computer and phone companies have made bezels ever smaller, we still want there to be a margin, a space between the thing we’re engaging with and the rest of the world. Movies have coming attractions and credits. Record albums have a few seconds between songs. Paintings have a frame, or a wall separating them from the next… The edges do more than delineate. They give the person encountering the work confidence that a professional made it, someone who has an eye for what seems right and can respect the edges. It takes discipline to only go near the margin when you’re doing it on purpose, to make a point, not all the time. Jackson Pollock not only abandoned the frame, he violated our understanding of the margin as well. But because he did it with intent, not out of commercial necessity or ignorance, his point was made. The self-discipline to see the margin and use it as a tool is a gift we offer the consumer of culture. "
1720,Slack rules of life,"November 5, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/slack-rules-of-life/,"Create a new channel for every project. Invite the right people to join the channel to work on it. Every project has a beginning, and it has an ending as well. Don’t start a channel if you’re not prepared to end it. When a project isn’t helping you reach your longer-term goals, leave the channel. Direct messages demand clarity and care. And teams do better when communication is shared. Remember that your reputation moves with you, from channel to channel. Emotions are real, but emojis can be a distraction. "
1721,All or some?,"November 4, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/all-or-some/,"When we’re wrestling with outsourcing project work, a key question is: Do we give someone the entire project, or do we break it into pieces? Should you have the architect also handle the budgets, the materials, the labor, the permits–all of it? Or should you project manage the thing and hire people for each discrete action? Should you have your favorite freelance programmer build every element of the website, or should you have her only focus on her core skills and then you farm out the rest? The axes are: Coordination vs Span. Coordination costs you. You need to manage it. Make sure the details match up. Get the information flow right. Coordination benefits you, because you can work in parallel, with experts. Span of work benefits you, because one person or a tiny team sees it all. On the other hand, span of control costs you, because it means that much of the time, the work is being done by a non-expert. If you give one person the entire project, then coordination costs go way down. It’s all in her head, and shortcuts present themselves. On the other hand, if you break a project into tiny parts, you can find exactly the right person or process for that part, and often, they can be done simultaneously. This is obvious, of course, but we forget to ask the question. That’s the hard part. "
1722,Annoyed,"November 3, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/annoyed/,"Does being annoyed serve any useful purpose? If it does, are there classes you can take or experiences you can pay for that help you become annoyed? We have gyms to get fit and mindfulness exercises to get calm, but I’m not sure I’m seeing a widespread movement toward seeking annoyance. So, if being annoyed is simply a side effect of something else we do, and it’s not actually useful, why do we work so hard to amplify the annoyance we feel? Why create a narrative, push hard against the powerless bureaucrat or the stuck pickle jar simply to make ourselves even more annoyed? The only person who is getting taught a lesson is us. "
1723,A year from now…,"November 2, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/a-year-from-now/,Will today’s emergency even be remembered? Will that thing you’re particularly anxious about have been hardly worth the time you put into it? Better question: What could you do today that would matter a year from now? 
1724,The process vs. the outcome,"November 1, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/11/the-process-vs-the-outcome/,"A sports fan, a zealot and a hack all look at the outcome before they decide if they’re happy with the process that led to it. On the other hand, a scientist, an engineer or anyone searching for fairness and utility insist on a reliable process and learn to live with the outcomes (or even better, learn to work hard to change the inputs so that the next time, the useful process delivers a desired outcome.) Instead of asking, “how did my team do?” we can begin with, “did the system do what it’s supposed to do?” You can game the process for a little while, but that approach will always catch up with you. On the other hand, when you learn to understand first principles, you can work with them forever. The process that gets you answers you want most of the time is probably a process worth trusting even when the answers don’t match your belief system in the moment. Yelling at the ref because you don’t like a call against your team is not nearly as effective as insisting that your team train harder or find a better strategy. "
1725,Which change?,"October 31, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/which-change/,"You can change the way people get the things they want. Or you can change what they want. Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates are two of the wealthiest people in history. They got that way by changing how people used tools to find new ways to get what they already wanted. Nelson Mandela and Jacqueline Novogratz picked a different mission. Trying to change what people want in the first place. Both paths are available, but they’re different.   PS The only way to create action where there is none is to tell a story that resonates.

1726,Bread and books,"October 30, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/bread-and-books/,"Twenty years ago, I met the most famous baker in the world. I was in Paris for a speech, and visited Poilane, a bakery much smaller than its reputation would lead you to believe. I was hoping to take home an unbaked kilo of dough, a sourdough, one that I could use to spawn hundreds of new loaves over the years. Proud of my sneakiness, I began by ordering $30 worth of loaves and tarts. And then, offhandedly said, “and an unbaked loaf please.” The clerks would have none of this. It was impossible, it wasn’t done, it wasn’t permitted. Bluffing, I said, “I’m confident that M. Poilane would be okay with it.” On cue, a door behind the counter opened and a handsome man, dressed in a smock, came out to introduce himself. Even before he spoke, I could see the sparkle in his smile, and I figured we would hit it off. Instead of shooing me away, he invited me into his office. We spent two or three hours together that day, talking about his work. He showed me his huge library on the history of bread and we hung out in the basement, where it was over 100 degrees because of the wood-burning ovens. He sent me home with 2 kilos of unbaked dough. I kept that starter alive for years. Lionel understood that bread shared wasn’t bread lost. That no one was going to be able to steal his sourdough, even if they grew their own version at home. Over several years, he and I got together for long lunches in Paris when I was in town for a speech. I taught him about the internet, and he taught me about the magical intersection between generosity and idiosyncracy. Ideas, bread and books are all the same–they’re better when they’re shared. The posture of generosity and connection replaces a mindset of scarcity, and Lionel modeled this philosophy every day. When he and his wife were killed in a tragic helicopter crash, he left behind friends all over the world as well as two teenaged daughters. I honored his memory in the best way I could think of–by dedicating a book to him. My challenge was that I didn’t have a book in the works, nor was I planning to write one. The book I wrote, so that I could have a book to dedicate to Lionel, was Purple Cow. It captured his energy and his care and his impact on so many. And it changed the arc of my career as a writer as well. Lionel’s eldest daughter, Apollonia, immediately stepped up and took over the bakery, a task that few outsiders felt she could handle. After all, she was only a kid. And the patriarchal mindset in her industry and city didn’t help. Not only has the quality of the bakery been maintained, but its impact has only grown. Apollonia has modeled the clarity and contribution of her dad, and has shown us what it means to share ideas and to lead. From the first moment, she showed up in a way that honored the memory of her parents. Generosity, abundance and idiosyncrasy in service of craft and community. Her new book, her first in English, is out this week. Her dad changed my life, and her bread and the way she talks about it might change yours. "
1727,“Get what you want without compromise”,"October 29, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/get-what-you-want-without-compromise/,"That’s the call of our times. Run a marathon without getting tired. Lose weight without dieting. Get ahead without working hard. Earn big money without risk… When you expose it this clearly, it’s obviously nonsense. Compromise is precisely what’s called for. You can’t have everything you want. But, if you care enough and trade enough and work hard enough, you might be able to get some things that matter. The real question might not be, “what do you want,” it might be, “what do you care enough to compromise for?”   PS Today’s the last day to sign up for The Freelancer’s Workshop. This is our last session of the year. Time to start doing the work to earn better clients. "
1728,On quitting a freelance gig,"October 28, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/on-quitting/,"A powerful thing a freelancer can do for her career is to figure out when to fire the bad clients. Firing bad clients is an essential step on the way to finding better ones. Identifying a client mismatch: Quitting in a huff rarely changes the approach a client takes. Instead, it’s the erosion of esteem and resources that eventually help them wake up. They don’t have to be fired with drama. In fact, everyone wins when you hand off a mismatched client to someone who can do a better job than you can in dealing with their needs and approaches. Freelancers need to worry about doing the right thing as well as maintaining their reputation. Leaving a project in midstream hurts your reputation, and your promise needs to mean something. But sometimes we express our fear of change by sticking around longer than we need to and longer than we promised to. The magic of freelancing is that projects end but careers persist. If you can walk away from a project at an end point, it probably moves your career forward more smoothly than if you develop the habit of quitting in the middle. A few questions to consider as you think this through: One last thought: The best time to think through questions about ending a gig is before you take the gig. Having a set of principles makes it far easier to handle the pressures and grind of the hardest days of your work, because you’re making strategic choices, not decisions under duress. We talk more about this here. "
1729,“Where does this bus go?”,"October 27, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/where-does-this-bus-go/,"One approach, which is tempting in the short run, is to wait until people are on the bus and then ask each person where they want to go. Seek to build consensus. Try not to leave anyone out. The other approach, which works far better if you have a fleet of available buses, is to announce in advance where the bus is going. That way, anyone who wants to go where you’re headed can get onboard. Enrollment is critical. Enrollment allows leaders to lead. Not by endlessly querying those that they seek to serve, but by announcing their destination and then heading there, with all deliberate speed. "
1730,Short and funny,"October 26, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/short-and-funny/,"If we only forward the easy, short and funny things we read online, why are we surprised that our inbox is filled with nothing we’ll remember tomorrow? What would happened if instead, we shared the most complex, useful and thoughtful things we discovered instead? "
1731,“What’s the hard part?”,"October 25, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/whats-the-hard-part/,"A simple question, often overlooked, as if ignoring it will make the problem go away. Everything worth doing has a hard part. If it didn’t, it would have been done already. The hard part, we can hope, will become easier if you allocate resources and focus and effort. That’s the point of the work, to whittle away at the hard part. But, if we refuse to ask and answer, then how can we possibly focus on what matters? It’s often a lot more fun and relaxing to focus on the parts that aren’t hard. Or to pretend that the hard part is easy. Better, I think, if we’ve decided that the work is worth doing, to get serious about the parts that are worth our effort. "
1732,All or nothing,"October 24, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/all-or-nothing/,"Projects often require tools. The right tool gets the job done (all of it) and an inferior one leaves it undone (none of it). There’s a spectrum of cost, though. Tools require different levels of expense to purchase and use. If you use a cheap tool, you might end up with nothing. Use the right tool, and you get the desired result. Because the cost of tools usually fills out a linear scale from cheap to expensive, we can be lulled into believing that the results are also on a linear scale. But that’s not true. You’ll need to spend enough to get anything at all. Less than that is a total waste of time and money. Better to use a tool that cost more than you expected than to use a cheap tool and get nothing in return.   PS The first lesson for The Freelancer’s Workshop went live this week. Today’s a great day to join. We teach technique, but mostly we help you become more brave. "
1733,Two buttons on offer,"October 23, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/two-buttons-on-offer/,"Every person in your organization needs to wear a button. And they can choose one of two. The choice is up to them, but they have to own it. One button says, “I don’t care.” The other button says, “I’d like to help.” It’s entirely possible that you’ve managed your way into a bureaucracy that acts like it’s wearing the first button. If that’s true, admit it and have you and your team put on the buttons. You’ll save a lot of heartache by telling us and your co-workers the truth. On the other hand, if you want the satisfaction that comes from wearing the second button, you’ve got to keep the promise. "
1734,Up and to the right,"October 22, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/up-and-to-the-right/,"The typical performance chart has two axes. And one is time. We can’t do anything at all about time, so there’s really one axis. How fast did your profits grow? How many followers did you add to your account? How much muscle did you add to your calves? The problem with a graph that only has one axis is that it’s dumb. No room for nuance. It’s a blunt instrument, easy to game. If you want your profits to go up faster, simply cut corners. If you want more followers, buy them, or lower your standards, or pick a fight. And if you want to add muscle faster, sacrifice your health… Adults are better off realizing that we have the patience and intelligence to measure our lives on two or more axes. Which means that instead of just one quadrant, there are four. That maybe it makes sense to choose to pursue something longer term, more resilient, more important. That maybe the metric that was chosen for everyone isn’t really the metric you care about it.   PS Applications are now open for the next session of the altMBA. Today’s the Early Deadline, and the best chance to set your sights for 2020 (yes, it’s almost 2020). The altMBA is a powerful, proven approach to leveling up and making work matter. "
1735,The limits of technique,"October 21, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/the-limits-of-technique/,It’s possible that you no longer need to get better at your craft. That your craft is just fine. It’s possible that you need to be braver instead. 
1736,The simple dynamics of failing retail,"October 20, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/the-simple-dynamics-of-failing-retail/,"The local retailer says, “I’m sitting here all day, with a limited selection and a paid staff, waiting for you to come and buy something I have in inventory. I’m paying rent, just waiting for you to come in, try things on and pay for them.” The online retailer says, “I can use the same size staff to serve a town of a million, not a few thousand. I have a much bigger inventory, of course, but my rent and my staffing costs are tiny. And so what I sell you costs a lot less.” The local retailer depended on two groups of people: Folks who needed or wanted the hands-on service, the ability to try things on and the chance to chat. And, people who didn’t demand those things but had no choice because there were no other options. When online showed up, the second group defected. And with just the first group remaining, most local retailers are doomed. The answer isn’t to figure out how to be as cheap as Amazon… you can’t. The answer is to figure out how to find the people (and the products and services they demand) so you can eagerly and comfortably charge a fair price. "
1737,‘Not good enough’ is an easy place to hide,"October 19, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/not-good-enough-is-an-easy-place-to-hide/,"Sniffing at the others who care is a form of virtue signalling. It’s also an ineffective way to create real change. “My Prius Hybrid gets 140 miles per gallon.” “My Tesla is solar powered.” “Really, well I take an electric scooter.” “We carpool by sharing a horse.” “A horse? You should walk!” This misses the real problem: The 1998 Chevy Suburban, with just one person on board, doing a forty-mile commute at 12 miles per gallon. The same goes for ranking elected officials on who is the most perfect on the issue we care about. The people who are paying attention are the ones who are trying. And shaming people who are trying because they’re not perfect is a terrific way to discourage them from trying. On the other hand, the core of every system is filled with the status quo, a status quo that isn’t even paying attention. Focusing the group’s energy on shutting down strip-mined coal is going to make far more impact than scolding the few who are trying. "
1738,The enthusiasm correlation,"October 18, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/the-enthusiasm-correlation/,"That fan at the game, the one who was cheering the whole time… That audience member, the one that gave a long standing ovation after laughing through the whole show… And that team member, who eagerly participated in the last meeting… Surveys showed that they had a truly great time. They were glad to be there and thought it was a terrific day. The question: were they enthusiastic because it was a great event? Or did it feel like a great event because they were enthusiastic? "
1739,What did you expect?,"October 17, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/what-did-you-expect/,"If you run a rush delivery company, expect that the customers will be rushed. If you run a health food restaurant, expect that your customers will care about the ingredients you use. If you run a preschool, expect that your users will act like little children at times. If you offer urgent consulting services for clients in trouble, expect that they’ll be stressed and want you to work all night. If you treat people with mental health issues, expect that they’ll not always be patient and long-term thinkers. Sometimes, we get what we expect and still complain about it. It’s a feature, though, not a bug. "
1740,Hope for the best,"October 16, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/hope-for-the-best/,"Better, I think, to spec for the best instead. It’s comforting to hire a contractor, give them a rough spec and hope for the best. Wish to be positively surprised. Leave room for lots of unexpected magic. But if it matters, write a really good spec instead. "
1741,Freelancing is a brave act,"October 15, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/freelancing-is-a-brave-act/,"When I quit my job in 1986 and went out on my own, it was shortly after my picture had appeared in a small feature in a national magazine. My grandmother proudly kept a copy of the magazine (not the article, the entire magazine) on her coffee table, proudly telling anyone who stopped by that her grandson was now a “FREE lancer.” Not sure what that meant, she had a hunch that it wasn’t nearly as stable, easy or prestigious as having an actual job. Freelancers show up in the world without a safety net, offering to do their best. Freelancers rarely get the credit they deserve for the work they do. Freelancers aren’t always sure of what’s next, and freelancers often get the wrong end of the stick. But it’s about a pure a craft as most of us can find. You’re your own boss, most of the time, and figuring out a way to become better at being the boss of you is a worthwhile investment of effort. I’m so pleased with the results we’ve achieved with The Freelancer’s Workshop. It’s a straightforward approach to the biggest problem most freelancers have: Finding better clients. Our new session begins signups today, and I hope you’ll check it out (click to find the disappearing purple circle discount). It’s the last session of 2019. Better clients demand more, pay more and talk about your work. Better clients make it easier for you to level up, and better clients challenge you to dig deeper and do what you’re capable of. You don’t do better by working more hours. You can’t work more hours. You do better by finding better clients. I’m delighted that so many freelancers read this blog, and proud to be, on my best days, a freelancer. Join me at 1 pm ET today, Tuesday to talk about freelancing and how to level up. I’ll be taking your questions on my FB and Insta pages. Now might be the time to be seen as the professional you’re capable of becoming. "
1742,“This is mediocre”,"October 14, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/this-is-mediocre/,"Large organizations seek to decrease variability. Starbucks wants the very best latte you buy from them to be exactly the same as the worst one. If you define a spec and work hard to meet it, you can make it so that most things are within a reasonable distance of that spec. Which means that most of what you make is average. If an entire industry is busy seeking to meet that average, we can define that work as mediocre. Not horrible, but certainly not exceptional (because ‘exception’ -al is self-explanatory). When you go out to buy aluminum siding, copywriting or consulting services, you have a choice: You can demand that the work meets the industry spec, a fair product at a fair price. Or, you can seek something better than average, something worth paying extra for. Most TV ads, most car services, most airplane flights–they’re mediocre. That’s a choice. If you want to buy creative work that’s exceptional, you’ll need to pay for it (and accept the risk that it might not work out as planned). "
1743,Open the cookies,"October 13, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/open-the-cookies/,"Put a bag of cookies in the break room and it might sit for days. Open the bag and leave it out, and within an hour, all the cookies will be gone. We are happy to take a tiny slice off the thing that’s being shared, but we hesitate to open the bag. The same is true with all of the initiatives in our culture. Design, movements and ideas are all trapped, waiting to be opened, and then the rest of us will happily pile on. Open the bag. "
1744,“I’m sorry” takes guts,"October 12, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/im-sorry-takes-guts/,"I recently saw two men arguing about who got to use the urinal next. As a result, neither got what he wanted, and neither could honestly say that his day got better. The need to win every interaction, the inability to apologize, the short-term over the long-term–this isn’t a sign of strength, it’s a symptom of immaturity and weakness that almost always leads to suboptimal results.

1745,Better than it needs to be,"October 11, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/better-than-it-needs-to-be-2/,"Every element of the organization has a spec, a minimum required performance. Accounting has standards, so does the department that measures the air quality. Everything beyond spec is marketing. That’s an interesting definition, but I think it’s true: All the money, effort and time that an organization puts into making anything better than it has to be is a marketing expense. Because the extra is there to help change minds, to spread the word, to earn trust and loyalty. The head of marketing is the person in charge of what’s extra. Because if you want to grow, nothing is actually extra. It’s simply an investment. "
1746,Initiative,"October 10, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/initiative/,"The only way to get initiative is to take it. It’s never given. And some people hesitate to take it, perhaps because they’re worried that we’ll somehow run out. We’re not going to run out. It’s a self-renewing resource. From an early age, most of us were taught to avoid it. Do your homework. Take out the trash. Wait to get picked. Wait to get called on. Become popular. Fit in. Maybe stand out, but just a little bit. Failure is far worse than not trying. The alternative is to take some initiative. On behalf of those you seek to serve. Go ahead, there’s plenty to go around. "
1747,Projects vs tasks,"October 9, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/projects-vs-tasks/,"Your job might be a series of tasks. Tasks are work where money is traded for time and effort. You put in a fixed amount of time, expending effort along the way, and you get paid. In the end, tasks are completed and it’s up to the boss to weave those tasks together into something useful. The person at the front desk of a hotel is probably doing a task. So is the lineman working on a high power line. The easier a job is to get, the more likely it involves doing tasks. The alternative is projects. The way a project gets done is up to you. Your goal is to create an extraordinary outcome, not to perform the tasks. The work done is simply a means to an end. If you can figure out how to do less work or different work and still create project magic, that’s exactly what you should do. The challenge is in owning the project. To say, “I’m going to engage with this customer in a way that changes them from frustrated to loyal,” as opposed to saying, “I’m going to move this paper from here to there.” Claim the project before you start the work. "
1748,Use your best judgment,"October 8, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/use-your-best-judgment/,"I called the front desk early in the morning. “Where’s the gym located?” It’s a big hotel. They have a thousand rooms, and they’re part of a chain. Still, I was surprised to hear typing. The person who answered was typing the question into their database and then proceeded to read me the answer. It’s reasonable to assume that the hotel decided to save some money by consolidating all of their front desk work into one central location. And reasonable again to assume that instead of training people to give clear and helpful answers, simply instructed them in what to read. Still… I can’t imagine that’s a job you’d want to do. A job that would use any of your skills or care. A job you would look forward to doing. The next step is to have voice recognition replace this pesky worker. After all, the best cog is no cog at all. Our choice is profound, and more urgent every day: either do a job where your best judgment is required, or do a job where management will work hard to replace you with someone cheaper. Race to the top, race to the bottom. Either way, you might win. Up to you.   PS today’s the last day of the year to sign up for The Marketing Seminar, our industry-leading workshop for people who have an idea, a project or a business they need to grow. "
1749,The Big Fish theory,"October 7, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/the-big-fish-theory/,"In all markets, the market leader gets an unfair advantage. That’s because casual and unsophisticated customers choose the leader because it feels easier and safer. The strategy, then, is not to wish and dream of becoming a big fish. The strategy is to pick a small enough pond. By engaging with the smallest viable audience, you gain the reputation and trust you need to move to ever bigger audiences. "
1750,Narratives about modernity,"October 6, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/narratives-about-modernity/,"If we give an isolated community access to the internet, very quickly, the quality of life will improve. Time will be saved, research into proven solutions will produce value, and people will become connected to a larger population. Those connections will lead to productivity and learning. And, then, soon thereafter, they will become less happy. Not because they’re worse off, but because the dominant media narratives that arrive exist to make them feel insufficient, inadequate or simply jealous at how green the grass is over there. Our narrative defeats our surroundings, every time. "
1751,Security superstition/Security theater,"October 5, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/security-superstition/,"Security theater is a rule requiring you to take off your shoes when you get to the airport. It doesn’t actually catch anyone, it simply makes people feel more secure, and it allows those in charge to feel like they’re doing something. Mostly, it’s a demonstration of power and authority, not a practical measure. And security superstition involves putting security measures in place on a hunch, or because others are doing it. This alert from a website run by Thomson Reuters manages to do both:  This is malpractice. No, it’s not a doctor giving you the wrong medicine, but it’s definitely someone who should know better making an error that will cost countless users a lot of time and money. Long passwords work better than short ones. But impossible-to-remember passwords get written on post-its by people who haven’t yet realized that they need a password manager. Having people change their passwords often simply creates more post-its. Insisting on arcane rules is nothing but theater plus superstition. The theater and the superstition compounds, creating mountains of cruft, layers and layers of misunderstood but accepted practices that waste our time and make our systems less secure, precisely the opposite of what’s intended. Software runs our world. Building insecure, difficult to use and frustrating software and then forcing people to use it is easily avoided. But it requires leadership and insight, not mindless superstition. "
1752,How much is that piece of paper in the window?,"October 4, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/how-much-is-that-piece-of-paper-in-the-window/,"Four years at MIT cost about $250,000 all in. Or, you could engage in more than 2,000 of their courses on their site, for free. What’s the difference? When you do education, you pay tuition, plus you pay with a focus on compliance. Traditional education requires that students trade in freedom of choice, coerced by tests and exams. And what do you get? You get an ‘A’ and you get a certificate. The power of that certificate is extraordinary. Students (and their families) will go a lifetime in debt to get that paper. They’ll make choices about time and focus and geography for that paper, ignoring what’s ostensibly possible in exchange for the certainty of acquiring it. Learning, on the other hand, is self-directed. Learning isn’t about changing our grade, it’s about changing the way we see the world. Learning is voluntary. Learning is always available, and it compounds, because once we’ve acquired it, we can use it again and again. Many adults in the US read no more than a book a year. That’s because books aren’t assigned after you’ve got your paperwork done. We’re surrounded by chances to learn, and yet, unless it’s sugarcoated or sold in the guise of earning a scarce credential, most of us would rather click on another link and swipe on another video instead. The exception: People who have chosen to be high performers. Doctors, athletes, programmers and leaders who choose to make a ruckus understand that continuous learning is at the heart of what they’ll need to do. “Will this be on the test?” is a question we learn from a young age. If you need to ask that before you encounter useful ideas, you’ve been trapped. It’s never been easier to level up, but the paper isn’t as important as we’ve been led to believe. "
1753,Getting to the truth,"October 3, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/getting-to-the-truth/,"Your anecdote isn’t true. I know it happened. I know that your experience, your feelings, your outcomes are real. And they’re yours. Statistics suffer when compared to anecdotes. Because your mileage may vary. Your interaction with the randomness of the world will never match up to what the statisticians tell us to expect. Because averages and correlations are never what we actually experience. We experience a tiny slice of it. But, at the same time that the larger truth can’t be experienced, your anecdote can never represent the larger truth, because it’s yours. What happened to you will never happen to anyone else, not in quite the same way. By relying on well-told stories, we ignore the real truth, the universal truth of how the world actually is. Yes, our mileage varies. But please let me know what the reality of the world is. "
1754,Facing our fears,"October 2, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/facing-your-fears/,"That’s unlikely. If I’m lucky, I can glance at them. But just for a second or two. Our fears burn so bright that if we truly face them, we think we might be blinded. Of course, we may think we’re looking at our fears, dead on, but it’s more likely we’re just seeing a distraction, a shadow of what’s actually holding us back. Because once we’re truly clear about the fear, it fades. It might even disappear. "
1755,If you want to change minds…,"October 1, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/10/if-you-want-to-change-minds/,"If you want to change the mind of a scientist, do more science. Do better science. Get your hands on the data set and prove your assertions. If you want to change the mind of a bureaucrat, bring more power. If you want to change the minds of the nerds, build something that’s new. If you want to change the mind of a teenager, amplify the other teenagers. If you want to change the mind of the audience, put more emotion into your story. If you want to change the mind of a believer, bring in the perceived authorities. If you want to change the mind of a banker, eliminate risk. If you want to change the mind of an engineer, build a prototype. If you want to change the mind of a hustler, show the money. If you want to change the mind of a sports fan, win the game. Other people don’t believe what you believe, and they don’t see what you see. "
1756,Don’t buy cheap chocolate,"September 30, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/dont-buy-cheap-chocolate/,"Halloween is a month away. And over the next few weeks, a lot of cheap chocolate is going to get bought in preparation for the ringing doorbell. Cheap chocolate is made from beans picked by poor kids in dangerous conditions. And cheap chocolate is made from beans that don’t even taste that good, but come from more hardy trees, so it’s more reliable to grow. Some of the poorest people in the world raise cacao beans, and the market is driven by the low bidders. The low bidders are the folks who have no room for flexibility in their supply chain because the end product they sell is so price sensitive. For forty years, it’s been a race to the bottom, one that has led to plenty of ignored pain. On the other hand, expensive chocolate turns the ratchet in the other direction. The folks who make the bars, particularly those who do direct trade, keep paying higher and higher wages. They keep children out of the system. And they encourage their growers to use the tastier artisanal Criollo and Trinitario varieties, keeping them from extinction. The race to the top often creates more winners than losers. That’s because instead of seeking to maximize financial returns at the expense of everyone in the system, they’re focused on something else. "
1757,Learnable,"September 29, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/learnable/,"It’s worth remembering that if someone knows how to do something, that means, with sufficient effort, you could probably learn it too. You might not be willing to put in the time and effort, but it’s learnable. “I went to art school. That means that everything I can do with a pen you can learn to do as well.” Alex Peck. "
1758,Ways to grow,"September 28, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/ways-to-grow/,A checklist to get you started—you can either do the same thing or a different thing… More of the same Persist Get the word out Doing something different     Change an element of what you do Raise your prices Lower your prices Make it better Tell a different story Serve a different customer Enter a new segment Change the downstream effects of your work Earn trust Make bigger promises Organize Get better clients Do work that matters to someone 
1759,The race to the bottom,"September 27, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/the-race-to-the-bottom-2/,"When anyone has the ability to announce breaking news, urgent updates, RIGHT NOW, steal attention and emergencies, then sooner or later, many will do just that. Attention is scarce, scarcer than ever, and we’ve given everyone a machine that can steal attention, and a keyboard that can be used to steal even more. The race for cheap, unearned attention is a race that can’t be won. As soon as someone gains the lead, someone else will lower their standards and take a shortcut to get even more. The players have already surrendered their self-esteem, so it’s simply an escalating hijack of trust. And so we have dark patterns, once-respected media outlets with shameless headlines and an entire industry based on clickbait, come-ons and trickery. It’s pretty clear that there’s an alternative. A chance to work toward the top instead. To deliver anticipated, personal and relevant messages to people who want to get them. The opportunity to create remarkable products and services for a focused audience, stuff so good that people want to talk about it. This is marketing. To choose to race to the top and then to do it well. "
1760,A ratchet with leverage,"September 26, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/a-ratchet-with-leverage/,"That’s something worth building. Electricity is a ratchet with leverage. Once communities have access to a little electricity, a solar lantern, say, they quickly discover that they want/need more electricity. The productivity increases create more income which gives them more money to buy more electricity. The leverage that this productivity and income give them (combined with the actual power at their disposal) creates a one-way route toward the future. The same thinking applies to a personal career. The first speech you’ll give will be difficult. The tenth one will be easier. Each speech, well-delivered, creates more demand for more speeches. Each speech given gives you more leverage to give better speeches. Better speeches create more demand… This is the opposite of shoplifting. Shoplifting isn’t a ratchet. The system actually pushes back harder and harder the more you do it. And it has no leverage. Some businesses work at scale because they’re ratchets (they cause motion in one direction) and they’re able to reinvest from that ratchet to create more leverage. Amazon is certainly the most shining example of this simple process. But it can also work for the local university. A little learning creates demand for more learning. Useful degrees as a label for effort offer leverage to those that receive them, and the demand for more learning and more leverage gives the university resources to expand and do it even more. When in doubt, look for the ratchet and look for leverage. PS A new episode of my podcast Akimbo is out this week. I think it’s an episode worth checking out. "
1761,We don’t call portraits people,"September 25, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/we-dont-call-portraits-people/,"But in fact, just about everything is a portrait. It’s our temporary understanding of the world as it is, not an actual experience of it. We see things through our filters, match them to our expectations and live out our story of what we expect and why. We build a narrative around every interaction we have, and that narrative is rarely as accurate as we’d like to admit. It gets easier to work our way through a situation if we preface our retelling with, “the way I experienced what she said…” HT to Paul. "
1762,You might have a marketing problem,"September 24, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/you-might-have-a-marketing-problem/,"Democracy is a marketing problem. Health is a marketing problem. Climate change is a marketing problem. Growing your organization, spreading the word, doing work you’re proud of–these aren’t engineering problems or economics problems. They’re marketing problems. That’s because humans make choices. If we live in a culture where people are free to choose, we’ve offered control over our future to others. When humans make choices–that’s marketing. Marketing is the difficult work of telling a story that resonates, of bringing a consistent set of promises to people who want to hear them. If you want to change things, it helps to understand how humans make choices. And if you’ve got a change in mind, I hope you’ll spend the time and effort it takes to get better at bringing your story to the people who need to hear it. I’m thrilled that we’re launching the eighth edition of The Marketing Seminar today. My bestselling book This is Marketing (more than 250,000 copies sold worldwide in less than a year) is based on this workshop. Every time we run the seminar, it gets better and our participants find what they’re looking for. If you want to join the 8,000 people who have found a path forward, today’s the best day.

1763,The rip saw,"September 23, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/the-rip-saw/,"Supposedly, going against the grain is really difficult. It turns out, though, that it’s far more dangerous to cut with a rip saw, a blade that goes along the grain. It often leads to a botched project. When you’re cutting across the grain, you know exactly what to expect and won’t get surprised by a patch of resistance you didn’t expect. The same thing goes for sailing. It’s way easier to sail diagonally across the wind than it is to run with it. The story we tell ourselves about cutting across expectations is probably more difficult than the actual work. "
1764,On knowing what you’re doing,"September 22, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/on-knowing-what-youre-doing/,"It’s pretty easy to know what you’re doing when you’re doing something that you’ve done before. Follow the path. It’s a lot more difficult when the task ahead is not quite the same as what you’ve done before. When wayfinding is required. That’s a different skill. That’s the skill of finding the common threads, seeing the analogies and leaping over the crevices. Knowing how to do something you haven’t quite done before. Which sort of knowing is more scarce? Which is more valuable? "
1765,"Danger, real and apparent","September 21, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/danger-real-and-apparent/,"It’s absurd to trim trees like this. There are high power lines. There’s a helicopter. There are cables. Do the math.  It turns out, apparently, that a swinging chainsaw is far safer than having men and women climbing through trees with ropes and saws. We don’t notice someone falling out of a tree and breaking an arm (or worse) because it doesn’t make good TV. And if you assign 100 people to go out into the dense forest and expose themselves to this risk, it doesn’t feel nearly as fraught as the crazy helicopter option, even if it turns out to be safer. Often, that’s our instinct. To pay the persistent, consistent, significant price of deniable small dangers and avoid even the feeling of the big loss, even if it’s actually less dangerous. HT Tariq "

Second, if enough people are in the first group of bottom fishers, many other people may decide that those behaviors aren’t as wrong as they thought they were. The internet ends up normalizing bad behavior, because bad behavior captures our attention and gets noticed. We multiply the outliers in our imagination and come to the erroneous conclusion that their behavior is common, when it actually isn’t. There are two ways forward, and both are up to us: First, we can start paying more attention (rewarding) good behavior. And second, we can start modeling precisely the sort of discourse and contributions we hope to see from others. The best antidote to a culture shifting to bad behavior is to re-normalize good behavior. "

Free to work your own hours, free to make what you want to make, free to express yourself. Except not really. Because it comes with a hook.

1770,The relationship with the customer,"September 16, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/the-relationship-with-the-customer/,"If you’ve ever bought a mattress online, or a private label product from Amazon, you’ve experienced the value created by the last step. That mattress company didn’t make the mattress. And Amazon doesn’t make light bulbs. There are countless factories vying to sell generic products to the companies that own the customer relationship. Perhaps 90% (sometimes 100%) of the profit goes to companies that make the sale, not the ones who actually made the product. That’s because while they make the thing, they don’t do the work. The hard part is earning attention and trust. The hard part is helping someone make the choice. (There’s a difference between the hard part and the important part. Without the factory, there’s nothing to sell. Making it is important. But increasingly, it’s not the hard part.) The Broadway producer makes a profit, the chorus member ekes out a living. Fair pay is related to the scarce work of engaging with the customer. Either you’re doing the hard part or you’re left out of the transaction. "

You can be certain that your aromatherapy, jewelry store, engineering consulting, stereo gear or home improvement practice is 100% performance-based, completely driven by specs, immune to a double-blind study. Or, you can embrace the fact that human beings are 94% irrational, making decisions based on feelings, expectations and culture. That none of us are double-blind in real life. That the placebo is the most highly leveraged and efficient way you’ve got to help people get to where they’re going. Ignoring the placebo effect won’t make it go away. Embracing it will help you do much better work, work that quite possibly is based on those skills and practices you’ve worked so hard to be good at.

It is the creation of something new, something that might not work, something that causes a viewer to be influenced. Art uses context and culture to send a message. Instead of only a contribution of beauty or craft, art adds intent. The artist works to create something generous, something that will change us. Art isn’t painting or canvas or prettiness.

Congratulation on being wise and careful. The only way to get out of the spot you’re in is to do something that feels unreasonable, that’s unreasonable in the short term, that a similar person in a similar situation would say is unreasonable. Because if that wasn’t the case, then you wouldn’t be stuck, would you? If you truly want to get unstuck, if you want to move to higher ground or do something more worthwhile, the first question to ask is, “Am I willing to be unreasonable, at least for a while?” "

In fact, once you become an acquired taste, then those that have done the hard work to like what you make are likely to talk about it, likely to come back for more, likely to insist on paying more for something that’s not simply a pedestrian pleasure, available on every corner, merely pandering for a bit more attention. It takes guts to create a contribution to culture that’s more than simply a checklist item. And then you have an asset, one that people with voices that are fungible never do. "

Bob Marley was a magical artist, but one reason he’s such a seminal figure is that most of the other musicians of his time (in the North American market) were lumped together in one or two other categories, whereas he was pioneering a new one. You might not want to play reggae at your party, but if you did, you were going to play Marley. In order to be “one of the above” you have to begin by being willing to be “none of the above.” To zig with intent, when the market is insisting that you zag. There’s a caveat, though: In order to be one of the above, you need to be in the jukebox or on the ballot. And that means your innovation, while different, still has to qualify for consideration. "
1780,Two kinds of 9 to 5 job,"September 6, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/two-kinds-of-9-to-5-job/,"The eight-hour workday is precious and humane, and difficult to find in an era of always-on communication. But there are two kinds of 9 to 5 jobs. The first one is the industrialized cog. Protect yourself, do as little as you can, because the boss will always take more. This is the standard, and the source of the expression about watching the clock. The other one is the linchpin. This is the contributor who brings so much emotional energy, thoughtfulness, risk-taking and passion to the job that they leave nothing in reserve. Eight hours of this sort of work is a choice, and it’s a privilege if you care about the work you’re doing. It’s also plenty. It’s plenty because of instead of ‘more’, you went for ‘deeper.’ When we see passionate people at work (at a chess tournament, a brainstorming session, writing a play or counseling), we have trouble imagining doing it for six hours in a row, never mind eight. It’s no wonder hours have been expanding. If we’re coasting through our day, it’s the only way for the imagination-challenged boss to create more productivity. More low-value hours for no more pay. More hours is the only option if you’re not willing to put your heart into it. The alternative is to figure out how to go all in, to make a ruckus and then to stand back and catch your breath. If you’re lucky enough to have the choice, it’s worth seeing that you have the choice. "

1782,The end of reputation,"September 4, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/the-end-of-reputation/,"AI can now easily (8 seconds) change the identity of someone in a film or video. Multiple services can now scan a few hours of someone’s voice and then fake any sentence in that person’s voice. Open publishing on platforms like the Kindle means that there’s no gatekeeper to verify the source of what you read. Perhaps there’s already a fake Kindle book by “Malcolm Godin” and “Seth Gladwell”. I wonder if it’s any good or if someone simply wanted to fool a search engine? Don’t buy anything from anyone who calls you on the phone. Careful with your prescriptions. Don’t believe a video or a photo and especially a review. Luxury goods probably aren’t. That fish might not even be what it says it is. But we need reputation. The people who are sowing the seeds of distrust almost certainly don’t have your best interests in mind–we’ve all been hacked. Which means that a reshuffling is imminent, one that restores confidence so we can be sure we’re seeing what we think we’re seeing. But it’s not going to happen tomorrow, so now, more than ever, it seems like we have to assume we’re being conned. Sad but true. What happens after the commotion will be a retrenchment, a way to restore trust and connection, because we have trouble thriving without it. "
1783,What do you own?,"September 3, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/what-do-you-own/,"Small business is a resilient backbone of the modern world. Choosing to not simply be the day laborer or the gig worker, but someone who actually owns something. You might own a permission asset–the right people, offering you their attention and trust. You might own a lease or a patent or some other form of property. And you might own a reputation, one that earns you better projects and a bigger say in what happens next. As we begin a new season, it’s worth considering what you own, and far more usefully, what you can build on your way to owning even more leverage. If we are all shopkeepers, what do you have in inventory? If you own nothing but the next eight hours of your time, for sale to the highest bidder, you may be disappointed in the bids you get. I just got a note from an Akimbo workshop participant. She said, “Today I got my first project where I will be getting not an hourly rate but an equity stake in the product. I’m doing the happy dance and thanking Freelancer’s Workshop.” That’s why we keep showing up. So that you can show up and get paid what you’re worth. Even better, so you can make a difference you’re proud of. On September 10th, the third session of the Bootstrapper’s Workshop begins enrollment. Find out more and sign up for updates right here.

To have a sense of what the market wants, of what’s likely to work, of what quality looks and feels like. But not when it’s our work. When it’s your work, the moment you commit to it and own the outcome, you can’t help it. None of us can. We start to shave/bend/ignore the truth. Some make a mistake by downgrading the work, lowering expectations and trash-talking the output of all that hard work. Probably to protect ourselves from the doom that we fear is right around the corner. This makes every criticism nothing but confirmation of what we say we already knew. And some make the mistake of persuading themselves that their taste is universal, their talent is off the charts and that their effort is greater than anyone else’s. And so every criticism is seen as a personal attack. The reality is nothing like this. The reality is somewhere in between. And it’s worth developing the skill and guts to see it. "
1785,This one simple trick makes everything faster and easier,"September 1, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/09/this-one-simple-trick-makes-everything-faster-and-easier/,"Here it is, tested, effective and worthwhile: Stop chasing shortcuts. Personal finance, weight loss, marketing, careers, beating traffic, relationships, education–everything that matters to someone often comes with heavily promoted shortcuts as an alternative. Fast, risk-free, effortless secrets that magically work, often at someone else’s expense. But if the shortcuts worked as promised, they wouldn’t be shortcuts, would they? They’d be the standard. A shortcut is not an innovation. It’s not a direct path, either. Those work, but they require effort, risk and insight. If you can’t afford the time and effort to do it right, you probably can’t afford to do it over after you realize that the shortcut was merely a trap. "

1787,Online marketing vs. marketing online,"August 30, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/online-marketing-vs-marketing-online/,"Online marketing has become a messy mix of direct marketing, seo, tricks, tips, code and guesswork. It’s an always-moving target and it’s mostly focused on tactics, not strategy, because tactics are easy to measure. Marketing online, on the other hand, is what happens when the work to serve our audience arrives in an electronic form. Marketing online is simply marketing–the act of making things better by making things–aided by a mouse and a keyboard. Careful not to get stuck focusing on the wrong one. You need both, but one drives the other. "
1788,Politics vs. governance,"August 29, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/politics-vs-governance/,"“It’s just politics.” No one ever says, “it’s just governance.” Politics is organized sparring about power, without much regard for efficacy or right or wrong. Governance is the serious business of taking responsibility for leadership. Over the last twenty years, the mass media has shifted, from “here’s the news,” to, “hey, it’s just media.” As a result, a system has been built in which situations, emergencies and bad news have been packaged and promoted twenty-four hours a day. In the face of that maelstrom of noise, it’s easy to come to the conclusion that the world is more dangerous and unstable than it has ever been. When we have a chance to speak up for governance, we can strike a blow against politics. Because even though it doesn’t make compelling TV, the long-term challenges ahead of us aren’t going to respond to politics. Dedication, resilience and concerted effort have saved us before and they can save us again. Except once again, it’s on us to speak up and do something about it. "
1789,Lottery logic,"August 28, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/lottery-logic/,"Someone has to win the lottery, it might as well be you. Buying a lottery ticket is economically irrational and emotionally rewarding for some. Because while someone has to win, it’s probably not going to be you. There are examples of lottery logic in our daily work as well. It’s clear that someone is going to be the next Taylor Swift, the next George Clooney or the next Will Smith. But it’s probably not going to be you. Someone is going to raise a $40 million seed round, or get picked to be the next big thing. But it’s probably not going to be you. It’s tempting to decide to follow the path that leads to mass-market stardom, the top of the charts, the fame and fortune that comes to the person who wins a media lottery. It’s tempting to build a mass-market podcast or a general-audience news site. It’s tempting to be the sort of vanilla-but-attractive actor who can play just about any role… But it’s far more productive to focus on stepwise progress for the smallest viable audience instead. It might not make headlines, but it’s far more likely to work and more rewarding in the long run. "
1790,Arithmetic true,"August 27, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/arithmetic-true/,"Arithmetic is true. It’s true because 1. we accept the terms for what they mean 2. it’s timeless, past and present and future are the same 3. it’s testable In every fourth-grade classroom, the statement, “9 is bigger than 7” is clearly true. We can count out nine marbles. We have a mutual understanding of what “bigger” means in this context. From this shared understanding of the axioms and vocabulary, we can build useful and complex outcomes. On the other hand, “Cheryl is a better candidate than Tracy” might be true for some people, but it presents all sorts of trouble if we look at it through the same lens of “truth” as a term we learned in arithmetic. We know who Cheryl is and we know who Tracy is, but it’s not clear what “better” means in this case. Are we describing who will win an election in two weeks? That’s awfully hard to test in advance. And ‘words as building blocks of truth’ gets even more complicated when the ideas intersect with both science and culture. The statement, “The theory of evolution is our best explanation for how we all got here,” is demonstrably true in the realm of science, but for people with a certain worldview who value cultural alignment more than verifiable and testable evidence, this statement isn’t true at all. The words matter. It matters whether we’re talking about ‘arithmetic true’ or simply an accurate description of what works for part of our culture. "

It was great. How do you know? They bought. How did you play? Super. How do you know? We won. Actually, that’s selling your potential short. Even if the chip shot went in the hole, it doesn’t mean you hit the ball properly. It might simply have been a positive variance. Next time, it could easily bounce the other way. In order to improve our performance, we need to model our preparation, our effort and our form against a standard, not base it on the outcome. Because outcomes aren’t always guaranteed by our work. Just because you won doesn’t mean you did a good job (and vice versa). "

Shun the people who aren’t shunning the right people. Shun those who have slighted you. And shun those who didn’t realize that they should be shunning those that you’re shunning. Not much left. Shunning is a powerful tool, it is a sanction that society uses to maintain norms. But it’s an absolute tool, a final resort. It’s possible to connect with people without endorsing their worst actions. In fact, the best way to undo negative actions may be to engage with people to persuade them that there’s a different way forward. "

Giving it to 100 costs you a night’s sleep. Sending an email to six colleagues is normal. Sending a note to a list of 400 is cause for concern. Where, exactly, is the line?

All of us have a catalog of voices in our head. We’ve got the one for feeling behind, the one for not feeling good enough, the one we use when we’re trying to avoid a sore spot. There are good reasons to decide to wait until later. Waiting for later keeps our options open. Waiting for later helps us avoid the short-term hustle. Waiting for later feels safer. Too often, waiting for later also keeps us from leaping, from leading and from making a difference. It keeps us from moving on, moving forward. The feeling of “later” doesn’t go away. it actually gets harder and harder to leap as the time goes by. It’s easy to turn waiting for later into a habit. It’s a great way to hide from the work we truly care about, especially if it’s uncomfortable. Today’s the last day of 2019 to apply for the altMBA. It’s possible that you’ve heard about it, read the case studies, seen the impact it’s made on the thousands of people who have completed it, but perhaps you decided to wait until later. Today is later. Today’s the last day to apply at our current tuition. Our upcoming session is this October, and after that, we won’t be back until 2020. Now is usually better than later. "
1796,"Sooner or later, the shark gets jumped","August 22, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/sooner-or-later-the-shark-gets-jumped/,"Short-term thinking repeated again and again doesn’t lead to long-term thinking. Rand Fishkin shares a thoughtful analysis about a trend that now affects just about everyone: Google is hoarding more and more traffic. When I worked at Yahoo, there were 183 links on our home page. The stated strategy of the company was to build more and more internal content and services (Yahoo mail, Yahooligans, Yahoo Finance) to keep as many surfers on their site for as long as they could. The math was simple: if you’re getting paid by the impression, having someone stay for twenty or thirty clicks is way more profitable than encouraging them to leave and go to another site. Google blew this status quo wide open. Their model was very different: “come here on your way to somewhere else.”  There were only two links on their home page, because the only place they wanted to encourage you to go was wherever a good search led you. If you were a company or an individual with something to say, this hub and spoke model was essential to your ability to make a difference online. The web is a very big haystack, but if your needle was sharp enough, the promise was that you could get found. And if you were someone looking for information, commerce or connection, you could rely on Google to take you there. This, as much as anything, enabled Google to draw huge amounts of traffic away from Yahoo. It didn’t take very long for surfers to realize that they wanted to see what else was out there, not be shunted around a walled garden. Year after year, driven by the short-term (shortsighted) demands of the public markets, Google has been losing its way on this effective (and community-based) strategy. In the most recent data Rand quoted, we see that more than half the time, a search on Google leads to someone either clicking on nothing (because they found what they needed without leaving the search results) or visiting a property Google already owns. On a regular basis, Google makes changes to their UI and algorithm that destroy companies or industries in order to keep more time and clicks from the person who was expecting to find themselves somewhere else after visiting Google. If you’re a fan of the open web, this is bad news. If you’re an individual or business that’s hoping to be ‘found’ via a search, this is bad news. And if you’re a Google employee or shareholder this is bad news as well, because monopoly is a tempting place to extract cash and drive the stock up, but it’s not stable. The resilience of the connected open web is one of the shining lights of our modern culture, and my hope is that we can avert lock-in before we calcify around the current status quo. Every monopoly seems like it’s going to last forever, until it doesn’t. "

The busy person has a bias for action, the ability to ship, and a willingness to contribute more than is required. The busy person is wrong more than most people (if you get up to bat more often, you’re going to have more hits and more strike outs, right?). Those errors are dwarfed by the impact they create. Being a busy person is a choice. It might not work for you, but you could try it out for a while. We need more busy people. "

The curb cut turned out not simply to be a boon for wheelchair users. At low cost, it opened the sidewalk to a significantly larger audience of strollers, delivery people and skateboarders, too. Often, we make the mistake of focusing on too broad an audience. Obsessing about the minimum viable audience forces us to make something that’s truly better. But once we identify those we seek to serve, broadening access is a powerful way to add impact. This isn’t a matter of high or low, more or less. It’s the power of thinking hard about who it’s for and what it’s for. "

They become unseen foundations of who we will become. The goal of running a marathon in six weeks is audacious, but it’s not a habit. You might succeed, but with all that pressure, it’s more likely you’ll simply abandon the project. On the other hand, the goal of running to the mailbox (at least) and back for 50 days in a row is the sort of habit that might stick. The same goes for education (“we do flashcards every day” is very different from “I need to cram to learn quantum mechanics for the test.”) And it goes double for our lifestyles. If you can replace a bad habit with a good one, you’ll live with the benefits for decades. The challenge is to set up systems that are likely to create habits, not sprints that lead to failure. "

Again and again, she was jolted from her practice because he kept clicking his tongue. During the break, as she gathered up her courage to tell him that he was ruining the day for her and for everyone else, she realized that in fact, it was a nearby radiator that was causing the clicking. Suddenly, the fact that it was an inanimate object changed everything for her. It wasn’t about her any longer. It wasn’t intentional or selfish. It was simply a radiator. The rest of the day was fine, because it was simply a radiator. My biggest takeaway is that the key leap wasn’t in discovering that the sounds came from a radiator. The lesson is that acting like it comes from a radiator completely solves the problem. Sometimes (often, usually), it’s not about us. It’s simply weather. "

It begins with understanding the economics of loyalty. Saving a customer is ten times more efficient than finding a new one. If it costs an airline $1,000 of marketing and route development to acquire a first class business traveler, it’s worth at least $10,000 in customer service to keep one. And that means that an extra ten minutes on the phone clocks in at a high value indeed. And it continues with a simple tactic: Instead of defining the minimal legal requirement, outline the maximum possible action you could have taken. “You’re right ma’am, that was a terrible situation. And we could have alerted you in advance that the plane was late, and we could have trained the flight attendants to be more aware of situations like this and we could have been significantly more responsive when we saw that the whole thing was going sideways. That’s incredibly frustrating–you’re right.” Because it’s all true. You could have done all of these things. And it’s true, it was frustrating. If it wasn’t, she wouldn’t have called. And then, after learning all the things you could have done, send the ideas upstream. It’s free advice, but it’s good advice.

And you could show off by flying first class, but then you needed to charter a plane, then charter a jet, then charter a bigger jet, then buy a fractional share, then own the whole thing, then get a bigger one and on and on. Conspicuous consumption is not absolute, it’s relative. It’s sort of a selfish potlatch, in which each person seeks to demonstrate status, at whatever the personal or societal cost, by out-consuming the others. Social networks have amplified this desire, at the same time they simplified the execution. Now you can waste time and dignity instead of money. Who can you tear down? How much time can you waste? What’s it worth to you to have more followers than the others? It’s a lousy game, because if you lose, you lose, and if you win, you also lose. The only way to do well is to refuse to play.

The innovator shows up with something she knows might not work (pause for a second, and contrast that with everyone else, who has been trained to show up with a proven, verified, approved, deniable answer that will get them an A on the test). If failure is not an option, then, most of the time, neither is success. It’s pretty common for someone to claim that they’re innovative when actually, all they are is popular, profitable or successful. Nothing wrong with that. But it’s not innovative.

They do this at the very same time that they are supplanted by the new ones. While they will occasionally spend some time or money testing a new medium, they rarely leap. This is the posture of the business people/publishers, but it also has an impact on their editorial approach. Radio shows rarely became TV shows. TV networks didn’t embrace cable as they could have. The book industry generally ignores every innovation in tech. As late as 1994, Bryant Gumbel was spending time on network TV being befuddled by the ‘internet’. And in 1999, Conde Nast bought the print half of Wired but intentionally left the web version behind. Twenty years ago, newspapers were in a perfect position to establish blog networks—they had their reader’s attention and advertiser’s trust. But they blinked. New media tends to be adopted by amateurs first. And it rarely has a mass audience in the early days (because it’s new). But professional content for the masses is precisely what old media stands for. As new media gains traction, the old media doubles down on what they believe to be their value, because they no longer have a monopoly on attention. The editors at Encyclopedia Brittanica were proud of the control they had over every page, so they ignored Wikipedia. The producers and directors of movies love the gloss of film, so they ignored video games. And the editors of newspapers like their local hegemony so they fight against distributed content. So the Times publishes a snarky, poorly written takedown of podcasts. Not because it’s based on the economic or cultural reality of today, but because their self-esteem requires there to be a chasm between all of these amateur podcasts and the few professional ones that they deign to create and publish. Businesses make their own choices and suffer the consequences. The Mutual Broadcasting Network was a powerhouse in radio, but no longer. The problem is that these media businesses also narrate our cultural conversation, and that narration is historically wrong and prevents people from seeing what’s possible until it’s already well underway. There were thousands of newspapers before there were only a few profitable ones. There are millions of YouTube creators, but only hundreds make a great living at it. And the same will be true of podcasts. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t start a podcast. You should. Because a podcast is a generous way to share your ideas. Because it gives you a way to clarify your thinking. Because you can assemble a group of people who want to go where you’re going. The Podcast Fellowship starts this week. Check it out. "
1811,Streaks,"August 8, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/streaks/,"Today’s the 11th year in a row of daily posts on this blog. Nearly 5,000,000 words since my first post twenty years ago, and I haven’t missed a day (given some time-zone wiggle room) since 2008. Streaks are their own reward. Streaks create internal pressure that keeps streaks going. Streaks require commitment at first, but then the commitment turns into a practice, and the practice into a habit. Habits are much easier to maintain than commitments. I’m pretty sure that the blog would still have an impact if I missed a day here or there, but once a commitment is made to a streak, the question shifts from, “should I blog tomorrow,” to, “what will tomorrow’s blog say?” And once you’ve made that shift, it’s 100x easier to find the voice that you’re looking for. I didn’t set out to have this particular streak (I don’t remember the day the blog went from ‘most days’ to ‘every day’) but I’m glad to have gone on this journey. Thanks for being part of it.   PS you can subscribe to this blog for free, as always. You can follow my blog on Twitter, or on Facebook, or get the posts by email or even better, unfiltered via RSS.

1812,When will we learn?,"August 7, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/when-will-we-learn/,"It’s essential that we make new mistakes. We don’t make nearly enough of them. Not enough original effort, not enough generous intent, not enough daring in search of something better. But at the same time, we need to stop making the old mistakes again and again. What did you expect to happen when you did the very same thing that didn’t work last time? For some of us, it’s more frightening to do something new than it is to retry something that failed. "
1813,What’s your podcast about?,"August 6, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/whats-your-podcast-about/,"This is the moment, right here and right now, to start your podcast. Not because it will make you rich. Hardly. There are too many other ways for people to spend their attention for you (or me) to possibly assemble a large enough audience to make a killing selling ads. There are three good reasons to start a podcast now: Over the last year and a half, Alex DiPalma and I have offered the Podcasting Fellowship, an Akimbo workshop that helps people find their podcasting footing. (Alex is the producer of my podcast and many others). Nearly 1,000 people have been through our Podcasting workshop, and it works. Our alumni have created thousands of hours of material, including at least one iTunes Top 10 podcast. We’re running it for a fourth time, because this is the best moment to begin. Enrollment starts today. I hope you’ll check it out at the link below. Look for the purple circle today to save a few dollars. The Podcasting Fellowship "
1814,Seriously/Personally,"August 5, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/seriously-personally/,"Take it seriously. Of course. That’s required. But you don’t have to take it personally. In fact, if you want to be a professional, it’s impossible to do both at the same time. "
1815,Impossible,"August 4, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/impossible/,"Our days are filled with the path to future skills, tasks and commitments that we believe we can’t possibly take on. We’ve seduced ourselves into believing that we’re not born with the talent, or that the obstacles to doing the work are just too great. In fact, it’s more likely that we’ve simply decided that the work isn’t worth the effort. Or the fear is too much to bear. But it’s hardly impossible. We just don’t care enough. "
1816,Rules and responsibility,"August 3, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/rules-and-responsibility/,"“Use your best judgment.” Bureaucracies have a very hard time saying this to their staff. They create an endless series of scripts and rules, procedures that force people to not care. “I’m just doing my job,” which is the precise opposite of, “I see the problem and I’m going to fix it.” As any organization hits a sufficient size, it will increase rules in order to decrease responsibility. Because they’ve gotten big enough that they no longer trust the people who work for them. Is that a job you want? Is that a company you want to hire? "
1817,Fooled by reputation,"August 2, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/fooled-by-reputation/,"The second law of motion isn’t true because it was discovered by Isaac Newton, it’s simply true. Newton merely described it. The fact that he spent most of his time doing alchemy and looking for magic doesn’t impact the truth of what he discovered. There’s a chasm between science, where the identity of the discoverer doesn’t matter, and culture, where, “because he said so,” is a factor in our beliefs. The reputation of a jazz musician, or a comedian or a political leader can influence whether or not we think the work is any good. And it can even cause us to change our mind once we discover something about its originator. "
1818,Living in surplus,"August 1, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/08/living-in-surplus/,"In our culture, it’s easy to choose to live in deficit. To spend just a bit more than you make, so that you’re in debt. To need to drive just a bit faster than the prevailing traffic, so you can push every interaction. To measure yourself against someone (there’s always someone) who has more (there’s always more) than you do. If this habit of becoming ‘behind’ is the fuel you need to do your best work, it’s difficult for an outsider to argue against. But consider that it’s also possible to choose to live in surplus. To spend a bit less than you make, so you’re never worried about paying the rent. To drive with the flow of (metaphorical) traffic, because not only is it safer, it frees you up to dream. And to measure yourself against no one but yourself. Raise your standards as often as you can, but not because someone else you chose out of the lineup of success is somehow ahead of you. When you live in surplus, you can choose to produce because of generosity and wonder, not because you’re drowning.   PS Tomorrow’s the early decision deadline for the altMBA October session. This is our last session of the year, and the last at this tuition. Worth a leap. "
1819,The problem with sarcasm,"July 31, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/the-problem-with-sarcasm/,"“Well, that was super helpful.” Was it? Or are you trying to be sarcastic? Because if it was helpful, you could simply write, “thank you, that was helpful.” On the other hand, if you’re trying to express disappointment or displeasure, you could write, “I’m disappointed that you weren’t able to contribute more here. We were really looking forward to your input.” The problem with sarcasm is that the level of displeasure is hidden. You might come across as snarky when you don’t mean to, or, the snarkiness you were sending might not land. My new rule of thumb is to always assume goodwill and ignore any perceived sarcasm. Call it a Type II sarcasm-detection error. It’s hard to imagine a situation where sarcasm is the most effective way to make your point. "
1820,The perfect mustard,"July 30, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/the-perfect-mustard/,"If you ask for mustard at a French bistro, you’ll get a strong Dijon, handmade in a little village three hundred kilometres away. If you ask for mustard at a game at Fenway, apparently you’ll get Gulden’s. Within a rounding error, all mustard costs the same. It’s not about the price. It’s about coherence with the story. When a Marriott brings you the little sealed bottle of fake dijon from Heinz, they’re not offering you mustard, they’re sending a signal about what they think is fancy. And at the ball game, the yellow mustard in a giant pump tells a story as well. Is one better than the other? It’s a matter of taste and context. Of course, I have a favorite mustard and a narrative about what’s appropriate in a given setting, and so does just about everyone else I know. But favorite is different than ‘right’. There’s no absolute scale. How can a mustard be yuppie? Pretentious? Down to earth? It’s simply a condiment. And yes, there’s a mustard analogy in everything you do. In how you shake hands, in the typeface you use in your presentation (and whether you call it a ‘font’), in the volume you choose for your voice when in conversation. Being in sync is a choice. "
1821,Pivoting the education matrix,"July 29, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/pivoting-the-education-matrix/,"For the longest time, school has been organized around subjects. Fifth graders go to math class and then English class and then geography. Mostly, those classes don’t teach what they say they teach. Sure, there are some facts, but mostly it’s the methods of instruction that are on offer. School usually has a different flavor than learning. It turns out, the skills we need to use in life (and in school) aren’t subject specific. But we use those subjects to teach the skills we actually end up using. Everyone knows that the typical person doesn’t need binomials, but the argument is that problem-solving, etc, are totally worth learning and so we pretend to teach the subject when apparently, we’re teaching the skill. Perhaps, instead of organizing school around data acquisition and regurgitation, we could identify what the skills are and separate them out, teaching domain knowledge in conjunction with the skill, not the other way around. It turns out that the typical school spends most of its time on just one of those skills (obedience through comportment and regurgitation). What would happen if we taught each skill separately? Obedience
Management
Leadership/cooperation
Problem-solving
Mindfulness
Creativity
Analysis Indeed, you are required to do all seven of these things in math class, but in what proportion? Is a kid who has trouble with obedience “bad at math,” or is it that the obedience part of a class got in the way of the analysis or problem-solving part of the class instead? It’s entirely possible for a kid to make it through 16 years of organized schooling with a solid B average and never do much more than do well on just one thing–remembering what’s on the test. We’ve failed when we’ve turned out someone with just one of the 7 skills. What happens if we are clear what we’re doing and why? Because obedience isn’t the point of math or science, but sometimes it’s taught that way. And then, when obedience session is over, we can find other ways to approach the work at hand, developing the other essential skills. A 45 minute Creativity class that uses algebra is going to feel very different from a Leadership class covering the same material. Some kids spend a decade in the school sports system and learn leadership and management and creativity and analysis. And some learn nothing but how to follow the coach’s instructions and sit on the bench. This has nothing to do with sports (or geography or biology) and everything to do with what we decide we’re teaching in any given moment. Is there a cognitive difference between solving a chemistry problem and solving a crossword puzzle? Not really. Getting good at solving–putting on your solving hat and finding the guts to use it–is a skill that gets buried under the avalanche that we call obedience. “How’d you do in Creativity today, son?” or perhaps, “Wow, you got an A in Analysis–that’s going to open a lot of doors for you…” Bureaucracies over-index for obedience. They do that out of self-preservation, and because it’s the easiest thing to sell to clients, funders and parents (and to measure). But since we’re currently overdoing that one (they do it far more in other countries, though), we end up getting confused about what it means to learn a subject area in a useful way and we definitely under-develop people on the other six skills. My guess is that most parents and educators are afraid to even discuss the topic. More here. "
1822,People don’t change,"July 28, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/people-dont-change/,"(Unless they want to) Humans are unique in their ability to willingly change. We can change our attitude, our appearance and our skillset. But only when we want to. The hard part, then, isn’t the changing it. It’s the wanting it. "
1823,Sneaky surveys (and push polls),"July 27, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/sneaky-surveys-and-push-polls/,"First thing: All open access online surveys are essentially inaccurate, because the group that takes the time to answer the survey is usually different from the general public. Second thing: Don’t confuse a survey with a census. A survey asks a randomized but representative group some questions and then seeks to extend the answers to the entire group as a whole. A census seeks to ask everyone in the group, so that no generalization is required. In general, you don’t need a census. What you need is a correctly representational group, which can be dramatically smaller than the entire population. The huge mistake is believing that you need to survey more and more people. You don’t. And your work to reach more people actually makes your survey less accurate not more (see the first thing). And yes, this is true even if you’re a solo creator wondering if your novel is any good. In the age of good stats, the best use of a census is to establish a 1:1 relationship between what someone feels and who that person is. Asking every single person at a restaurant what they want for dinner is a census, a useful one, because you can then serve each person exactly what they want for dinner. Third: You might believe the survey someone just emailed you to fill out is anonymous. It probably isn’t. Check out this explanation from Survey Monkey. It turns out that tracking by IP and even email address/name is a built-in feature. If you get a survey link by email or even as you browse a site, it’s a safe guess to imagine that your answers are tied in some way to your other interactions with the organization that posted the survey. Respondent beware. And fourth: Asking someone a question can change the way they feel. Done crudely, this is called a push poll (“Did you know that Bob was indicted last year?”) but even asking someone a thoughtful question about their satisfaction can increase it. Okay, two more things: At the conclusion of the endless surveys when they ask you if you have anything else to add, don’t bother. It’s not like the CEO is busy reading your comments. The single best way to figure out how people feel isn’t to ask them with some focus-group survey. It’s to watch what they do when given the choice. “This or that?” is a great way to get to the truth of our preferences. "
1824,Too big to care,"July 26, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/too-big-to-care/,"The marketing math is compelling. It’s obvious that the most highly-leveraged moment in every brand’s relationship with a customer is the moment when something goes wrong. In that moment, when a promise was broken, the customer sees the true nature of the brand. We make up stories about the brands in our lives, but we believe that when the promise is broken we’re about to see the truth of that story. As brands get bigger (and bigger might be as small as an organization with just two people in it), policies kick in. Policies and budgets and bureaucracy. The brand has become too big to care. I mean, it might be big enough to pretend to care. To have policies that appear to set things right. But they don’t really care. The only way to really care is to have human beings who care (and to give them the authority and resources to demonstrate that.) Once you’ve got that, it’s pretty easy to show that you do. "
1825,Surrendering curation and promotion,"July 25, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/surrendering-curation-and-promotion/,"Facebook, Linkedin, Google, Apple and Amazon have very little ability to promote a specific idea or creator. That sounds crazy, but culturally and technically, it’s true. In 1995, Oprah got to put just one person as the lead in an episode of her show. That choice was a commitment and a signal. It said to her viewers, “there were many people who could have been on the show today, but I chose this person.” In 2000, Random House got to pick one book to be their big business title for November. Just one. Their curation sent a message to bookstores, who stocked more copies as a result. They were curators and their curation led to promotion and attention. There was a cost to picking junk, and a benefit to earning trust. The tech giants have surrendered that ability, with the costs and benefits that come with it. They end up disrespecting creations and their creators. It doesn’t matter if you know someone at Google or if Amazon promises that they’re going to heavily promote your new Kindle book. The people who work at these companies don’t have a dial to turn. Amazon is good at selling everything, but they’re terrible at selling a thing. Apple gets some zing for a recommended podcast now and then, or for a heavily promoted record, but the same rule is generally true with them–98% of all their content is driven by the algorithm, not a human with something at stake. They don’t care which record you pay for, as long as you pay for something. The platforms are built on the idea that the audience plus the algorithm do all the deciding. No curation, no real promotion, simply the system, grinding away. This inevitably leads to pandering, a race to the bottom. Netflix is an exception because they have so much at stake in the investment of their own products that they insist on curating and promoting, bending the algorithm in the direction they wish it to go. When a site tries to do both (like Buzzfeed), it’s a perilous journey. The metrics and the algorithm will swallow up the best intent of taste and culture making. "
1826,Comparing % and mass,"July 24, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/comparing-and-mass/,"Direct marketers don’t care how many people they reach. They care what percentage take action. Brand marketers have trouble measuring action, so all they have to work with is reach. If you can measure, stop worrying about big numbers when it comes to reach. Run away from the Super Bowl or a billboard on the main highway. Small audiences are your friend, because small audiences are specific, and specific increases your percentage. "
1827,Three wishes,"July 23, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/three-wishes/,"When you’re feeling stuck with your project, grab three index cards. On each card, write down an element of the project that, if you invested time and money, would change for the better. If those three things happened, if those three elements improved, what would happen to your project? Okay, now that you’ve got all three… what are you going to do about it? "
1828,Where will the media take us next?,"July 22, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/where-will-the-media-take-us-next/,"Since the first story was carved on a rock, media pundits have explained that they have simply given people what they want, reporting the best they can on what’s happening. Cause (the culture, human activity, people’s desires) leads to effect (front page news). In fact, it’s becoming ever more clear that the attention-seeking, profit-driven media industrial complex drives our culture even more than it reports on it. Thoughtful people regularly bemoan our loss of civility, the rise of trolling and bullying and most of all, divisive behavior designed to rip people apart instead of moving us productively forward. And at the very same time, reality TV gets ever better ratings. So much so that the news has become the longest-running, cheapest to produce and most corrosive TV show in history. Increase that exponentially by adding in the peer-to-peer reality show that is social media, and you can see what’s happening. Imagine two classrooms, each filled with second graders. In the first classroom, the teacher shines a spotlight on the bullies, the troublemakers and the fighters, going so far as to arrange all the chairs so that the students are watching them and cheering them on all day. In the second classroom, the teacher establishes standards, acts as a damper on selfish outliers and celebrates the generous and productive kids in the classroom… How will the classrooms diverge? Which one would you rather have your child enrolled in? We’re not in elementary school anymore, and the media isn’t our teacher or our nanny. But the attention we pay to the electronic channels we click on consumes more of our day than we ever spent with Miss Binder in second grade. And that attention is corrosive. To us and to those around us. The producers of reality TV know this. And they seek out more of it. When they can’t find it easily, they search harder. Because that’s their job. It’s their job to amp up the reality show that is our culture. But it’s not our job to buy into it. More than anything, profit-driven media needs our active participation in order to pay their bills. It’s an asymmetrical game, with tons of behavioral research working against each of us–the uncoordinated but disaffected masses. Perhaps we can find the resolve to seek out the others, to connect and to organize in a direction that actually works. The first step is to stop taking the bait. The second step is to say, “follow me.” "
1829,Two kinds of system risk,"July 21, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/two-kinds-of-insurance/,"When you set up a system, it helps to keep in mind what will happen if it doesn’t work. Depending on the costs of ‘not working’, you can build more resilience into the system. In most cases, ‘not working’ isn’t catastrophic. If your toaster doesn’t work, it’s not that big a deal. You can make toast in a few days and live with limp bread in the meantime. On the other hand, if you’re on a mission to Mars, you’ll probably be glad you packed a few extra oxygen tanks, even if the cost of bringing them is quite high. We make two mistakes when we organize a system: A useful skill in executive decision making is the ability to describe resiliency and the cost of failure in non-emotional ways. Especially when it’s difficult do precisely that.   "
1830,Tailgating,"July 20, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/tailgating/,"It doesn’t make you go any faster. It doesn’t make the leader go any faster. Tailgating creates frustration, limits your choices and isn’t safe. If you want to make a difference, you’ll probably need to find your own lane. "
1831,Say what you want,"July 19, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/say-what-you-want/,"Euphemism is easier than ever. Broad strokes, majestic language, big ideas… Mission statements and humanitarian motives. It’s interesting to note that organized sports, one of the first places that hyperbloviation caught on, is still honest about the point of today’s game. “Our goal is to score more points than they do.” It’s really clear what the team is trying to do. Often, we’re so busy talking about our ideals and motivations that we forget to let our colleagues know precisely what we’re trying to do. “Our goal is to make sure the State Senate votes no on this bill.” “We want to sell 10,000 more packages this month.” “Actually, all our shareholders care about is making a bigger quarterly sales number.” The problem with focusing on only the short-term is that it leads people to cut corners, to create negative outcomes and to crumble in the face of change. Our overarching mission matters. But being honest to yourself matters too. If your team regularly suspends your stated overarching mission with thinly disguised emergencies in search of an outcome you’re not that proud of, it’s time to admit that the emergencies are what you actually do. Here’s a simple test: If a competitor came along who could achieve your stated mission faster and more effectively than you could, would you cheer them on? If you’re not proud of what you actually do, perhaps you can explore doing something else instead. "
1832,Toward or away?,"July 18, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/toward-or-away/,"Today, will you stand outside your boss’s office hoping that she’ll meet with you about your new project, or will you hunker down in your cube hoping she doesn’t notice you? Will you raise your hand in class hoping to get some airtime, or will you sit in the back, avoiding it? Will you track down a recalcitrant customer and see if you can make things better, or will you duck voice mail in case they’re trying to track you down? It’s possible to spend your entire day moving towards something you seek. Alternatively, you can spend your time running away. This is the fork in the road that represents the altMBA. Tomorrow’s the first priority deadline for the October session of our proven workshop, and this is the last session before the tuition increases. If you’re ready to start moving, we’re ready to help.

1833,Squeaky wheels,"July 17, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/squeaky-wheels/,"Do you really want the grease? Or would you rather make things better? The best way to contribute to a community or a brand isn’t by complaining. It’s by making things better. Taking responsibility (without authority) and creating a positive cycle of generous action. Leading by example. Finding a small corner where you can make a difference–and then making a difference. We keep optimizing our systems for squeaky wheels. But often, all we get is a patch, not a fix. "
1834,Which sort of presentation is this?,"July 16, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/which-sort-of-presentation-is-this/,"If you’re going to do a presentation (instead of sending a memo)… If you’re going to do a sales call (instead of staying home)… it’s because you want to make a change happen. What action are you seeking? There are two kinds of changes you could work with: 1. There’s already a goal and a set of commitments, and here’s an update as to how to take appropriate action to reach that goal. Example: The GPS in your car. It knows you want to go to Cleveland. It’s giving you an update about where to turn to get there, or an alert about traffic up ahead that will be relevant to your journey. Note the GPS isn’t asking you about why you want to go to Cleveland nor is it trying to get you to go somewhere else. 2. The presenter wants a change in priorities, to want something different. Example: I know that you’ve never given to a charity like this one before, but once you see the urgency of what’s happening, it will change your mind. If you’re doing a GPS update, then your presentation ought to be focused on communicating the facts and changes we know we need to take action on. On the other hand, if you’re doing a presentation about changing people’s minds, please spare us the irrelevant coordinates and turn by turn announcements. You came for a change, please ask for it. "
1835,Paid to learn,"July 15, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/paid-to-learn/,"The rationale for traditional education is that more learning gets you a better job, and a job gets you paid, which makes the learning a worthwhile investment. But what happens after you get that job? In some organizations, that’s the end of that. You might pick up experience and wisdom on the job, but the short-sighted organization may view ongoing learning as too expensive. The insight is to realize that stuck employees are far more expensive than educated ones. More and more organizations have come to understand that paying their employees to learn, to really dig and learn something, is a bargain. An inspired and insightful employee is going to produce far more value than one who’s simply being ignored. And employees are beginning to understand that the time and effort they put into continuing education comes back to them for the rest of their careers, because once you learn it, it’s something you can use again and again. We put together the kernel of a list of companies that actively reimburse their people for education. And a page with an invitation for L&D leaders to consider the altMBA as a tool for developing real skills among their key employees. Better decisions, emotional labor and the confidence that comes from education are the future of work. Either you’re on that path or you’re falling behind. "
1836,Judging a day by the weather,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/judging-a-day-by-the-weather/,"It seems more productive to judge tomorrow by something more relevant, useful and in our control than whether or not it’s raining, doesn’t it? We can judge a day by how many tools we get to use, how many people are open to hearing from us, how many problems are available to be solved. Weather, or anything else that’s not in our short-term control, can become an excuse and a distraction. If you can’t do anything about it, it might not be worth your focus and energy. We can begin by embracing the fact that we get a whole day to make an impact. We can open doors, find new resources and create value. In spite of or because of the prevailing conditions… "

They’re drawn to it for little-understood reasons related to how they’re wired. Just as moths seem to be the same, humans manage to be different. How do you spend your unscheduled time? What distracts you or moves up your priority list? Perhaps you’re drawn to danger. To conflict. To hedonistic pleasure. Perhaps you’re drawn to take actions that avoid criticism. To shiny objects or new opportunities. To crossing things off the endless to-do list. It could be that you can’t resist fixing a typo in someone else’s work, or that you’d rather win at a team sport than just about anything. Maybe you want to do things that feel safe. Some people want to do things that actually are safe. For many, it’s either the avoidance of trouble or the desire for praise, but rarely both at the same time. It could be that the highest priority is to fix what appears to be broken. Or it might be to avoid what appears broken and to run to the new, unsullied opportunity instead. You might need to turn off all the lights and make all the beds before you leave the house. And you might be willing to trade everything just to be sure that the world at large doesn’t think for a moment that you’ve faltered in your work. The extraordinary variety of our urgencies makes it obvious that we’re not moths. The opportunity lies in understanding if what we’re drawn to is actually helping us achieve the outcomes we seek. "
1838,Now with recipes….,"July 13, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/now-with-recipes/,"Over the last few months, I’ve added a few recipes to the pages of this blog, mostly so I have them handy, partly because I haven’t found anything like them online. If you want insight into the official lunch foods in the office, here you go: Daily Dal (this is as close the perfect food I know. Vegan, easy, filling and delicious. You can serve an office full of people. Buy the spices once and you’ll have enough for months). We serve this with dosa made on the cast iron pizza pan below. Almost raw brownies.

1839,Principles and being let off the hook,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/principles-and-being-let-off-the-hook/,"Principles that we suspend during difficult times aren’t really principles. Principles really count when they’re difficult to maintain. That’s not the same thing, though, as refusing to consider the edge cases. “Free speech,” is a fine principle, one to live by. But shouting “fire” in a crowded movie theater isn’t allowed, for good reason. The edge cases are always subject to endless debate. There are no easy bright lines. It’s tempting, then, to never consider the edge cases. A rule’s a rule. But principles without judgment aren’t the easy path they seem to be. Because without our judgment on the edge cases, we’ve given up responsibility. It’s no longer our decision if we’re not making a decision. The hard work involves willingly being on the hook for making a tough call. "
1840,Next to the competition,"July 12, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/next-to-the-competition/,"On Fisherman’s Wharf, there’s one restaurant after another. Is that a smart place to open a business, right next to all the others? At the bookstore, there are tens of thousands of books, each competing to find a reader. The thing is, books are impossible to sell when there aren’t a lot of books around. They don’t sell many books at Macy’s. The biggest competitor most marketers face is “none.” Inaction always has the biggest market share of all. The surprising solution is to be surrounded by competition. Because that changes the question from, “if?” to “which?” "

1842,Open parentheses,"July 10, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/open-parentheses/,"Technology shows up and changes the culture. The culture then enables new industries and movements, which further change the culture. And then technology shows up and puts an end to the system we were all used to. The parentheses open, and then, perhaps, they close. The pop-rock parentheses opened with the transistor radio (kids could listen to music without their parents) and closed with streaming (no scarcity meant long tail meant no mass market). The publishing parentheses opened with Gutenberg and ended with the death of the bookstore. Digital books mean no scarce shelf space, no scarce paper, no power to the publisher, no mass market. A door opens, and then, one day, it closes. It’s easy to mourn the end of these eras, but in my lifetime, so many parentheses have opened… Computers connect us–to resources, to truth and to each other (which can mean folk-truth instead of actual truth) Medicine is truly a science, not a series of half-understood superstitions Musicians and writers can find an audience without a gatekeeper We’ve changed the narrative about fairness (even though we’ve just begun to make progress) It has never been easier to spread an idea or start an enterprise Access to information, just about all of it, is cheap and fast If you care enough to learn something, you can It’s possible to day trade tragedy and doom, and if it was the best way to make things better, I’d be in favor of it.

1843,"The $50,000 an hour gate agent","July 9, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/the-50000-gate-agent/,"Conventional CEO wisdom is that top management is worth a fortune because of the high-leverage decisions they make. But consider the work of Wade, an unheralded Air Canada gate agent. Yesterday, I watched him earn his employer at least $50,000 while getting paid perhaps .1% of that. The microphone was out of order, but instead of screaming at the passengers, he walked over and spoke directly to the people who needed to hear him. On his own, he started inquiring about the connection status of a family of four. He could have cleared the standby list, closed the flight and told the four that they’d have to find another way home. Or, he could have saved them their four seats, which would have flown empty if they hadn’t been filled. Instead of either path, he picked up the phone, organized other staff to find and expedite the family and get them on board. And then, in an unrelated bit of valor, he tracked down a lost wallet and sent his #2 to fetch it from where it had been left–getting it to the plane before it left. Most of all, in an era when loyalty is scarce, he probably increased the lifetime value of a dozen wavering customers by at least a few thousand dollars each. Krulak’s Law states that the future of an organization is in the hands of the privates in the field, not the generals back home. Unfortunately, management and a lack of trust get in the way of the work environment you’ll need to build to earn the human, dedicated work of the next Wade. Hopefully, the airline will put him in charge of their horrible website next. But I’m not optimistic. Where is your Wade? What are you doing to make it more likely that he or she will bring magic to work tomorrow? "
1844,“I wish I had more data”,"July 8, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/i-wish-i-had-more-data/,"Really? More data is usually available. It takes time or money, but you can get more data. But you’re probably not using all the data you’ve already got. I’m guessing what you meant was, “I wish I had more certainty.” And that, unfortunately, isn’t available. If it’s worth the work you put into it and the change you seek to make, it’s worth dancing with the uncertainty. Reassurance isn’t going to come from more data–that’s a stall.

Before it’s perfect. Before it’s 100% proven to be no risk to you. At that moment, your resistance says, “don’t ship it, it’s crappy stuff. We don’t ship crap.” And it’s true that you shouldn’t ship work that’s hurried, sloppy or ungenerous. But what’s actually on offer is something scrappy. Scrappy means that while it’s unpolished, it’s better than good enough. Scrappy doesn’t care about cosmetics as much as it cares about impact. Scrappy is flexible and resilient and ready to learn.

1846,The irony of close competition,"July 6, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/the-irony-of-close-competition/,"The easiest way to get someone’s attention is to compare them to someone else. When people compete on the same metrics (how many followers, how much income, how many points scored) the focus gets very tight. With a simple metric, there’s no confusion at all about how to earn more status. The irony is that the simpler the metric, the less useful the effort is. Big ideas, generous work, important breakthroughs–to pursue these goals is to abandon the metric of the moment in favor of a more useful sort of contribution. If we want smart kids, the GPA is a lousy way to get them. "
1847,Portion control,"July 5, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/portion-control/,"That’s the two-part secret of smart eating–you don’t have to eat everything on your plate, and if you’ve got trouble with that, put less on the plate to begin with. But the same rules apply in our daily lives. If a meeting is scheduled for an hour, you’re allowed to leave after ten minutes if you’re done. The hard part isn’t ‘portion’, it’s ‘control’. Self-control is underrated. The digital economy has created an endless buffet, and it’s easy to overeat. When confronted with infinity, is it okay to blink? Portions are up to us. "
1848,Connection day,"July 4, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/connection-day/,"Independence sometimes seems easier than the long-term, disciplined, generous work of connection. But it’s connection that enables us to add value. The math is simple: when people with different assets, needs and views come together, they’re able to produce more than they ever could on their own. Trading goods, skills and knowledge without friction creates a leap in productivity. It might be easier to burn a bridge than it is to build one, but in the long run, bridges are what we need. "
1849,Awareness or action?,"July 3, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/awareness-or-action/,"Some projects suffer from a lack of awareness. If only more people knew about what you were offering, you’d be fine. But most projects don’t have that problem, not really. The problem is that the people who are already aware of it don’t take action. They don’t sign up. They don’t engage. They don’t spread the word. More focus on action and less on awareness usually pays dividends. It’s more difficult of course, because you need to focus on what you make, how you make it and the change you seek to create. "
1850,Horizontal leadership,"July 2, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/horizontal-leadership/,"The first week of business school was pretty miserable for me. I had no idea if the others were feeling as underwater as I was, because I was focused on my own challenges. And then, a few days into the semester, Chip Conley, a fellow student, put a note in my campus mailbox. To paraphrase, “I’m organizing a five-person brainstorming group, and I’m hoping you can join us.” Chip wasn’t in charge of anything. Like me, he was one of the youngest students in the class. But he realized that the best way forward was together, so he reached out and changed the lives of four fellow travelers. By assembling a few others, he created magic, possibility and connection. What can you organize today? "
1851,Everything is a compromise,"July 1, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/07/everything-is-a-compromise/,"It’s possible to build a car that will never injure the driver, regardless of the severity of the crash. The thing is, it will be so heavy, it won’t move, and so wide, it won’t fit on the roads. We compromise every time we engage with the rules of physics. And it’s possible that the world will line up and give you exactly what you want. Except that other humans never want exactly what you want, and we build that truth into our expectations about what’s possible. We compromise every time we engage with other human beings. Once we acknowledge that all forward motion involves compromise, we can get to the actual question, “how much?” How much will we compromise with the realities of physics and humanity on our path to making things better? Absolutism is a form of hiding. Perfect is the enemy of good. "

1854,Smashing the piggybank,"June 28, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/smashing-the-piggybank/,You can only break it open once. Organizations (and political candidates) that forget this and treat their biggest supporters like bottomless ATMs learn the piggybank rule at great cost. Every interaction you have with a customer either strengthens your relationship (because it’s mutually beneficial) or weakens it. Weaken it enough time and you break it. The fact that you ended up with a few bucks in the meantime is immaterial compared to the long term damage of breaking the relationship because you’re in a hurry. 
1855,The solo marathon,"June 27, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/the-solo-marathon/,"The usual marathons, the popular ones, are done in a group. They have a start time. A finish line. A way to qualify. A route. A crowd. And a date announced a year in advance. Mostly, they have excitement, energy and peer pressure. The other kind of marathon is one that anyone can run, any day of the year. Put on your sneakers, run out the door and come back 26 miles later. These are rare. It’s worth noting that much of what we do in creating a project, launching a business or developing a career is a lot closer to the second kind of marathon. No wonder it’s so difficult. "
1856,Constraints and measurement,"June 26, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/constraints-and-measurement/,"These are the two axes of professional design and engineering. Did you produce within the constraints? Did you deliver measurable results? That’s it. Good design doesn’t exceed the available resources and produces measurable change against the agreed upon objectives. Great design is better than good design because it uses fewer resources and/or creates even better results. If you need to build a bridge, yes, of course you could build one out of unobtainium and even an amateur could build one that can’t carry truck traffic, but a professional engineer eagerly accepts the constraints she signed up for and insists on measuring just how much wear and tear the bridge can actually handle. Direct marketing, curriculum design, product testing, movie-making–they all live within the axes of constraints and performance. They just opened the long-awaited Terminal B at LaGuardia Airport, previously one of the worst major airports in the world. And while it’s shiny, the failures of engineering and design are everywhere. At 6 am, the line for the ladies room is 20 people long. The space constraints can’t be eased (constraints enable architecture) but the throughput would have been easy to measure at the blueprint stage. This part of the billion-dollar facility had just one job, and it failed. The same is true for the design of the simple coffee stand. It doesn’t require a breakthrough in retail engineering to create an espresso bar that can serve grumpy pre-caffeinated travelers with speed and grace. But despite the hard work of the tradespeople who followed the plans, the plans themselves were defective. The outcome of their poor design decisions is obvious to anyone looking at the line of 30 people. Forward motion happens when we see the best practices of our craft and exceed them. The privilege of design and engineering comes with the responsibility to be measured, and to redo our work when it doesn’t measure up. “Give me constraints” and “Measure my performance” are rarely heard, except when talented and passionate designers go to work. "
1857,"The tyranny of small debts, compounded","June 25, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/the-tyranny-of-small-debts-compounded/,"The simple but hard to follow rule is this: Only borrow money to buy things that go up in value. In the old days, that meant a house and a college education, because you’d probably earn enough from either to pay back the debt, with interest. Today, housing is unpredictable and many forms of student debt are crushing (and the yield on the most expensive forms of education isn’t as high as it might be). You can justify borrowing money to buy a car if the car enables you to make enough money to pay the debt back… But medallion cab owners in New York have recently learned that there are few sure things. The deal with credit card debt, though is simply terrible. The credit card companies pay 2% on their interest-bearing accounts, but charge around NINE times that on the debt that some people carry–that’s a huge gap. It’s a lousy deal you should avoid if you possibly can, regardless of how unfair the economy is. Lately, there’s been a lot of handwringing about the long-term impact of a daily treat like a cup of coffee. The Times got this completely wrong yesterday, pushing people deeper into a trap that they should run away from. And the Washington Post points out that the number of people getting a loan for their wedding is skyrocketing. This is a problem. Here’s a simple way to see why:  You can make a copy of the spreadsheet I built (hit MAKE A COPY or download) and then play with the numbers yourself. The sad news is that the best you can do within an industrial system that makes it harder and harder to catch up through effort is to begin by avoiding debt. It turns out that paying interest on interest is a long-term trap. The real win is to borrow money to embrace high-yield education, and then borrow money if you need it to build an asset, a business that creates value for you and the people you serve. The system is not fair, and it’s rigged against those that get compounded. Don’t get compounded if you can avoid it. "

Until you realize that if you switch just one letter around, it spells eyes eyes eyes… As soon as you’re applauded, you have eyes on you. Eyes that belong to humans, to critics, to people hoping for the best. Mostly, to people who expect you to keep your promises. That’s part of the deal of ‘yes.’ "
1859,Fear of kohlrabi,"June 23, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/fear-of-kohlrabi/,"What do you do when you face an alien looking vegetable? It’s all over the farmer’s market, it’s cheap and plentiful and you’ve never had it before. Most people walk right on by. What’s the cost of being wrong, though? The economic cost is tiny. Make a mistake with a kohlrabi and you’re out about a dollar–less than it cost you to drive to work. But the emotional cost, depending on how you’ve trained yourself, could be high indeed. What will my family think of me if they don’t like it? How will I deal with my ignorance of what to do with it? Is it too painful/risky/time-consuming to learn? What if I do it wrong? Will it make me feel stupid? What will eating an unfamiliar food remind me of? The kohlrabi metaphor runs deep. It’s about our perception of new experiences, and how we deal with, “this might not work.” Most of all, kohlrabi is a choice. "

If we don’t agree about the meaning of the word, we haven’t communicated. Instead of, “that’s just semantics,” it seems more productive to say, “I’m confident we have a semantics problem.” Because that’s all of it. The way we process words changes the way we act. The story we tell ourselves has an emotional foundation, but those emotions are triggered by the words we use. Not just. Especially.   [PS today’s the final due date for applications for the August altMBA. Hope to see you there.] "
1862,The mythical “Head of Marketing”,"June 20, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/the-mythical-head-of-marketing/,"Most organizations have someone that they call the head of marketing, but unlike the other departments, this person’s job is usually more tactical and less strategic than it could be. That’s because the boss isn’t willing to let go of the decisions that are actually at the heart of marketing. The boss is holding on tight to the answers to questions like, “who’s it for” and “what’s it for?” The boss certainly isn’t ceding responsibility for the company’s posture and the change it seeks to make. So, it’s a bit disingenuous to call this marketing person the ‘head’ of anything. I’m seeing the same thing with project managers who seek to extend their span of control to things that growth hackers get all excited about. Head of marketing operations is probably more accurate, right? In fact, the head of marketing is often more of a consigliere, charged with making a case to the CEO. If the boss is any good, she’ll listen carefully, ask hard questions and then make a smart decision. The rest of the time, the head of marketing is mostly following the lead of the boss. That’s because marketing is everything that the organization does that interacts with a member of the public. Marketing is personal, it’s vivid and it has its fingers in everything. To be the head of marketing, you need the freedom and responsibility to change the way things work, not simply how they’re talked about. At brand-oriented companies like Unilever, the brand manager has far more influence than she might at a place like Facebook, Basecamp or Slack, where it seems like the degrees of freedom are much narrower. If you want a marketing head, you need to give them the freedom to actually do marketing. The reason that the tenure of a CMO at a big company averages about 18 months is that it takes a year and a half for the boss to realize that pain-free, risk-free, easy miracles aren’t arriving on schedule. "
1863,Of course it could be better,"June 19, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/of-course-it-could-be-better/,"That’s not the question, not really. The question is, “what are you going to do about it?” And, to follow up, “what effort are you willing to put in to make it better?” If you’re not willing to make it better, it’s probably going to stay the way it is. The first day of summer is right around the corner (or winter, if you live in the other hemisphere). The changing of seasons is as good a time as any to say, “now, I’m going to make it better.” The key word isn’t ‘better’. The key words are now and I.   When you’re ready to take that on, we’d love to have you join us and become part of the altMBA.

This almost always leads to failure. It’s not because people memorize too much, it’s because they don’t memorize enough. Watch a great performance and you’ll see no artifacts of memorization. Instead, you will see someone speaking from the heart. This is what it means to know something by heart. Memorizing the words is half of it. And woefully insufficient. My suggestion: Don’t memorize your talk. Memorize your stories. Ten stories make a talk. Write yourself a simple cue card to remember each story’s name. Then tell us ten stories. Be you. We didn’t come to hear your words. If that’s all we wanted, we could have read the memo and saved a ton of time. Bring your heart. "

1866,The appropriate medium,"June 16, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/the-appropriate-medium/,"We spend all day communicating, and we’ve invented myriad ways to do it. You can buy a stamp, press a button, rent a room or use a microphone. Choose wisely. Don’t send an email when you should pick up the phone instead. Don’t send a text when an email makes more sense.

1867,Investing in slack,"June 15, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/investing-in-slack/,"If your delivery drivers have to do six deliveries a day, they’ll rush from the first moment. They’ll be super efficient at easily measurable metrics. They’ll cut a few corners. If they only have to make five deliveries, you can ask them to spend that ‘down’ time doing things your customers will actually remember. They can invest in less easily measurable metrics. Instead of cutting corners, they’ll embrace them. Systems with slack are more resilient. The few extra minutes of time aren’t wasted, the same way that a bike helmet isn’t wasted if you don’t have a crash today. That buffer will save the day, sooner or later. One thunderstorm can cripple the air traffic system for six major cities, because each plane is stacked so efficiently that the ripple cascades, leading to failure and cancellations. In the old days, when efficiency was measured over a longer term, there was enough buffer to absorb a bump like that. The mistake happens when we over-index on the easily measured short-term wins and forget to account for the costs of system failure. Competitive environments push profit seekers to reduce slack and to play a short-term game. If your organization hits the wall, the market will survive, because we have other options. But that doesn’t mean you will survive. Slack is actually a bargain. "

If you’re an actor, being able to write means that you can cast yourself. If you’re a marketer, being able to write means you can tell your story. If you’re looking for a job, being able to write makes you part of a special minority. Writing is organized thinking on behalf of persuasion. Writing is your opportunity to stand out, to pitch in and to make a difference. And you don’t need a permit or equipment. You don’t need an insider’s edge, or money either. Writing may be the skill with the highest return on investment of all. Because writing is a symptom of thinking. "
1869,There will be weather tomorrow,"June 13, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/there-will-be-weather-tomorrow/,"There always is. The song you’re listening to will end, a surprising news story is going to change the status quo and you’ll get feedback you didn’t expect. It’s easy to imagine that things are going to calm down, that there’s a neutral position coming up, and that it’s all going to go back to normal. But the swirl is normal. It’s always been this way. Changing. There is no ‘ever after’. There’s just the chaos of now. "
1870,Ten words per page,"June 12, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/ten-words-per-page/,"That’s how many words get scanned the first time through. Perhaps five on a billboard. Which means that your memo, your ad, your announcement, your post–you get ten words. Highlight the ten of the 1,000 you’ve written. Which ten do you want someone to scan so that they’re intrigued enough to slow down and read the rest? If you can begin with the ten words and write around them, you have the foundation for an effective message. As Jay Levinson said, the best billboard ever said, “Free coffee, next exit.” What do we see when we scan your work? "
1871,The Learning/Doing Gap,"June 11, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/the-learning-doing-gap/,"Our society separates them. Somewhere along the way, we decided that one interfered with the other. Go to school for 8 years to become a doctor–most of that time, you’re learning about doctoring, not actually doing doctoring. Go to work as a copywriter. Most of the time, you’re doing writing, not learning about new ways to write. The thing we usually seek to label as ‘learning’ is actually more about ‘education’. It revolves around compliance, rankings and “will this be on the test?” Being good at school is not the same as learning something. One reason that we don’t incorporate doing into education is that it takes the authority away from those that would seek to lecture and instruct. There are 56 million people in K-12 (compulsory education) in the US right now. Most of them do nothing all day but school, failing to bring real-life activity, experimentation and interaction into the things that they are being taught. And there are more than a hundred million people going to their jobs every day in the US, but few of them read books or take lessons regularly about how to do their work better. That’s considered a distraction or, at best, inconvenient or simply wasted time. The gap is real. It often takes a decade or more for a profession to accept and learn a new approach. It took gastroenterologists a generation before they fully accepted that most ulcers were caused by bacteria and changed their approach. It has taken our justice system more than thirty years to take a hard look at sentencing and corrections. It could be because we’re confusing learning with education. That education (someone else is in charge and I might fail) is a power shift from doing, so I’d rather be doing, thank you very much. What happens if the learning we do is accomplished by always engaging in it in conjunction with our doing? And what happens if we take a hard look at our doing and spend the time to actually learn something from it? When police departments invest time in studying their numbers and investigating new approaches, they discover that efficacy and productivity goes up, safety improves and so does job satisfaction. When science students devise and operate their own lab tests, their understanding of the work dramatically improves. Education (the compliance-based system that all of us went through) is undergoing a massive shift, as big as the ones that have hit the other industries that have been rebuilt by the connection and leverage the internet brings. And yet, too much of the new work is simply coming up with a slightly more efficient way to deliver lectures plus tests. I see this every day. People show up at Akimbo expecting lifetime access to secret videos, instead of the hard but useful work of engagement. The alternative? Learning. Learning that embraces doing. The doing of speaking up, reviewing and be reviewed. The learning of relevant projects and peer engagement. Learning and doing together, at the same time, each producing the other. If you want to learn marketing, do marketing. If you want to do marketing, it helps to learn marketing. That same symmetric property applies to just about everything we care about. To quote the ancient rockers, “We don’t need no… education.” But we could probably benefit from some learning. In the middle of all this doing, this constant doing, we might benefit from learning to do it better. "
1872,100 compromises,"June 10, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/100-compromises/,"Bit by bit, this is how we ended up with our organization, our job, our life. It’s impossible to move forward without them. And so we compromise on schedule, or quality, or on the pace of our days. We compromise on our standards, on our expectations and on what matters right now. You can’t produce without compromises. The question is: What would happen if you only had 98 of them? The difference between extraordinary performance and average performance is simply in the last two compromises. "
1873,Overwriting,"June 9, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/overwriting/,"Decorating a car with bling, mudflaps and an airhorn is a form of signalling. You can show your peers that you have the resources to waste on superfluous adornments. (Did you see what I just did there? I could have said, “You can show your friends that you have money to burn,” but I didn’t.) Overwriting has a long tradition, particularly among academics. Make it a bit more complex and wordy than it needs to be. Write run-on sentences. Apparently, complicated writing must be more true. One reason for this commitment to overwriting is that it keeps the hordes away. It’s difficult to read and hard to imagine writing. And so scarcity is created. And yet, the articles and books that stand the test of time are straightforward. They’re memorable. They can be understood by the reader you seek to serve. Simply write. Write simply. As few words as you need, but no fewer. But simply write. "
1874,But what is this question for?,"June 8, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/but-what-is-this-question-for/,"If you are asked a question in a job interview, on stage or even on a date, there’s probably a reason, and the reason might not be because the person asking wants to know your answer. Teenagers are terrible at understanding this. “How was your day at school,” is not a question asked to determine how a day at school was. It’s a (lousy) attempt at starting a conversation about feelings. It requires empathy to answer a question that isn’t obviously about the answer. The empathy to see that the person asking you has something else in mind. Back when I was hiring dozens of people at Yoyodyne, I asked one of the hackneyed programmer interview questions (back then, it wasn’t nearly as well known.) “How many gas stations are there in the US?” It should have been obvious that I didn’t actually want to know how many gas stations there were. That was easy to look up, and why would I ask someone I didn’t know a question like that? Over time, I had to get more and more clear in my messaging. “Because I want to see how you figure out amorphous problems, help me understand how you would answer a question like…” Even then, it was a very powerful tell. Two people said, “I don’t have a car,” and left the interview. (That’s true, not hyperbole). Other than name and phone number, when someone asks you a question, it’s worth considering why. Intentionally answering the real question is a great place to start.   [PS A question: Have you considered the altMBA?] "
1875,Junction City,"June 7, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/junction-city/,"A dozen states in the US have a Junction City. A place with the claim to fame that it’s on the way to somewhere else. You can do well being a stepping stone, a pathway, a place people go to get somewhere else. Or you can be a place where people seek to be. Yahoo grew as a place to stay. They built one service after another, hoping for time on site. Google, on the other hand, began as a place to visit when you wanted to go somewhere else. That’s their entire business model. Time on site wasn’t as important to them as the accuracy of their direction. Come to leave. Facebook, on the other hand, is organized to be a one-way street, with people staying on the site as long as possible. Of course, it’s not simply web sites that work this way. Either we organize for junctions and trajectory, or we build our place as a destination, physically or as metaphor.   PS Reminder: Today’s a great day to check out The Marketing Seminar.

1877,Ahead of the curve,"June 5, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/ahead-of-the-curve/,"When you’re traveling ahead of the curve, it’s silly to imagine that the road will be straight and flat. It’s actually more like a cliff. With bumps. That’s all part of the deal. That’s why it’s not called the curve. You’re in the void, uncharted, ahead of what’s behind. In fact, ahead of the curve, the weather is pretty lousy too. Often with catastrophic lightning storms. On the other hand, if you choose to work inside this messy metaphor, you get the thrill of finding a new path instead of merely following the old one. "
1878,“Don’t pee in the pool”,"June 4, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/dont-pee-in-the-pool/,"For generations, people dumped crap into the Hudson River. The river was so large and so swift that they assumed that the effluent wouldn’t come back to haunt them. Of course, it did, killing the oyster beds and poisoning the public. How big does a body of water have to be before we forget that we’re swimming in it? That it all comes around… Why are we are okay at yelling at a stranger, but not our neighbor? We will abuse the department in the other building, but not down the hall… It turns out that the pool/river/tub that we live in is far smaller than it seems. The culture of the place we work, the vibe of the community where we live. It’s all more connected than we realize. "
1879,Roads or buildings?,"June 3, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/roads-or-buildings/,"If you want to make a long-term impact, build the roads. Stewart Brand points out that if you compare two maps of downtown Boston–from 1860 and 1960, for example–virtually every single building has been replaced. Gone. But the roads? They haven’t changed a bit. The curbs and boundaries and connections are largely as they were. With the exception of a Big Dig, a Robert Moses or an earthquake, the roads last forever. That’s because systems built around communication, transportation and connection need near-unanimous approval to change. Buildings, on the other hand, begin to morph as soon as the owner or tenant decides they need to. When creating an organization, a technology or any kind of culture, the roads are worth far more than the buildings. How do we do things around here? "
1880,Surrounded by yes,"June 2, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/surrounded-by-yes/,"It’s good news and bad news. The web knows what you like and it’s working hard to surround you with reminders that you’re right. This is good news because it can help an outsider feel more normal. If you have something you’re interested in, you’ll see more of it, news about it, affirmations… all of which will help you find the confidence to speak up and lead. Everywhere you look, you’ll see reminders that the world is actually just the way you hoped. And this is bad news because it amplifies bad behavior. It normalizes behavior that successful cultures work hard to diminish. This reinforcement makes your bubble ever thicker and makes it easy to believe that in fact, the world does revolve around you. Everyone doesn’t agree with you, the web just makes it feel that way. "
1881,Of course they’re wrong,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/of-course-theyre-wrong/,"It seems like our take on culture is that we’re right. We shake hands properly, use a napkin properly, speak up at events properly and even greet one another on the street properly. When I’m in a foreign city, I’m always amazed at how (friendly/offputting/aloof/intimate) everyone else is. But of course, everyone else is right as well. They’re the home team, so they’re even more right than I am. The conflict seems pretty obvious: We can’t all be wrong, which means we can’t all be right, either. Culture, by its very definition, isn’t the work of being right. It’s the work of being in sync. Culture is people like us do things like this. So sure, the way WE do this is ‘right’ if right means, ‘the way we do this.’ But there’s little room for absolutes. Culture abhors the absolute, it is based in the specific instead. The next time you bump into a culture that you disagree with, perhaps it might be more useful to wonder about how it got that way, and would happen if we did it that way? How long would it take us to go from, “this is wrong,” to, well, sure, “that’s how we do things around here”? "
1882,The key part of new media,"June 1, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/06/the-key-part-of-new-media/,"It’s the new part. “How am I supposed to use this?” is the common question. You’re supposed to have a certain tone in your tweets, a certain format to your Facebook posts. You’re supposed to have comments on your blog and your YouTube videos should have a certain look, feel and length. When MTV was the hitmaker of the music industry, it quickly became clear what a music video was supposed to look like. Nonsense. Matching the vernacular is a fine starting point if you don’t want to spend time or energy questioning the form. But in fact, questioning the form, embracing the new part of the medium is precisely where forward motion happens. Our new instagram account is pioneering minibooks and other non-traditional ways to use the medium. This blog hasn’t had comments in a long time. Trailblazers have run telethons, talk shows and other surprising formats on Facebook. I don’t use Twitter ‘properly’ but that’s okay. A podcast doesn’t have to have guests. In fact, it could be a minute long or eleven hours long. The only right way is the way that helps you make the change you seek. PS Here’s my favorite music video, done incorrectly of course. For inspiration, the best of Spike Jonze, breaking the rules of an older new media can be found here… "
1883,Cognitive load and the convenience problem,"May 31, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/cognitive-load-and-the-convenience-problem/,"Why do smart people trade away so much money and freedom for just a little convenience? We do it all the time. We take the easy path, the simple shortcut or the long-term bad deal simply because it feels easier. The reason? Thinking is not worth the hassle. Cognitive load overwhelms us. Too many choices. The stakes feel too high. Every day, we make 1,000 times as many different decisions as our cavemen ancestors did. We’re exhausted from all the decisions, and more than that, from the narrative we have about making them poorly. Over the years, marketers have offered us one wonder or another in exchange for just a little cognitive load. And those promises have often been empty. Not worth the hassle. So now, we’ll press the re-order button like a pigeon in a lab. It’s easier. If you want people to stop and think, you’ll need to do two things: Make a very big promise… and then keep it. "
1884,On winning,"May 30, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/on-winning/,"Most people try to win. The real question is, “at what?” If you focus your sights on winning the local bowling league, the effort can consume you, and you will be aware of your progress and your competition. Or, if you turn the poetry you’re writing into your game, with the goal of winning that next stanza–not in the eyes of a publisher, an editor or a reader, but in your eyes–you can turn that into your thing. If, instead, your goal is to raise more money at a higher valuation in the Valley, then that’s the game you’ve chosen. Or, perhaps, your game is to bend others to your will, to prey on yet another human you see as weaker than you are… Often, we choose games we can’t possibly win. That approach might be working for you, as it lets you off the hook because you won’t have to work out what to do if you win. And sometimes, we choose games where we can’t win unless someone else loses. And these games can often have long-term, toxic after-effects. As you can see, modifying a game you’re already playing because you don’t like how it’s turning out isn’t nearly as useful as picking the right game in the first place. "
1885,Justifying mediocre work,"May 29, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/justifying-mediocre-work/,"The list of reasons is nearly endless. We need all of them to explain the shortcuts, phone-ins and half-work that we’re surrounded by. All of them are pretty good reasons too. We’re in a hurry, the system is unfair, the market demands it, no one will notice, it’s not my job, I was handed a lousy spec, the materials are second-rate, the market won’t pay for quality, competition is cutthroat, my boss is a jerk, it’s actually pretty good, no one appreciates the good stuff anyway… On the other hand, there’s only one way to justify work that’s better than it needs to be: Because you cared enough. "
1886,The timing of side effects,"May 28, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/the-timing-of-side-effects/,"Loosen the constraints on a system and the system will almost always do better in the short run. That’s if we define better as the visible outputs of what the system does. And short run as, “the stuff that happens before we have to live with the side effects.” So… if you remove environmental regulation from a factory, it will probably make more stuff faster. For awhile. But then the river is sludge and the workers are dead, so in the long run, not so much. If you stop paying taxes, you’ll have more money today. But the civilization you depend on to enjoy that money will soon disappear. If you stop taking medicine because you don’t like the stomach ache it gives you, you’ll definitely have a better day today. Until you stop having a better day, because of the illness that comes back because you stopped taking your medicine. All side effects are more simply called “effects.” And getting clear about the time frame we live in is the first step to leaving things better than we found them. "
1887,Accountability vs. responsibility,"May 27, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/accountability-vs-responsibility/,"Accountability is done to you. It’s done by the industrial system, by those that want to create blame. Responsibility is done by you. It’s voluntary. You can take as much of it as you want. "
1888,Organized crime,"May 26, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/organized-crime/,"Best I can tell, most of the folks in the organized crime industry care a lot more about the ‘organized’ part than they do the ‘crime.’ Organized as in: who’s up and who’s down. Who gets to decide. Who’s in charge and who has power. The crime is simply a shortcut. The same is true for people on Wall Street. The money is simply a means to keep score of the organized part. When people are willing to sacrifice their principles to take shortcuts, when they’re willing to bully or cheat or lie to get more status, we are understandably disdainful. Because the boundaries matter. Because we can see that once someone is willing to cheat a little to win, they’re probably willing to cheat a lot. "
1889,On finishing well,"May 25, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/on-finishing-well/,"If you start a book, you will do better if you have a plan for finishing your book. If you take the time and spend the money to go to college, it’s worth considering graduating as well. Aretha Franklin died without a clearly stated will. As a result, her heirs will waste time, money and frustration, because Franklin was both naive (a will doesn’t make it more likely that you will die) and selfish. If you’re born, it pays to plan on dying. Every year, millions of people needlessly suffer in old age because they didn’t spend twenty minutes on a health care proxy. If you’re going to take a job, everyone will benefit if you think about how you’re going to leave that job. And if you start a company, you should realize that you’re probably going to either sell it or fold it one day, and neither has to be a catastrophe or a failure. Beginning is magical. So is finishing. We can embrace both. "
1890,Defective apologies,"May 24, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/defective-apologies/,"Civilization depends on the apology. When humans interact and something goes wrong, the apology builds a bridge that enables us to move forward. But apologies are failing more often. Two reasons: First, organizations aren’t humans, and organizations often seek to avoid or industrialize the human work that civilization needs. And secondly, the apology is a complex organism, one with many structures and purposes, and our culture models (or fails to model) how it’s supposed to be done. Consider that we can say, “I’m sorry” at a funeral even if we didn’t murder the deceased, but we also say, “I’m sorry” when we bump into someone in a crowded train station and “I’m sorry” when we get caught shoplifting. Three different situations, with fundamentally different amounts of complicity, blame or guilt. When someone accidentally bumps into us, we don’t expect compensation or punishment, but we very much want to be acknowledged. On the other hand, acknowledgment is insufficient when someone sought to profit from our pain. We can start by asking, “what is this apology for?” What does the person need from us? The first category is the one that most demands humanity, and it’s also the most common. A form letter from a company does not make us feel seen. Neither does an automated text from an airline when a plane is late. One reason that malpractice victims sue is that surgeons sometimes have trouble with a genuine apology. This non-human behavior is getting worse and is being celebrated in parts of our culture (mistaking it for strength), which leads to a demand for the other three. Compensation is the ancient tradition of seeking to make a victim whole. Unless the injury is solely financial, financial compensation is insufficient, but that doesn’t mean we haven’t tried to build systems that use money to atone for ills. Punishment is different from compensation. Punishment allows the victim to feel seen, because he or she is now aware that the transgressor feels some pain as well. (Punishment is unsatisfying to the victim if he or she is unaware of it). Punishment is economically suspect, though, because other than the second-order feeling of being seen, the punishment doesn’t directly help the person who was injured. It also can spiral forward, leading to ever more damage. And finally, stopping the damage, which often co-exists with the other three needs. This is the affirmative act of making sure it doesn’t happen again. This is correcting the website so that the next person who reads it won’t see the same error. This is fixing the railing so the next visitor won’t trip and fall. This is the organization investing time and energy to actually improve its systems. Compounding these totally different sorts of apologies is the very industrial idea of winning. Victims have been sold that it’s not enough that your compensation is merely helpful, but it has to be the most. That you won the biggest judgment in history. That the transgressor isn’t simply going to jail, but is going to jail forever, far away, in solitary confinement. We’ve all ended up in a place where one of the ways to feel seen is to also feel like you came in first place compared to others. There’s an old cartoon–an irate customer is standing at the complaints desk of a store, clearly not mollified by the clerk. She then asks, exasperated, “well, what if we shut down the store, burn it to the ground and run the owner out of town… will that be enough?” The challenge that organizations have is that they haven’t trained, rewarded or permitted their frontline employees to exert emotional labor to create human connection when it’s most needed. The traveler goes straight from, “my flight is overbooked,” to “I want a million frequent flyer miles and a first class ticket on the next flight.” The patient goes from, “the scar on my leg isn’t healing,” to “I’m going to sue you.” And the most common unseen situation is the customer who walks away, forever, because you have a broken system and you’re not hearing from your people about how to fix it. Organizations that refuse to see the pain they’re causing because they’re afraid of being held responsible have missed the point. You’re already being held responsible. The question is what to do about it? You can stonewall, bureaucratize and delay, and hope that the system will suffice… The alternative is to choose to contribute to connection by actually apologizing. Apologizing not to make the person go away, but because they have feelings, and you can do something for them. Apologizing with time and direct contact, and following it up by actually changing the defective systems that caused the problem. “Yikes, I’m sorry you missed your flight–I really wish that hadn’t happened. The next flight is in an hour, but that’s probably going to ruin your entire trip. Are you headed on vacation?” “You’re right, you booked a front-facing seat, but you got one that’s facing backward–and I hear you about getting motion sickness, my sister does too… I know that Amtrak has been having trouble with our systems, but I have the hotline number of the head of ops–I’m going to call and let them know.” “Yeah, I shouldn’t have written that review. I was in a bad mood when I wrote it. I apologize. But, to set the record straight, I’m going to delete that review and write a new one, just as loud, but this time telling people about how much you care.” Consider that an effective apology has a few elements to it:
1. You know what sort of apology you’re offering.
2. You share your story with the aggrieved as well as hearing their story, thus becoming human, and then taking the time to help them feel seen by you.
3. You engage with the person who was harmed and find out, beyond being seen, what would help them move forward, noting that it’s impossible to make complete amends. [It’s worth noting that these are not the same steps you’d take if you’re simply hoping the person will shut up and go away, without you seeing them. That’s not going to happen, and acting as if it will, will only make your problem worse.] Empathy –> Connection –> Trust "
1891,The mob fears the truth,"May 23, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/the-mob-fears-the-truth/,"It’s not that they don’t know the truth (they might, if they stopped to think about it.) It’s not that they want to know the truth, either. Information is available if they looked for it. No, they fear the truth. And being part of a mob is a good way to hide from that fear. "
1892,Blockbusters vs. building blocks,"May 22, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/blockbusters-vs-building-blocks/,"It’s the blockbusters that get all the hype. The home runs, the viral videos, the hits. It’s the sudden shifts, the ideas that change everything, the fell swoops. Fell swoops seem like they’re worth chasing, but a hit isn’t a strategy, it’s an event. Nice work if you can get it, but hard to plan on or build on. It takes patience to avoid planning on swoops. It’s more productive to live in a house that’s built out of bricks, one at a time, day by day. Here’s to a swoop-free journey. "
1893,It’s all horizontal (and books went first),"May 21, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/its-all-horizontal-and-books-went-first/,"With enough top-down energy, it feels like the creator of an idea can broadcast it, anytime and anywhere. That enough hype/promo/media/leverage ought to allow a major publisher or network or candidate to bend the culture simply by yelling. If you follow this road, you’re going to be sorely disappointed. For 500 years, this hasn’t been true for books. And now it’s not true for anything. Ideas spread from person to person. Horizontally. Because someone who encountered an idea cared enough to spread the word, to talk about it, to insist that friends and colleagues pay attention, if just for a moment. If you can figure out how to embrace the true fans, they’ll go ahead and spread an idea–not because you want them to, but because they want to. Your ability to reach a tiny group of committed fans is essential. But the work spreads because of the fans, not because you figured out how to spend money to interrupt more and more strangers. "

And it’s entirely possible that the methods you’ve developed are costing you at least an hour a day in wasted time. That your desktop isn’t supposed to have 2,000 files on it. That you don’t need to click the same sequence over and over to get through your inbox. It’s possible that the ‘I’ll learn it later’ shortcut you took a few years ago is now a significant time tax on your day, every day. The solution is fun and simple: find a smart person and have them watch you use the computer for an hour. She’ll share ten shortcuts and principles that will amaze you. And then you can return the favor. It’s much more difficult to use a computer than it should be. But that’s mostly because they’re powerful, and power brings choices, and you may need some help with your choices. "
1895,This will take two hours,"May 19, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/this-will-take-two-hours/,"We have so many forms of “this will only take a minute” inputs. We have Slack, which is optimized for, “yep, I saw that.” We have email, which is optimized for, “I cleared my inbox” or possibly, “I’ll do this later.” We have Twitter, which is optimized for wasting time. And we have Facebook, which in only a few minutes, can make you feel left out. But we don’t have a convention for important inputs that might take hours of work to respond to. We don’t have a pre-sorted inbox for, “I’m ready to think deeply and work hard and change my posture and truly engage with this idea now.” This is one of the best things about a good non-fiction book. It’s not for wasting time, it’s for depth when you’re ready to go deep. If you spend your whole day browsing, then what happens?   [Typo update: There are typos on this blog now and then, and I apologize for all of them, the past ones and the ones yet to come. I usually fix them within an hour of publication, so if you’re ever wondering–yes, Bo Diddley was 1955, not 1995–just click on the title of the post and you’ll see the latest version, here, on the blog itself, almost certainly corrected. Thanks for your forbearance and patience.] "
1896,Bo Diddley,"May 18, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/bo-diddley/,"In 1955, Bo Diddley released his first record. It became a #1 bestseller. The name of the track? “Bo Diddley.” It was a song about a singer and his work. That’s what it sounds like when you own it. When you sign your work. If you’re going to step up and create, it helps to own what you just did. You’re not simply another in a long line. You’re you. "
1897,Three kinds of ‘forever’,"May 17, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/three-kinds-of-forever/,"There’s the forever of discomfort. Sasha Dichter taught us about this. The feeling we get during a temporary situation that feels like it’s going to last forever. It’s one thing to tolerate a bumpy landing on an airplane, because you know it’ll be over in ten seconds. But, a car-sick toddler doesn’t have that perspective. He’s wailing and sad because he thinks that this is the new normal, a permanent situation. Too often, we quit in the dip. Not because we can’t tolerate discomfort for an hour, a week or a month, but because we mistakenly believe that it might last forever. There’s the forever of plenty. This is when we erroneously assume that the stuff that’s good is going to stay good. That this moment, this leverage, these resources–we can squander them because they’ll be here tomorrow. This sort of forever leads to heartbreak, because, inevitably, it doesn’t last. It can’t. And there’s the forever of never. The dominant narrative of society is that you’re stuck with what you’ve got. Stuck in your status role, stuck in your skill set, stuck in your situation. If you believe it, it’s probably true. If you believe it, you just let yourself off the hook, which is comforting indeed. And if you believe it, you’ve made life easier for the systems that would like to pigeonhole you. But, even though it’s certainly harder than it ought to be, it doesn’t have to be forever.   [PS today’s the Early Decision deadline for the altMBA. The word continues to spread, person to person, with more than 3,300 alumni in 74 countries.] "
1898,Kinds of truth,"May 16, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/kinds-of-truth/,"“Gravity’s not just a good idea, it’s the law.” A truth is a useful, reliable statement of how the world is. You can ignore it, but it will cost you, because the world won’t work the way you hope it will. You can dislike the truth, but pretending it isn’t true isn’t an effective way to accomplish your goals or to further our culture. Most of the kinds of truth we experience are about the past and the present, and these are the easiest to see and confirm, but there are also truths about cause and effect. Identity is the truth of description. A circle is round because we define a circle as round. You can say, “a circle is rectangular in shape,” and all you’ve done is confused us. Words only work because we agree on what they mean. Demagogues often play with the identity of words, as it distracts us. Axiomatic truth is truth about the system. The Peano axioms, for example, define the rules of arithmetic. They are demonstrably true and the system is based on these truths. Einstein derived his theories of special and general relativity with a pad of paper, not with an experiment (though the experiments that followed have demonstrated that his assertions were in fact true.) There were loud voices in mid-century Germany who said that Einstein’s work couldn’t be true because of his heritage, and many others who mis-described his work and then decried that version of it, but neither approach changed the ultimate truth of his argument. Axiomatic truth, like most other truths, doesn’t care whether you understand it or believe it or not. It’s still true. Historic truth is an event that actually happened. We know it happened because it left behind evidence, witnesses and other proof. Experimental truth may not have the clear conceptual underpinnings of axiomatic truth, but it holds up to scrutiny. The world is millions of years old. Every experiment consistently demonstrates this. Experimental truth can also give us a road map to the future. Vaccines do not cause autism. The world is not flat. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising. If you want to challenge an experimental truth, the only response is to do a better experiment, make it replicable and show your work. Personal experience truth is the truth that’s up to you. How you reacted to what happened can only be seen and reported by you. And finally, consider cultural truth, and this is the truth that can change. This is the truth of, “people like us do things like this.” Which is true, until it’s not. And then people like us do something else. "
1899,Reach is overrated,"May 15, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/reach-is-overrated/,"It might be the biggest misconception in all of advertising. The Super Bowl has reach. Google has reach. Radio has reach. So? Why do you care if you can, for more money, reach more people? Why wouldn’t it make more sense to reach the right people instead? To pick an absurd example, you can use a giant radio telescope to beam messages to the billions or trillions of aliens that live in other solar systems. Worth it? I read an overview that pointed out that one of the cons of Amazon advertising was that they didn’t have the reach of Google. This is wrong in so many ways. Reach doesn’t matter, because your job isn’t to interrupt people on other planets, with other interests. Your job is to interact with people who care. Running an ad on the most popular podcast isn’t smart if the most popular podcast reaches people who don’t care about you. Perhaps it makes sense to pay extra to reach precisely the right people. It never makes sense to pay extra to reach more people. "
1900,Lifelong connection,"May 14, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/lifelong-connection/,"It lives right next to lifelong learning. Lifelong learning is the mindset of possibility. It is built on the idea that we can grow if we simply show up, ready to learn. Lifelong learning is never finished, and achieving the mindset isn’t easy, because the existing bias toward competence makes it socially unattractive. It requires us to acknowledge that we don’t know enough on our way to learning more. And lifelong connection? That’s our commitment to engaging with people who will help us see what’s possible–and that in return, we’ll support them on their journey. This is not the easily monetized connection of digital social networks. Those networks seek to maximize a simple metric (likes, friends and followers, all three of which should be in air quotes because the words don’t mean what they appear to mean). It’s more difficult than that. We founded the altMBA (and the other Akimbo workshops) with a focused commitment on lifelong learning. I believe that it’s our urgent obligation (and precious opportunity) to learn more and make things better for those around us. What we’ve found, though, is that it’s the lifelong journey of connection that powers that learning. That surrounding ourselves with others on the same path is at least as useful as learning something new. To that end, we’ve spent the last year building an online community called Forward Link where the more than 10,000 alumni from our workshops are connecting with and challenging each other on the way forward. At the end of each seminar, we invite our students to join with the others who are already part of our growing circle. Drip by drip, day by day. It’s not dramatic, but that’s how we get there. "
1901,Toward abundant systems,"May 13, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/toward-abundant-systems/,"Industrialism is based on scarcity. So is traditional college admissions. In fact, much of the world as we know it is based on hierarchies, limited shelf space, and resources that are difficult to share. This leads to a common mindset: if it’s yours, it’s not mine. Sharing is something we teach to little kids, but in real life, we’re much busier keeping track of who’s up and who’s down in an endless status game. But some systems are based on abundance. A language, for example, is more valuable when more people know it. The network effect helps us understand that for connection-based systems, more is actually better, not worse. Interoperability is a benefit. Cultural connection is an asset. Wikipedia is more valuable than a traditional encyclopedia. That’s because there are unlimited pages and room for ever more editors. The system works better when more people use it. The cultural turning point of our moment in time, the one that’s just beginning to be realized, is that education is an abundant system, not a scarce one. Space on the Harvard campus is highly valued and also scarce. But if we can break education out of the campus/scarcity mindset and instead focus on learning, learning at scale, learning that happens despite status not because of it–then we can begin to shift many of the other power structures in our society. The more people who know something, the more it can be worth, because knowledge permits interoperability and forward motion. Knowledge creates more productivity, more connection and then, more knowledge. It’s not enough, but it’s a start. "
1902,Trapped by the incoming,"May 12, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/trapped-by-the-incoming/,"The incoming is coming to you because a while ago, you did something brave and generous and risky. Incoming is great. It’s a reward for your impact. It’s a chance to serve and to make a difference. And it enables you to go to work every day. If you spend all your time dealing with the incoming, though, you’ll have no time and no energy to create the next thing. Every successful organization that has ultimately faded away via irrelevance has failed for this very reason. "
1903,Role models as a tool for decision making,"May 11, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/role-models-as-a-tool-for-decision-making/,"Innovation is essential, but it’s rarely true that we do something that’s truly never been done before. And that means that our work is toward something. We’re making decisions, taking risks and expending effort to get from here closer to there, where there is a place that’s been visited before. Are you spending time in the gym trying to be more like Jackie Joyner-Kersee or Dwayne Johnson? Do your policies push our country to be more like China or Denmark? Will this policy create a place that looks like Bakersfield or Portland? Are you investing in the style of Warren Buffet or Mary Meeker? The role model’s image brings with it all of the nuance that’s missing from a dry discussion of tactics. It forces us to get real and to look further into the future. Are you really trying to be a Kardashian? "
1904,Time travel is exhausting,"May 10, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/time-travel-is-exhausting/,"If you’re imagining your future and then looking back at today through a rear-view mirror, it can wear you out. Writing a book (all caps, WRITING A BOOK) or preparing for a TED talk (already in all caps) can paralyze an ordinarily productive person. At the same time, tweeting is easy for a lot of people. That’s because Twitter makes the false promise that it’s all about now. Whatever. Write what you’re doing, or feeling, or angry about. It’ll be obsolete in ten minutes. No future, no rear view mirror. On the other hand, a book feels permanent. It’s not for now, it’s for later. It’s your testament, something for strangers to read. And so, when you sit to write your book (or your blog, for that matter), you imagine who’s going to read it, one day in the future. And then you reflect from that distant, amorphous place back to now. Time travel. Without a doubt, we need to do this now and then. We need the discipline to think hard about the implications of our actions. We need to plan, to envision, to make trade-offs. It keeps us on track, doing work we’re proud of. But when you find that it’s paralyzing you, it might be better to get back to now. Sit around the campfire and simply tell your story. Your story as of now, for the people who are with you, now. "
1905,Embracing your incompetence,"May 9, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/embracing-your-incompetence/,"You can’t be great at everything. None of us are. The question is: What will you do about it? What will you do about the areas where you don’t have the commitment, time or skill to be exceptional? One approach is to never talk about it. It’s off limits. Do the work poorly, but pretend you don’t. Another approach is to talk about it with zeal. Work to find resources you can use to avoid the things you do poorly. Find a cohort that will challenge you to get better. Find new and better ways to improve… It’s hard to imagine that avoidance of the issue is going to make things better. "
1906,Selling insurance to your sister,"May 8, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/selling-insurance-to-your-sister/,"There are people in your inner circle who trust you. Family members, close work colleagues, college alumni, dear friends–they will give you the benefit of the doubt. Think twice before turning this circle into prospects by selling them products and services. First, it doesn’t scale. You don’t have enough relatives to cash in on. But far more important, these relationships are precious. These are the people who will help you level up, who see you, who care about your future. They are the ones who will tell you the truth and will challenge you to become a better version of yourself. Don’t burn this down on the lazy road to your next paycheck. If your product or service isn’t good enough to sell to strangers now, it’s not going to be good enough after you sell it to your inner circle. [On the other hand–if it’s not good enough to sell to your family, please don’t sell it to us.] "
1907,Do things get better?,"May 7, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/does-it-get-better/,"Maybe. Improvability is a choice. You can build a society, an organization or a family with improvement in mind. Either things are static or we’re putting effort into making them better. Here are some of the elements: Assertions are welcome Information flows in all directions Falsifiable assertions are tested, and the successful ones are embraced There’s forward economic motion Authority is used to get things done, not to simply end discussion Proven assertions from the past are accepted until more effective new assertions replace them The new is shipped on a regular basis Individuals are encouraged to engage with strange ideas and the strangers who create them Alternative methods are not seen as disloyal There are common goals No graft, no bribery, no external hidden agendas People show their work and don’t fear insight on their methods Mistakes are embraced when they lead to forward progress or simply encourage assertion making It’s not okay to blame the ref for results you don’t like Most of all, there’s a consistent process in place. A process that doesn’t change even as the work does. That process doesn’t get pushed aside every time a leader feels threatened. There are one or two of these elements that need expanding: Assertions are educated guesses about what might work better. They are coherent theories of how a problem can be solved or explanations of how a system works. It’s impossible to be sure of your assertion, but that doesn’t mean you should never make one. A falsifiable assertion is one that can be proven to be wrong. If it’s not falsifiable, it’s not a useful assertion. Saying that a giant green leprechaun determines the winning lottery numbers isn’t helpful, since we can’t prove that it’s not true. And forward economic motion: It’s easier to turn a boat that’s already moving. Forward motion means more incoming, more decisions, more deal flow. All of which lead to more ways to learn and more ways to improve. "
1908,College confusion,"May 6, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/college-confusion/,"While a high-status college admission confers a measure of status, it doesn’t automatically grant a great education. Sometimes, a student gets both, but not always. Because learning is taken as much as given. Along the way, many of us have conflated the status with the learning. We’re also confused about the correlation between big college sports and the expected outputs of a university. One symptom: We often say “good college” when we mean “famous college.” And so, the college one goes to doesn’t tell us very much at all about what someone learned, or even about who they are. It merely demonstrates that when they were 18 years old, a combination of luck and signaling led to them being chosen (or not). It’s not personal. And it’s not predictive. Unless we allow it to be.   [PS Just finished Lost and Wanted. A haunting novel, with physics. Recommended. The Analog series from Eliot Peper is simply terrific science fiction from the (very) near future–I loved all three. And Dare to Matter, from Jordan Kassalow, the founder of VisionSpring, is next up.] "
1909,Might makes right,"May 5, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/might-makes-right/,"The ‘might’ in “this might work.” The ‘might’ of making a generous assertion, one that you can’t be sure of. Might, might, might. It adds up. "
1910,Consider A/J testing,"May 4, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/consider-a-j-testing/,"The problem with A/B testing is that people don’t like to fail. So they test option A against option B, where both options are quite similar. Blue boxes vs. green boxes. $199 vs. $205. Why not spend some time on A/J testing instead? Test radically different alternatives. Test eliminating the entrance fee. Test increasing the price 400%. Test making the movie thirty minutes long, or five hours… You won’t be surprised very often, but when you are, bingo. "
1911,When your project isn’t making money,"May 3, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/when-your-project-isnt-making-money/,"It might be that you’re losing money on every sale (Which means that each and every item you sell, every service you perform, costs you money. Bigger won’t make you better…) (Low price is the last refuge of leadership that doesn’t have the guts to make a great product and tell a true story to the right people) (Some customers want to pay more than others, and some customers want to get more—of something—than others) (Your factory processes may be unsophisticated) Are you aware of work in process, cash flow and cycle times? Are you doing custom work in a batch business, or vice versa? What are you outsourcing? Is the time and money you spend on every step rewarded by the customer you serve? (Because people do what they want, and they respond to training and respect and opportunity) (And that’s a hard one to fix) (Systems thinking matters) It might be that your costs of acquiring a new customer are more than that customer is worth (Because your marketing message is incorrect) Because there’s a mismatch between your story and the worldview of those you seek to serve. Because the people you seek to serve don’t think they need you. Because it costs too much to tell these people you exist. Because the people you seek to serve don’t trust you. Because you’re lying when you make promises. Because you’re overspending or underspending on marketing. (often, it’s the underspenders that are in real trouble) Because you’re focusing on the wrong channels to tell your story. (just because social media is fun to talk about doesn’t mean it works) Because you don’t have a connection ratchet, a business that leads to a network effect, where success begets more success because the more people use you, the more they want their friends and colleagues to use you as well. Because your product isn’t sufficiently developed. Because the people you seek to serve don’t talk about you, thus, you’re not remarkable. Or the people you seek to serve don’t like to talk about anyone, and your efforts to be remarkable are wasted. Because your product doesn’t earn traction with your customers, they wouldn’t miss you if you were gone–the substitutes are easy. Because even though you’re trying hard, you’re being selfish, focusing on your needs instead of having empathy for those you seek to serve. It might be that your scale is wrong You may have created an organization that’s profitable at a much bigger (or smaller size) but the mismatch between your overhead (all that rent, all those people, all of those services you pay for) and your total sales is way off. It’s smarter than ever to be very small–but occasionally, there are significant rewards for being the efficient giant. It’s rare that being in the middle is the Goldilocks happy medium you were hoping for. That’s it, that might be all of it. Either your marginal costs are too high compared to your price, or the fixed price of marketing is too high, or your overhead is too high (meaning your sales are too low for the size of your organization). Within those three areas, there are many sub-riffs: It might be that you’re too early to the market. There are early adopters, certainly, but maybe not enough, or not willing to pay your price… Being too early also means that your costs are higher and your forward motion is slower. And it might be that you’re too late. Which means that the people who were interested, interesting and willing to pay extra already have their needs met, and all you’re left with is bottom-fishing, bargain-hunting late adopters. It might be that you’re slow moving when those you seek to serve want speedWhat you make isn’t usually as important as how it makes your customers feel. You might not be focused enough on a specific segment of the marketplace, a place where you can cross the chasm and reach the customers who are waiting for a tested and proven option. It’s possible you say ‘yes’ when you should frequently be saying ‘no’. You may have a staffing problem, with senior people doing their job instead of working on the mission of solving interesting problems and scaling up their tactics. It’s likely that you’re being reactive, doing what the market tells you instead of bending the market in the direction you want it to go (But, it’s almost as likely that you’re spending too much time and energy bending the market in a way it’s not eager to bend, and if you spent more time fitting into the slot that’s being offered, you could generate the traction you’re looking for.) A lot of this is called “marketing” but too often, when faced with problems like these, we end up spending time shouting, hyping and cutting promotional corners instead of doing the hard work of understanding what we make, how we make it and who we make it for. I know this is a long list. But the good news is that once you find what’s broken, you can fix it. "
1912,The minimizing coin,"May 2, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/05/the-minimizing-coin/,"If your habit is to clear your throat, apologize a few times, minimize the quality of the work you’re about to share and in general, apologize for the assertions you’re about to make… you probably realize that this is not an effective way to give a talk, lead a class or have a strategic discussion. Consider carrying a coin in your pocket, one that’s large, or in a foreign currency. Every time you feel like you need to minimize your contribution, simply stop and turn the coin over. You can count that as your obligation fulfilled. And then you can get back to work. [This isn’t simply an analogy. It actually works.]   PS There’s a new episode of my podcast Akimbo out this week, and it’s one of my favorites.

The sort of bar that wouldn’t be out of place in a Clint Eastwood movie. The anecdote has been through a lot. There’s the drama with his family, sure, but also the fight he had with his boss today. He needs this job, what with the payments coming due on the house, not to mention his gambling debts… A guy walks up to the anecdote and taps him on the shoulder. A bad move at any time, but today, it’s particularly ill-advised. Putting down his beer, the anecdote turns, in a rage, about to punch the stranger in the face. At the last moment, fist poised to strike out, the anecdote stops. This stranger–he seems somehow familiar. Could it be? Is it his long-lost brother? The valid statistical analysis, the one that’s correct, useful but hard to believe if you haven’t been trained in statistics? He’s in the corner, being ignored. The most effective statisticians are the ones who aren’t afraid to tell a story. Because anecdotes are the way we navigate the world. "
1915,And your company will pay for it,"April 29, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/and-your-company-will-pay-for-it/,"You might be surprised at your company’s reimbursement policy for education. Not only can you expense that book that will change the way you do your job, but you can probably take a course on the company’s dime (and perhaps even get some time to work on it). It’s a great deal for the company. You get paid the same, but now you’re smarter, more engaged and more skilled. And it’s a great deal for you. Because one day, when you leave the company, you’re going to take the smarter with you. It’s interesting to consider why so few people take advantage of this extraordinary perk. One reason is that you might not be aware of it (but now you are). A second reason is that learning might remind you of school, and alas, school has created bad associations for some people who were hurt by the command and control mindset of industrial education. The biggest reason I encounter, though, is that people are afraid. Afraid to ask the boss, afraid to assert their desire to learn something and afraid that after they’ve learned it, they won’t be able to live up to the increased expectations. Even as I type this, I hope you can see how silly this is. Relentlessly lowering expectations can work in the short run (hello George Costanza) but it’s hardly a strategy worthy of you and your next 10,000 days at work. Enroll. Engage. Learn. And level up. Ask your boss and give it a try. "
1916,The first database rule,"April 28, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-first-database-rule/,"If you participate in a database about people or their work, the first rule is simple: it should be as simple to fix an error as it is to make one. If you mischaracterize something, get a digit wrong, sort it wrong, include a typo, inadvertently leave something out, put someone on a list of privilege or denial… every one of these errors is expensive–to you and to the person you’ve misrepresented. You make it worse, far worse, when you insist that the database can’t be changed. It’s bad enough that we’ve reduced people and their work to digits. At least we can be agile in fixing our mistakes.

Sort of like a snooze button. The snooze button is a trap. It’s a trap because not only do you have to decide later, but you just expended time and energy to deciding to decide later. Do it once, move on. ‘Decide once’ is a magical productivity commitment. There is a certain class of decision that benefits from time. Decisions where more information is in fact useful. But most of the time, we’re busy making decisions that should be made now or not at all. You end up with a ton of decision debt, a pile of unanswered, undecided, unexplored options. And you’re likely to simply walk away. If you open an email, you’ve already made the commitment to respond and move on. Not to push it down the road. In or out, yes or no, on to the next thing. Snooze is not for you. "

It’s the community’s role to establish what “things like this” are. If you want to hang out with people like us, that’s the price you have to pay. To avoid the short-term and to invest in us instead. The community might be wrong. The path of the person making change happen is often lonely, because change is frightening. But too often, the act of taking a shortcut or finding a short-term profit is confused with the actual long-term hard work of making things better. Fortunately, the community often knows better.

1919,On finding something to say,"April 25, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/on-finding-something-to-say/,"The throughline of the last twenty years of tech has been new ways to speak up and connect. We’ve built platforms for email, video, writing, short fiction, daily updates, chat, discussion, classes… But what if you don’t have anything to say? It’s difficult to find a tech solution for this problem. It might be that instead of spending more time looking for a louder platform, you could profit from digging in and doing the hard work of figuring out the change you seek to make. If you’re unable to influence one person in a face to face meeting, all the tech in the world isn’t going to help you change a million people. "
1920,The power (and risk) of charismatic ideas,"April 24, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-power-and-risk-of-charismatic-facts/,"Charisma is a magical power. It enables humans to hotwire connection and build bridges long before the facts on the ground are clear. Charisma creates rock stars, powerful scientists and con men, too. Misused, charisma is often the road to tragedy, because it causes us to suspend disbelief and follow a leader we should have been wary of. On the other hand, charisma in the right hands is the engine that can move us toward better, toward outcomes we might have never achieved if we’d allowed ourselves to be paralyzed by the status quo. Consider for a moment the charismatic idea. An idea, disconnected from the person who might have conceived it, that spreads from person to person. An idea that’s not only sticky, but viral as well. I wrote about ideaviruses twenty years ago, but didn’t talk enough there about the very nature of an idea itself. That some ideas, like some people, are more charismatic than others. When those charismatic ideas contribute to the culture, they create a forward cycle that benefits all of us (I’ll nominate “don’t litter” as an example.) On the other hand, sticky negative ideas (like false fear about vaccination) persist longer than they should. Our job as marketers is to do the hard work of finding and nurturing charismatic ideas we can be proud of. One place to start is to look at the ideas you’re trying to spread. Consider whether they’re charismatic enough to earn the effort you’re putting into them–and if not, how to replace them with ideas that are. HT to the Distance Plan "
1921,Rationalizing your project,"April 23, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/rationalizing-our-project/,"“I followed the recipe exactly, and it failed.” That’s how many reviews of online recipes begin. Then the poster explains that he replaced the sour cream with yogurt (it’s what he had in the fridge), that he replaced the wheat flour with rice flour (it’s gluten-free) and he used the toaster oven instead of a real oven… Once you are deep into a project, it’s yours. It’s underway. You have heart and soul and pride invested in it. In the face of helpful advice, it’s easy to say, “sure, that’s what I’m already doing,” and then torture your description of the current project to make it sort of, almost, sound like you’re following the suggested new approach. But you’re not. You’re merely wasting time and effort pretending you’re embracing this new way of doing something. What if, just for a week or even a day, you acted as if? What if you re-did your plan, or your perceptions of the world or your approach in a totally new way, the way that respects and embraces the thing you just learned. What if you followed the recipe by following the recipe, simply to learn the technique… After that, after you’ve seen what it can do, then go ahead and see what happens when you re-adopt the cruft that had you looking for a new recipe in the first place. In the age of unlimited access to recipes, the hard part about getting good advice isn’t getting it. It’s following it. And then you might be able to turn the recipe into insight.   PS First priority deadline for the August session of the altMBA is this Friday. When you’re ready to level up, we’re ready for you. "
1922,Anything you want,"April 22, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/anything-you-want-2/,"The paradox of choice is real, and it gets worse when the choices aren’t even multiple choice. Confronted with the unlimited selection offered by any music streaming service, people choke. They pick an old favorite, a current hit or something banal. The same is true with the nooks and crannies of Amazon or most pieces of software–when people can have anything they want, suddenly what they want isn’t much at all. People are good at “a, b or c?”. Not as good at “pick a card, any card.” And terrible at, “think of a number between one and a trillion.” That’s one reason why writer’s block is far more common than roll-the-dice block. If you’re on the offering side, it’s on you to be smart about the multiple choice options that can unfold new horizons for us. Curation can do better than “Shuffle”. And if you’re on the choosing side, you can multiply your impact simply by embracing a method that pushes you toward new (and thus uncomfortable) options. "
1923,The compass and the map,"April 21, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-compass-and-the-map/,"Wouldn’t it be great if we always had a map? A set of step-by-step instructions on how to get from here to there, wherever we were and wherever we wanted to go… Steve Pressfield relates this magical story: A Gurkha rifleman escaped from a Japanese prison in south Burma and walked six hundred miles alone through the jungles to freedom. The journey took him five months, but he never asked the way and he never lost the way. For one thing he could not speak Burmese and for another he regarded all Burmese as traitors. He used a map and when he reached India he showed it to the Intelligence officers, who wanted to know all about his odyssey. Marked in pencil were all the turns he had taken, all the roads and trail forks he has passed, all the rivers he had crossed. It had served him well, that map. The Intelligence officers did not find it so useful. It was a street map of London. I love this story. Happy endings come from an understanding of the compass, not the presence of a useful map. If you’ve got the wrong map, the right compass will get you home if you know how to use it. Where are you headed? "
1924,“A good product at a fair price”,"April 20, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/a-good-product-at-a-fair-price/,"Some people say that marketing doesn’t work on them. That all they want is a good product, a fair price, and they’ll be on their way. But that’s a marketing story as well. Who decided what ‘good’ was? And ‘fair’? Your preference for the straightforward is still a preference. Your expectations for what you need are simply yours. It’s all a story. Great marketers don’t invent frills and fluff in order to create value. Great marketers have the wisdom to know that they will be judged and the practical empathy to go to where those that would judge them are. "
1925,The true cost of customer response,"April 19, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-true-cost-of-customer-response/,"“Your call is very important to us.” If you hear that, it means someone is not just lying, but also isn’t good at arithmetic. Your company spends $6 on digital ads to get a click, and one in a hundred clicks leads to an inquiry. Which means that every inquiry sitting in the queue cost you $600. Inquiries are a bit like cronuts, in that they go stale quickly. Waiting an extra day to get back to just one person probably costs you more than the entire day’s salary of a customer service salesperson. Your company spends $2,000 a day on rent for its showroom. And you paid that rent (along with all of those ads) for a month before John walks into the store. The uninterested, undertrained, under-compensated salesperson is finishing up a personal call, John gets bored and leaves. That (non) interaction cost you $20,000. Jon, the reservationist, is overwhelmed by incoming calls, and he’s snippy when a regular calls for a table this Saturday night. So the patron, rebuffed and feeling disrespected, goes to a different restaurant, loves it, and never returns. Let’s see–10 business dinners a year at $200 including tip and wine–you can do the math. “You can do the math,” while true, is rarely followed up by, “I did the math.” "
1926,Three deadlines (and Instagram!),"April 18, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/three-deadlines-and-instagram/,"Here’s what someone posted yesterday in The Freelancer’s Workshop discussion board: I was really just hoping to pick up a few insights from Seth. I got one of those yesterday, but meeting and interacting with other people struggling with the same things as me has been amazing. The deadline to sign up for The Bootstrapper’s Workshop and The Freelancer’s Workshop is this weekend. Today’s your last best day to level up. The next altMBA is now accepting applications, and the early deadline is April 26. Our August session is often one of the most powerful, because there’s more time to dig in. And thanks to Sam and Taylor, we’re back on Instagram, experimenting with short-form videos and other interactions. See you there. "
1927,Dancing with infinity,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/dancing-with-inifinty/,"If your little bagel shop suddenly had everyone in the world waiting in line to buy a bagel, that would be stressful indeed. You’d need riot police to keep order and you’d run out of sesame seeds in no time. On the other hand, it’s easy to hope that your YouTube video, your Facebook post or your professionally published book be seen by everyone in the entire world. Because digital scales. Because there’s apparently no useful limit. Because you believe in it and more is better. But more isn’t always better. Better is better. And better might mean more specific. More respected. More exclusive. More trusted. More cherished. Dancing with infinity isn’t free, and if you do it too long, it’s corrosive. You’re busy being busy, instead of doing what’s important. "
1928,Make things better,"April 17, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/make-things-better/,"I’ve come to realize that this is a controversial statement for some people. Two issues, it seems: I’ve seen that there are pockets of our culture where both of these ideas are difficult to embrace. That authority pushes us to fit in, not to seek improvement, and deniability encourages us to whine instead of doing something about it. Power enjoys passivity in others. Power doesn’t want you to get uppity, doesn’t enjoy your dissatisfaction, doesn’t want to be on the hook to continually upgrade all of its systems. And so power has sold a cultural norm of acceptance, deniability and ennui. And yet… Everything in our built world–the water we drink, the food we eat, the place we live–if it’s good, it’s good because someone, a generation or two ago, decided to make it better. And if it’s not good, or not good enough, only our action is going to make it better. We can see the world around us, and if we try, we can see it becoming better. It might be a podcast or a political campaign, an engineering insight or a more inclusive policy. It probably involves finding and organizing others on a similar path. It definitely takes guts. I’ll reiterate my belief that we each have a chance to assert. To announce our vision, to propose a change, to do the hard work to make things better. It’s on us, right now. Make things better by making better things. "
1929,Impermanence,"April 16, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/impermanence/,"Beloved 1,000-year-old buildings disappear in the blink of an eye. Celebrities we’ve never met die young. Babies are born. Music goes from cutting edge to current to oldies. Technology that was prized becomes obsolete. A medical breakthrough averts certain doom… Our experience with time keeps changing. The concept of the time machine was only invented in the 1800s, and people who lived when they were building Notre Dame had little concept of what the world was like a thousand years before them, and no imagination at all of what the world might be like today. We didn’t have time zones until we had clocks, and we didn’t have clocks until we invented cities… As we’ve learned about history (not the details, simply the concept of it, that someone came before), we’ve also spent time thinking about the future. About our role in it and whether or not it will turn out the way we hope it will. My hunch is that two things are true: • We have much less direct control over the future than we hope, and that it will always surprise us. • We have far more ability to make an impact than we expect. The only people who can change our culture (and thus our future) are us. We can’t control the future, but we can bend it. And we can’t freeze the world as it is, but we can figure out how to be a part of it. The work we do every day, the stories we tell, the paths we follow and the connections we make define our culture, and culture determines what’s next. No guarantees, but yes, urgency. "
1930,The gap between ‘have to’ and ‘get to’,"April 15, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-gap-between-have-to-and-get-to/,"Deadlines work. They work because they focus the mind and create urgency. They work to get us to file our taxes or finish an assignment. They’re an external lever for the work we have to do. On the other hand, dessert works too. You don’t need an external force to encourage you to eat dessert after you’ve finished all your vegetables. It’s something you get to do, not something you have to do. You can build a work life around deadlines. You can procrastinate, pay the late fines and push through the last minute emergencies because you need all of that in order to get to ‘have to’ mode. Or, you can follow the path of the most productive and happy people you know. By redefining the work you’ve chosen to do as something you get to do. And yes, I’ll point out that you can even do that with your taxes. It’s something you get to do because you’re successful and lucky enough to live in a civil society. "
1931,“You can hire just about anyone…”,"April 14, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/avoiding-the-fiver-trap/,"“and you’re in luck, since I’m just about anyone.” It’s time to start avoiding the Fiverr trap. You can fill your day as a freelancer taking easily accessible work from clients who simply want you to meet spec. Or you can build a career as a freelancer by getting better clients. Websites that offer lowest common denominator jobs for freelancers (like Fiverr, Uber, ZocDoc, Mechanical Turk etc.) are focused on the generic. They intentionally blur the identities of the people doing the work–a simple star rating, a measure of reliability, that’s all. These are easy jobs to get. If you’re the cheapest, you’ll be busy all day. But is being cheap and busy the point? Because that’s a race to the bottom. And the problem is that you might win that race. You’re not generic, so why act that way? The alternative is to be distinct. To be uniquely you. To bring a point of view to the work, one that is worth seeking out, paying for and remarking on. It is the difference between, “what do you need me to do?” and “I can offer you this.” It is the difference between being handy and being indispensable. Why is this so difficult? Two reasons: The first problem is that the typical client doesn’t want that. The typical client wants cheap and reliable. And you’re not going to persuade the typical client to change his or her mind. Which means that if you’re going to do your best work, you’ll need to send the typical client to someone else. The second problem is that it takes guts to be specific. To stand for something. To turn down mediocre work for clients that will settle for mediocre. It takes guts to have a point of view, a protocol, and a skill set. It takes guts to make a stand. Your day is priceless. You only get it once. And then another chance tomorrow. Your career is what you invest in it, and if you spend your days building a career that consists of doing reliable work by being the lowest bidder, you’ve bought yourself a job that’s hardly rewarding or steady. The alternative, the one you deserve, is to find better clients. Not to resent your ordinary clients, but to focus your energy and your passion earning better ones. To become the sort of freelancer who can proudly say that you deserve it. Because your clients deserve your best work. I hope you’ll consider joining our new workshop. It takes guts and support to make these choices, and it helps to find the others on a similar journey. That’s what we do–assemble and connect and inspire the sort of people you want next to you as you go on this journey. "
1932,The elegance of nothing,"April 13, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-elegance-of-nothing/,"What ever happened to details? The red sole of a Louboutin shoe, or the elegant tag on a pair of Tom’s? The sweeping fenders of a Porsche 911 or the needless complications of a fancy watch… Today, a certain kind of customer is using a Muji notebook, or wearing a plain Everlane t-shirt. Is this what we’ve come to? One might come to the conclusion that consumers have rejected all the effort that designers and marketers have produced in a statement that rejects design. Not so fast. Design is the new marketing. It is the product itself, not the ads or the slogan. Design is the supply chain of Patagonia, the ethics of Purple Carrot and the customer service at Union Square Cafe. It’s design, not advertising, that turned Apple into the most valuable luxury brand (and the most valuable company) in the world. But design requires a point of view. The confidence to make an assertion. And the skill to turn that assertion into something that resonates with the person you seek to serve. It’s probably easier to create heavily adorned mash-up than it is to produce a Field Notes notebook. Stripping away the artifice doesn’t always leave something pure. It often creates banality, the simple commodity that’s easy to buy cheaper one click away. The elegant nothing brands aren’t about nothing. Not all. They merely have a different, more difficult sort of artifice. The artifice of no artifice. The elegance of leading with utility as its own form of style. And what is a brand? It’s not the logo, certainly. I have no idea what Everlane’s logo is. The brand is our shorthand for the feelings that an experience creates, the promises that a product or service brings with it. If Nike announced that they were opening a hotel, you’d have a pretty good guess about what it would be like. But if Hyatt announced that they were going to start making shoes, you would have NO IDEA WHATSOEVER what those shoes would be like. That’s because Nike owns a brand and Hyatt simply owns real estate. For a company that stands for few details to become a brand, then, there needs to be a promise associated with what they make and what you’ll get if you engage with it instead of buying the cheaper commodity. In most cases where brands have been built, the brand has: 1. Served users who care about origin and elegance. They resist the idea of buying the cheaper commodity, because telling themselves they have the real one creates personal value. Beyond that, these users have the sensitivity (or taste) to be able to tell the difference between the real one and the knock off. Cayce Pollard (the fictional heroine of Gibson’s Pattern Recognition) only wears an authentic MA-1 jacket (you can buy a real life version right here). Her narrative about sensitivity, origin and authenticity makes the jacket worth the $675, even though she knows she could buy the knock off for 10% of that artificially high price. 2. Served users who care about status. The status of ‘people like us do things like this.’ These users know that their peers will recognize the invisible products they’re carrying, and this recognition is worth far more than the product itself costs. Seeing a designer with a genuine Uni-ball Signo UM-151 Gel Pen in her hand (from Japan) is to see someone who is better than you (perhaps). Better in the sense that she cares enough to go to the trouble. That she cares enough to know the difference. That she cared enough to pay a bit extra in time and money, because it matters–to her, and perhaps to you. 3. Found the intestinal fortitude to play a longer game. There are shortcuts everywhere, corners that can be cut, profits that can be taken. Once you get a small head start, you can license your name to others. You can cash out with a vodka or an affiliate deal of what sort or another. The invisible brands that last, though, realize that the artifact is only an artifact. It’s not the point. It’s a souvenir of the point. The point is that people like us do things like this. Our tribe, our group. That when we see the others, we see ourselves. Will the momentary mania among a small group who is busy measuring just how invisible they can be in their design fade away? Of course, it will. It always does. The cycle moves because the very people who drive the market, the neophiliacs, are in search of something new. Because something new gives them a new chance to tell a story, to earn status, to engage with that which is scarce. But the brands that matter are voices that choose to matter. Voices that make assertions on behalf of their users. Who market with people, and for them, not to them or at them. Work that matters for people who care. "
1933,The second bowl,"April 12, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-second-bowl/,"I broke two bowls today. I was emptying the dishwasher, holding both small clean bowls in one hand. One of them slipped, and I watched, aghast, as it started to fall in slow motion toward the hard kitchen floor. In a valiant but vain attempt to miraculously catch the bowl, I dropped the second one as well. Now both were gone. Often, the best thing to do with a lost cause is to let it go. Because pursuing it gets in the way of the causes you haven’t lost yet. "
1934,Workshops are not courses,"April 11, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/workshops-are-not-courses/,"Traditional courses, online or off, are linear. They’re based on a direct connection between the instructor’s content and the student’s attention. Write this down, memorize this, understand that. Traditional courses scale in a particular way. They scale even better when the instructor appears on video. Workshops are different. Workshops are about the cohort. The other students. The people you meet, the people you learn from and the people you teach. Workshops involve work, not the compliance inherent in testing and certification. If you want to learn to build a boat, take a workshop. It’s very difficult to run workshops at scale in the real world. The physics of interaction make it awkward. But it turns out that online, a workshop is a powerful way to learn. A course can be quite effective. Students get a ton of actionable insights from the highly-rated video courses I offer at Udemy. But a course can’t possibly provide the magic of a workshop. And workshops are the future of online learning. That’s because in a workshop, you are able to connect, and connection is at the heart of the economy we live in now. Connection means finding the others. Embracing peer support, giving more than you get, engaging with ideas and with other people. Connection is part of the process of growth. Connecting with possibility, with change and with the generosity of new ideas and new approaches. The Akimbo Workshops aren’t courses. In the most recent session of one of our seminars, a typical day saw students interacting with each other every three minutes, 7,000 times a day. In a typical course, that number would be zero. We’re launching two workshops this week. One might be a good fit for you, if that’s the direction you’re headed: The Freelancer’s Workshop (a short sprint toward finding better clients). The Bootstrapper’s Workshop (a deeper dive into building an organization without outside funding). Each of these is specific. They use Akimbo’s customized discussion platform to create large-scale communities built around solving a particular challenge. They are there to help you find the others. Four times a year, we run the altMBA, our elite flagship, a workshop that’s very different from the others. It has curated small groups, video conferencing, hands-on alumni coaches and focused cohorts that meet every day for a month. It’s designed to help you see more clearly, decide more effectively and most of all, transform into the leader you’re capable of becoming. I’ve been a teacher my entire career, and the workshops we’re running now are the most effective way I’ve found to help people level up. I hope you can join us. [also, another new riff on this from me on Medium] "
1935,The problem with unicorns…,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-problem-with-unicorns/,"is that there aren’t any. That’s precisely what makes them so interesting. The null set. The impossibility of it. A unicorn is not a black swan, which is a rare bird that proves a point. A unicorn is by its very nature, impossible. That’s actually not a problem. That’s the entire point. That there’s something unavailable. Instead of aspiring to unicorn status, a pipe dream which is simply a place to hide, we can instead decide to do something useful (and possible) instead. It’s more challenging to set your sights on something that’s possible. More useful, too.   [HT to Michael, for a tangential unicorn riff. He points out that now that so many companies are called ‘unicorns’, the term is meaningless, a lazy trope used by some in business media who eagerly substitute lazy tropes for insightful analysis and interesting assertions.] "
1936,Cognitive load is real,"April 10, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/cognitive-load-is-real/,"Disneyworld is stressful. The occasional visitor has far less fun than you might expect. That’s because without habits, every decision requires attention. And attention is exhausting. And it’s stressful because the choices made appear to be expensive. There’s a significant opportunity cost to doing this not that. You’re leaving tomorrow, what are you going to skip? What if it’s not worth the line? What are you missing? It’s all fraught. We feel the failure of a bad choice in advance, long before we discover whether or not it was actually bad. And it’s not just Disneyworld. It’s now the whole world. Every minute on a website is a minute not spent doing something else. Every decision about what to write in social media is enervating. It’s not like the old days, with just three TV channels and a TV Guide to make that difficult decision even easier. (The most popular magazine in America, for decades, was devoted to helping people figure out which one of three channels to watch). Here’s my list, in order, of what drives behavior in the modern, privileged world: The five are in an eternal dance, with capitalist agents regularly using behavioral economics to push us to trade one for the other. We’re never satisfied, of course, which is why our culture isn’t stable. We regularly build systems to create habits that lower the cognitive load, but then, curiosity amplified by greed and fear (plus our search for connection and desire to love) kick in and the whole cycle starts again.

1937,A job without a boss,"April 9, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/a-job-without-a-boss-2/,"Are you a freelancer or an entrepreneur? It’s not simply semantics, your answer changes everything. Freelancers get paid when they work. We’re not focused on scale… and we’re not tiny versions of real entrepreneurs. Freelancers do the work for clients who need them. Hiring employees to scale when you’re a freelancer can be a bit of a trap, because you are likely to give up the very thing you set out to do in the first place. Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are organized for growth. The job of the entrepreneur isn’t to do the work, it’s to build a company that does the work. Mary Barra doesn’t make cars at GM. She organizes so that GM makes cars. And, it turns out that there are two kinds of entrepreneurs: Funded and Bootstrappers. Funded entrepreneurs are the ones you hear about all the time. They use other people’s money to fuel their growth, and one day, they have to pay that money back, either by going public, selling, or distributing the profits. And Bootstrappers? Bootstrappers build a business using their customers’ money. Bootstrapping is a special case, an intentional choice, the chance to serve your customers so well that they eagerly fund your growth. I’ve been a funded entrepreneur, and I’m fortunate it worked out well. And I’ve also been a bootstrapper, more often than not, and sometimes that’s worked as well. Today, I’m often doing the work of a freelancer (no one writes these posts and those books but me). Which means, if you work on your own, you’ve got three choices, and we’ve built two Akimbo workshops that might help. Today, we’re launching the first session of the Freelancers Workshop. It’s an intensive interactive workshop with about ten lessons… you can finish it in just a few weeks if you want to, but you don’t need to worry about falling behind. Mostly, you will meet and engage with freelancers from around the world who will help you accomplish your goals (and vice versa). The Freelancers Workshop is focused on just one thing: Helping you get better clients. Because better clients are the only way for a freelancer to find the support and respect and income you seek. And, also today (because I want you to make the choice!) we’re relaunching the famed Bootstrapper’s Workshop. To date, thousands of people have experienced this deep dive into making deliberate choices about how to be an entrepreneur without scraping together money from investors and banks. I’ve been talking about the freelancer/bootstrap/entrepreneur trichotomy for years. Here’s what I hear most often: “Thank you for giving me permission to be a freelancer. It’s as though a weight was lifted, and I’m doing the best work of my career.” and “I’m so glad that I don’t have to obsess about valuations, bro fundraising culture and the rest of it. Our business continues to thrive, because we’re proud to be bootstrappers.”   Resources: More than 23,000 people have taken my Freelance course on Udemy. You can get it here for 10% off. And nearly a million people have read the Bootstrapper’s Bible. Here’s a free copy. The new workshops take these ideas and run with them. They connect you to others on the same path, using the proven Akimbo methods to help you go way beyond text or video and dive deep into how it works and why. Today’s an excellent day to decide if you’re a Freelancer, a Bootstrapper or something else… And if you visit the site, look for the purple circle for a rapidly decreasing discount for early birds.

Watching this video a year later, I’ve realized I have very little recollection of what happened in that jam-packed barn, so I’m thrilled that Kertis Creative captured the day. 
[You can rewind for a very kind intro from Tina.] I ended up riffing on dozens of topics, and it might be the best session like this I’ve ever done. I hope you get something out of it. And thanks to the amazing Creative Mornings community for bringing so much care and energy to the event. The timing for the release of the edit couldn’t be better, as we’re launching two workshops today: The Freelancer’s Workshop is brand new. Join us as we work together on the single biggest issue facing anyone who is out on their own: How to get better clients. And The Bootstrapper’s Workshop is an effective and proven method for starting an organization financed by customer investment. We’ve brought it back for entrepreneurs who are looking for a better, saner way to make a difference. Early birds, don’t forget to click the purple circle. I’ll be posting later today with some thoughts about the urgent but non-obvious choice so many of us face: Which are you, a freelancer or an entrepreneur? "
1939,Mind the gap(s),"April 8, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/mind-the-gap-2/,"There are two kinds of marketing, and the gap between them keeps widening. You’ll need to choose. Do marketing to people or with them… Actually, there are a few other gaps worth considering: Average stuff vs remarkable edge cases Brand vs. direct Unmeasured vs. measured Largest imaginable market vs. smallest viable audience. And… Attention as a precious resource vs. something to be purchased or stolen, cheap churn, and then move on. "
1940,The high cost of a little bit sooner,"April 7, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-high-cost-of-a-little-bit-sooner/,"As the news cycle has trained us to find out results the moment they happen (or sometimes, as polling promises, before they happen), it’s easy to lose track of a simple truth: There’s a sweet spot between knowing with certainty at a low price (yesterday’s weather report is free) and guessing with a bit of a head start at a huge price (insider trading information). When we’re anxious, we spend too much time and thus too much money trying to hurry up what we’re about to find out anyway. A deep breath is usually a better plan. "
1941,Do you remember the frenzy?,"April 6, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/do-you-remember-the-frenzy/,"There was an outcry when they banned cigarettes from bars in New York. The restaurant owners were certain that disaster was imminent. And there was panic when we began to switch to LED bulbs, with concerned citizens and opportunistic politicians proclaiming that it was the end of civilization as we know it. And when law firms started offering women partnerships… And when seat belts were required in cars… And when the building codes required fire exits and accessibility ramps… And when work rules required more training and more rest for pilots and airline crews… And when doctors were required to wash their hands before and after delivering a baby… Change isn’t always guaranteed to work, but change often brings the frenzy. "
1942,“I was wrong”,"April 5, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/i-was-wrong-2/,"That’s a hard sell. It’s difficult to get someone (a client, a boss, a voter, a partner) to say those three words. Difficult to say on our own behalf, too. Which is why we so easily get stuck. We get stuck defending what we already decided. Because it feels easier to defend than it does to be wrong. In 1993, in my role as founder of an internet company, I rejected the idea of the world wide web. I saw Mosaic (and then Netscape) and decided it was stupid, a dead end, a technology not worthy of our tiny company’s time. That decision cost me a billion dollars. Within nine months, I saw what others were seeing. I saw the power of widespread connectivity and how it was more powerful than a centralized host. It still wasn’t easy to say, “I was wrong.” The alternative is, “based on new information, I can make a new decision.” We can make a new decision on what’s happening to our environment, based on new data and new science. We can make a new decision on corporate governance or on a recent political referendum. “Why didn’t you tell me that it would lead to all these bad outcomes?” Not wrong, simply underinformed. The cost of a do-over is often less than the cost of sticking with a decision that was made in good faith, on insufficient information. We don’t have to be wrong. But we regularly get a chance to make things more right. "
1943,The avocado principles,"April 4, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-avocado-principles/,"All of these truths lead to the real insight, the metaphor that’s just waiting to be lived in all ways: If you get ahead of the cycle, waiting until the first one is ripe and then always replenishing before you need one, you can live an entire life eating ripe avocados. On the other hand, if impatience and poor planning gets you behind the cycle, you’ll be just as likely to waste every one you ever eat. Plant your tree before you need the shade. "
1944,More right,"April 3, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/more-right/,"There are at least seven realistic ways to get from my home near New York to a meeting in Washington DC. None of them are wrong. Each offers its own advantage in terms of resilience, speed, cost or hassle. And so, we can’t choose based on this is right and those are wrong. The only useful construct is to consider our priorities and find the route with the best combination of trade offs. Waiting for perfect is a never-ending game. And the comfort of totally right vs. totally wrong is elusive. "
1945,Next to the competition,"April 2, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/next-to-the-competition-2/,"Books sell better in bookstores than they sell in butcher shops. In a bookstore, surrounded by all the competition, a book is in the right place to be seen, compared and ultimately purchased and read. Trade show booths work when they’re in close proximity to the other options a buyer has. Building your trade show booth across town might insulate you from the other choices, but it does little to help establish where you belong and whether or not you’re a smart choice. If I was one of the 25 people running for President of the US, I’d organize my own debate tour. I’d invite four or five other candidates to hit the road with me, and I’d do a debate every single night. All six of us would benefit from the competition, leaving the rest behind, ignored because they are alone. No one will stop you, simply begin. And if I was a wedding photographer, I’d organize a dozen other photographers in town and do a joint brochure and marketing effort. Serving brides in a way that establishes status and increases their confidence. It’s tempting indeed to shy away from organizing a panel, a conference or a trade show where you can see and be seen right next to those that seek to solve problems for those that are listening. But now that information flows more freely than ever, that’s your fear talking, not an actual strategy for somehow fooling people into believing they don’t have a choice. [More on debates] "
1946,This has gone too far,"April 1, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/04/this-has-gone-too-far/,"The press release from Comcast, perhaps America’s most hated monopoly, begins as expected. “In order to serve all of our customers better, we’re delighted to announce several new features…” But it goes quickly downhill from there. Under the guise of increasing net access during a time when Net Neutrality is sorely missed, spokesperson Kevin Marting says, “We’ll be offering a new basic plan, one that costs 15% less than our current offerings. The only difference in service is that due to the cost of moving text around, these users won’t get vowels in their emails or blog posts.” He goes on to point out that reading without vowels is an ancient tradition, back to the Sumerians and ancient Hebrew. And that it’s more convenient, because, after all, convenience is what we all care about. I was part of the team that developed the original codec for the internet, particularly the way aascii characters would be treated. Because there are 26 letters (more in various international alphabets) we had to divide the corpus of letters into two batches, reserving a high bit for some of the most used letters. This high bit is necessary, but it also requires twice as much bandwidth to transfer. Of course, the videos transmitted by Netflix and YouTube use far more space than any text file ever would, but Comcast, seeing the post-literate future, decided to take a short-term selfish route and eliminate the letters that are the most difficult to move around. This is about the relentless munching around the edges that big companies engage in. They need to boost their earnings, and instead of focusing on better, they obsess about more. Once again, ordinary people are seeing choice stripped away by selfish functionaries and power-hungry bureaucrats. In the case of this blog, because we’re connected to the net via Comcast’s DSL (the only service that’s available in my building) it means that after next week, all future posts on the blog will only contain consonants (and semicolons). Enough already. The internet works because it’s open. It creates generous connection across time and distance, and it works best when it’s accessible to all. Just because a company can legally do something doesn’t mean that they should. Here, go ahead a try it.

1947,Busy is not the point,"March 31, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/busy-is-not-the-point/,"There’s a common safe place: Being busy. We’re supposed to give you a pass because you were full on, all day. Frantically moving from one thing to the other, never pausing to catch your breath, and now you’re exhausted. No points for busy. Points for successful prioritization. Points for efficiency and productivity. Points for doing work that matters. No points for busy. "

1949,Pretending to be stupid,"March 29, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/pretending-to-be-stupid/,"Intellectual horsepower is overrated. “I’m too stupid to do that,” isn’t helpful and it’s probably not true. We’re capable of learning Photoshop, We can figure out the arithmetic behind our analytics. We can follow a nuanced discussion of strategy. We can learn to read a balance sheet and we can get sophisticated about long-term decision making. If we’re being honest, the real reason we don’t do this work isn’t that we’re stupid. It’s probably that we haven’t made it a priority. It might be that we’re afraid, that we’re lazy or that we’re underinformed. All three are temporary conditions if we want them to be. Or we can live with them and assume that we’re stupid instead. (Which is worse: to be seen as stupid or to have priorities that don’t match the opportunity?) "
1950,Bottlenecks,"March 28, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/bottlenecks/,"Are you a bottleneck? Sometimes it’s a good thing. It would be impossible to guzzle a Pepsi if it were served in a saucer–the bottleneck creates the path of maximum slam. It would be difficult to water your lawn without a nozzle. The bottleneck creates pressure that allows you to reach further. But in an organization, a bottleneck can be a real problem. If the project is sitting on your desk, no value is being created. The opportunity, then, is to achieve your goals by getting every single thing off your desk so that it can move forward. A team that is sitting still waiting for you to attend the approval meeting is suffering from your bottleneck. And so are the people you set out to serve. The trick: Figure out which parts of the approval process truly benefit from your unique judgment and skills, and which parts are merely your fear at work. And then get it off your desk and let someone else do it. "
1951,The long run (and the short runs),"March 27, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/the-long-run-and-the-short-runs/,I hope we can all agree that the long run is made up of a bunch of short runs. That seems obvious. The surprising thing is that we live our short runs as if that isn’t true. 
1952,It’s not your tribe,"March 26, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/its-not-your-tribe/,"I didn’t say this clearly enough in my book. While there are a few outlier organizations and individuals who ‘have’ a tribe, more often than not, we simply have the privilege to talk to a community, to connect a community and perhaps to lead them for a while. But it’s a mistake to believe that they are ours to do with as we choose. The tribe of people who read Fast Company in the first few years weren’t invented by Alan and Bill. They were organized by them, introduced to each other (and new ideas) by them and challenged by them. But, as the world changed, the tribe found other places to meet those needs. At the watercooler and at the conference, the conversations shifted. It’s impossible to stay at the center of an evolving community for very long. Even for Apple. More profit doesn’t always open the door for more connection. The tribe of people who follow a politician are rarely aligned with her, personally. Instead, they’re aligned with each other, with the way it feels to be part of this movement. Over time, the tribe and the leader inevitably drift apart. The tribe of people who listen to Dave and Nastassia are into food and drink. But if Cooking Issues went away, the tribe wouldn’t disappear. When Booker and Dax produce a device for the tribe, that’s precisely what they’re doing. Doing it for the tribe, not to them. Most outsiders might wonder what it’s for, or hesitate at the price, but for those in the heart of the community, it’s a no-brainer, right here and right now. Tribal leaders are in a hurry, a race to connect and inspire. Tribal leaders dig deep to be seen, sure, but mostly to see. To see what the group believes and fears, and to help them get to where they hope to go. The realization that the tribe is already there, just waiting for you to contribute, is energizing. And the fact is that while we get the benefit of the doubt—that the tribe is open to hearing from you—they’re not yours. "
1953,Almost no one,"March 25, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/almost-no-one-3/,"Every time you talk about reaching everyone, that you imagine changing “the world,” you should fine yourself a nickel. It’s almost impossible to reach everyone. The most popular podcast in the world has reached one out of every 2,000 people on the planet. By a rounding error, that’s not nearly everyone, in fact, it’s essentially no one. The same is true for the most popular salsa, the bestselling writer and the leading non-profit. You’re going to reach virtually no one. That’s okay. The question is: which no one? Your smallest viable audience holds you to account. It forces a focus and gives you nowhere to hide. But first, you need to choose. "
1954,Data into information,"March 24, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/data-into-information/,"It takes discernment to do this. Most problems don’t require more data. They require more insight, more innovation and better eyes. Information is what we call it when a human being takes data and turns it into a useful truth. "
1955,Clearing the table,"March 23, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/clearing-the-table/,"Centralized control is fabulous until it isn’t. Centralized control gives us predictable, reliable, convenient results. Until it suffocates. Google promises websites free attention at a time when attention is harder than ever to obtain. It promises fast, convenient search at a time when people prize fast and convenient more than ever. And it promises targeted clicks for a known price to anyone who is willing to pay for them at a time when marketers are figuring out how to measure in the digital domain. But the three promises are undermined by the company’s need to keep growing in profitability. Google controls what gets built in many corners of the web. If your project isn’t Google-friendly, it probably won’t get built. If it used to be Google-friendly but it isn’t anymore, it will disappear. If there are twenty search engines delivering traffic to a wide variety of sites, diversity will come from that competition. But when there’s just one, then the human decisions about what gets traffic and what doesn’t (largely based on what makes Google a profit and what doesn’t) change the very nature of what we see and interact with. This centralized control gives Google the power to absorb most of the profit of businesses that have no better option than to advertise on Google. The powerful model of their ad auction is simple: if it’s worth $100 to your organization to get a new customer, and it’s worth $100 to your competitor to get that same new customer, in an auction, you’ll eagerly bid up to $99 for that click. Like a landlord who owns every building in town, Google can’t lose. A successful business in the online ecosystem is one that has a few dollars left over after giving the rest of it to Google or Facebook (or Apple). In the short run, the convenience and reliability of centralized control lull users into a happy compliance. It’s a miracle. It works. What’s the problem? But in the long run, where the long tail has fewer chances to thrive and where the powerful magic of choice disappears, we stagnate. If a centralized government authority decided what news and content we saw, filtered our incoming mail and regularly bankrupted competitors it didn’t like, there’d probably be more of an outcry. The alternative remains the power of peer-to-peer connection. Not the centralized authority of an unknown algorithm, but the roots-based cultural shift that happens when people find the others. When we build something that works better when it’s shared, it’s more likely to be shared. While it’s tempting to seek to be picked by authorities and found by strangers, the more reliable path is to organize and connect those that seek to be part of a tribe, to establish better cultural norms and then persist in making promises and keeping them. “Follow me” on this journey is more difficult, but it’s also more effective than pleading “pick me.” "
1956,Dissolve it,"March 22, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/dissolve-it/,"The best solution to a persistent, apparently non-solvable problem is to make the problem itself obsolete. Go around it. Cease to need it to be solved. Redefine your process or goal so that the problem is no longer permitted to slow you down. An unsolvable roadblock might be better called “reality.”   PS Today’s the altMBA deadline "
1957,How big is your unfillable hole?,"March 21, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/how-big-is-your-unfillable-hole/,"It doesn’t really matter, does it? All of your bad habits (and some of your good ones) exist to fill that hole, or to protect it from being seen. And as long as our mission is to fill the hole, and as long as the hole remains unfillable (and after all this time, if it’s not filled yet, good luck with that) it doesn’t really matter how small or trivial or unmentionable the hole is. It still drives us. The first step to living with it is to acknowledge it. You can’t make it go away. But you can learn to dance with it. "
1958,The minimum viable audience,"March 20, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/the-minimum-viable-audience-2/,"The smallest group that could possibly sustain you in your work… If you could pick the members of this audience, who would you choose? Their dreams, their worldviews, their energy, all up to you. If you could pick them and needed to delight them because you had no one else available, would your product or service improve? If you had no choice but to ignore the naysayers (they’re not in the group) or the people who don’t think they need you or your work, would that force you to stop compromising and start excelling? Two things happen when you delight your minimum viable audience: On the other hand, if you aim for mass (another word for average), you’ll probably create something average. Which gets you not very far. "
1959,Where are you headed?,"March 19, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/are-you-on-the-bus/,"Traffic at work isn’t just a metaphor. It’s real. We get stuck. Surrounded by people who are just as stuck. It can seem like progress is at a crawl. And then, we see a different way. Someone finds a lane we didn’t even know existed. Quickly, they’re joined by a few others, a cohort that’s making a difference and moving precisely where they want to go. All around us, there are people who want to protect their status quo, while others are on a path to level up. Some careers are about checking boxes while others set people up to draw the boxes. This blog, of course, is for people who want to do work that matters. It might be a more difficult route, but it’s worth it. The work of leveling up involves pushing past perceived limitations, understanding that they’re not real. And it involves surrounding yourself with people on a similar journey. “What’s required here?” is the question we were taught to ask. This is the loyal employee and the reliable cog, meeting spec. “What is the opportunity here?” is a totally different question. It’s about contribution and forward motion, not simply compliance. For people in a hurry to learn and contribute, the range of learning options online is a boon. You can learn more, and more quickly, than ever before. The options range from straight video courses (some of which are really quite expensive, some of which are nearly free) to intensive interpersonal community interactions. Some involve fun topics and well-known celebrities, while others are dry video monologues offered in exchange for a continuing education credit. Nearly three years ago, we started the altMBA. Our goal was to find people who were already enrolled in the journey of leveling up and making a difference–and so we created an intensive thirty-day workshop that would help them do better work. The altMBA is not like the other online courses you might see offered from various websites. We have a coach for every ten students, with group work, daily video calls and most of all, peer-to-peer projects. There are no gurus, no video lectures, nothing to memorize. It’s easier to take (and make) a straight video course, but I’m not sure it can deliver the results worthy of your time. One of the key choices we made is that we don’t have tests or a fancy accreditation. That’s because these enforcement tools separate the student from the process, turning it into something adversarial. The question, “will this be on the test?” is a question about how little can I do, and about compliance. On the other hand, if you’re enrolled, then no enforcement is necessary. If you’re enrolled in the journey, no one has to hassle you. Instead of seeking to do less, you seek to do more. The altMBA was created to help people see more clearly, make better decisions and engage with their soft skills, the ones that truly matter. This is a cohort of people who have decided to leave their imagined limitations behind. With the altMBA continuing to thrive, we’ve taken some of what we’ve learned from the process and expanded it into a new learning paradigm, online seminars we’re calling workshops. Unlike the altMBA, these new workshops don’t have a high coach ratio, organized learning groups or peer-to-peer projects. Instead, we’re building online communities with dozens of video lessons, lessons that each participant can turn into a chance to improve their own projects. In a typical workshop, there are hundreds of thousands of page views every few weeks, and a post is made every few minutes, 24 hours a day. Real people, interacting with each other because the journey is worth it. Seeing in others what they know they have in themselves. These workshops are far more tactical than the altMBA, but they still end up challenging people to ask themselves (and each other) the really hard questions. We’re calling these the Akimbo workshops. They include The Marketing Seminar, The Podcasting Fellowship and several others. And we only offer them to people who are already headed in that direction. It’s voluntary education, it’s for people who have decided to get on the bus and get to where they’re going. I hope you’ll check out both the altMBA and the Akimbo workshops. Because if you’re ready to level up, we’re ready for you.  PS If you’ve been on the fence about the altMBA, I hope you’ll click over to see some of our latest news, testimonials and updates–the final decision deadline for our next session is this week, on March 22.

1960,The invisible limits,"March 18, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/the-invisible-limits/,"Words like חמץ and kx’āhã don’t appear in English. These words, like thousands of others, include sounds that aren’t part of the normal spoken range of the language. We don’t have difficulty saying or hearing these sounds, they’re simply sounds we have rules against. The question is: Is the alphabet we use missing those sounds because we don’t use them, or is it that we don’t use those sounds because we don’t have letters for them? If you can’t see it, you can’t say it. And that goes for more than words. "
1961,Resilience and tolerances,"March 17, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/resilience-and-tolerances/,"Resilience is what happens when we’re able to move forward even when things don’t fit together the way we expect. And tolerances are an engineer’s measurement of how well the parts meet spec. (The word ‘precision’ comes to mind). A 2018 Lexus is better than 1968 Camaro because every single part in the car fits together dramatically better. The tolerances are more narrow now. One way to ensure that things work out the way you hope is to spend the time and money to ensure that every part, every form, every worker meets spec. Tighten your spec, increase precision and you’ll discover that systems become more reliable. The other alternative is to embrace the fact that nothing is ever exactly on spec, and to build resilient systems. You’ll probably find that while precision feels like the way forward, resilience, the ability to thrive when things go wrong, is a much safer bet. The trap? Hoping for one, the other or both but not doing the work to make it likely. What will you do when it doesn’t work? Neither resilience nor tolerances get better on their own. "

They take persuading, cajoling and enthusiasm to get going, and require ever more of it to keep going. And some people are a faucet, an endless pipeline of possibility, potential and forward motion. Who do you work with? Who are you hiring? It’s possible to turn a drain into a faucet. It’s mostly a choice, a decision to dance with the fear of contribution. "

How about, “Move fast and make things better,” or “Move fast and create possibility”? The reason we hesitate to move fast is that we’re worried about what that implies. Move fast and learn something. Move fast and take responsibility. Move fast and then do it again because now you’re smarter. The alternative is to move slow. To move slow and to hide. Which means that those you sought to connect, to help and to offer something to will suffer as they wait. Don’t hoard your work. Own it and share it. "

Perhaps it would be more accurate to call it a made hour or, if we’re going to be quite truthful, a made minute. When something bad happens, we can revisit the humiliation and anxiety for months. But the good stuff, if we don’t work at it, can pass right by. We get what we remember, and we remember what we focus on. "

But a headline that people click on is rarely one that earns trust, sustained attention or action. Which means that if you’re looking for more than a click, you’ll need to walk away from the bait and switch that’s now so common. Just because you can trick people and swindle a click doesn’t mean you should. Because, as we know, measuring the wrong thing is worse than measuring nothing at all. "
1967,Monopoly is the opposite of capitalism,"March 11, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/monopoly-is-the-opposite-of-capitalism/,"If you believe in the benefits of the free market, then the logical conclusion is to oppose policies that a market-dominating monopoly decides are in their best interest. Adam Smith and his descendants all understood that monopolies undo the benefits of the free market. Data portability, open marketplaces, net neutrality, campaign finance reform–all of these steps make it more likely that innovation occurs and that people have choices. Free markets work because ideas and processes can quickly evolve. When the system gets stuck, it doesn’t get better. Without choice, we’re left with bullies and whatever is on their agenda. "
1968,People who don’t care…,"March 10, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/people-who-dont-care/,"…doing things that they don’t understand, for managers who have no sense of strategy, in an organization that measures all the wrong things. Everyone involved unable to honestly answer the simple question: “Why?” Why are we doing it this way? Why is it like this not like that? “Because I said so,” is no way to lead. This is the unmistakable symptom of a bureaucracy that has gone too far.   PS back in the old days, I used to incorporate a PS in blog posts about Daylight Savings Time. A public service because we didn’t have computers that automatically changed all of our clocks. But it’s still up to us to spring forward. It won’t happen automatically. "
1969,Everyone and no one,"March 9, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/everyone-and-no-one/,"Rarely true. “Everyone loves it.” “No one wants to be my friend…” More effective and accurate to replace these words with, “someone.” "
1970,Embracing externalities,"March 8, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/embracing-externalities/,"The world is better because industrialism made it better. The world is worse because industrialism made it worse. When a factory makes something that people want, they buy it. When a competitor improves it, it gains in market share. When a third competitor becomes more efficient and lowers the price, even more is sold. And so we have safe, clean, cheap food that can sustain us. We have antibiotics that can save a life. We have transportation systems that just a hundred years ago would have seemed like a fantasy. The ratchet of industrialism is tied to the fast-moving cycle of the market, fulfilling needs and wants and making a profit. That same system, though, is insulated from the damage it causes. When a factory makes a product but pollutes the river that flows by it, the factory doesn’t pay for the pollution unless required to. When a marketer seduces people with short-term delights that cause long-term health problems, the marketer doesn’t pay for it, the customer does. And when the weapons manufacturer produces ever more lethal weapons, it’s the person who stepped on the land mine who pays the price, not the person who made it or purchased it. The opportunity is simple to describe but requires real effort to achieve: the community must enforce systems that build the external costs into the way that the industrialist does business. Faced with an incentive to decrease bycatch, waste or illness, the industrialist will do what industrialists always seek to do–make it work a little better, a little faster, a little more profitably. Industrialism can’t solve every problem, but it can go a very long way in solving the problems that it created in the first place. When facing a long-term, chronic challenge, we can look for a ratchet, a long-term positive cycle that helps us overcome that challenge. Externalities aren’t external, and we shouldn’t treat them that way. "
1971,Time and money,"March 7, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/time-and-money/,"“I can’t afford it.” “I don’t have the time.” …almost always means, “this is not a priority.” When we care, it’s amazing how much we can get done. One way to choose to care is to be clear about your priorities, which means being clear in your language. And so we can say to ourselves, “I’d love to do that, but it’s not a priority.” Remarkable work is usually accomplished by people who have non-typical priorities. "
1972,Concept cars,"March 6, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/concept-cars/,"Every year, Audi, Ford, GM and the rest of the auto companies bring concept cars to the big shows. These swooping, modern, magical cars are in stark contrast to the cars that are actually for sale. Why do they bother? It’s not a form of market research. Begin with the fact that car companies need their product to be stylish. By making older cars seem ‘old’, they create social pressure to get rid of your existing car (even if it’s running fine) and keep up with the trends. And so, every year, cars are a bit different. Not in performance, really, but in the way they look and feel. At the same time, though, consumers are really hesitant about buying a car that they’ll regret. It’s such a big purchase, it feels very different than buying a pair of purple uggs that might only be in style for a month or two. Concept cars, then, are an assertion by the company: here’s where we think we’re going, thanks for paying attention, car nerds! Tell the others. We’re here to entertain you, have fun. We know it’s outlandish today, but by exposing you to these features over and over for five or ten years, by the time the cars actually arrive, you’ll say “of course,” not, “what’s that?” They’re normalizing design progress. Making it safe over time. As you’ve probably guessed, this doesn’t only work for cars. Any idea that needs to move from early adopters to the masses can benefit from a preview that simultaneously delights the nerds while warming up the masses for what’s to come. "
1973,Loud voices vs. important ones,"March 5, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/loud-voices-vs-important-ones/,"Broken systems get worse when we confuse the loud voices with the important ones. Spend a lot of time listening to the loudest complaints and you will elevate those voices to importance, because you’re no longer carefully listening to the more easily overlooked constituents. A persistent typist with a keyboard might be a cranky critic, but is this the person you set out to serve? If an airline makes 84% of its profit on leisure travelers, it’s not clear that the person who flies once a year on a last-minute first class fare is the person they ought to be paying the most attention to. We can acknowledge that someone is upset, we can see them, respect them and help them. But we shouldn’t get confused that there’s a correlation between their ALL CAPS EFFORT AT ATTENTION and our agenda to serve the people we seek to serve. "
1974,“We meet all Federal regulations”,"March 4, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/we-meet-all-federal-regulations/,"The excuse made by large corporations for the impact of what they produce is that they simply follow the rules. Of course, at these companies, there’s often a different department in charge of lobbying to change the rules so that they can increase short-term profits while being less beneficial to customers and communities. It would only cost the car companies a dollar per car to prevent accidental carbon monoxide poisoning, which kills dozens of people. When you can run the car without the key (most modern cars), it means it’s easier than ever to pull your car into the garage and accidentally leave it running, which can kill everyone in your home before morning. When the government worked to put in a regulation requiring this fix, the car companies lobbied against it. Why would they do that? (Now, due to outrage, they’re fixing this particular problem. But in the past, the car companies fought seatbelts and other safety measures). Why does any organization actively fight to lobby to lower its costs when it might benefit customers and their communities? The rules are not going to lead to lower industry sales. All the standards do is raise the bar for all the competitors. I don’t think many of us want to live in the world of Sinclair Lewis. The restaurant industry fought a smoking ban, and the baseball bat industry fought one on aluminum bats for kids… Sooner or later, humans are involved. And when someone says, “not on my watch,” they commit to making things better, not simply more profitable. The rules are one thing, but what if you’re better than the rules? “We can make it better” is a far better motto than, “we meet all the regulations.” "
1975,Truth in bots,"March 3, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/truth-in-bots/,"All day we interact with others. And sometimes, they’re bots. Perhaps you’re in a chat room, and after a few Eliza-quality backs and forths, you realize that this helpful voice isn’t actually a voice at all, it’s simply a bot, here to interface with a tech support database. Or you’re talking to a next-generation bot on the phone, and it’s only a minute or two into the interaction that you realize you’re being fooled by an AI, not a caring human. Wouldn’t it be more efficient (and reassuring) to know this in advance? But we can take this further. If you’re on the phone with American Express and the person you’re talking with has no agency, no ability to change anything and no incentive to care, wouldn’t it be helpful to know that before you had the conversation? Or what about the publicist or direct marketer, sending you an email that purports to be personal but is in fact only personalized? Spam decorated as human interaction is still spam. The problem with not labeling bots is that soon, we come to expect that every interaction is going to be with a bot, and we fail to invest emotional energy in the conversations we could have with actual people. I feel bad for all the actual customer service professionals (doctors, bureaucrats and others who help) who have to deal with impersonal interactions simply because their customers have been fooled one too many times. The bots should announce, “I’m not a person, or if I am, I’m not allowed to act like one.” Or, if there’s no room or time for that sentence, perhaps a simple *bot* at the top of the conversation. That way, we can save our human emotions for the humans who will appreciate them. "
1976,To vs reply vs bcc,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/to-vs-reply-vs-bcc/,"How much of your inbox activity is initiated by you? What percentage of your email threads started with an email you wrote? And how much is spent replying to others? And finally, how often are you bccing or being bcced? I hope we can agree that the percentage for the third category should be close to zero. But for the first two, the simplest way to change your day is to dramatically alter the percentage of the first two categories so that you’re adding way more value for others. In whatever way works best. "
1977,“I don’t like your work”,"March 2, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/i-dont-like-your-work/,"That doesn’t mean I don’t like you. The difference is critical. It’s impossible to be a productive professional if you insist on conjoining them. Here are two useful things to consider: If someone cares enough to dislike our work, the best response is, “thank you.” Thank you for taking the time to consider it, thank you for caring enough to let me know… You can choose to listen (or not) to the rest of the feedback, but all you’ll learn is how one person reacted to something you built. "
1978,On feeling incompetent,"March 1, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/03/on-feeling-incompetent/,"At some point, grown ups get tired of the feeling that accompanies growth and learning. We start calling that feeling, “incompetence.” We’re not good at the new software, we resist a brainstorming session for a new way to solve a problem, we never did bother to learn to juggle… Not because we don’t want the outcomes, but because the journey promises to be difficult. Difficult in the sense that we’ll feel incompetent. Which accompanies all growth. First we realize something can be done. Then we realize we can’t do it. And finally, we get better at it. It’s the second step that messes with us. If you care enough to make a difference, if you care enough to get better–you should care enough to experience incompetence again. "
1979,Choice and obligation,"February 28, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/choice-and-obligation/,"If it’s an obligation, then you don’t have a choice. Pretending you do is simply a way to create frustration. Free yourself to simply do what you have to do. On the other hand, if you do have a choice (and you probably do) then it doesn’t make sense to treat it as an obligation. Own the choice. "
1980,The first piece of tape,"February 27, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/the-first-piece-of-tape/,"I’m sitting on a black couch in the lobby of a nice theater. The couch is cracked and peeling, with seven strips of black gaffer’s tape holding it together. And you don’t have to be an interior geologist to see that it has developed this patina over time, bit by bit. The question is: Who was the first person who decided to fix the couch with tape? The third or fifth person did a natural thing–here’s a ratty couch, let’s keep it the best we can. But the first taper? The first taper decided that it was okay for this theater to have a taped couch. The first taper didn’t make the effort to alert the authorities, to insist on getting the couch repaired properly. The first taper decided, “this is good enough for now.” This is how we find ourselves on the road to decay.   Here’s a new video the team just put together for the altMBA. I hope it resonates with you…  PS The early decision deadline for the altMBA is March 1st. "
1981,Lessons for telling time,"February 26, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/lessons-for-telling-time/,"For something as dominant as the four digits that we use to tell time, it’s disappointing that there’s no manual, and not surprising that we do it wrong so often. I’m not talking about the big hand/little hand part of announcing what time it is. I’m focused on how we use our awareness of time to screw up our narrative about life. Here are some examples: We focus on the days, making short-term decisions, instead of being cognizant of the years. We ignore the benefits that short-term pain can have in earning us long-term satisfaction. Which means that we often fail to invest, embracing a shortcut instead. We rehearse the past, obsessing about sunk costs, instead of freeing ourselves up to make new decisions based on new information. We put a stopwatch on our best experiences, ticktocking the moments instead of living in them. But we fail to be honest about the time when we’re in a dip, or unhappy, imagining instead that it is lasting forever. We confuse the thrill of fast-paced media with the magic of doing work that matters, even though they each take just as long. We might have a fancy watch, but that doesn’t mean we’re good at telling time. "

1983,Experience and variation,"February 24, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/experience-and-variation/,"The only way to learn from experience is to have different experiences. The very nature of an experiment is that there’s a chance you’re doing it wrong, or at least less ‘right’ than the way you usually do it. Which leads to the trap of no new experiences. The only alternative is to eagerly engage with the possible. If you follow the recipe the same way every time, you’ll get the same results every time. "

1985,Telescopes and microscopes,"February 22, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/telescopes-and-microscopes/,"It pays to look at opportunity with a telescope. It’s real, but it’s distant. The telescope brings it into focus and helps you find your way there. Telescopes are easy to find if you look for them. And it often pays to look at trouble with a microscope. Not to get intimidated by the amorphous blob that could snuff out your dreams, but instead to look at the tiny component parts, learning how it is constructed and taking away its power. Once you realize how it’s built, you can deal with it. "
1986,Work before passion,"February 21, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/work-before-passion/,"“Offer me something I’m passionate about and I’ll show up with all of my energy, effort and care.” That’s a great way to hide. Because nothing is good enough to earn your passion before you do it. Perhaps, in concept, it’s worthy, but as soon as you closely examine the details and the pitfalls, it’s easy to decide it’s better to wait for a better offer. What about considering the opposite? “Offer me a chance to contribute, and I’ll work hard on it, with focus, and once I begin to make progress, I’ll become passionate about it.” Work before passion measures our craft in terms of contribution, not in an idealized model of perfection. Passion comes from feeling needed, from approaching mastery, from doing work that matters. [HT to Terri Trespicio.] PS Today’s the first day of signups for the now-legendary Podcast Fellowship.

All thrilling, perhaps fun, but unlikely to change minds. If your cause is important enough, it’s worth taking the time and emotional energy to make your case without an argument. The opportunity is to recast your outcome in terms of the other person’s worldview, not insist that they change what they want or what they think they know. The culture isn’t immutable. You can change it. But not by picking a fight. "

You could either move to Cuba or plant winter wheat instead. But don’t beat yourself up just because the climate doesn’t match your seeds. "
1989,Who’s in the room?,"February 18, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/whos-in-the-room/,"We accidentally curate who comes to the meeting, who has a seat at the table where decisions are made. We almost randomly decide who is interviewing and being interviewed, who is brainstorming, who is reviewing the work… What if we did it with intention? What if we thought deeply about who sits across from us during the key conversations? Convenient should not be the dominant driver of this choice. Nor should existing protocol. “Who’s not here?” might be the most important unasked question. "
1990,The practical de-escalation of worry,"February 17, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/the-practical-de-escalation-of-anxiety/,"In order to maintain its power, common anxiety (sometimes called worrying) needs your help. Constant reminders, moments of conflict and concrete examples all pitch in to keep our worry on the warpath, amplifying it and further frazzling us. The feeling of experiencing failure in advance happens to many of us. But with active encouragement we can make it much worse. Without our help, it’ll likely fade away. But if we work at it, we can keep it going for hours. Not only do each of us experience worry, the feeling of imminent failure, but we often escalate it with our words and actions. “Don’t you know that this is the biggest meeting of my career? How could you have forgotten to pick up the dry cleaning!” or “The inspector is coming, and if we fail, they shut down this franchise. I want you to redo this entire section, and work overtime doing it. In fact, call in Jim and Bob from their day off, right now.” What’s happening here? We’re connecting the feeling of worry (it’s not really the biggest meeting of the year, it just feels that way, and the inspector has never failed us before, it just feels that way) with the real world. That gives us the ability to turn that worry into a concrete component of the actions that we’re taking. By doing so, we further reinforce the tactile and imminent nature of our feeling. The thing that just happened is real, our action is real, therefore the anxiety must be real as well. It takes this continuous narrative to keep the worry roaring along. What happens if instead we say, “Yikes. This big meeting that’s coming up has me stressed, and I was hoping my lucky jacket would be here from the cleaners. But it’s not, so I’ll need a minute to find an alternative. Either way, the meeting is going to go fine, it always does.” or “The inspector is coming and our perfect record is something we’re proud of. Would you spend a few minutes going over these three spots so we can know that we did our very best?” You could make the choice to actually work to amplify your fear of the negative outcome instead of working on the real problem. But you can’t do both at the same time. Either you’re amplifying your worry or you’re working on a solution to the problem. The alternative, a path worth seeking out, is to create a positive cycle, where each action we take creates a bit more confidence and calm, not less. We can choose words and tones that are softer, that don’t raise our blood pressure (or the ire of the person who’s working to support us) and that more directly get us to where we’d actually like to go. And it’s free. The Situation Room might be a profitable TV show, but you don’t have to live there. "
1991,Some problems are easier to sell,"February 16, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/some-problems-are-easier-to-sell/,"In order to solve a problem, you need to sell it first. To get it on the radar, and to have people devote time, resources and behavior change to address it. Human beings in our culture are wired to pay attention to problems that are: Visible–right in front of our eyes, not microscopic or far away. Non-chronic–rationalization is our specialty, and the reason we learn to rationalize is so that we don’t go insane when faced with long-term, persistent issues. We bargain them down the priority list. Symptomatic–this is a version of ‘visible’. If the problem has symptoms, and the symptoms are painful and getting worse, you have our attention. Symptoms that are stable or getting better feel much less urgent. Painful–some problems have symptoms that aren’t so bad. And so we ignore them. In our control–because helplessness is a feeling most people seek to avoid. The more certain the potential solution, the more likely it is people will acknowledge that there’s a problem. Keep us from feeling stupid–because we don’t like feeling stupid, so we’d rather ignore the problem. Status-driven–this one might be surprising. It turns out we like to focus our attention on things that will move us up the social hierarchy. Expensive–problems that cost us money right now are ideal for this culture, because expensive = urgent. Solvable–see that earlier riff about rationalization and chronic problems. If a problem doesn’t seem solvable, we’re a lot less likely to stake our attention on it. This explains why cigarette smoking among the youth took so long to (partly) extinguish. It was a high-status activity, with no real symptoms for decades. It’s not painful and the visible side effects (thanks to billions of dollars in culture-bending spending by the tobacco companies) were seen as positive by many who participated. While the anti-smoking cause was definitely helped by the weight of evidence and persistent efforts by the medical community, it was higher taxes and enforced smoking areas that turned the tide. They made the problem expensive and a little shameful. People who didn’t want to look stupid or feel poor didn’t smoke. Other problems that have a similar set of problems: Selling pre-need funerals. Addressing climate change. Balancing the budget. Bringing your kids to be vaccinated. Getting out of personal debt. Learning science and math. River blindness somewhere else… If you’re working to sell a problem to your public, it’s tempting indeed to point out how shockingly irrational all of the instincts above are in practice. More effective, though, is to remarket your problem with a story that resonates. "
1992,Mastering the medium,"February 15, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/mastering-the-medium/,"We know what it sounds like when you’re great at AM radio, classical music or even reality TV. We can imagine the tone and content you’ll need to be really good at being on Broadway. Jack Dorsey has made it clear that Elon Musk has mastered Twitter. He wrote, “I like how [he] uses Twitter. He’s focused on solving existential problems and sharing his thinking openly. I respect that a lot, and all the ups and downs that come with it.” Before you decide to master a medium, it’s worth considering the ups and downs that come with it. It’s not free. It costs. Is it worth it? Does being good at this medium help you achieve your objectives beyond simply being good at the medium? Yes, you might attract a crowd on the Bachelor or at the local fight club. You could probably be a world-class javelin catcher as well. But to what end? If you’re going to put so much effort into a form of media, it’s worth deciding if it helps you or only the people who run the platform. If you don’t want to go to Toledo, don’t get on the bus to Toledo. "

1994,Colors and numbers,"February 13, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/colors-and-numbers/,"By the time you’re six years old, you can count to infinity. Whatever number someone says, you will know a higher one. The same is not true for listing colors. Most of us can’t even do all 64 Crayolas, and it takes real effort to keep adding one more to the list. That’s a form of poetry. Identifying ways to comment on beauty. Seeking creativity when there is no obvious right answer. There’s always going to be someone who will pay you (a little) to add one more to a running total. But the non-linear act of invention and magic is far more valuable. "
1995,The trap of early feedback,"February 12, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/the-trap-of-early-feedback/,"We skew our thinking based on the first feedback we get. That’s the moment of maximum fragility, and so our radar is on high alert. But the math doesn’t hold up, and this high alert can destroy our most important work. All salt is the same. If you add a cup of salt to your soup recipe, it’s going to ruin it. Continuing to add salt in this quantity to soup is always going to ruin it in the same way, because all salt is alike. But all people are not alike. If you’ve created something that will delight and astound 10% of the marketplace, there’s a 90% chance that the first person who encounters your work will dislike it. He might even hate it. In fact, if you do the math, you’ll see that there’s more than a 70% chance that the first THREE people will hate it. And if you give up then, you’ve just walked away from serving the people you set out to serve. [Consider how much more resilient you might be if the first three people loved it. You might then persist in the face of 100 critics after that, simply because the early reviews were so positive. The order of feedback doesn’t change the ratio, but it certainly feels that way.] Listening to the right people is a gift, a chance to learn about how to do better. Listening to the wrong people, particularly the early critics, is a trap. If you’re not careful, it can become a place to hide. "

1997,Hard work,,Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/hard-work/,"Consider two loading docks at small companies. At the first, a tractor-trailer filled with heavy boxes shows up. The sole worker on the dock is tasked with unloading the trailer, asap. He puts on his gloves and begins hauling the boxes, one at a time. He’s manhandling them off the truck and straining to stack them to the side. Eight hours later, he has a strained back, blisters and an empty truck. A day’s work, hard earned. At the second dock, the sole worker looks at the truck and then heads next door, to the larger company and their foreman, a woman he met on the bus to work last week. “Can I borrow your hand truck and ramp for an hour?” It took guts to ask, he might have been rejected, but his calm manner and ability to connect worked. An hour later, the truck is empty. Who worked harder today? For most of us, hard work is measured in insight, emotional effort, and connection. It’s been a long time since the economy fairly rewarded people based on brawn alone. And now, consider the third company, where the person at the dock planned ahead and had everything ready as soon as the truck was scheduled to arrive… Or consider the keyboard workers, one of whom does a repetitive task all day long, and the other who did the labor to find a plug-in or macro that would do it in a few minutes… "
1998,CNP,"February 10, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/cnp/,"As Close as Necessary to Perfect The thing is, with limitless focus and energy, just about everything can be improved. That’s not the question. The question is: Is this thing you’re working on as close to perfect as it needs to be? As close to perfect as your customer demands? As close to perfect as the budget can allow? It’s not settling to walk away from something that’s CNP. It’s simply a smart allocation of your resources. [Please don’t forget the opposite: BGE. Which stands for Barely Good Enough. The thing is, BGE rarely is.] "
1999,Productive choices (which?),"February 9, 2019",Seth Godin,https://seths.blog/2019/02/productive-safe-harbors/,"When you’re doing scary creative work, or work that requires emotional labor, it’s natural to want to walk away a bit. To distract yourself. To go shave a yak, mindlessly eat or bother someone in the next cube. This is the main activity online, actually. People avoiding the real work. One useful practice is to have forced choices that break up the work but that are also productive. Not fun, that would be a mistake, but productive. Example: For the next hour, we either need to be developing a brand new strategy for your widget rollout or re-filing forty 1099s. One or the other, switch when you want to. If it gets too scary on the brand side, let’s do some mindless filing. Or perhaps it’s answering HelpScout requests. Or auditing a specific set of financials. The key is that it be something both important and unfun. It’s a no-win situation. Unless you want to think of it as a no-lose situation. It turns every distraction (in either direction) into a contribution. "
