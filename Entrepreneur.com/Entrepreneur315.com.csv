0,How New Businesses Can Create a Content Marketing Strategy,"Apr 18, 2024",Daria Gonzalez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/8-things-tech-startups-must-do-before-creating-a-content/463170,"
Wherever you are in your business journey, you'll need a content strategy to communicate with external and internal audiences — whether they're potential customers, new employees or other industry experts. As your business grows, your content strategy will naturally evolve. Using the tips below — which range from launching a content strategy plan to optimizing for audience growth — you can prepare for that evolution.Getting Started1. Build your strategy from the ground upInvesting in content creation might not feel like a priority when you're just starting out, but the impact of a well-executed strategy can be immense. If you have a limited marketing budget, content is a cost-effective way to reach your target audience compared to paid advertising.Moreover, it can showcase traction with potential customers. If you're courting investors, the success of your content can be used as proof of the popularity of your product. You will also benefit from early audience discovery by monitoring how your customers respond to your messaging, thus gaining a better understanding of what resonates with them.



2. Avoid shortcutsIf you fail to create a strategy from scratch, you'll risk producing inconsistent messaging. Instead of a haphazard approach, start with a concept the whole company can buy into. Don't assume you know your audience intimately; gather data to build a comprehensive understanding of who you're aiming to reach so you can create content that resonates. As you grow, monitor which methods are working or failing. Then, you can make informed decisions about your strategy based on performance.3. Understand your audienceThere are two approaches to use when defining your target audience. The problem-solving approach considers your customers' pain points and how your brand's solution is different from your competitors. The customer-persona approach is about creating a hypothetical representation of your brand's ideal customer based on research and data. By understanding your customers' motivations and needs, you can tailor your messaging and offerings to better meet those needs and stand out from the competition.Related: How Buyer Personas Can Transform Your Marketing and Get Results4. Look inward, not outwardA robust content strategy begins with looking at your own brand, not at your competitors'. Make sure you're answering these questions when building out your strategy:What's your business vision and mission? This relates to your company's values, culture and purpose.How would you describe your brand's personality? This pertains to the human characteristics attributed to your brand.How would you define your brand's voice? This is about how your brand sounds to customers.Being able to definitively answer these questions will help you express your brand value to external audiences.5. Know your value proposition and unique sales propositionsOnly after you've studied your company's internal characteristics is it time to look outward and see how you compare to competitors. Your value proposition and unique sales propositions (USPs) will help form the basis of your content strategy. Your value proposition is based on information about what your competitors are offering. It's important to understand their strengths and weaknesses so you can articulate why your brand offers a better solution. Your unique sales propositions augment the value proposition by defining the specific features and benefits that make your products stand out.


6. Establish realistic and measurable goalsYour business goals will inform the goals of your content strategy. To help set strategic goals, start with a realistic planning time frame. For example, six months gives you enough time to gain momentum, test out different hypotheses and track performance. A long-term approach helps you focus on building a solid foundation instead of looking for quick results. Content can take a while to ramp up, but if you approach it with a long-term perspective, you'll eventually reap the benefits.7. Transition from content strategy to content planWhen executing your plan, one of the first steps is identifying your priority marketing channels — which will be determined by what your research has told you about your audience. These channels may include your website, email, various social media platforms or even mailers. Then, it's time to map your content-posting schedule to an editorial calendar, keeping in mind the themes that most resonate with your audience. By creating a content calendar, you can ensure that your content is consistent, relevant and serves your overall goals.8. Measure, track and optimize contentA data-driven approach is essential. By tracking your strategy's performance, you can see trends and tweak accordingly to improve the traction of your content. Depending on your goals, you'll need to measure key performance indicators (KPIs), including website traffic, social engagement, conversion rates and lead generation. Here's the case for data-driven content marketing success:With data, you can make more informed decisions about your content and improve how you're targeting your audience.Data helps you better understand your customer's journey and develop more personalized content that speaks to their specific needs.By understanding what's working and what's not, you can avoid spending time and money on content that doesn't perform well.Data helps you optimize your content distribution strategy to reach your target audience with the right message at the right time.Data can help you track progress over time and see how your content marketing efforts impact the bottom line.Related: 7 Crucial Metrics to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Your Marketing CampaignsTypes of ContentThe difference between content and content marketingOn the internet, content is anything that expresses thoughts, information or experiences through written, visual or audio media. The photos uploaded to Instagram are content. The videos uploaded to YouTube are content. This article is content.Content marketing, on the other hand, is a strategic approach to marketing that emphasizes the creation and delivery of valuable information or ideas to attract, retain and convert a clearly defined audience.Content marketing can take many forms — email, social media, case studies and blogs — but it's differentiated from mere content by strategically providing solutions to your audience's problems — with the goal of raising the profile of your company and its products or solutions. If you're putting your audience first, addressing pain points and producing exceptional content, then you'll grow your brand while also cultivating authority and trust. That's content marketing.The difference between thought leadership and content marketingThought leadership garners a lot of attention among entrepreneurs and those aiming to pick up more traction and increase brand recognition. Content marketing serves a similar purpose, but many people are unsure what the differences between the two are. The four primary factors that differentiate them are as follows:


Content marketing is top-down. Typically, content marketers are businesses talking to potential customers or clients. Thought leadership, on the other hand, is peer-to-peer. The objective of content marketing strategies is ultimately to sell a product or service. With thought leadership, the primary goal is not to sell but rather to create a business relationship.Big ideas matter. Although content marketing aims to provide value to readers, thought leaders must offer something groundbreaking. If you call yourself a thought leader, you must present deeper insights than your competitors.Thought leadership is higher in the sales funnel. Thought leadership is often deployed by large organizations selling high-ticket items in a complex and long-lasting sales process. When thought leadership is deployed, the central objective is to make an impression that presents the author and their company as experts.Content marketing is published on your platforms. Thought leadership is often published in industry publications, which means the writing style tends to be less promotional.What is premium content?Premium content is any content format meant to be higher quality, more in-depth or more valuable than what you typically produce. Some of the most common examples of premium content include ebooks, white papers, original research and online courses. This is the type of content your audience might pay for while they could read a blog post for free. Producing these valuable content types might help you generate leads, as people are more willing to volunteer their information if they gain access to high-quality content like a white paper.What is snackable content?Snackable content is uncomplicated and short-form content that can be digested quickly — like a snack. Its origins stem from social media, where infographics, memes, GIFs and reels now dominate user feeds. It doesn't require effort from users to read or engage with, but it also can provide awareness of your business.Because of its ability to capture users' attention, snackable content on your website — maybe via an infographic, listicle or fun quiz — can drive users to your website and keep them there. Snackable content is also mobile-friendly, which can draw larger audiences. It can even improve your search engine optimization (SEO) strategy, helping more people find you in the first place.Driving EngagementWhat is quality content?Quality should always be your top content priority. Search engines like Google reward helpful, reliable, people-first content, but even more importantly, quality content significantly affects your readers and customers. Content should be original and easy to read with no spelling or grammatical issues. It should also be relevant and timeless. When it comes to SEO, consider these critical factors:Traits of quality contentLength: In general, blog posts and articles should be 1,000 to 3,000 words. Landing pages or description pages perform better at 300 to 500 words.Structure: Format your content using title (H1) and subheader (H2 and greater) tags. This semantic structure boosts your SEO score.Links: Linking to internal and authoritative external webpages increases traffic and performance.Keywords (and keyword density): Using keywords relevant to your topic is critical. But be careful. A keyword density that is too high can lower your SEO ranking (experts generally recommend a density between 1% and 2%).Usefulness: Create content that features original research with comprehensive insights that go beyond what else will appear in search results.Meta title and description: A catchy meta title and description that includes your primary keyword or phrase will attract readers.How to optimize quality controlBe sure to review each piece of content before it's published. This takes time, but it's essential to consistently produce quality work. Follow these guidelines for each piece of published content:Organize your workflow: Use tools that allow you to manage content formats and run it through a pipeline of drafting, editing, revising and publishing. Involve other team members in the workflow to ensure enough people see each piece of content.Avoid plagiarism: Plagiarism isn't just an ethical or quality concern; search engine algorithms downgrade pilfered content. Use plagiarism checkers to ensure your content is unique.Eliminate spelling and grammar mistakes: Ideally, you should hire an editor to proofread your content and catch typos, syntax, diction and grammatical errors. If you don't have an editor, take advantage of online tools. Many products can help you clean up your writing.How to create viral contentMany brands want their content to go viral, but whether this happens or not is out of their control. There's no switch you can flip that will create a viral moment, but these seven factors will give your content better odds of taking off:High emotions: According to a study from the Journal of Marketing Research, content that leaves readers awe-inspired, excited, angry or amused is more likely to be shared than low-arousal content that evokes contentment or sadness.Practicality: Useful and educational content is also more likely to go viral, as people enjoy sharing this type of content for altruistic reasons. This is part of the reason that ""how-to"" lists perform so well.Readability: Your content might contain groundbreaking information, but it's useless if it's too dense. Run your work through a readability test and aim for a reading comprehension level of an eighth grader.Power words: Inserting power words with emotional triggers into your title and introduction will help hook your audience and get them to share the content. Here's a list with more than 800 examples.Trustworthiness: People share credible content. You can build trust in your content by quoting experts in your field and citing statistics and sources.Visual appeal: As with readability, layout matters. Readers typically want easy-to-navigate websites with clean designs and consistent visual elements.Timeliness: When you post is as important as what you post. Research your audience's behavior and site traffic so you can deliver and promote valuable content during peak hours.Content promotion tipsReaching a large audience requires you to devote resources to promoting your work — on social media channels, through email and elsewhere. Although the content itself is the bedrock of your marketing strategy, promotion is also paramount.The case for content promotion:Good content is useless in a vacuum. If you've just launched a blog, people won't find it unless you spend at least some time and money on promotion. Because of this, early-stage content promotion is essential.Promotion is (arguably) less expensive than creation. When you pay for content creation, you're taking a bit of a gamble because there's no guarantee that your content will function as intended. But when you pay on a per-click basis for advertising, you practically guarantee a stream of visitors to your website.Promotion can maximize your creation investment. Even if you have only a few pieces of content, continued adaptation and promotional investment can help you reap more value from your content creation over time.Keys to being successful in content marketing:Start with a strong foundation. If your blog is empty or if its content is hard to understand, no promotional strategy in the world will be able to salvage it. At a minimum, you should have at least a few strong resources on your website that people perceive as authoritative and trustworthy.Promote strategically. You don't need to spend large amounts of money to see results as long as you're strategic. Focus on platforms where you've traditionally seen strong engagement, or exclusively promote content that is already well-received by your followers.Learn and adapt. Perhaps most importantly, you must study your content marketing metrics to learn which of your investments is paying off. Is your content creation investment seeing a better return than your promotional investment? If you can answer this question, you can make better content marketing decisions.Refining Your ApproachAs your marketing strategy evolves, it's important to implement tools and strategies that will make content production more efficient and, ultimately, more lucrative. You don't need to have every tool and strategy in place on day one, but it's important to refine your operation as you grow.


Content marketing toolsThere are countless tools and software products for marketers — some of which are more essential than others. To help you determine what you actually need, here are nine of the most important types of content marketing tools:Content management system (CMS): WordPress is perhaps the most well-known CMS, but many platforms allow you to manage online content and give access to contributors. A good CMS lets content teams create content without needing to be a coding expert.Customer relationship management system (CRM): A CRM is used to manage a company's relationships and ultimately close more business. Several companies offer CRMs, including Salesforce, HubSpot and Marketo, but you'll need to do significant research before selecting the right option.Email marketing platform: It's essential to be able to reach your customers with email — via a regular newsletter or one-off updates. A good email marketing platform will offer CRM integration, allow you to manage customer and prospect information and track key metrics, such as click-through and open rates.Marketing automation system: Several aspects of marketing, including social media posts, email and lead generation, can be automated with the right software. Ideally, it should also be easy to use and integrate with your CRM and other tools.Key performance indicator tracker: KPIs are the most important metrics that your business strategy is being measured against, like revenue, contact form submissions, inbound leads and more. You can create your own with a spreadsheet or use a pre-made tracker.Project management software: Project management software is used for project planning, content workflow scheduling and allocating resources. Asana, Monday and Trello are some options, but you can also create your own system.Design software: Creative work often requires some sort of graphic design, and using software such as Canva or Adobe will be key. With the right design tools, you can ensure your visual content captures your audience's attention.Analytics software: You'll need an analytics tool to report how your content channels perform and how your campaigns influence revenue. Without one, you won't have data to track your KPIs. Google Analytics is perhaps the most well-known tool, but there are plenty of others to choose from.Social media management software: A social media management platform provides an efficient way to create and schedule posts across a variety of social channels. HubSpot, Hootsuite and Buffer are a few of the more well-known tools, but there are many others.How to write compelling content that convertsOnline readers are bombarded with information and selective about the content they consume. The way you write has a major impact on if you'll attract an audience. Your content should provide valuable information and answers to consumers and needs to strike a tone that connects with them.To accomplish this, follow these two pillars of great website content:Use a conversational tone: Focusing on conversational content throughout your website copy can help you open an ongoing dialogue with your followers, improve brand awareness and encourage engagement. This is why you see businesses incorporating user-generated content like customer feedback, testimonials and snippets from reviews on their websites — it backs up the claims they make about their product or service.Incorporate storytelling: Every aspect of online marketing goes back to storytelling. People love good stories. You can have an excellent product, service and team, but if you're not able to tell a good story about your company, you'll lose out on your audience. This might include your origin story, a testimonial from an employee or an example of how your product changed someone's life.Content monetization strategiesAlthough content marketing efforts can build awareness and ultimately lead to sales, they can also be a revenue driver on their own. If you're writing blog posts, recording a podcast or live streaming on a regular basis, you can use most of these strategies to make money:Direct advertising: If you're producing enough content, you'll likely be able to sell ads. It's a simple strategy, but be careful: Your audience might not appreciate being inundated with ads.Sponsorships/affiliate links: With sponsorships, you'll make money by talking about specific products or featuring someone else's content for free. With affiliate links in your content, you'll generate revenue as a percentage of the sales you influence.Donations: Platforms like Patreon make it easy for content creators to accept donations for their continued work, and platforms like Twitch have a built-in donation option.Premium content: You can also make money with optional premium content that's more in-depth or exclusive than your typical work. Bloggers often provide premium content in the form of an ebook or collection.Subscriptions: Depending on the nature of your content, readers might be interested in an ad-free experience via a paid subscription. A subscription could also grant your audience access to an entirely different content feed.Merchandise: If you have a large following, selling products like shirts, hats or mugs with your branding can generate revenue and give you a platform for free advertising.Exclusive rights: If your content gains a big enough audience, a platform might pay you to use its platform exclusively, preventing its competition from capitalizing. These deals are rare but lucrative.Now that you understand the basics of creating — and implementing — a content marketing program, it's time to produce and promote your work. Conduct research to understand your audience, use analytics to measure your goals and use the tools and strategies in this guide to help you along the way. Soon, your content strategy will be firing on all cylinders.

 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Agriculture equipment company John Deere is on the hunt for a different kind of CTO.The brand on Tuesday announced a two-week search to find a ""Chief Tractor Officer"" who would create social media content to reach younger consumers.One winning applicant will receive up to $192,300 to traverse the country over the next several months showcasing the way John Deere products are used by workers, from Yellowstone National Park to Chicago's Wrigley Field and beyond.



""No matter what you do — whether it's your coffee, getting dressed in the morning, driving to work, the building you go into — it's all been touched by a construction worker, a farmer, or a lawn care maintenance group,"" Jen Hartmann, John Deere's global director of strategic public relations, told AdAge.To kick off the search, John Deere tapped NFL quarterback Brock Purdy (who will presumably be a bit busy this Fall to take the job himself) to star in a clip in which he attempts to set out on a road trip in an industrial tractor.Suited up in the obligatory vest, work boots, and John Deere hat, Purdy's progress is interrupted by teammate Colton McKivitz hopping into the cab while a string of messages floods in from other athletes and influencers expressing interest in the job.The clip also represents the first time that the 187-year-old company has used celebrities to promote itself, Hartmann told AdAge.


According to the contest rules, entrants have until April 29 at midnight to submit a single 60-second video making their pitch for why they should be the face and voice of the company.In addition, entrants must live in the 48 contiguous states or DC — sorry Hawaii and Alaska residents. Interestingly, any AI-generated submissions are prohibited, too.Videos will be judged against four categories — originally, creativity, quality, and brand knowledge — after which five finalists will be chosen and notified after May 17.

2,"A Step-by-Step Guide on How to Make Money With Facebook Ads, According to Experts","Apr 17, 2024",R.L. Adams,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-make-money-with-facebook-ads/305380,"
It's hard to know exactly what will work on Facebook these days. The world's largest social media platform — owned by and rebranded as Meta — is constantly updating its algorithms and policies, which can create uncertainty for content creators and advertisers. However, with more than 3 billion users, Facebook offers a unique opportunity to drive traffic to your website, boost awareness for your business and grow your online audience.Facebook ads can become a key component of your sales funnel, and when you understand how they work and what strategies perform best, you can create cost-effective campaigns that meet your needs and, ultimately, drive revenue. So, how do you go about doing that? Follow the tips below — which range from audience targeting to budgeting and more — and begin reaping the benefits of advertising on Facebook.How to craft your message.Everyone wants to make money with their Facebook ads, but many people don't know how to craft the right message. By following the ""Feel-Felt-Found"" formula you can create messaging that is both engaging and effective.



Feel: The goal is to connect and show empathy. Let your audience know you understand how they feel – this should address their pain points and the origin of their issue. Let them know that you're solving their problem with your product or service.Felt: The next part in the empathy bridge is to relate that you've felt the same way: You know how they feel because you've felt that way too, and that feeling was the catalyst for the product or service you created to address the problem.Found: This is where you tell the prospects about the solution you found or the origins of the solution. Here, you'll describe something that worked for you or that you've implemented and has worked for others.Businesses big and small have found success using this formula to create ads. For instance, when Dove created Project #ShowUs in 2019 to help women focus on body positivity, they made it a key pillar of their Facebook ad strategy. By creating empathy with their customers, they reached 900,000 people globally and significantly expanded their audience.How to reach your target marketMaking money with Facebook ads requires you to find the right audience. And to do so, it's worth understanding the Pareto Principle, which says that 80% of your results come from 20% of your effort.This principle applies across the board. The majority of your sales will come from 20% of your customers, and 80% of your income will come from 20% of your work. This concept applies to every aspect of your e-commerce business – but to make it work you have to narrow down your audience to 20%. To do that, consider the ""follow-frequent-fund"" formula.Follow: Who do your prospects follow? What do they read? This might be an industry leader, a specific Facebook Group or other business pages. Once you know who they're following, you can use that information to better target your ads.Frequent: The next question to ask yourself is what your prospects frequent, meaning where they go and what they do on a daily basis. Facebook lets you narrow down ads by interests, so understanding this information will be key to your ad-building process.Fund: The final part of the formula is to determine where your prospects are spending their money – this is often where their heart and their passions lie. If you can answer this question, you'll hone in on your target audience with precision.Creating your magnetWhat does your lead magnet — the item or service that you're offering people to grab their attention — look like? Making money with paid ads of any kind involves delivering something of value. This could be a cheat sheet, a checklist or an ebook. Think about something you can deliver that can be read in about 10 to 15 minutes.Make sure that every step of your sales funnel delivers real value.When creating a lead magnet, ask yourself: ""What can I offer the marketplace that will add value?"" To help you figure out the best lead magnet for your business, follow this four-step method that follows the S-A-G-E acronym.


""S"" stands for SHORT. Remember: the lead magnet should be able to be read and understood in 10 or 15 minutes.""A"" stands for ACTIONABLE. Identify the difference between information and insight. Insightful content tells the prospect what to do with the information they're being given in order to achieve a very specific result.""G"" stands for GOAL-ORIENTED. Each piece of content should be goal-oriented. Everyone is looking for a solution that gets them closer to their goals. If you're the one who presents them with the solution, they're going to associate their progress with you. That makes them more likely to come back and spend money with you.""E"" stands for EASY. Everyone wants an easy solution – it has to be simple. How do you determine if it's simple? Ask yourself the following question: ""If I were to give this information to an 8-year-old, could they then apply it to their business?""Create the sales mechanismThe next step in your quest to make money from your ads is to create the sales mechanism, also known as a sales funnel. A sales funnel is the process of finding a prospect and bringing them into your ecosystem to eventually become a customer. What can you put in place so that those people who buy not only know you, but also like your company enough to purchase directly from you? When the prospect is ready to purchase the product or service, the goal is that you have already developed a positive relationship with them so they choose your company over your competitors.Best practices for building the perfect Facebook adThere are a variety of ways to approach the ad-creation process on Facebook. Photos and promotional videos can draw audiences in, but you must also write engaging ad copy that's clear and prompts viewers to take an action. Here are the key elements of a great Facebook ad:Think visually: Hooking users immediately will give your ad a greater chance of driving post engagements. Design something visually impactful by using high-quality photos, bright colors and easy-to-read text. Consider using video ads, too, as they lead to the highest click rates of any format.Be concise: You only need a few words to catch your audience's attention. However, your ad does need to prove your product's value. Be pithy, but tell the audience what your product or service will do for them.Include a clear call to action: You may have created a visually appealing ad, but it won't lead to conversions if you don't tell people where to go. That's where a clear call to action (CTA) comes in. Tell your users you want them to click, download or call today. Because a CTA takes up precious text, it's okay to think outside the box.Facebook ad FAQsHow do I promote my small business on Facebook?Targeted ad campaigns help you reach the right people with your message and increase the chances of it driving engagement. To start, take advantage of Facebook's Audience Insights feature to gain insight into the demographics of your ideal customers.Are Facebook ads worth it in 2024?The short answer? Yes. Facebook can be a great way to promote your business over the next year. While there are many ways to advertise online, Facebook is still one of the most cost-effective advertising methods on the internet.How much does a Facebook ad cost?The cost of an ad varies depending on how many people you want to see it, how long you want it to run and factors including location and audience type. However, you can set both daily and lifetime budgets and Facebook will drive engagement based on those parameters. If your total budget for the ad is $100, consider running it for five days at $20 per day.How do I start a Facebook ad campaign?If you want to start a Facebook ad campaign, you must create a business page and Facebook Business Manager account – but to do this you must already have a personal Facebook page. If you don't, you'll need to create one.Once you've launched your business page, define the objectives for your ad campaign (e.g. driving traffic to your website, getting more likes and followers or maximizing reach). Next, target your audience by age, gender, location, interests and other factors. Once you've completed those steps, create an engaging ad with high-quality visuals, compelling copy and calls to action. Finally, set your ad budget parameters and publish your ad. It will then be reviewed by Facebook and, if approved, it will go live.How do Facebook ads work?Facebook advertisements target users based on their behaviors, interests and other demographic information. When a user sees your ad on their timeline, they'll be measured as part of the ad's reach. If they click on the ad or interact with it (via reacting, commenting or sharing), their behavior will be counted as an engagement. When creating an ad, keep in mind that you can restrict your efforts to Facebook or, using Meta Ads Manager, you can share your ad on Meta's other platforms including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.


How do Google ads compare to Facebook?With Google Ads, you can target people actively searching for keywords related to your business or product. By contrast, Facebook ads let you target people based on their interests and other demographic information, so visual ads are served to them while they're spending time on social media.The benefit of Facebook is that it enables you to be more selective about the type of person you are trying to reach.Do Facebook ads work for small businesses?Yes. Regardless of the size of your business or daily budget, Facebook can be a powerful tool. You can tailor your ads with precise segmentation to reach the right audience, helping them make more impactful connections and increase awareness of your business.For how long should I run a Facebook ad?The duration of your ads will vary based on audience engagement, but the short answer is you should run ads for as long as they are effective and within your budget. While many advertisers use an interval of one or two weeks to test an ad, Facebook will let you keep a single ad live for as long as 90 days.How do I find my target audience for Facebook ads?Before launching any serious advertising initiative, it's important to conduct market research. Where do your customers live? How old are they? What are their interests? Some of this can be done informally via surveys and direct outreach, but you can also use software like Google Analytics to better understand your audience demographics. Once you've done this, you can target your Facebook advertising efforts accordingly.How do I measure the success of my Facebook ads?The best way to measure the success of an ad campaign is by tracking its performance with Facebook Audience Insights. This tool will help you measure impressions, clicks, conversion rate and more to determine which ads are performing best and providing the most value. As your advertising strategy evolves, you can determine your KPIs — such as cost-per-click or engagement rate.What is a good budget for running Facebook ads?There's no one-size-fits-all budget recommendation, as you can launch a Facebook ad spending as little as five dollars per day. The more you spend, the more people you'll reach, and those figures largely depend on the size of your business. However, it's worth testing your ads with a small budget before allocating more money to any campaign. Determine what works best and invest from there.What is the average return on ad spend for a Facebook campaign?The average return on ad spend (ROAS) for a Facebook campaign can vary depending on your target audience and how well your ads perform. Generally, you should aim to get a ROAS of at least one to five times — meaning you're earning back the amount you spent to run the campaigns. To calculate your ROAS, divide your total profit by the amount you spent on running the ad.Phrases to avoid in Facebook adsFacebook's advertising policies can seem awfully opaque, as there are certain topics and words that may lead to your ad being rejected. Worse, your ad account could be suspended if you have too many rejected ads. If you're running ads about politics or social issues, you must get your page verified and confirm your identity with Facebook. Even if your ad doesn't have any content about politics or social issues, there are a few phrases and writing styles you should avoid.


Too many personal attributes: The Facebook algorithm will penalize you for using too much ""you"" or ""your"" language. Essentially, they don't want you to make assumptions about people based on their attributes. While a few instances of ""you"" and ""your"" may be permissible, Facebook's transparency center recommends you limit the use of this type of language. For instance, the following phrase may be rejected for making assumptions about motherhood: ""Are you a busy mom with no time to make healthy meals for your family?""Capital letters and exclamation points: You don't want to ""yell"" at potential customers, which is the impression phrases in all capital letters can give. Use capital letters and exclamation points sparingly and only to emphasize important words. Facebook may reject your ad for having too much exclamatory language as it could violate the platform's grammar and profanity rules.Sensitive topics: Topics like health, weight loss, beauty products and anti-aging supplements are closely monitored by Facebook and may lead to your ad being rejected. The platform outlines these categories under its personal health and misleading or false content policies. You'll want to avoid ad copy like this, for instance: ""Tired of diets that don't work? Want to lose weight without counting calories?""""Get rich quick"" language: Facebook does not like ""make money"" schemes, work-from-home opportunities that encourage people to quit their jobs or financial claims that might not be possible for everyone to achieve. The platform addresses these issues in its multilevel marketing and prohibited financial services policies. So, be careful using language around making money and reframe true income opportunities to focus on the benefits you're offering.Profanity: Facebook tries to maintain a family-friendly environment, and wants to avoid a parent scrolling through content with a child by their side encountering a four-letter curse word on a sponsored post. Along those same lines, sexual images and overt language around intimacy are nonstarters as well.Products and services not allowed on Facebook adsBecause the platform has various content restrictions when it comes to advertising, Facebook may not be a viable place for your ads. Some products and services are outright restricted, like tobacco, while other products, like alcohol, must comply with applicable laws and licenses. For a complete list of products that are restricted or banned, visit Facebook's transparency center. Below are some common examples:Ads promoting adult content or services are prohibited.Ads promoting dating services must have prior written permission from Facebook.Ad may not promote prescription drugs without written permission from Facebook.Ads for over-the-counter drugs must comply with applicable laws and may not be targeted to anyone under the age of 18.Ads promoting cannabis or related products are prohibited.Now that you understand the dos and don'ts of Facebook advertising, it's time to get creative and grow your audience. No matter how large your online business or budget, advertising on Facebook is an opportunity to hone your advertising strategy and harness the power of the world's largest social media audience.

3,Elon Musk Says New X Users Will Soon Have to Pay to Post on the Platform,"Apr 17, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/elon-musk-says-new-x-users-will-be-charged-a-fee-to-post/472864,"
Elon Musk is continuing his upheaval of the platform formerly known as Twitter.On Monday, X's owner said that the platform will start charging new users to post in an attempt to get rid of bot and spam accounts.In response to an X post that claimed Musk was initially testing the new policy to ""improve the experience for users overall,"" Musk replied that initiating a ""small fee"" was the ""only way"" to get rid of bots on the platform.



Unfortunately, a small fee for new user write access is the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots.Current AI (and troll farms) can pass ""are you a bot"" with ease.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 15, 2024He also alleged that new AI technology has the capability of surpassing prompts that are meant to curb bots.


In a second post, Musk responded to a user concerned that charging new users would make the platform less ""special,"" Musk clarified that the pay plan would be short-lived — new users would only have to pay the fee for three months before they could post freely.That is way harder than paying a tiny fee.This is only for new users. They will be able to do write actions for free after 3 months.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 15, 2024Musk did not elaborate on how much the fee would be nor when it is set to be implemented. It remains unclear whether or not Musk's comments this week mean that users worldwide will face the fee or if the company will be testing it in select markets.Related: Elon Musk Says X 'May Fail' Amid Competition, Ad LossesLast October, Musk began charging all non-verified users in the Philippines and New Zealand a $1 fee to post as a part of X's ""Not a Bot"" subscription model.Users who agreed to the policy and paid the fee were able to continue posting as they wished on the platform, while those who opted out were placed in a ""view-only"" account mode that does not permit posting or re-posting but allows users to read posts, watch videos, and follow new accounts.At the time, X did not say when, if ever, the policy would roll out to other countries.Related: Elon Musk's X Will Starting Charging Unverified Users $1 to Post on the Platform

4,X Is Suddenly Prohibiting Users From Hiding Their Blue Checkmarks,"Apr 12, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/x-is-removing-the-ability-to-hide-blue-checkmarks/472618,"
It's been a long and confusing road for verified users on X (formerly Twitter) since Elon Musk took over — and now it looks like the billionaire is making more changes to the platform.On Thursday, verified users on X received notifications that they would no longer be able to hide their blue checkmark from their profile.BREAKING: #X seems to be removing the ability to hide the verification checkmark! pic.twitter.com/1Kn2OU4puj— Nima Owji (@nima_owji) April 11, 2024""The hide your checkmark feature of X Premium is going away soon,"" the notification reads. ""Tap to manage your X premium features.""Related: Elon Musk Is Mysteriously Re-Verifying X Accounts as the Platform Cleanses Bots, Spam



Before Musk took over the platform, verification status was granted to celebrities, politicians, major organizations, public figures, journalists, executives, and others as a way of verifying the information from those accounts was official — regardless of how many followers the account had. It ensured a trust factor that led to Twitter becoming a global news phenomenon.However, one of the first sweeping changes that Musk made to the platform, now known as X, was to remove legacy blue checkmarks and give them to any users who opted-in to the paid X Premium. This led to a slew of impersonators, parodies, and bad actors.While there are beneficial features of Premium that users enjoy, such as more characters when writing posts and being able to edit what's been published, X offered those with active paid subscriptions the option to hide their blue checkmark.Now, users with blue checkmarks (paid or not) will not have the ability to hide it.X did not say when the change will occur.Earlier this month, X started giving blue checkmarks back to certain accounts that had over 2,500 verified users. Some accounts with millions of followers had previously received their blue checkmarks back without paying as well.Related: Twitter Will Begin Removing Blue Checkmarks

5,Men Are Seen as Experts More Often Than Their Women Counterparts — and It's Time to Break Those Gender Biases.,"Apr 5, 2024","Kara Alaimo, PhD",https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-amplify-womens-wisdom-and-voices-in-a-mans-world/471783,"
I once sat next to a senior executive at a lunch during a conference and chatted with him about the subject of the research I do as a communication professor. He immediately began quoting a piece about the topic that he had just read in The New York Times – which I had written myself. The possibility that I was the author didn't seem to have occurred to this man when I had told him my area of expertise was this exact topic.The problem, of course, is that when people in our society picture experts, they often think of (white) men.I heard this complaint endlessly when I interviewed women across the country about their experiences using social media for my new book, Over the Influence: Why Social Media is Toxic for Women and Girls – And How We Can Take It Back. These women often told me something I have experienced myself: When they posted about topics related to their professional expertise on social media, their posts got little engagement; yet when men in their fields posted about the very same thing, they seemed to get a lot of reposts.



Research backs my findings up: When women use social networks to advance their professional careers, they often end up with fewer followers, reposts and resulting opportunities than the men in their fields. Why? In Entitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women, Cornell philosopher Kate Manne writes that often men are considered to be the ones in possession of knowledge in our society. Too often, women simply aren't seen as experts.Related: 8 Ways To Empower the Next Generation of Women Leaders


This can help explain why, when people are looking for a professional — whether they need to hire someone, want to follow people on social media to learn more about a topic or are making an appointment to see a doctor — they so often turn to men. To overcome this implicit bias, women's knowledge needs to be given greater visibility in our society. If people were constantly reminded of women's wisdom and accomplishments, eventually, they would come to see women as experts, and would therefore turn to women for their expertise more.All of us can help make this happen. Women who are experts in our fields should recognize that the more we can share our knowledge publicly — whether it's giving a talk at the local library or writing an op-ed about important work we are doing — the more we can help reshape these perceptions. Serving as a guest speaker in schools, from elementary schools to graduate classes, is another great way of making our knowledge visible. We should also post regularly about our work on social media and emphasize its value to society, so people can see the important contributions we are making.We can all also help by following more women on social media and sharing the posts of women more. To help us get started, I've posted a list of ""feminists to follow"" on my website. They are a diverse group of women doing amazing things in many different fields. The database SheSource, created by the Women's Media Center, is also a good resource for finding women experts in many different areas.What's more, we should try to boost other women in our professions, such as by nominating them for awards or writing Wikipedia bios about them, so their knowledge becomes visible to others outside our fields. One woman I profiled in my book, Jess Wade, has created Wikipedia pages for over 1,800 women and minorities working in science and engineering. She told me that simply having a Wikipedia page can be ""transformative"" to women's careers, because it allows people to find them when they're looking for nominees for things like awards and fellowships.


Related: How We Can All Elevate Women and Give Them a Voice in the Business WorldEmployers also have an important role to play. Companies should book women staffers for media interviews and speaking engagements and share their expertise on their official social media channels. They should feature the work women are doing on their websites and ask women to handle public-facing activities like earnings calls with investors and congressional testimony.Employers should also make it easier for women to attain leadership roles, such as by ensuring that people at all levels of their organizations can achieve work-life balance. As I've warned before, the expectation for executives to overwork is one of the major factors that holds women back in our careers, because so many of us need to balance our jobs with major caregiving responsibilities. They can do this by not expecting executives to be available 24/7 (economist Claudia Goldin's work demonstrates the value of having professionals like lawyers and accountants take turns being ""on call"" for client emergencies). Chief executives should also model the expectation for staffers to take time off for things like family vacations and children's sick days by doing so themselves.Our society's tendency to look to men for expertise is one of the things that holds women back in our careers. But we can all help give women's knowledge and accomplishments greater visibility, which will cause people of all genders to view women as experts and turn to women for expertise more.

6,6 Marketing Lessons Small Businesses Can Learn From the Big Players,"Apr 5, 2024",Joseph Camberato,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/marketing-lessons-small-businesses-can-learn-from-the-big/471902,"
Going to the movies doesn't generate the same excitement it used to. The price of tickets and popcorn are higher than ever, and you don't have to wait long for your favorite movies to be streaming on Amazon.But in 2023, Barbie made people excited to go to the movies again. The film brought in $1.45 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the year. While Barbie's success is due to the directing and quality of the film, it's hard to overlook the film's excellent marketing strategy.As a small business owner, you can learn valuable marketing lessons by studying major marketing campaigns like Barbie and, more recently, Dune: Part 2. Let's look at six major takeaways you can apply to your next product launch.



Related: 'Barbie' Was a Marketing Masterpiece. Here's Why.1. Incorporate social mediaA large part of Barbie's success is due to its social media campaign — the movie was heavily promoted on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitter. You could find behind-the-scenes content, trailers, memes and interactive posts.


There were promotional hashtags, like #BarbieMovieMagic, which encouraged fans to create and share user-generated content. The Barbie team also partnered with celebrities and influencers who shared their experiences and thoughts about the movie.The Barbie movie is an example of what can happen when you leverage social media to its fullest extent. When used effectively, it can create unstoppable momentum that pushes a brand or product into the public eye.2. Collaborate with other brandsThe Barbie marketing campaign focused on collaborating with other brands to promote the movie. In total, Mattel partnered with over 100 brands — for example, Forever 21 created Barbie-inspired clothing like crop tops, mesh tees and hoodies.Airbnb listed the iconic Malibu DreamHouse on its site. Restaurant chains like McDonald's, Burger King and Cold Stone also partnered with Barbie to promote the movie. Cold Stone's pink cotton candy ice cream shake even went viral on TikTok.


It's hard to market a product on your own, and Barbie demonstrates what can happen when you create mutually beneficial partnerships on a very large scale. The right partnerships can generate more excitement among your audience and put your brand in front of entirely new audiences.Related: 5 Ways to Effectively Utilize Marketing Collaborations3. Create brand consistencyWhen you think of Barbie, there's probably one thing that comes to mind — the color pink. Barbie pink became a central part of the movie. The color was not only used throughout the movie but also incorporated in all of the promotional materials and campaigns.Even blank billboards with nothing more than the color pink and the date of the film's release were instantly recognized as promoting the film. Once the movie was released, people began flooding the theatres dressed in their best Barbie pink outfits.


Brand consistency matters because it helps customers create an emotional connection to your products. When customers immediately recognize your brand, it creates familiarity and a greater sense of trust.4. Encourage user-generated contentUser-generated content may not be applicable to every marketing campaign, but if you can use it, it's an effective tool. User-generated content was pivotal to marketing Barbie, and fans were constantly encouraged to engage with the movie.There was a Barbie selfie generator that allowed fans to edit themselves into the movie poster. And there was tons of user-generated content posted on social media. User-generated content can not only create a buzz around a product launch but also give your audience a sense of ownership around it.Related: The Beginner's Guide to User-Generated Content


5. Start earlyMost people probably became aware of the Barbie movie last spring or summer during the months leading up to its release. However, the marketing team spent years planning its launch and setting up partnerships.In fact, the first marketing materials debuted in 2022 at CinemaCon with a photo of Barbie in her pink convertible. By starting early, the marketing team could be selective about its partnership and narrow in on the best strategies.Effective marketing campaigns don't open overnight — the earlier you begin marketing a product launch, the more time you have to create awareness. Plus, marketing early and often gives you a chance to test out different strategies and see what works.6. Know your audienceOne of the biggest things the Barbie marketing campaign demonstrates is a deep understanding of its audience. The Barbie brand has been around since 1959, and the movie embraced the power of nostalgia to appeal to older fans who grew up with the dolls.


At the same time, the movie's focus on diversity and inclusion made it relevant to younger generations. The movie succeeded by giving fans what they really wanted — an experience that resonated with people of all ages.When you know your audience, you can create relevant, targeted content you know they'll identify with. It also helps you create a relationship with your audience and create long-term customer loyalty.

      Key Takeaways    



        Entrepreneur hosted a live ""Real Talk With Inspiring Entrepreneurs"" session featuring women business leaders Swan Sit, Dr. Diandra Renée, Rabeea Chaudhri, Bianca Maieli and Carolyn Aronson.
      


        They each offered their best advice for aspiring entrepreneurs hoping to start their dream careers. 
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

 This March, Entrepreneur was proud to celebrate Women's History Month by spotlighting incredible business leaders and the companies they lead, as well as female trailblazers who helped pave the way.



During our ""Real Talk With Inspiring Entrepreneurs"" Twitter Spaces session, we were joined by an incredible panel of women business leaders who shared their experiences coming up in their industries and their advice for those aspiring to chase their dreams. Below are some of the takeaways of that session that we hope will inspire current and future entrepreneurs to continue to move the needle for women in business.Related: See the latest news, trends and advice for women business leaders 


Swan SitThe host of our Twitter Spaces event, Swan Sit, has been dubbed the ""Queen of Clubhouse"" and is a sought-after advisor and expert on Web3. Swan is a creator and digital strategist known for her foresight and innovation, helping companies at the intersection of corporate economics and consumer attention. Her passion for helping founders and prowess for spotting the next big thing was put on full display as an investor on our TV show Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch. During the session, she encouraged attendees to create the life they've always dreamed of, stressing that there is not a single path to success.Top Takeaway: ""The reason I love partnering with Entrepreneur magazine is our shared love of founder journeys, mission to democratize information and opportunity, and belief in the impossible. It was so inspirational to host the conversation with these incredible women! The irony is — I'm not a born entrepreneur. I only found it later in life after I accumulated enough experience and confidence to go out on my own. There is no right way to be an entrepreneur. It can be fractional, later in life, or even inside a corporation. I found my path by continually being curious, challenging the status quo, and pushing incremental change. Eventually, I pushed hard enough that I had to go outside of the corporate life at Nike and Esteé Lauder to create my own world!""Dr. Diandra RenéeWith a Ph.D. in Human Development and Family Science, a law degree, and a DEI in HR Certificate from Cornell University, Dr. Diandra Renée is a force of intelligence and advocacy. Her work spans industries, advocating for racial equity and transforming lives through her nonprofit and podcast initiatives.Top Takeaway: ""My biggest advice to anyone who wants to be an entrepreneur is: do it! If you believe that you are called to do this work, we need you to dream big and make it happen! I would also add:


Know your why and when times get harder than expected or when people try to convince you out of your dream — remember your why and let that anchor you through.Lean towards your fear and take the next step. If you are called to tread your own path and go places that people don't often go then understand that sometimes fear can arise. Fear is normal and is a signal to pay more attention. So, lean into the fear and take the next step. The journey is one step at a time. Lean into it by applying pressure (intentional force).You are supposed to be the only you in the room at that time that you are there. But it is your authenticity that will transform the space so that it is better when people come after you.Finally, I would say love what you do and do what you love. Love conquers all. So when the journey becomes challenging, success will be inevitable because you are doing it from a powerful place that can't be defeated and plus you are anchored in your why.""Related: Grow Your Business and Strengthen Your Entrepreneurial Mindset — 3 Key Strategies for Women EntrepreneursRabeea ChaudhriThe co-owner of Namkeen, a vibrant Pakistani-American restaurant with locations in New York and New Jersey, is a driving force behind the restaurant's communication and PR strategies. Rabeea Chaudhri's journey in the hospitality industry began with a passion for storytelling and a vision to bridge cultural divides through the universal language of food.Top Takeaway: ""It was such an honor to be surrounded by such talented and successful fellow women. It's really empowering to see the journeys other women have gone through to get to where they are today. It serves as a reminder to myself and the audience to constantly uplift and empower the women around us. My advice to anyone wanting to follow this journey is to believe in yourself and embrace failure. This journey is far from a perfect one and requires a lot of dedication and perseverance. Understand that failure is a natural part of the entrepreneurial journey. Don't be discouraged by setbacks, view them as opportunities for growth and learning. Adapt and pivot if necessary, and keep moving forward.""Bianca MaieliA DJ/producer from Los Angeles, Bianca Maieli draws inspiration from the city's diverse sounds and her mixed South Indian and Caribbean Colombian roots. She is also a co-founder of No Nazar, a creative collective making waves in the underground global music scene, breaking barriers and pushing boundaries.


Top Takeaway: ""It was great to connect with so many other women making moves in different industries. I was inspired by each of their stories and experiences. For anyone wanting to follow in my footsteps, I would just say just take that first step! Starting is oftentimes the hardest part, but once you get going the momentum will follow and you'll learn so much along the way. I know it sounds cliche but I truly believe the journey is the destination.""Related: 5 Trailblazing Black Women Entrepreneurs Share How They're Breaking Barriers — And How You Can TooCarolyn AronsonAs the founder and CEO of It's a 10 Haircare, one of the only female-owned professional hair care brands globally, Carolyn exemplifies entrepreneurship and determination. Her recent ventures include Be A 10 Cosmetics and Rewind It 10, showcasing her commitment to innovation and empowerment in the beauty industry.Top Takeaway: ""Get ready to wear many hats, and don't let intimidation crumble you. Once you begin your own company, you'll get a crash course in learning and understanding things you didn't know would apply to your position. Every day, you should be on a mission to learn and become better—even in categories you're not used to dealing with. For example, I learned that even if you're a CEO and have never done financials, you'll have to look at a balance sheet and tax return and work to identify any errors your accountant may have missed. Now, I'm well versed in this field and much, much more, and I owe it all to learning from those who taught me.""

8,How to Harness AI for a Competitive Edge in Marketing,"Apr 2, 2024",Rodolfo Delgado,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-harness-ai-for-a-competitive-edge-in-marketing/471647,"
Have you ever wondered how your favorite local spots seem to know exactly what you're craving or what book you'd love to read next? This isn't luck — it's the power of artificial intelligence (AI) at work. The digital era has ushered in a revolutionary shift, particularly for small businesses, enabling them to leverage AI for unparalleled personalization and engagement.Consider the local coffee shop that now knows to send a comforting note with a discount on your preferred latte during dreary Monday mornings or the family-owned bookstore that introduces you to your next favorite author, all based on your previous interactions. This level of personalization transcends traditional marketing, turning every customer interaction into an opportunity for connection.Related: Beware the Duplicity of OpenAI — 4 Strategies to Safeguard Your Brand in the Age of AI



Personalization with AIPersonalization is at the core of AI's transformative promise for small business marketing. It's about going beyond the one-size-fits-all approach, delivering experiences that resonate deeply with each customer. For instance, a boutique pet store might implement AI to remember not just purchase histories but significant dates for each pet, sending out personalized reminders and offers that perfectly coincide with these moments. This strategy transforms routine transactions into meaningful exchanges, fostering a sense of community among customers.By tapping into AI's potential, businesses not only survive in a competitive landscape but thrive, crafting experiences that convert customers into loyal advocates for the brand.


Building trust through transparency and the ethical use of AITrust is not just built on promises but on consistent, transparent actions. Small businesses leveraging AI have a unique opportunity to lead with transparency, setting a new standard in customer relations. Imagine a local health food store that uses AI to customize nutritional recommendations for its customers. By openly sharing how they use customer data to improve health outcomes and ensuring robust data protection measures, they deepen trust. This transparency transforms AI from a behind-the-scenes algorithm to a tangible benefit in customers' eyes.Many big brands, such as Amazon Fresh, have already made suggestions based on our previous shopping experiences. Small businesses, however, have the advantage of adopting new technologies quickly. The real opportunity for entrepreneurs comes from iterating technologies that improve their customers' experience — and they learn which are best by A/B testing quickly and efficiently.Related: How AI Can Help Small Businesses Do More in Less TimeLeveraging AI for enhanced customer engagementEngagement in the AI era transcends traditional marketing, turning every interaction into an opportunity for connection. A boutique gardening store, for example, uses AI to suggest plants and gardening tools based on the season and the customer's purchase history. Such personalized interactions do more than drive sales; they cultivate a community of gardening enthusiasts who feel seen and understood. Through AI, businesses can create a virtuous cycle of engagement, where each personalized recommendation strengthens the bond with their customers.


Customer experiences with AIInnovation through AI isn't just about automating processes; it's about redefining the customer experience. Small businesses can use AI to create interactive, immersive experiences that captivate customers. For instance, a small fashion retailer could use virtual try-on AI technology, allowing customers to see how clothes look on them through an app before making a purchase. This innovative use of AI enhances the shopping experience and bridges the gap between online and physical retail, offering personalized engagement that customers cherish.Related: How Small and Mid-Sized Businesses Can Leverage AI to Compete With Large CompaniesFostering a culture of continuous AI adoptionThe key to successful AI integration is fostering a culture open to continuous learning and adaptation. Small businesses thrive by staying nimble, and incorporating AI into their strategy should be an ongoing process, not a one-time effort. Encouraging a team mindset that values innovation and is not afraid to experiment with new AI applications can lead to discovering unique solutions that propel the business forward. Celebrating successes and learning from setbacks will create a resilient, AI-savvy organization.It's crucial to understand the impact AI has on the customer experience and the internal processes that power small businesses. Embracing AI technologies can streamline operations, from inventory management to customer service, freeing up valuable time for entrepreneurs to focus on strategic growth and innovation. This operational efficiency, paired with previously discussed enhanced customer engagement strategies, sets a solid foundation for small businesses to meet and exceed modern consumer expectations. In this era of rapid technological advancement, the integration of AI allows small businesses to remain competitive, agile and forward-thinking, ready to adapt to the ever-changing market landscape and consumer behavior patterns.


As the digital landscape evolves, so will the opportunities for small businesses to leverage AI. This promises an exciting future where technology and human creativity combine to create unparalleled customer experiences. The journey into AI-driven marketing is not without its challenges, but the rewards are boundless for those willing to embark on it.

9,Elon Musk's Newest AI Chatbot Outperformed ChatGPT in One Key Area,"Mar 29, 2024",Sherin Shibu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/how-elon-musks-new-grok-ai-stacks-up-against-competitors/471906,"
Nearly two weeks after Elon Musk's xAI startup opened up the AI model behind Grok to the public, its AI chatbot is set to get an upgrade.The company announced Grok-1.5 on Thursday and claimed that its latest model can understand longer documents, handle more complex prompts, and perform more advanced reasoning.While Grok-1.5 appears to be a step up from the original 1.0 with improvements in coding and math skills, its announcement post shows that it still lags behind Google's Gemini Pro 1.5 AI, OpenAI's GPT-4, and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus in some benchmark tests, while outperforming OpenAI on one key HumanEval test.

With a score of 81.3% on the MMLU test, which covers knowledge of 57 subjects from an elementary to an advanced level, Grok-1.5 performed close to Google Gemini's score (83.7%).It also scored close to GPT-4's score of 52.9% with a score of 50.6% on the MATH test, a benchmark that covers grade school to high school math competition problems.Related: Elon Musk Sues ChatGPT-Maker OpenAI, Accuses the Company of Working to 'Maximize Profits For Microsoft, Rather Than For the Benefit of Humanity'Musk stated in a Friday social media post that Grok 1.5 should be available on X, formerly Twitter, by next week.


The X owner has high expectations for the next generation of Grok, writing that the next step after Grok-1.5 will outperform the AI currently available ""on all metrics."" Grok 2 is ""in training now,"" he wrote in the post.Grok AI is currently only available to those with a $16 a month or higher Premium+ subscription on X.Musk sued OpenAI, a competitor of xAI, earlier this month and asked for a court ruling that would force OpenAI to make the research and technology behind its AI public.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features 29-year-old Jason Nelson, who turned his wedding entertainment side hustle into full-time business The Essential Jason Nelson. Image Credit: Michael Romeo CreationsWhat was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?When I started playing the saxophone and piano for weddings, private events and nightlife in 2019, I worked as an email marketing coordinator for a retail company in the New Jersey suburbs. I've always been extremely passionate about chasing happiness over money, so becoming an entrepreneur happened by coincidence when I discovered a way to combine my love for entertaining others with my love for mainstream party music.

After all, being able to entertain over 200 wedding couples during the happiest day of their lives and hearing the phrase, ""You were literally the life of the party. You made our wedding — we couldn't imagine it without you,"" truly humbles me and makes me want to entertain as many people as I can all over the world.


When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? While I started my side hustle in March 2019, I've played the piano for more than 21 years and the alto saxophone for over 18 years. From an early age, I learned that I have a perfect pitch which has allowed me to play any song by ear.When I attended Rutgers, I became obsessed with mainstream house music. During my free time in college, I enjoyed spending hundreds of hours mixing dance tracks in my DJ software program to make mixes for my friends to play at parties (and even DJ'ed for my friends at parties from time to time, too). Around 2015, I started an Instagram account where I posted short videos of popular songs on the piano and sax (The Chainsmokers, Post Malone, Blink-182, Fetty Wap, etc.) and eventually was hired by a friend's sister to play cocktail hour piano at her wedding. She also had me play along with the DJ for her intro to her reception, and I ended up staying the entire wedding.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I was so attracted to the adrenaline rush from my first wedding that I became obsessed with replicating the feeling. I contacted several entertainment companies in the New Jersey/New York area and quickly started getting booked to play at events. Above any compliments I received about my musical talents on the sax and piano, I kept hearing the word ""energy."" ""Oh my God, you literally have so much energy"" and ""You're literally the life of the party"" were two phrases I heard over and over again, so I realized that my passion for entertaining others far outweighed any passion I've ever had for music.Related: This Gen Zer's Stylish Side Hustle Earns About $20,000 a Month and Paid Off His Parents' $200,000 Debt: 'I Enjoy the Hands-Off Nature'


While playing several events each weekend, I focused on building relationships with different vendors in my industry, including DJs, event planners, photographers, videographers and other entertainers. I also continued gathering content (both photo and video) from my events to grow my Instagram and TikTok accounts, where at least 50% of my event leads now come from. I'm so fortunate to be able to post content from weddings and other events and have the opportunity to reach virtually anyone across the entire world, which has led me to travel for incredible destination events in places like Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, and later this year, Aruba and Dubai.@essentialjasonnelson Wedding guest energy was off the charts at this one ?? #weddings #destinationweddings #rosecliffmansion #rosecliffmansionwedding #theknot #weddingwire #bridetobe ♬ original sound - THE ESSENTIAL JASON NELSONWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?I wanted to leave my 9-5 marketing job at the start of 2020, but once the pandemic hit in March, I lost practically all of my event bookings lined up for the rest of the year. However, I was so fortunate to still have a paycheck and work from home when most full-time event industry professionals were shut down. I remained patient and continued to grow my side hustle by networking virtually, posting content and working on the administrative part of my business because I knew it was only a matter of time before events came back. Sure enough, we saw a surge of events being played (including weddings) in 2021, and I knew I made the right decision to leave the 9-5 world.Since the majority of my event bookings are operated through my LLC (I don't have an agent or any employees), a few years ago, when I started receiving an increase in demand for myself at events, there was a period when I was overwhelmed with how manual the booking process was (scheduling calls, sending contracts and invoices, etc.). However, I started automating my booking process in 2022 using HoneyBook, which I now use to automate the process from a client inquiry through booking. I have so much more free time to devote to innovating my entertainment style in the ever-changing industry and can focus on getting myself physically ready to be on my feet and bring energy to the dance floor for many hours each weekend.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety. It Made $1 Million in 7 Months — Then Sold for a Life-Changing Amount.


How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?Within the first year of launching my side hustle, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to play the sax at Angelina Pivarnick of Jersey Shore's wedding and the grand opening party for The Edge NYC. Events like these so early on in my career gave me the confidence to want to take my side hustle full-time. I was on track to earn between $45,000 and $50,000 in 2020, and at the time, my goal was to find a way to replace my email marketing income.You've since turned the side hustle into a full-time business. What does total revenue look like now?I currently earn between $150,000 and $175,000 a year playing events and was fortunate to make $176,000 in 2023.What do you enjoy most about running your own business?Being able to share my love of entertaining others through joyful celebrations is what I love most about owning my own business. I also love the ability to set my own schedule and decide when I want to work and when I want to take time off for myself. I'm so thankful that I have full control over my business and continue to strive to find the perfect balance between my career and my personal life.Related: 4 Simple Mistakes That Can Crush Your Creative Side Hustle, From an Expert Who Raised $45 Million to Support Independent Workers


What's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Ask yourself the question, If money didn't exist, what would you do? I never feel like I'm working because I love what I do. While it may be frustrating to not see an immediate ROI with customers and sales, continue to build your business based on what you'd do if money didn't exist so you can continue to have fun along the way and not get lost in why you started the business in the first place. Always be prepared, show up on time, strive to work well with others and be able to adapt to any and all situations.Find your strengths and triple down on them. What sets you apart from everybody else?Also, use social media to your advantage, especially since it's absolutely free to post! You never know what might happen by being unafraid to share your story with the world. Be yourself, and I promise you, there will be someone who will resonate with you and your story.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.

11,"Facebook Is Revamping One of Its Oldest, Most Controversial Features: 'Nature Is Healing'","Mar 19, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/facebook-revamps-poking-one-of-its-oldest-weirdest-tools/471412,"
When Facebook launched in 2004, it offered the ability to ""poke"" your friends to get their attention as a virtual nudge — and the feature has been debated ever since. Was it a nuisance or a low-key way to say hi?While it lost its visibility (and popularity) over the years, in celebration of Facebook's 20th anniversary, Meta is hoping to capitalize on nostalgia for the retro practice by bringing back the ease of ""poking.""And like the 20-year fashion cycle, it seems to be back in style. In a Threads post, Facebook revealed that there had been a 13x increase in poking over the past month.



  Post by @zuckView on Threads ""I poked Prisiclla, and now we're married,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg joked about his wife of nearly 12 years in response. ""Nature is healing.""Facebook told TechCrunch that in recent weeks, the social media platform has made it easier to find the informational page about poking easier, as well as adding a button to poke a person as soon as their name is searched on the platform.When users type ""poking"" or ""pokes"" into the Facebook search bar, the Poke page will surface.The company also said that over 50% of recent pokes came from a younger group of users aged 18 to 29.


Moreover, a recent report from the New York Times found that Gen Z has become more active on Facebook due to the platform's Marketplace feature, where users can buy and sell new and used goods without required fees or online transactions.Marketplace currently has over one billion monthly active users and per a 2022 Statista study, was the second most popular online destination for resold goods (eBay was first), even beating out Craigslist.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

 Despite pending legislation in the U.S., TikTok is still on the rise — for now. What first emerged as an entertainment platform in 2016 has grown into a social media behemoth over the past several years. There are more than 1.5 billion users on TikTok today, and since the COVID-19 pandemic it has been among the world's most-downloaded social media apps. While it hasn't surpassed Facebook (3 billion) and Instagram (2 billion) in terms of total active users, TikTok is dominating peoples' attention better than any other platform. Adults spent an average of 54 minutes a day on TikTok last year, and its popularity is only growing among both individuals and businesses. Other social media platforms have taken note. You've probably noticed your Instagram and Facebook feeds have shifted to prioritize short-form video and viral content from outside your network. Instagram Reels, Youtube Shorts, Snapchat Spotlights and others are iterations of the bite-size video revolution that began with TikTok.

If a teenager with a smartphone can do it, your marketing team probably can, too — it's just a matter of understanding the terrain and replicating what works. 


If you're thinking about launching a TikTok account for your business — or scaling the one you already have — here are the 12 rules you should follow to harness the potential of the platform for growing an audience, advertising your products and going viral. Related: Here's Why Not Being on TikTok Is a Huge Mistake12 Rules for TikTok SuccessBest Practices for Content Marketing on TikTokRule #1: Be AuthenticTikTok users prefer content from real people, so there's no need for stellar production quality or professional actors. In fact, many TikTok users are turned off by overly promotional and professional content, instead valuing videos that seem genuine and spontaneous. So, take some risks and have fun. Don't be afraid to lean into trending themes and playful ideas, and avoid making videos that look like they were designed for the board room. 


Rule #2: Follow the Trends Success on TikTok depends on knowing what's trending right now. Whether it's the ""Oh, No"" sound effect or recreating Wes Anderson movie trailers, you need to know what is driving engagement. One easy way to do that? Spend time on the platform and replicate the most viral themes of the day. You can also invest in social listening software like Awario, BuzzSumo or Meltwater, which can track your mentions and analyze the most popular posts on the platform. TikTok trends have a life cycle of about a week, if you're lucky. Social listening tools can pinpoint what trends are bubbling beneath the surface so you're ready to participate when the time is right. Rule #3: Avoid Making Organic Content That Feels Like an AdIf someone came to your birthday party and started handing out their business cards, you'd most likely be thrown off by it – and maybe even annoyed. The same rule applies on TikTok. The bulk of your content should be lighthearted, aiming to build an audience and add value to their day. Most users are not scrolling TikTok to find a business hawking its products, so it would be misguided to pump out purely promotional content. Think of your job as a storyteller: Your goal is to entertain people and keep them coming back for more. Tell your story, don't sell it. Related: How TikTok Can Help You Supercharge Your Career


TikTok in Your Content StrategyRule #4: Work with Creators — Not InfluencersContrary to popular belief, you do not have to force your employees to dance to the latest trending song in order to go viral. If you don't have the creative skill or bandwidth to produce TikTok content, find someone who does. There is no shortage of creators looking to partner with brands. But there's a major difference between creators and influencers. A content creator can give your brand a storyline and provide some direction (and much-needed humor) towards original, relevant video ideas. An influencer is more likely to simply promote your product in front of the camera, and users will note the lack of authenticity. Rule #5: Always Use CaptionsYou come across an interesting video and want to know what's being said, but your phone is muted and your headphones are out of reach. So, you skip it altogether. How often does this happen? A lot. Facebook found that over 85% of its users watch videos on mute. TikTok users prefer captions, too, which is why the platform encourages content creators to add them — a shift that can increase impressions by 55%. Business Growth on TikTokRule #6: Use TikTok as a Product-Market Fit Test Product-market fit (in other words, customers are buying, using or telling others about the company's product or services in large enough numbers to promote profitability and growth), is one of the most important things a business can accomplish — and TikTok can be a valuable tool for getting there. TikTok is a platform for niche communities (or TikTok ""sides"") that gather around specific values and needs. The platform's algorithm caters content to the right communities based on the value the content provides. On the paid side, TikTok allows a range of targeting options — from demographics to niche interests, hashtags and creator profiles the target audience follows. You can put your content in front of your hypothesized ""ideal"" audience and see how they respond to your product. Are you actually solving a pressing need for your target audience? Let your TikTok audience answer that question.Rule #7: Create Content That Adds ValueBuilding authority in any market can be challenging. TikTok helps brands gain visibility for consistently adding value and building trust with consumers. For instance, maybe you use TikTok to educate users about a specific issue or sector relevant to your business, or perhaps you bring users along on your growth journey, sharing backstories, the founder's passions or how you plan on evolving. You can also build trust by going behind the scenes and offering users a window into your office culture or how your product is made. Just remember, the content should never be too promotional.


Rule #8: Collect User Feedback to Inform Your Business TikTok can be a powerful tool to create a feedback loop between your business and its customers. The video comment section can highlight valuable insights that may guide your team's decisions, from roadmap planning to product messaging. Is there anything users are confused about? Any roadblocks preventing them from converting? Do their comments shed light on ways your product might evolve? By listening to your audience — and engaging with them — you can ultimately build a better product and a stronger business. Rule #9: Create Content You Can Use on Other ChannelsBeyond TikTok, many other social media sites have adopted the short-form video format. Assets you create for TikTok can serve as strong starting points on multiple channels, including Facebook, Instagram Reels, Youtube Shorts and other platforms. This will allow you to grow audiences on multiple platforms without having to create original content for each one. By reusing strong video assets, you can reach a wider audience and save your team some time and resources.Maximizing ROI on TikTok Rule #10: Consider Audience Quality and QuantityWhen building your brand through social media, it's natural to gravitate toward platforms with the most users. However, just because a platform has a lot of users doesn't mean it's a good fit for you. Audience quality is just as important as quantity. For instance, nearly 45% of TikTok's users are age 25 or under, and 75% of all users are under 35. If your business is trying to figure out a way to reach Gen Z or younger millennials, being active on TikTok is a valuable investment. Conversely, if your primary audience is over the age of 50, you're probably better off focusing your efforts on a platform better suited for that demographic. Rule #11: Pay Attention to #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt According to a recent study conducted by TikTok, the platform touted having the highest percentage of frequent social shoppers on any social media platform. An estimated 20.6% of TikTok users reported that they buy things on TikTok ""all of the time,"" and 67% said they ""feel inspired to shop"" when using the platform. The growing #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt hashtag doesn't beg customers to make purchases. Instead, it shows off trending new products – and it's working. If your goal is to drive purchases, create content that shows how your product works and features people using it without it looking like a sales pitch. 


Rule #12: If You Need to Advertise, Do It the Right Way While your organic TikToks should not feel promotional, that doesn't mean you can't spend ad money on the platform – you just need to make sure you separate it from your organic posts. Like every other platform, TikTok has a business arm — TikTok for Business — that allows brands to run ads. This is where you can execute an ad campaign in an inoffensive way. There are even incentive programs that will give your business credit to launch campaigns and use free advertising spend. Still, you should not simply run ads on TikTok and ignore the organic content side of the platform — that's the meat of the app and what users are coming to see.

15,A TikTok Ban Could Threaten the Livelihood of Many Entrepreneurs — Here's How Businesses Can Protect Themselves,"Mar 15, 2024",Andrea Casanova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-businesses-can-prepare-if-tiktok-is-banned-in-the-us/471211,"
By now, you've likely heard about the recent bill passed by the House of Representatives that can potentially enforce a ban on social media platform TikTok within the United States.Such news has left 170 million American TikTok users in a state of uncertainty as they grapple with the possibility of losing access to their go-to platform and the vibrant community it fosters.Moreover, it has sparked significant concerns for creators, small businesses, brands and entrepreneurs who have successfully monetized their presence on the platform, with some depending on it as their main source of income.



I'm right in the mix as one of those creatorpreneurs who've nurtured an awesome online community and used the platform as a launchpad for building and growing my own business. Thanks to TikTok, I've been able to take bold career steps and explore new income streams that I never would've dreamed possible.The thought of this possibility being taken from me and my fellow creators and small business owners, whose livelihoods hinge on the platform, is nerve-wracking, but alas, it's a reality we might need to prepare for.

Ensure brand partners can still effectively reach their target audience through your content.Monetize your knowledge: To provide additional value beyond traditional platform-specific campaigns, consider offering value-added services such as content creation workshops, influencer marketing consulting, or social media strategy sessions.Team up for growth: Consider collaborating with other creators to boost each other's reach on alternative platforms.

16,"I Made Over $250,000 in One Year as a Content Creator — Here's Why I'll Never Rely on It as My Main Income","Mar 15, 2024",Andrea Casanova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-i-made-250000-in-one-year-as-a-content-creator/470849,"
Since 2016, I've built a career by strategizing and producing content for creators, brands and influential figures alike. Back then, breaking into this industry carried a weighty price tag, both financially and creatively. In those early days, aspiring to become an influencer felt like striving for a rarefied form of celebrity.The learning curve was steep, and success demanded a meticulous curation of content. It was an era characterized by exclusivity.Then came TikTok. Suddenly, the barriers crumbled, and the entry point became accessible to all. With just a smartphone and an idea, anyone could step into the spotlight and share their creativity with the world. From overnight 'It Girls' to ordinary individuals transitioning from 9-5 jobs to full-time creators, TikTok has revolutionized how people achieve financial independence.



Personally, I found myself swept up in this wave of democratization, seizing the opportunity to share my knowledge and insights on marketing and entrepreneurship through my own content as ""latinapreneur"" and leveraging the platform to promote my services as a marketing strategist.Not only was I able to quickly scale my service-based business, but I also started working with some of my favorite brands. In 2023, I made over $250,000 in branded content, solidifying my position as a successful content creator with the ability to go full-time if I wanted.


However, this spontaneous rise to fame and fortune is not a universal experience for every content creator. In fact, even for seasoned creators, there's usually a drought season, with brand deals falling through and algorithm changes limiting content reach. I know the struggle all too well.Related: I Made $389,822 In One Year On YouTube. Here's How I Did ItOne moment, you're riding the virality wave, and the next, you're refreshing your email, hoping that a brand rep is not actually ghosting you. The truth is, in this realm, nothing is guaranteed. Deals can fall through, campaigns can be canceled, and budgets can dry up in an instant.So, to creatorpreneurs who are tired of being at the mercy of quarterly marketing budgets and enduring 90-days+ payment terms, here's a roadmap for transitioning from working with brands to becoming the brand.


1. Redefine your identityThe way you speak about yourself will dictate the opportunities you get. Think beyond your current role and envision where you want to be. Start branding yourself accordingly, making your platform an added advantage rather than the sole focus.Related: How to Create Consistent Branding That Sticks2. Mobilize your audienceWhile you might be tired of hearing about it, building an email list is crucial for owning your audience. If emails aren't your thing, consider communities like WhatsApp or Discord. Don't wait for another potential platform ban to take action.3. Identify winning conceptsWhat content of yours has generated social buzz? What are your followers constantly asking for? These are your winning concepts. Explore how you can further develop and monetize them.


Related: 4 Ways to Leverage TikTok for Startup Growth4. Start small, scale upYou don't have to jump straight into high-ticket offers. Begin with something simple, like lead magnets or low-ticket mini-courses. The goal is to create a product with minimal investment required. I recently launched a vision board mini-course, which generated over $8,000 in the first month. It took just four hours from ideation to publishing, including batching content for promotion.5. Expand your horizonsWhile creators often focus on diversifying content types and pivoting to long-form, I believe the conversation about diversification should be broader. For instance, I recently took on a role at an entertainment company as an executive and creative mind. This move has opened up opportunities for professional growth in a whole new arena.The creator economy may be booming, but questions linger about its long-term sustainability and fair compensation for influencers and content creators.


Most content seems to be positioning brand partnerships as this abundant and definitive marker of success in the creator economy. However, while brand partnerships can be lucrative and valuable, they are just one piece of the larger puzzle.It's time to broaden the conversation and recognize the multitude of pathways to success for content creators, emphasizing the importance of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship beyond traditional brand collaborations.

Here's Everything To KnowBut before we start exploring the essence of both technologies, let's take a look at some statistics:Currently, 23% of customer service companies are using AI chatbots.A substantial 80% of individuals have engaged with a chatbot at some point, Userlike says.The global chatbot market is on an upward trajectory, with a projected worth of approximately $454.8 million by 2027.Clutch mentions that virtual assistants are frequently used in specific industries, notably accounting (37%), IT (37%), and digital marketing (34%).There are varying counts of virtual assistants—either 25,000 or a staggering 30+ million worldwide. Regardless of the specific number, this underscores the growing significance of virtual assistants across diverse industries.1.4 billion people are using chatbots, and the top 5 chatbot-using countries are the United States, India, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Brazil.34% of online buyers said they would prefer to answer questions from AI via chatbots or virtual assistants.The technology that previous generations envisioned in science fiction has become a reality in our present, including the once-fantastical concept of flying cars. Surprisingly, one example of advanced technology that might seem commonplace today is the humble chatbot or virtual assistant. Despite its apparent simplicity, the market for these technologies is burgeoning, drawing in and motivating more businesses to embrace these new AI instruments.

Their functionality relies on decision trees and predefined rules to determine appropriate responses.In contrast, virtual assistants utilize more sophisticated AI technologies, incorporating natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. This allows them to comprehend context and engage in conversations that mimic natural human interactions. The key distinction lies in the advanced capabilities of virtual assistants, enabling more nuanced and context-aware interactions compared to rule-based chatbots.Chatbots overviewPros:


Chatbots are efficient at handling routine, repetitive tasks and providing quick responses. They are available 24/7, ensuring round-the-clock support.They are cost-effective, as they reduce the need for human agents to handle routine inquiries, saving both time and money.Chatbots can handle a high volume of interactions simultaneously, making them suitable for businesses with large customer bases.Chatbots provide consistent responses and follow predefined scripts, minimizing the risk of human errors or inconsistencies.Chatbots can be programmed to understand and respond in multiple languages, making them versatile for businesses with a global audience.Chatbots can easily scale to handle a large volume of inquiries, adapting to a business's growing needs.Cons:Chatbots may struggle with understanding complex, context-based queries and nuanced conversations.They might lack the personal touch that human agents can provide, potentially leading to less empathetic interactions.Developing and training chatbots requires time and resources, including ongoing maintenance and improvements.Related: How Can Marketers Use ChatGPT? Here Are the Top 11 Uses.Virtual assistants overviewPros:Virtual assistants are more versatile and capable of handling a wide range of tasks, from customer support to scheduling appointments and even data analysis.They excel in natural language processing, making them better at understanding and responding to complex queries.Virtual assistants can offer more personalized interactions, creating a more engaging customer experience.They can maintain context throughout a conversation, offering a more seamless experience.Virtual assistants enable hands-free and voice-activated interactions, providing convenience and accessibility.They can seamlessly integrate with various devices, including smartphones, smart speakers, and smart home systems.Cons:


Virtual assistants often come at a higher price point due to their advanced capabilities and human-like interactions.They may not be as scalable as chatbots, which can simultaneously handle a higher volume of interactions.Building and maintaining virtual assistants can be resource-intensive and require ongoing training and updates.Quality virtual assistant-enabled devices can be expensive, restricting access for some users.Let's be straightforward – there's no definitive choice when deciding between chatbots and virtual assistants for your customer service strategy. The selection depends on your particular needs, budget constraints, and the desired level of personalization. Chatbots shine in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness, while virtual assistants bring versatility and more sophisticated interactions.The ultimate decision revolves around your business objectives and the type of customer service you aspire to provide. It's about aligning the chosen AI technology with your unique goals and delivering an experience that attracts customers.

  TikTok's Growth Rate Has Collapsed. 'Life' May Be Getting in the Way for Its Younger Users.
  
    Some users who started using the app in their teens are now young adults — and no longer have time for endless scrolling.

      Key Takeaways    



        TikTok's growth stalled in the final quarter of 2023 and even went into reverse in the U.S.
      


        Many young users have signed on to the short-form video app since its launch in 2016.
      


        Those core users are entering their 20s now and getting busy with other obligations.
      



















TikTok: @brielleybelly123, Brielle via Business Insider
A young woman was upset about her first 9-to-5 job after college.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. By one important measure, TikTok didn't grow in the final quarter of 2023. In the U.S., it actually went into reverse.This is shocking for an app that has experienced rocket-ship expansion since the Chinese tech giant ByteDance launched it in 2016.



The question is why? A few folks might be deleting the app. More likely: There are simply no more hours left in the day for people to watch more TikTok videos. This is especially true for young users who are now entering a new busy time of life known as adulthood.Here's the data. This chart is probably way more worrying for the company than any possible U.S. ban.


TikTok's growth rate slowsThese numbers are the growth rates of daily average users, or DAUs, for some of the popular social media services globally. This is from a quarterly review conducted by Evercore ISI analysts who tap Sensor Tower data.After demolishing the competition from 2020 through the first half of 2022, TikTok's DAU growth rate has collapsed. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the video service lagged Snapchat, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. Yes, you read that right: The ancient big blue app grew faster than TikTok.TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.What is going on?One interesting theory is that TikTok users are growing up and taking on new responsibilities that leave less time to watch videos.When the app launched, it took the world by storm. Young kids and teenagers were especially drawn to the service's unique creator-friendly content and culture.Let's say those users were about 13 when they first downloaded the app in 2016 and 2017. Now, these people are at least 20 years old. They have full-time jobs or are studying at college. For many, their parents no longer do their laundry, cook their meals, and ferry them to and from sports games, meetings, and other engagements.For readers who have not yet experienced this, it's called ""life."" This stuff takes a lot of extra time, which leaves less for TikTok.This shows up in the data, too. TikTok's US average monthly users between the ages of 18 and 24 declined by nearly 9% from 2022 to 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported recently, citing analytics firm Data.ai.


""Time spent"" has been the part of TikTok's business that really caught investors' attention. US adults were expected to spend about an hour a day in 2024 on TikTok, more than YouTube, according to eMarketer estimates.More time = more chance to show people ads and do other things that make money. If some of TikTok's core users can no longer afford to spend an hour a day on the app, that's not good for business.Remember Brielle?This gives me a new appreciation for the honesty of a TikToker called Brielle, who was unfairly lambasted last year for complaining about her new corporate job.After landing her first office role out of college, she posted a video describing how little time she had left each day for a personal life and basic chores. Older viewers harshly criticized Brielle for being naive and a host of other alleged failings.


What I now realize is that Brielle was probably just a heavy TikTok user who had recently grown up and realized she no longer had as much time for the app.Deleting TikTokI've seen this in my own life. My two kids have been huge fans of TikTok for years.The older one is now in her second year of college, studying mechanical engineering. She rents a house with friends. There's a huge study load, along with house cleaning, cooking, doing the dishes, emptying the trash, paying bills, and yes, parties.A couple of months ago, she decided to delete TikTok from her phone. She's part of a competition in her house right now to see who can limit screen time the most.


A year ago, this daughter watched at least two hours of TikTok per day. I'd given up trying to limit this. She's an adult, and I have no sway anymore. And yet, she recently realized by herself that she couldn't fit in all her new obligations and still watch TikTok for hours every day.My younger daughter lives at home and is still in high school, so her daily TikTok intake is still massive. She's leaving for college in the fall, so she'll eventually face a similar dilemma with her time.This is not just meThe Wall Street Journal recently interviewed a few TikTok users in their 20s. They tell a similar story: They started noticing that TikTok, in particular, got in the way of sleep, work, household chores, and relationships.They also said many of their friends have deleted the app or scaled back their use in recent months.Keilah Bruce, a 27-year-old accountant, told the Journal she stopped using TikTok last year.""I'm at a good place now with my friends, my family, my dishes, and my laundry,"" she said. ""I don't want to sacrifice those things anymore.""""TikTok offers several tools, from custom screen-time limits to sleep reminders, that are used by millions of people to help them make intentional decisions about how they spend their time,"" a TikTok spokeswoman told the Journal, adding that the app regularly reminds people of these features.

      Key Takeaways    



        Watercutter says she's always had an entrepreneurial spirit, but the side hustle proved challenging at the start. 
      


        Cash flow was one of the biggest hurdles; it took ""a lot of discipline and learning"" to push the business forward. 
      


        The brand's since gone viral on TikTok and began hitting seven-figure revenue months last year.

Today, Gold Hinge counts celebrities including Kristin Cavallari and Kaitlyn Bristowe among its fans. The brand went viral during TikTok's ""RushTok"" trend, garnering 40 million hashtag impressions and sales in the multi-millions. Image Credit: Courtesy of Gold Hinge. Katherine Watercutter.What was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?



I was a sales representative for a distribution company working with kitchen and bath designers around Indiana (I studied interior architecture and design). I have always been an entrepreneur since I was young; you have to have that as a part of you to be willing to take risks.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?


I got the idea for it in 2018 and started it in January 2019. There really was no inspiration — I thought it could make me quick money. But I was wrong about that.Related: He 'Accidentally Discovered' a Semi-Passive Side Hustle in College — Now He's on Track to Make More Than $500,000 This YearWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I started a Shopify store and created a website and an Instagram.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?One of the biggest challenges early on was cash flow. I didn't receive funding from outside investors and started with very little to invest. So there were a few times where I almost had to close the doors because of cash flow. It taught me a very valuable lesson early on because businesses often fail the first year when they run out of money. I navigated that by getting a line of credit from the bank and a business credit card, which helped with funds, but I also almost maxed those out. It took a lot of discipline, learning and watching the numbers to navigate this challenge until I saw more consistent growth and revenue.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?The side hustle didn't earn anything. It wasn't until a few years into making it my full-time job, dedicating 80-90 hours a week, that I actually started making money, and I didn't pay myself until about 2021. It is hard to say how long it took for consistent revenue because it wasn't until the spring or summer of 2020 that revenue took off — but later that year, it dropped again. It is safe to say that 2021 was the year that revenue was actually ""consistent"" enough to feel safe where debt was paid off, and things were headed in the right direction. So that would be a total of about three years (two years all-in on my business).

What does revenue look like now?During 2023, we went from hitting six-figure months to seven-figure months, and our total revenue hit eight figures.What's your favorite thing about running your own business?Being in charge of my day-to-day and future.What's your advice for others hoping to start a successful side hustle of their own?My advice may sound as cheesy as it gets, but don't give up. People in this day and age are impatient and sometimes quick to give up when they feel like they keep failing. There were a few times when I thought I hit ""rock bottom"" and exhausted all options, but I found a way around it. I felt like I was failing consistently for three years, and I know many would have given up by then, but business is all about problem-solving.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a Month

21,Reputation Management Starts Before Your First Bad Review — Here's How to Develop a Proactive Crisis Plan,"Mar 5, 2024",Danielle Sabrina,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-prepare-for-a-reputation-crisis-before-it-hits/470366,"
In an era where a single tweet can go viral and a review can reach millions overnight, the reputation of a business has never been more vulnerable — or more valuable. In the words of Warren Buffett, ""It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently."" And with the ability to share personal experiences at the touch of a finger, those words have never been more true.This new age of connectivity has leveled the playing field for consumer opinions, empowering them to share their experiences far and wide. While this can bolster a business's reputation through positive feedback, it also means that a single negative review can have a disproportionate impact.Traditionally, reputation management has been reactive, a strategy employed to mitigate damage after the fact. However, in a world where information spreads at the speed of light, the most successful businesses are those that adopt a proactive stance on reputation management. This approach mitigates risks and builds a resilient brand capable of withstanding the inevitable challenges of the digital age.



Related: How to Lower the Risks to Your Brand Reputation (and Build an Image that Wins New Business)Act before the internet's eyes turn criticalBefore the internet's eyes turn critical, establishing a strong, positive online presence is crucial. This involves not just a well-designed website but an active and engaging presence across social media platforms, industry forums and professional networks. This is not merely about having a profile but actively engaging with your audience through regular updates, sharing valuable content and participating in industry conversations. The goal is to saturate the digital landscape with positive content about your business, making it the first thing potential customers see.


There's an old saying that you never get a second chance to make a first impression. In the world of online business, this adage rings particularly true. Early positive reviews and glowing testimonials can set a tone of trust and quality around your brand, influencing potential customers' perceptions and decisions from the get-go.Strategic advantages of early reputation managementSEO benefits: Search engines love fresh, positive content. By populating the internet with favorable articles, blog posts and customer reviews, businesses can enhance their visibility. A robust SEO strategy ensures that when potential customers search for your business, they are met with a chorus of positivity, drowning out any lone voices of dissent that may arise later.Building trust and credibility: Trust is the currency of the digital marketplace. Establishing a solid reputation early on fosters credibility with potential customers, making them more likely to choose your business over a competitor with a less established online presence. This trust, once built, becomes a shield against the impact of future negative reviews.Feedback and improvement loop: Engaging with customers for feedback before any negativity arises creates a culture of continuous improvement. By soliciting, listening to and acting on customer feedback, businesses can often preempt negative reviews, turning potentially dissatisfied customers into brand advocates.


Related: Why You Must Monitor Your Online Reputation Before it Hurts YouPreparing for a crisis before it hitsBeing prepared for a crisis before it emerges is integral to proactive reputation management. It involves detailed planning, team preparation and the development of protocols that allow a business to respond swiftly and effectively to potential reputation threats. Consider the following when preparing your proactive crisis plan:Establish a crisis monitoring team: Designate a team responsible for continuously monitoring online channels, news media and social platforms for any signs of emerging crises that could impact your brand.Develop early warning systems: Utilize social listening tools and set up specific alerts for increased volumes of mentions, sudden spikes in website traffic from forums or news sites, or patterns of negative sentiment that could indicate a brewing crisis.


Communication strategy: Create a comprehensive communication strategy that outlines how to communicate internally to employees and externally to customers, stakeholders and the media. This strategy should include key messages, tone of voice guidelines and the preferred channels for communication.Scenario planning: Prepare for various crisis scenarios by developing specific action plans. Scenarios might include data breaches, negative press, product recalls or customer service failures. For each scenario, outline the steps to mitigate the issue, including who needs to be informed, how to respond publicly and measures to resolve the situation.Rapid response framework: Develop a framework for rapid response that enables your team to act quickly once a crisis is identified. This includes templates for press releases, social media posts and FAQs that can be quickly adapted to the specific situation.Approval processes: Streamline approval processes for crisis communication to ensure that responses are timely but still maintain accuracy and adhere to your brand's values.


Identify key stakeholders: Map out your key stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, investors and regulators. Understand their concerns and expectations during a crisis.Tailored communication plans: Develop tailored communication plans for each stakeholder group, addressing their specific needs and concerns. This ensures that all parties receive the right information at the right time, helping to maintain trust and mitigate negative impacts.Related: 9 Steps for Building a Reputation Management Plan That Wins Customers and Gives You an EdgeReputation management should not be an afterthought or a reactive measure. By adopting a proactive approach, businesses can build a strong, positive reputation that not only withstands the occasional negative review but also contributes to long-term success. While the strategies outlined above require time and effort, the return on investment is clear. A well-established and positive digital footprint enhances customer trust, attracts new business and builds a resilient brand capable of navigating the challenges of the digital marketplace.

This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Nvidia's CEO recently shed light on the allocation of its in-demand chips.The comments have brought Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg's extensive stockpile back into the spotlight.Jensen Huang told investors on Wednesday that the company was doing its best to share the chips evenly amid unprecedented demand.



""We do the best we can to allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,"" Huang said in a call with analysts following Nvidia's fourth-quarter results.Huang was responding to a question about distributing chips between the companies fighting over a limited supply, many of which are competitors.""At the core of it, we want to allocate fairly, avoiding waste, and looking for opportunities to connect partners and end users,"" he said.Meanwhile, Zuckerberg is plowing on with his plan to acquire hundreds of thousands of the chips as part of his ambition to create a ""top-level product group"" focused on generative AI.Last month, Zuckerberg told The Verge that Meta would have more than 340,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs — the main chips companies use to train and deploy AI models — by the end of 2024.Taking into account chips of other types, the CEO said he expected Meta to have amassed 600,000 GPUs by the end of the year, the report said.The surge in global demand for the chips has dramatically boosted Nvidia's stock over the last 12 months.


The AI chipmaker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenues on Wednesday, with revenues of $22.1 billion in the fourth quarter — a 265% year-on-year increase. Nvidia stock surged almost 15% in premarket trading after posting the blockbuster sales, Business Insider reported.Meta did not immediately respond to BI's request for comment.

        Nelson's first massive beanbag took three weeks to make and quickly caught people's attention.

It's 1995, and I'm 18, sitting on my parents' couch in Salt Lake City, Utah. One morning, I had an idea and thought, Wouldn't it be funny to make a giant beanbag chair — like the size of my entire living room floor? So, I got off the couch, drove down to the fabric store and bought enough fabric for something that massive. Then, I began sewing it together. It took three weeks to fill it up with soft stuff I cut up from around the house — but everywhere I took it, people loved it and begged me to make them one. Eventually, I did. It cost me $25 to register the name, and in October 1998, Lovesac officially began as a company.Related: The Side Hustle She Started in Her Princeton Dorm Room Led to a $510 Million Business: 'Don't Take No for an Answer'What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground?When I started college at the University of Utah, I lived in my parents' basement, which was the perfect place to roll out huge, long rolls of fabric.

We quickly became known as the ""Lovesac guys"" around campus, with even the frats and sororities buying a few Sacs for their houses. From there, we were a fixture at any event we could find — boat shows, home shows, car shows, Oktoberfest — and this is how we grew the company in those earliest days.Were there challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those?After two or three years of running Lovesac as a side hustle in college, it was apparent that it would not make any real money in its current form. In fact, it probably cost me money to keep it alive. Sure, we'd make a profit selling the product — but then the van would break. Or the foam shredder would break. Or the state would fine me and my buddies for some workplace violation. The bottom line is: Building a business is hard, and it can take a lot of money to make it to some kind of meaningful critical mass.


As we grew, I was working harder than ever. It was draining, but I couldn't help but give it one last shot at a trade show in Chicago, hoping to get to the next level. One of the biggest retailers in the U.S. placed an order for 12,000 Sacs, not knowing that it was just me and a buddy working out of a rundown building with a wood chipper as a foam shredder.Despite every inefficiency, we completed the order, but then we realized we had no other big customers to sell to. We went to the furniture stores, but they all laughed at us and said it was a stupid idea — so we decided to open our own store. The first Lovesac store opened on November 17, 2001.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacRelated: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWhen did you decide to take the business from side hustle to full-time venture?Our first store changed everything — this is when I pivoted the company to a full-time venture. Consumers were obsessed with Lovesac. They came in, bought Sacs, flopped down and hung out with friends. The product was the best sales pitch we could give. We were doing six figures in just the first few weeks, and I had never seen money like that. We promptly ran off to open the second store in Provo, Utah, then Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Southern California. Growth went ballistic.What were some of the biggest hurdles that came up over the years once you were running the business full-time? How did you overcome those?We had grown to 35-40 locations when I got recruited to be on Richard Branson's reality TV show, The Rebel Billionaire, in 2005. It was a national primetime show on Fox Network, and I won a $1 million investment! Of course, I was $2 million in debt, having built this growing retail chain, but what are you going to do? We took the winnings, paid off some debt and raised more money through venture capital. However, the venture capitalists wanted to bankrupt the company and start over cleanly through Chapter 11 reorganization. I was devastated. We had made it all this way, yet somehow, the only way forward was to begin again.


We moved the company to Stamford, Connecticut, downsized the staff to a skeleton crew and started over with just 12 locations and about 12 employees at our tiny new HQ on the East Coast. It was the right move in the long run. We learned, focused and built the company back up to 30, 40, then 50 locations. Some people might have coasted after that, but I got another wild idea. Ironically, this one happened because of a couch, too.In that first store, we had a couch in the corner to show the Sacs in a living room-type environment. We noticed that customers always asked to buy the couch, but it was too big to sell. So, the idea was, What if we could shrink down this couch the way we shrink down our Sacs? And that's how the concept of Sactionals was born.Related: This College Student Started a Side Hustle So He Didn't Have to Bartend Until 4 am. Now He's Earning $7,000 a Month — and Putting It to Good Use.In 2012, Lovesac was named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. by Furniture Today — what made that rapid growth possible? How has the company approached scaling over the years?Around this time, I recognized that if we were going to really compete, we needed to pivot the business. With this in mind, I changed our focus to becoming a direct-to-consumer furniture brand with Sactionals as the primary driver. I took a risk and invested in local and then national TV advertising for the Sactionals, along with every emerging digital approach. Sactionals quickly became the fastest-selling couch solution in the United States. Lovesac expanded to nearly 80 locations, and then [we] took the company public in 2018 with $100 million in sales.After you go public, the sky's the limit. The company was worth $200-300 million overnight. It felt like a dream; I couldn't believe it. We grew to hundreds of locations by the 2020s. We have thousands of employees, and we've been named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. numerous times. Our sales have multiplied and will likely grow to a billion dollars and beyond. The Sactionals gave us a new future. Their rapid adoption revealed that people love the idea of things being built to last a lifetime and designed to evolve with you throughout your life. We're proving that planned obsolescence was the wrong way to make a brand that lasts. We call this new approach to innovation Designed for Life, and it will inform everything we do from here on out.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacWhat is the company's current valuation? How much revenue does it bring in today?


Looking back at the past year, Lovesac's growth and performance results are a testament to the resilience of our brand and disruptive business model that has consistently delivered category outperformance and customer loyalty. Through a challenging year for our category, we've been able to maintain momentum with our commitment to product innovation, compelling marketing and a highly productive omnichannel footprint. These strategies continue to drive consumer demand and further distinguish our unique brand from a crowded market. Looking ahead, we believe that we are poised to continue investing in the future with an accelerated pace of expansion and innovation to further garner customer enthusiasm.Prior to reporting year-end results, Wall Street analysts estimate Lovesac's sales for the fiscal year that just ended to come in at around $700 million, with high single-digit adjusted EBITDA profitability. The company has fluctuated in multiples and market cap valuations over the past four years hovering in the $300-400 million range, peaking at over $1 billion in 2021 when the home category hit all-time highs during the pandemic.Related: The Side Hustle He Saw on YouTube Earned Him a Multi-Year Deal With Sony and Income Streams Generating Tens of ThousandsWhen you look to your company's future, what are you most excited about?At Lovesac, innovation is at the center of our design philosophy as we continue to prioritize developing breakthrough technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the furniture category. Challenging traditional definitions of comfort and home style is what has set the Lovesac brand apart since its inception, and over the past few years, we've been working with a variety of high-end fashion brands in the space to create something truly unique in the market. Anti Social Social Club, Jeremy Scott, alice + olivia and KidSuper are among the brands that have collaborated on covers and accoutrements for our two signature styles. We look forward to creating a blend of fashion-forward design and unparalleled comfort that speaks to the modern consumer.What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned over the course of your entrepreneurial journey?In my new memoir Let Me Save You 25 Years: Mistakes, Miracles, and Lessons from the Lovesac Story, I detail the ups and downs of my 25-year saga building the Lovesac business from its days as a college side hustle to a successful IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange and beyond. If you can learn from my mistakes, however, then perhaps your ambitions, big or small, can be realized in less than the 25-plus years it has taken me to finally learn something and get somewhere with mine.Here are some of the biggest lessons I've learned:


1. Heed what the experts have to say, but on occasion, you need to trust your gut.2. There comes a point before any major change in your career, business or personal life where you can greatly improve your odds for good outcomes by making a bold decision to ditch the safety net and fully commit.3. Play along the way, taking the time you need to keep yourself relaxed and sharp.4. You're no good to anyone as a miserable, uptight workaholic.Related: He Started a Side Hustle in His Dorm Room With 'a Bunch of Ingredients From Amazon and a Crockpot' — Now It's a $56 Million Brand in Walmarts NationwideDo you have any advice for others interested in starting a side hustle or business of their own?The entrepreneurial journey I've faced over the past quarter-century has been full of triumphant victories and humbling defeats, born from sweat, tears and relentless determination. With my new podcast series and memoir, I look forward to creating and fostering a sense of community through these channels and shining a light on real, raw stories from industry trailblazers on the movements they have built to bring valuable insights and knowledge to those that seek it.Growing Lovesac into what it is has taken my entire adult life and is the hardest thing I've ever done. I have so many memories and have built so many lifelong friends throughout this journey that make all the stumbles, roadblocks, sleepless nights and unrelenting stress worth it. My advice for anyone considering starting down the road of being a founder would be this: Get off the couch! Trust your instincts, and just keep going. That life-changing moment could be right around the corner, and the last thing you want to do is turn back just before you arrive.Entrepreneurship is a never-ending pursuit, but the journey is the gift. With an open mind, an honest heart, some ambition, time, help and a little bit of luck, all things are possible.

Although foot traffic increased 4% year over year during Q3 and Q4, customers gravitated toward the less expensive offering, which led to higher-than-expected demand and an initial price adjustment from $20 to $22. But even the subsequent markup wan't enough to offset the deal's popularity.Now, minority investor Thai Union Group, which said in a February earnings call that it saw a $22 million loss from Red Lobster last year, plans to sell its stake in the restaurant chain.""We're not expecting to get anything much from the sale,"" Thai Union Group CEO Thiraphong Chansiri told investors on the call, per Restaurant Business.

28,6 Instagram Story Strategies That Will Grow Your Following,"Feb 16, 2024",Dmitrii Khasanov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/6-instagram-strategies-that-can-grow-your-reach/469036,"
Instagram has become indispensable to any business's digital marketing strategy, boasting over 1.3 billion active users, 3.76 billion daily visits and 500 million daily story users. This platform provides a substantial opportunity for businesses to engage with their target audience and enhance their return on investment (ROI). Despite its popularity, the competitive environment on Instagram can make it challenging for brands to stand out and make a significant impact.As more retail brands seek attention on the platform, standing out and making a meaningful impact can be challenging. Social media managers and marketers can employ several strategies to scale reach and, consequently, enhance ROI on Instagram. How? Let's figure it out together.The initial crucial step is to establish clear goals for your business to maximize the return on investment of Instagram stories. Define what you aim to achieve with Stories — driving more traffic to your website, increasing brand engagement, or generating buzz around the brand. Understanding your objectives, target audience, and engagement strategy is paramount. Create specific and measurable goals for each campaign, breaking them down into manageable steps to track success.



For instance, if your goal is to gain more followers, set a realistic target, such as reaching 10,000 in the next six months, by targeting individuals interested in your business, brand, category, or industry. It's extremely important to set achievable goals, allowing you to celebrate milestones as you reach them.So, what is the magic behind maximizing your ROI? Unfortunately, there are no special secrets or hidden formulas; all a business can do is focus on producing quality content and continually test new approaches. However, these strategies might accelerate the performance of your stories.


Related: 3 Ways to Use Instagram Stories to Boost Your Brand1. Provide more informationInstagram provides a unique way to boost your brand and turn visitors into buyers effortlessly by using the ""swipe up"" feature. Simply add an attractive image and a call to action and invite your audience to visit a link. When people swipe up on your Instagram Story, they'll be directed to the page you want them to explore. It's a simple yet effective way to engage and potentially convert your audience.2. Show that you are liveLive stories have a unique appeal as they draw your audience in by sending automatic notifications to your followers. When you decide to go live, generating buzz and excitement around something happening at the moment is essential. In this case, your business may create a sense of urgency and encourage active participation from your audience.Related: How Instagram Stories and Instagram Live Help You Interact with Your Customers


3. Storytelling still rocksCreating visual stories on Instagram is powerful for building brand awareness. Visuals are more engaging than text, effectively reaching a broader audience. With its focus on visuals, storytelling on Instagram helps build an emotional connection with viewers and sparks their curiosity to learn more about your brand. Through this approach, you can convey your brand's story and values compellingly, strengthening your connection with the audience.4. Collaborate with influencersInfluencer marketing campaigns have the potential to boost brand awareness and drive sales growth significantly. While reaching out to influencers directly on Instagram is an option, I would recommend using an influencer marketplace for more efficient and timely discovery of the best influencers for your campaign. Remember that you do not need to collaborate with celebrities and Instagram superstars; instead, consider micro and nano influencers as they make waves in 2024.Related: How Many Followers Do You Need To Make Money on Instagram?5. Do not be afraid of paid advertisingInstagram's advertising platform is a potent tool for expanding your brand's reach and engagement on the platform. With the average user spending 30 minutes daily on Instagram and 63% of American users checking the platform at least once a day, it offers a strategic means to maximize your ROI and attract attention to your paid content. Consistent posting plays a crucial role in increasing visibility. The more frequently you post, the higher the likelihood of appearing in the Explore feed, being featured on other accounts, or ranking highly in searches for keywords and hashtags you commonly use. Establishing a regular posting cadence is essential to maintaining audience interest. Posting consistently every week has the potential to double your followers compared to those who post less frequently than once a week.


6. Ask your followers and get engagementRemember that marketing is about understanding your audience's likes and dislikes, and Instagram Stories can help you learn more about them. Creating polls and asking questions in your stories prompts users to interact by clicking on them. These interactions provide valuable insights that can improve your business and marketing strategies. You can also use these features to effectively advertise new products, making it a versatile tool for engaging with your audience and conducting market research.

29,This Job Hack to Escape Layoffs Is Gaining Popularity — But It's Divisive: 'It Altered My Brain Chemistry',"Feb 15, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/government-jobs-are-going-viral-as-gen-zs-layoff-proof-hack/469798,"
Despite slowing inflation and low unemployment, the New Year started with layoffs. Employees in tech continue to be the hardest hit; the industry lost more than 260,000 jobs in 2023 and cutbacks have continued into the first quarter of this year, according to TechCrunch.In the face of so much uncertainty, U.S. workers, especially the younger set, are seeking more job security. And one potential way to get it has been making the rounds on TikTok: opting for a government job.Working for the government is usually a longer-term gig than private employment — in January 2022, employees in the public sector had a median tenure more than three years higher than that of employees in the private sector, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Last year, one TikTok user's video promoting government jobs went viral with more than half a million views. She cited some of the benefits, including the ""best healthcare"" and the possibility of a pension, though she admitted people wouldn't find ""glamorous stock options.""@boujiebudgeter There is so many opportunities within the federal government thag many people know or understand.. think outside the box when it comes to they types of jobs you are applying to in this season #boujiebudgeter #jobtips #jobsearch #federalgovernment #applyingforjobs #youngrichandresponsible ♬ original sound - BoujieBudgeterCommenters chimed in with tips on how to apply for government jobs and agreement that the job security is ""unmatched.""

      Key Takeaways    



        Paul and Cranston's Dos Hombres, which means ""two men'' in Spanish, launched in 2019. 
      


        The mezcal is crafted in Oaxaca by third-generation maestro mezcalero Gregorio Velasco. 
      


        The business partners use a leadership approach honed over years on the set of 'Breaking Bad.' 
      












""I saw a clear opening with mezcal,"" Aaron Paul, co-founder of Dos Hombres Mezcal with fellow actor Bryan Cranston, says. ""You ask anyone on the side of the road, 'Name your favorite mezcal,' [and] they're like, 'Oh, mezcal is…' But they can name a vodka, a tequila.""Cranston and Paul, who played Walter White and Jesse Pinkman on AMC's award-winning crime drama series Breaking Bad, became fast friends on set. So, when Paul suggested the duo start a mezcal brand of their own several years after the show wrapped, Cranston was all in.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 



Dos Hombres, which means ""two men"" in Spanish, launched in 2019. The mezcal is crafted by third-generation maestro mezcalero Gregorio Velasco, who uses traditional production methods to blend Espadin agave hand-picked from the hillsides of the small village of San Luis del Rio in Oaxaca, Mexico. It boasts notes of apples, mango, local ""zapote"" fruits, wood and an ""almost imperceptible"" smoke on the finish.Constellation Brands announced a minority stake in Dos Hombres in 2021 through its venture capital group, though the company remains independently owned and continues to manage, market and produce its mezcal.

They're determined to make Dos Hombres the No. 1 mezcal, they say, and that means doing things a bit differently than some of the many other celebrity spirits brands.""Celebrities have an opportunity,"" Cranston says. ""They have the door open. You want to come in? It's up to you. And a lot of celebrities will come in — and then go away. You want me to go and work…?""""Wait, you're not just going to write me…a check?"" Paul quips.Related: How to Be Your Own Boss and Drink on the Job


Cranston notes that ""there are far more celebrity brands that have failed than have succeeded."" But, like their on-screen characters, the pair isn't afraid to get in the trenches and do what needs to be done. Until about six months ago, the co-founders ""were on emails constantly,"" and Paul ran the company's social media accounts.""I think actors, especially, we're used to stepping into something we don't know,"" Cranston says. ""Every time we take a job, 'I think it could be this, but I'm not sure.' I'm playing a podiatrist — 'Oh, I gotta go learn all about the feet.' So we're not daunted about stepping into something we don't know. We're like a dry sponge. So we go down to Oaxaca once a year and talk to our people.""Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal ""We break bread with them. We talk to them, and we learn.""Dos Hombres has 50 employees in Mexico and 22 in the U.S., and Paul and Cranston have personally interviewed each person who was hired onto the team. They want to make sure that everyone understands the culture they've built: ""We work hard here, and then we go home,"" Cranston says. ""That's the greatest thing. Work hard, go home.""Paul and Cranston are ""very proud"" of the team members they've brought together — and seize every opportunity to learn from them.""We break bread with them,"" Cranston says. ""We talk to them, and we learn. Every time we're down there, it's like, 'Oh wait a minute, that's a new thing. Why are you doing this? Oh right. What happened there?' And then [we] learn about the mashing, the smoking, fermentation, the distillation, bottling.""Related: Comedy Legend Dan Aykroyd Doesn't Mess Around When It Comes to Vodka


Paul and Cranston's hands-on leadership approach to building their ideal company, team and culture is a straightforward but perhaps underrated one these days. And it carries over from their years on the set of Breaking Bad. Paul, who was 28 when the show debuted, says that Cranston taught him that ""when you're No. 1 on the call sheet, you set the tone.""""[Cranston is] the hardest worker in the room but also the most immature person you've ever met,"" Paul says. ""And I say that with love and respect because he does the job perfectly, but he has the best time doing it. He loves to pull pranks; [he] jokes.""Cranston says there were a couple of hundred people on set that they felt responsible for, and to help establish the kind of close-knit culture they envisioned, they started a bowling night with not just the crew but the crew's family, too. ""We'd take over the entire bowling alley and just play,"" he recalls.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 


""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""The co-founders might not have anticipated going into business together during their early days on set. Cranston admits he had no idea Paul had such a ""business mind,"" though he was quickly impressed by his co-star's boundless ""energy"" and strong work ethic — and adds that ""he's not at all like Jesse Pinkman.""Needless to say, the real-life friends have a more functional business partnership than Jesse and Walt ever did. They also have a lot of fun with it: Just don't ask them to take any shots of mezcal if you run into them at the bar.""We go out a lot to all the bars and restaurants, and most of the younger kids go, 'Ah, let's do shots,'"" Cranston explains.""It's sacrilegious to do a shot of mezcal,"" Paul says. ""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""

34,Visiting Disney Can Be So Complicated That People Are Taking Classes to Get 'a Grip' — But This Simple Mistake Will Derail Even the Best Planners,"Feb 1, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/genie-plus-complicates-disney-visitors-take-classes-to-plan/469123,"
These days, planning a successful trip to Disney is no longer a walk in the park.Increasingly, visitors have to learn new lingo and strategies for optimizing their experiences amid an ever-evolving system at Disney parks, and some of them are even enrolling in classes to make it easier, The Washington Post reported.Related: Disney Is Suddenly and Without Warning Cracking Down on Third-Party Tour Guides, Some of Which Have Operated For Decades and Help Curate Park Experiences for Disabled Visitors



That's what Rob Kayris and his family of six did last year for a trip to Disney they were ""dumping a boatload of money on,"" according to the outlet. They took a class about the new ride reservation system Genie Plus — a paid service that opens up ""Lightning Lanes"" for visitors seeking speedy access to select attractions — not once but twice.""I feel like if you don't know how it works, you're going to waste probably two to three days before you have a grip on what's what,"" Kayris, a copy machine salesman who lives outside Philadelphia, told the Post.


Learning how to navigate a Disney vacation, which recently saw price hikes, can mean even more spending. Although some influencers and bloggers offer their insider tips for free, VIP tours at the parks can range from $450 to $900 an hour depending on the season, per Disney World's site.Genie Plus, introduced in 2021, replaced Disney's free ride reservation system with a cutthroat model that requires park-goers to begin reserving rides at 7 a.m., according to the online forum planDisney, which is run by Disney's team of advice-givers.Related: 'I Listen To You And To Our Guests': Disney Is Bringing Back Free Parking for Disney Orlando Hotel Stays, Plus Other PerksBut it's not just enough to know the rules — other factors, like slow Wifi, can throw a wrench into even the best-laid plans. Online forums are full of devoted Disney goers trying to hack the reservation system, even as many realize it can be an effort in futility.

Music from some of the biggest artists in the world has been pulled from TikTok.Universal Music Group withdrew TikTok's access to its extensive music catalog, which includes songs from Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Rihanna, and more, following the expiration of a licensing agreement and failure to secure ""appropriate compensation,"" the company said in a statement.Image Credit: Buda Mendes/TAS23 | Getty ImagesRelated: TikTok Is Reportedly in Talks to Expand Its Music-Streaming, Could Take on SpotifyThe decision, which goes into effect today, impacts TikTok's user base of more than 1 billion, CNN Business reported. According to Universal, the offer from TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese tech giant ByteDance, was a ""fraction"" compared to what other social-media platforms provide in terms of royalty fees.



TikTok accused Universal of prioritizing its ""own greed"" in the matter. ""TikTok has been able to reach 'artist-first' agreements with every other label and publisher,"" the company said in a statement. ""Clearly, Universal's self-serving actions are not in the best interests of artists, songwriters and fans.""Universal's move highlights the ongoing tension over fair revenue distribution in the digital age — and the controversial escalation of AI-generated music.Universal claims that artists and songwriters suffer from TikTok's increased reliance on such content, and it has accused the platform of being indifferent to both the online safety of users and the protection of musicians from AI's ""harmful effects,"" per the statement.Related: Twitter Slammed With Lawsuit Over Copyright Infringement

      Key Takeaways    



        Lukas Battle's ""loud budgeting"" suggests people verbalize financial limitations to avoid overspending.
      


        Though it began as a joke on TikTok, research shows the strategy can have a positive impact on finances. 
      












""Quiet luxury,"" or the trend of wearing pricey but understated fashion, might not resonate for most Americans — enter ""loud budgeting.""Coined by 26-year-old comedian Lukas Battle in a TikTok video posted in December, ""loud budgeting"" comically flips ""quiet luxury"" on its head; the idea is to unapologetically verbalize your financial limitations to avoid overspending.Related: This Financial Expert Reveals the Simple Spending Hack That Will Make You Happy, Even in a Recession



Battle arrived at the term when his friends asked him to go out to an expensive Italian restaurant in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood. Instead of agreeing and overextending his budget, he was honest about his situation and suggested they cook at someone's house and have a game night.@lukasbattle #greenscreen ♬ original sound - Lukas BattleThat video garnered more than 1 million views and 1,000 comments, many of them from viewers in support of ""loud budgeting.""""Loud budgeting is my new personality,"" one user wrote.""I started loud budgeting this summer and it freed me,"" said another.Americans are facing record-high debt, per Fox Business. According to a survey from real estate site Clever, more than half (61%) of respondents have credit card debt and owe an average of $5,875.

We must be mindful of what we post online, with 60% of companies admitting they look to social media as a method of vetting potential job candidates, according to CareerBuilder. They also found one in four companies reprimanded an existing employee for something they posted online, and even the C-suite and board aren't immune.And it's not just public-facing data–everywhere we go online leaves a trail of cookies and data behind. Our email addresses and passwords can show up in major data breaches, like what occurred last year with companies like Okta, MOVEit and LastPass.Companies — and, well, the internet — are increasingly collecting our data, and, depending on where you live, the law doesn't do much to protect your privacy. This data is, in turn, being used to train AI models and other technologies, and there's not a lot of transparency in how it's leveraged and sold.



Related: Is Your Digital Footprint Killing Your Sales?Web3 offers a number of digital identity solutions, but there's skepticism about how well they work. Although there's no easy button, there are steps we can take to control our digital identities while providing guidance to employees.


To be or not to be anonymous?We have more ways to connect today than ever — there's a social platform for every interest, big or small, and deciding whether you want to present as yourself when signing up and posting is important.Social media today is focused on influencers and public personas over real people, and it's not uncommon for prominent people to use anonymous accounts with fictional names like Beff Jezos and cartoon characters for profile pics. This is especially prevalent in the crypto space and creative fields, like artists and musicians.By contrast, many influencers and public figures, especially journalists, use their real names (although they often use anonymous burner accounts). So long as you stick to that decision, there's no right or wrong answer.Consider Dream, the Minecraft streamer who garnered over three billion views on his Minecraft streams while concealing his identity. His career hasn't been the same since his 2022 face reveal, as he began receiving a lot of online hate. He has since deleted his unmasking video from YouTube, something Jezos, the leader of the effective accelerationism (e/acc) movement doxxed by the media as Guillaume Verdon, can't do.


The difference between these men was their digital footprint, as Verdon's online activity was easier to trace back to him.Related: Anonymous Online Detractors Shattering Your Confidence?Controlling your digital footprintJ.P. Morgan recently published an article on digital identity called ""Assessing Web3's Building Blocks."" In it, they describe four factors that contribute to our digital ID.Identifiers: Our names, email, addresses, and social handles.Identity Attributes: Data points about us, like education or employment.Reputation: Our online persona, contributions, affiliations, and followings.Digital Collectibles & Assets: Anything we own.Web3 solutions like the fediverse and wallets with soul-bound tokens aim to combine these, removing them from centralized servers and placing control of this data back into our hands. Today, it's difficult to migrate between platforms, as we don't really own our followers on Instagram or X, and the next generation of the internet aims to fix that.


This power comes with responsibilities, however, like protecting our passwords from cyber threats. Redundancy is important for risk management, and you never want a single point of failure. Should your blockchain wallet be hacked, you could lose everything forever, with nobody able to help you recover it.And regardless of whether these solutions ever become commonplace, there are steps we can take to protect our digital identity better.1. Use single sign-onWith features like single sign-on, it's easier than ever to log in to apps and services using your account with companies like Apple, Google and Facebook. This limits the potential damage during a data breach, as the tokenized login won't compromise your other accounts.Using SSO removes duplicate credentials, adding a layer of security, and you don't need to use a password manager like LastPass, which lost customer trust after it was compromised last year.


2. Limit app accessMobile devices are getting better about warning us which apps have access to what data, and it's a good idea to limit access as much as possible. Social networks like Snapchat and TikTok don't need full access to your photos and location information, so it's always best to limit what they access, especially when the app isn't in use.3. Keep it professionalBe aware that everything you post to the internet is forever, and this is true whether it's in public or in DMs. It's not uncommon to see people leaking private messages with each other on main during an argument, and reputations are often ruined this way. Celebrities like Drake and Justin Bieber had their DMs leaked, and it's best to assume yours can be, too.Keep things professional whenever communicating on the internet. This way, you don't have to worry about being compromised by a leak and ending up canceled.Related: 10 Tips for Behaving as a Grown-Up Professional


4. Regularly audit your presenceYou can't fix what you don't know, so it's important to know what shows up under your name online. Make it a habit to search your name online to see the results regularly. This will help you understand how you're viewed by others while allowing you to make any necessary changes.Related: Your Brand's Digital Presence is More Than SEO5. Involve your communityNearly half of consumers (49%) trust online reviews as much as friends and family recommend. This means you can make a greater impact by having others sing your praises rather than doing it yourself. Find ways to solicit organic, positive feedback from clients to maximize your positive online presence.Our digital footprint is an asset and is more normalized today than in previous generations. The internet is a prominent part of modern culture, and it's important to leave a good impression while using it because it may be your last. Be mindful of what data you leave everywhere — your next job or client may depend on it.

Royal Caribbean's Ultimate World Cruise, which set sail in December, is well underway — but some passengers are still learning proper etiquette on board.Marc Sebastian, an influencer and passenger on the cruise whose 18-night stint on the Serenade of the Seas was sponsored by Atria Books, found out that some words are best left ashore, according to a TikTok video he posted detailing his faux pas.JEAN-FRANCOIS MONIER | Getty Images

The Chinese e-commerce platform Temu, which launched in the U.S. in September 2022, appears to have some staying power — and not just with digital native Gen Z and Millennial shoppers.In its inaugural year of U.S. operations, Generation X and Baby Boomers were Temu's biggest splurgers — and they kept coming back for more, according to data from Chicago research firm Attain reported by Bloomberg.Related: How to Tap into the U.S. Social Commerce Market Through Millennials and Gen Z



Owned by PDD Holdings Inc., Temu's aggressive marketing strategies on platforms like Facebook and even the Super Bowl — where it encouraged consumers to ""Shop Like a Billionaire"" — boosted app downloads and solidified its place among other Chinese market entrants like Shein and TikTok Shop, all of which offer cost-effective alternatives to Amazon, per the outlet.Boomers aged 59 and up were the app's most devout fans: They placed about six orders per year, double the amount of 18 to 26-year-old Gen Z shoppers, according to the report.


""Temu has a diverse product mix that appeals to more mature shoppers who appreciate the variety and the discounts,"" Attain Chief Executive Officer Brian Mandelbaum told Bloomberg.Soon after its U.S. launch, Temu began to gain a reputation for ""undelivered packages, mysterious charges, incorrect orders, and unresponsive customer service,"" TIME reported.Temu currently has more than 1,600 complaints lodged with the Better Business Bureau and a BBB customer rating of less than three stars.Related: Asian Millennials Will Lead Global Consumer Market, Report says


Emily Balcetis, an associate professor of psychology at New York University, told Bloomberg that ""gamification elements"" within the app — spinning a roulette wheel to win discounts and free products — can contribute ""perceived value"" to the purchase.Older consumers might be more susceptible, she added, as they might not be as aware as ""younger, digital natives"" of how such marketing tools influence their behavior.

42,How to Leverage Short-Form Content to Boost Your App Downloads — 5 Proven Strategies,"Jan 23, 2024",Srikar Karra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-proven-strategies-for-boosting-your-app-downloads/467585,"
In an age where digital platforms reign supreme, mastering the art of short-form content has become crucial for app developers seeking significant growth.At Trendify, our extensive experience, coupled with insights from our in-depth courses, has revealed a multitude of strategies that effectively boost app downloads.Below, I'll share those strategies and the key lessons we've learned:



1. Deep dive into audience understandingTo truly resonate with potential users, it's essential to delve deep into audience analysis. This means going beyond basic demographics to understand their interests, behaviors and content consumption patterns. This insight allows for the creation of content that not only grabs attention but also fosters a sense of connection with the audience.Segmenting the audience further helps in tailoring content that addresses specific groups' needs and preferences. This targeted approach ensures that your app reaches the right people with the right message, increasing the likelihood of downloads.


Engaging with your audience is also key. Monitor their feedback and interactions to continuously refine your understanding and approach. This ongoing dialogue helps in creating content that evolves with your audience's preferences, keeping them engaged and interested in your app.Related: 5 Growth-Hacking Strategies to Increase Your App Downloads2. Focus on creative consistencyConsistency in content creation is pivotal. However, this doesn't mean repetitive or monotonous content. Instead, it's about finding creative ways to present your app's features and benefits regularly. This could be through storytelling, using different content formats or even incorporating user-generated content.The key is to maintain a balance between being consistent and being creative. Each content piece should offer something new or present your app in a different light, ensuring that your audience remains engaged and curious.


Develop a content calendar that strategically plans out your posts, balancing promotional content with educational, entertaining or inspirational pieces. This helps in maintaining a steady stream of content that keeps your audience coming back for more.3. Maximize platform-specific featuresEach social media platform offers unique features and tools that can be leveraged to enhance your content's effectiveness.

43,Tired of Trolls? Here's Why Creators and Businesses Are Doubling Down on Private Online Communities.,"Jan 19, 2024",Christie Horsman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-entrepreneurs-are-doubling-down-on-private-online/468183,"
Noisy. Sketchy. Abusive. Dark. These are all apt descriptions for many public online spaces today. In fact, four out of 10 Americans report they've experienced abuse and harassment online. And for those who haven't, even witnessing negative interactions in comments can cause distress (just look at the mass exodus off X after moderation changes increased the incidence of hate speech).Despite all this, we're still spending more time online than ever. And many of us, myself included, are looking for ways to connect safely and authentically with peers and trusted experts — especially when it comes to advancing our personal and professional learnings.One of the best investments I've made in my own online learning is paid subscriptions to exclusive online communities. These are focused, curated spaces led by industry experts and creators who facilitate learning and connection among people with similar challenges and interests. For me, these communities have gone a step further than what I'd get by simply following an influencer I admire or a social account with great content. They have offered the safety of a vetted space where I can interact with others and ask questions without fear of judgment or junk content — and without leaving my desk. Those are privileges I'm happy to pay for.



As global policymakers grapple with rampant online safety issues, many creators and businesses are taking matters into their own hands, forging a path to safer, smaller and more private online learning experiences.Here's why I believe private communities are the most viable way forward.Related: 5 Tips for Building an Online Community for Your BusinessPrivate is the new publicEver done a social media detox? It's likely because you've experienced the downsides of being online. Beyond the terrifying hold of algorithms in keeping us addicted to doom-scrolling, the fact is, so many of the social spaces we've come to rely on for learning and community have turned into a source of angst — places we need to take breaks from for the sake of our mental health.The same is true for creators, who often struggle to manage channels where negativity can quickly spiral, souring the experience for all. Moderating content and upholding community guidelines can quickly become a full-time job — one that simply isn't optional, isn't fun, or the best use of time.According to my company's research, 69% of respondents we surveyed believe social media has more negative content now than it did five years ago, while more than half of all respondents said they prefer private communities as a respite from social media fatigue. While growing follower counts have always been paramount to flourishing online, long-term success in business is also about fostering positive and genuine engagement. And more and more, private communities are where this is happening.


Exclusive communities add business valueWhether they're run by creators or bigger brands, private communities provide an opportunity to connect deeply with followers on a more vulnerable and authentic level than public spaces allow for. This has been key to the success of creators like Amanda Wolfe, the self-taught financial educator behind SheWolfofWallStreet, who built a community of over 275,000 people devoted to increasing financial literacy, and creator coach Kristen Bousquet, who credits her private community, Soulcial Suite, for the success of both her company and her students' businesses.For entrepreneurs, the element of exclusivity has enabled them to take public conversations deeper and help people on a more personal level. It's also added value to their sales funnels, giving students a reason to stay engaged beyond the purchase of their first course. It's a strategy that's worked for bigger brands as well, like Dr. Becky's Good Inside community for parents, and Exit Five, a thriving private space for B2B marketers.At my company, our private community has served both as a customer success forum and as a marketing tool, giving us the ability to get to know a smaller segment of our users and their needs by soliciting their feedback on new products and features. While we had previously experimented with public polls and surveys, we always felt limited by social algorithms. Privately, we can reach more of our members and spark conversations that benefit everyone — especially when the surrounding noise is filtered out.Related: The Key Elements All Online Communities Should Have


So how do you launch your own private online community?Creating engaged and authentic online communities is not a new concept. But as public spaces continue to deteriorate, finding new ways to build bridges back to customers is becoming more important than ever. Here's how creators and brands can tap into the power of exclusive community spaces:First, build a following on a public channel: You can't segment off part of your audience until you've built up a public following. But once you have that, you can invite those who are interested to move to a private space. Note: This doesn't have to be a huge amount of people, but ideally, it's enough to create a groundswell of activity and discussion for when you launch.Decide on your value proposition: Private community members naturally expect more value than public followers, especially if they're paying to be there. So, you'll need to determine how to make it worth their while and how much of yourself — and your time — you're able to give. Don't forget that your public channels will continue to need your content and attention, too.Choose a platform that matches your needs: A lot of business owners want a community they can brand as their own and moderate to their standards. That could mean a private offshoot of their public space or could require a platform they can tie to a course or website. However you create your private community, consider how the platform will allow you to optimize for functionality and brand authenticity.Commit the necessary resources: Going private will require additional time and resources, and the best way to prioritize this is to make it part of your business plan. Treat your private community like you would any other marketing channel or customer success initiative.Consider monetization: Charging a membership fee is a straightforward way to monetize your private community, but it's not the only way. You could offer limited access to group sponsors or charge for aligned advertising. There are many ways to monetize and many good reasons to do so, just as long as you ensure the value you're delivering matches the price you're charging.Private communities not only offer refuge from a lot of the bad stuff on the internet, but they're also a great way to generate the kinds of business relationships we all want: respectful, productive, helpful and most of all, mutually beneficial. Here's to a future where this becomes the norm across the board.Related: 3 Lessons Subscription-Based Businesses Can Teach You About Building Connections and Fostering Community

44,Is There Still a Need for Press Releases When Newspapers Are Going Extinct?,"Jan 16, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-press-releases-are-still-important-despite-the-dying/467422,"
I've been in PR for a long time now, and in that span, I've seen many things change. The magazines I used to write for are now virtually all online. The article interviews I used to conduct in person over lunch are now done over a computer screen. And the print newspapers in which I used to broadcast my clients' announcements and publicize their efforts are a dying breed.So it's not surprising that a colleague recently asked me at a networking function, ""Should I even bother with press releases for my company anymore?"" The short answer is, ""Yes!"" Why the press release is still a valuable asset requires a longer explanation.Combining the old and the newToday's press release is still a highly strategic tool for any business; it's just that as the definition of ""press"" has changed, so too have the delivery mechanisms that distribute it and the platforms and products by which it's disseminated.



Not too long ago, AP and Reuters were household names. These news agencies are still central players, but readers can now access their output directly instead of waiting for it in the morning edition delivered to their doorstep or watching it on the evening news. And though the ""newswire"" remains the main artery through which the lifeblood of today's business information flows, the wire mostly takes the form now of digital distribution services, software tools and PRM (public relations management) platforms like Cision, Muck Rack, Newswire and EIN Presswire. These vehicles share news as opposed to generating it.So the national or international ""headquarters"" through which a group of reporters operates is rapidly becoming a thing of the past, but journalists — still the actual human resource fueling ""the media"" — are very much alive and kicking! They decide what does (and does not) get picked up for influential news outlets, popular websites and TV. They decide what news is newsworthy. And so appealing to journalists still matters. A lot.

Here are 6 Ways to Outcompete Your Competitor for News CoveragePress release version 2024Enter the strategic press release to grab the media's attention. Remember when your mother's company issued a press release to herald the new incoming CEO or when your old boss commissioned a release to clarify a product's safety warning? Today's press release has a much broader — and more engaging — mission than just announcing a store opening or publishing fourth-quarter profits.The modernized press release has a robust, multifaceted job:It builds brand awareness by garnering your business attention — the most coveted commodity in today's digital marketplace. Cision has reported that 68% of businesses experience improved visibility from published press releases, making it an excellent medium to increase brand familiarity.It promotes brand credibility, which is vital in terms of creating trust with your market. Not only that, but the more reputable the publication that picks up your release, the more your reputation rises.It establishes brand authority by positioning you as a thought leader in your industry. You gain widespread influence when your company is perceived as an expert in your field.It lets you control the narrative you want to relate to. This is just one of the advantages of owned media (which you create yourself) over earned media (which others create about you).Related: The Essentials of an Effective Press Release Media Strategy


Tips on impactful press releases in today's marketOutsource for cost-effectiveness. The ""wire"" isn't free. You can't just go out there and post your own content and hope it shows up on HuffPost or the Today show. This method of mass distribution requires an annual subscription fee, ranging anywhere from $500 to $4,000. Most small businesses can't afford that for the occasional press release. But PR companies routinely subscribe because they're submitting multiple products for multiple clients all the time. Do yourself a favor and let an outside firm foot the bill for the wire while you pay for only the content transmitted to it.Know the difference between embargo vs. exclusive. Some journalists regularly check sources on the wire while others purposely stay away from it, and there's also a demarcation between a press embargo and a press exclusive. The former is sent out and reserved for a later pub date, whereas the latter is sent to just one media source, offering exclusive rights to break your news. Don't want to become a specialist on the distinction? Again, bring in a professional to concentrate on your product or service.Include SEO. The more functions your press release can serve, the deeper the mark it will make. It's worth the effort of integrating SEO best practices and link building so that you'll rank higher with search engines. Every click from every well-researched keyword can increase revenue and market presence, so don't neglect the ""technical"" side even as you focus on the creative side.Don't expect immediate results. If you think one press release will lead to an explosion of growth, you will be disappointed. Like any worthwhile marketing endeavor, such as an ad campaign, this is not a one-and-done proposition. While your initial press release is perched on the wire in hopes of taking flight, use the time to continue learning about your client base and testing what works best in reaching them. Then bring those insights to even more refined versions of your press announcements. Just keep plugging away, and you'll eventually get plugged in!The AI effectLet's take a quick detour to acknowledge the change underway in journalism. Though it may be true that AI chatbots will drive the future of business writing, never forget that AI sources its content from already-written text on the internet. So we still need original content, and we'll always need original content (even if AI gets better at masking its inherent plagiarism).In this AI climate, the key to crafting an inventive press release is to personalize. The future of PR lies in reliance on ever more personal brands and personal connections. Make your press releases as personal as you're comfortable doing — that's the way to make it stand out from a computer-generated piece.Related: How Modern PR Differs From Traditional PR — and Why It's a Crucial Part of Any Successful Business StrategyLast word: PR = public relations and press releasesPress releases have historically been used to deliver updates about product launches, mergers and other large-scale business news. In today's digital media landscape, however, they serve a far more dynamic purpose.


That's why your business should absolutely still invest in press releases. But like any asset investment, you want to amplify their impact by curating exciting content, customizing the messaging and conducting targeted sends. Don't worry if it sounds overwhelming to try to take advantage of all the media relations software out there to share your good news farther and wider than it's ever traveled before. You can use a top-notch PR outfit to implement the whole process for you — in fact, that's what we're here for!

45,Try This Super-Busy Restaurateur's Recipe for Preventing Personal Burnout,"Jan 16, 2024",Shawn P. Walchef,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/try-this-super-busy-restaurateurs-recipe-for-preventing/468387,"
You need to find joy to run a restaurant that people love. But how can you expect anyone to love your business, if you don't love it yourself?For restaurateur Lien Ta, she had to learn an important lesson about how working too much can negate your love for your job. There are two essential ingredients to running her Los Angeles restaurants that feature the viral breakfast sandwich at All Day Baby and their signature Boozy Milkshakes: ""Restaurants require a lot of work and a lot of love.""In the sometimes chaotic world of operating restaurants and hosting live events, the restaurateur and industry leader learned that the best way to take care of others is to first take care of yourself. So every day Lien spends time doing something just for her — even if it's just a few minutes.



""I've gotten better week-to-week at building just a little bit more structure to better take care of myself. And the payoff is strong,"" All Day Baby co-founder Lien Ta told Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media on a visit to the Los Angeles restaurant.One way that she has brought more joy into the world is with live events.


Hosting Events and Building CommunityFor Lien Ta, events are not just a way to make more money. Hosting unique gatherings (like her popular ""Food Trivia Night"") is a creative outlet, a catalyst for joy, and how her All Day Baby restaurant cultivates a loyal fanbase.""We just had to find ways to differentiate our restaurant from other restaurants,"" she said. ""Oftentimes restaurant work is repetitive, but events are the exact opposite. Sometimes when you collectively do something spontaneous, it's really meaningful.""If it weren't for the joy that Lien Ta feels for her profession, she wouldn't have been able to run one restaurant — much less multiple ones.""I wouldn't have even thought of those events if I hadn't actually started doing these tiny little things for myself,"" she said.


Fundraising tipsHer passion helped raise $750,000 for her first restaurant, Here's Looking At You, and $1.25 million for All Day Baby.Due to her willingness to share her own restaurant story with different forms of media, Lien has become a mentor to many who hope to do what she has done.Her advice to budding restaurant entrepreneurs looking to raise money?""You need to think about any single person that has possibly ever cared about you. Hopefully, they have deeper pockets than yourself,"" Lien said.


""You can tell them the concept, you can tell them why you think it's going to work, this is the 5-year plan, etc. Ultimately, an investor is investing in you and they need to believe that you're the kind of human that's going to see this through to the best of her capabilities.""Women taking controlLien Ta knows hospitality can be a hard business for women. That's why she is working to help amplify women in the industry with the RE:Her nonprofit she co-founded.RE:Her (Regarding Her) was created to accelerate women-owned food and beverage businesses all over the world.""We believe a woman alone has power, but collectively, we have impact,"" their vision statement reads. ""Our ambition is to create the food and beverage industry we want for ourselves and for future generations — one we can be proud of and in which women thrive.""


Lien is proud of the work she's done with RE:Her and knows there's lots more to come.""And what I love about RE:Her is I'm trying to forge true connections and learn these individual stories and do my best to provide a platform where we can celebrate those women. It's so wonderful to see them headlining panels or being incredible presences on social media,"" she said while sitting inside her All Day Baby during a recording for the Toast Family Style streaming series.In Edible LA, Lien Ta wrote a love letter to her industry and opened up about rediscovering her joy for restaurants.""For years I personified the classic trope of making passion my work, and then losing passion for it,"" she wrote. ""In a way, I had to give myself permission. Permission to neglect my work and prioritize two, arguably bigger, things: myself and the value I cherish most, connection. I tried to convince myself that if I could do this, I could patch up my relationship with my job and my joy.


And as Lien Ta found, when you take care of yourself, it's a lot easier to take care of others.""My inspiration was this: I couldn't bear to have any of my younger-generation employees look at me and think This must be the only way to reach success. To burn out beyond the pale. I wanted to be a better, healthier example of a human that knew she was only human — and it was okay to have needs of her own.""Subscribe to Restaurant Influencers: Entrepreneur | Spotify | Apple About Restaurant InfluencersRestaurant Influencers is brought to you by Toast, the powerful restaurant point of sale and management system that helps restaurants improve operations, increase sales and create a better guest experience.

46,How to Elevate Your Online Sales with Cutting-Edge Product Photography,"Jan 15, 2024",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/boost-your-ecommerce-success-with-these-top-photography/467263,"
Having an appealing product image can be quite helpful in the ever-changing world of online purchasing. How we take images of items to sell online has changed significantly over the last few years. The ways we display the goods we're selling online change as more people purchase online and technology evolves.This article outlines the most recent techniques for taking images for websites, including how they should be lit, what equipment to use and what they should look like. It all revolves around assisting companies in succeeding in the competitive world of sales via the Internet.The visual revolutionThe way we look at things has changed a lot because of online shopping. Unlike in physical stores, we can't touch or try items online. So, when we decide to buy something, we rely on its pictures. This is why online shops must take really good product photos. They have to be creative and show things in new and interesting ways.



One trend is using lifestyle photos. Instead of just showing the product alone, they show it being used in real situations. For example, if they sell outdoor items, they might show people using them outdoors. This helps customers understand how the product works and makes them want to buy it.Another trend is minimalism. This means keeping things simple and clean. Products are often shown on plain backgrounds with soft lighting. This style is great for fancy or luxury items because it makes them look elegant and well-made.


Lastly, there's mobile-first photography. Since many people shop on their phones, product pictures need to look good on small screens. These photos should be clear, simple, and load quickly on smartphones and tablets. Making image files smaller and using tall or square shapes can enhance the mobile shopping experience. Online stores need to follow these trends to ensure customers have a great online shopping experience.Related: Why Influencers and Ecommerce Should Be the New Power Duo for Your BusinessLighting techniques Regarding online sales, high-quality product photos are essential, and proper lighting is key to capturing the details effectively. Soft and gentle lighting techniques, achieved through tools like bounce boards and soft boxes, create a smooth appearance suitable for clothes and jewelry. For products with intricate details, dramatic lighting, like spotlighting or side lighting, highlights specific areas, making them visually appealing, especially for gadgets and fashion items. Natural light, obtained by shooting near windows or during the golden hour outdoors, adds authenticity and warmth, perfect for products related to health and outdoor activities.In addition to lighting, having the right equipment is important. High-quality cameras provide clear and professional-looking photos, like DSLRs or mirrorless options. Prime lenses enhance sharpness and brightness, especially in low-light conditions, ensuring detailed product images. Stability is essential; tripods and stands keep the camera steady for clear shots. Smartphone photography kits offer budget-friendly options, enhancing smartphone images with special lenses and tools. Continuous LED lighting provides a consistent glow and adjustable colors, allowing photographers to match the light with the product and surroundings. Editing software like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom helps perfect the images by adjusting colors and removing backgrounds, ensuring your product photos look appealing and professional for online customers.

People passing by always notice if the display changes, right? Similarly, updating your product images is like changing the window display. You want it to look fresh and exciting, so people are curious to see what's inside. By keeping an eye on how your products look, work, and suit different seasons, you ensure your store always feels new and inviting. It's like giving your store a makeover regularly, making customers eager to explore.Conduct A/B Testing: A/B testing is like trying different flavors of ice cream to see which one you like best. You experiment with different styles, lighting techniques, and ways of presenting your products to find out what your customers prefer. It's like asking your friends which ice cream they enjoy the most. By testing various approaches, you discover what makes your products more appealing to your customers. It's a bit like finding the perfect recipe that everyone loves!Consider Professional Assistance: Imagine you want to take a beautiful picture, but you're not sure how to use the camera. That's where professional photographers come in – they're like expert chefs in the kitchen of photography. They know all the tricks to make your products look incredibly delicious to buyers. Just like you'd hire a chef to cook a special meal, hiring a professional photographer ensures your products are presented in the best possible way. It's like having a magical touch that turns your ordinary pictures into extraordinary ones.Stay Informed about Industry Trends: Staying informed about industry trends is like keeping up with the latest games or toys that everyone is talking about.

47,How to Grow an Online Business Profitably — A Private Equity Playbook,"Jan 15, 2024",David Klein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-your-digital-marketing-should-adopt-a-private-equity/467676,"
Private equity firms are in the business of being extremely financially savvy. That is how they generate significant returns for investors. To apply that same focus to running omnichannel digital marketing programs, we need to gain as much clarity as we can via data and experience in order to benchmark and build a digital growth roadmap, followed by continued measures to drive profitable growth by increasing revenue and cost efficiencies.For online businesses with serious ambitions, I suggest approaching growth the way that most resonate with our private equity clients: With a digital marketing business case and a good ""strategic partner"" for their marketing efforts. By approaching digital marketing with a private equity mindset, businesses can make informed decisions and maximize their chances of success. It starts with the right foundation.The importance of a digital marketing business caseWe built our digital marketing consultancy by servicing private equity firms. The concept of the digital marketing business case was developed within the greater scope of digital due diligence in order to inform the business plan and align all stakeholders. As a result, we now develop these business cases with all our clients before spending any significant budget. To maintain focus amidst changing platforms and fast-paced disruptive innovation, we regularly refresh them to adjust for initiatives, product launches, or market changes.



A digital marketing business case, simply put, is a commercial forecast of revenue opportunities and a clear mapping of the resources required to achieve them as the foundation for a meaningful digital strategy. It reconciles leadership's top-down strategic vision and business targets with what is actually achievable from the bottom up based on the practical realities of each digital channel. A good business case aligns all key stakeholders with the company's digital activity and establishes a clear foundation for revenue growth. Constructing business cases for our clients has saved them tens of millions of dollars by empowering them to understand the impact of and resources required for their proposed initiatives.Related: 7 Things to Know about Digital Marketing


How to build a digital marketing business caseEvery business with a meaningful budget should create a digital business case. It is easier to eat the elephant piece-by-piece rather than whole, so establish multiple options for timeframes, budgets, and targets. Address and prioritize quick wins, which can often fund the next phase and grow stakeholder confidence. Once stakeholders agree upon the business case, project timeframes can be set, and the relevant digital strategies can be completed prior to campaign rollout.Specifically, a digital marketing business must address the following considerations:Calculate Opportunity in Dollars: Using a channel-specific analysis (as well as an understanding of the synergistic effects of channels), identify the gap between what revenue is achievable for a certain digital channel, and where the business currently sits.Know the Buyer Intimately: When we try talking to everyone, we connect with no one. With a crystal-clear understanding of our audience — their needs, pain points, motivators, interests, media consumption patterns and buying journey stages — we can forecast volumes and conversion rates across each channel and determine the role and KPI of each.Reverse-Engineer the Competitive Landscape:Competitors leading in one channel are often different from the leaders in another. Find the leaders in each channel and determine what it will take to beat them — the devil is in the details. Ask questions such as:What audience/s are my competitors targeting, and what works for them (e.g., which ads have they been running the longest)?What is their core value proposition and messaging?What can I learn from their creative assets when implementing my own (e.g., landing pages, ads, etc.)?What can I learn from their customer reviews?Calculate Effort:Understand the projects, budgets, timelines and expertise of internal (e.g., developers, internal marketing team members) and external resources (e.g., agency costs or media spend) required to capture the opportunity.Related: 5 Key Considerations When Choosing a Digital Marketing Agency for Your BusinessDefining a strategic partnership and how to find a winnerWhile every agency and consultancy may pitch themselves as a strategic partner, few come even close to having the skills, mindset and behavior required to earn this title. The partnership between a company and its digital agency should be akin to that of the consigliere in the Godfather movie — a trusted advisor with the commercial experience and technical know-how to guide clients toward exceeding sales targets within budget. They consult owners at the P&L level to ensure all marketing resources (internal and external) are strategically and practically aligned to achieve their key objectives.


To find a true strategic partner and validate their claims, ask for evidence:Do they have battle-scar wisdom from having run all relevant channels with great successes (and having learned from their failures)?Have they mastered the trifecta of commercial priorities (i.e. generating revenue), deep technical capabilities, and cut-through creative messaging?Are they agnostic in their choice of digital marketing channels and transparent with their fees?Do they have their finger firmly placed on the innovation pulse?Related: 10 Effective Strategies to Boost Your Visibility on LinkedInInnovation and disruption are inevitable and, therefore, must be at the heart of any strategic partnership to stay ahead of the curve. Mitigate the risk of these changes through the traffic light system: What activities do you stop, keep doing and start right now? For example, Google's plans to roll out Generative AI into its search results in early 2024 will shake the digital marketing world. A large portion of the real estate on the first page of a Google search may be occupied by generative results, which will have a significantly adverse impact on Google's traditional organic listings.Doing nothing will hit online businesses hard, but overreacting too soon could end up being a waste of resources. A good strategic partner will know best practices and risk-mitigation strategies that can be put into place early. They will both defend against these changes and exploit them while the window of opportunity is open. Many companies prefer the ostrich approach, keeping their heads in the sand until something happens, but this is clearly not a winning strategy. The evolving opportunities in digital marketing can be both exciting and confusing — but with a solid business case and a proven strategic partner, online businesses can be in a prime position to make the most of them.

48,7 Innovative Marketing Approaches to Boost Your Sales in 2024,"Jan 15, 2024",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-innovative-marketing-approaches-to-boost-your-sales-in/467509,"
Within less than two decades, marketing as we know it has changed almost beyond recognition. At the beginning of the century, business owners and marketers had a limited choice of channels through which they could reach potential customers. For small businesses, some of those channels were cost-prohibitive.The state of marketing in 2024Over the past two decades, digital marketing has transformed how companies find customers. Type 'the state of marketing 2024' into any search engine, and the results will most likely include some of the following key elements: personalization, use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), creating community, and a degree of uncertainty.As economic challenges and wars continue to wreak havoc on economies worldwide, forecasts for business performance remain volatile. Still, a handful of trends have been slowly emerging in marketing and are set to become key elements of winning marketing strategies in 2024. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, some of those revolve around the use of technology. At the same time, there is a distinct trend toward human connection. Marketers can make use of both to benefit their brands.

Personalized marketing strategiesGone are the days when entire families gathered in front of radios and TVs to watch a certain program and the advertising content delivered during breaks. For several years now, marketers have emphasized targeting specific audiences rather than using a broad approach.


Experts predict that leading brands will take things one step further in 2024 and introduce true personalization, basing the information consumers see on their needs immediately. Imagine a weather change, for example. As soon as the rain starts, you see adverts for rain gear, umbrellas, and articles discussing weather patterns. The goal is to make content more relevant than ever before.2. Interactive content and experiencesInteractive marketing communications are also gathering pace. To take advantage of them, marketers can use elements like polls and quizzes to create stronger connections with their target audiences. The goal is to transform the passive connection between the brand and the consumer into active, memorable communication.Product images and basic videos may no longer be enough to help a product stand out. Instead, leading brands will utilize augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to allow their customers to experience new products and innovations.3. Innovative use of social mediaSocial media marketing and advertising have become a core element of the marketing strategies of businesses of all sizes. Social media platforms offer targeted access to audiences, activities can be tailored to fit most marketing budgets, and the platforms lend themselves to community-building.


Over the past few years, ephemeral content that is available briefly and then disappears has been growing in importance. As consumers' attention spans grow ever shorter, content like Facebook or Instagram stories becomes more easily digestible than longer-form offerings.Aside from this type of disappearing content, live videos, social commerce offerings, and interactive storytelling that allows the audience to decide the outcome of a story will continue to grow.Related: 9 Key Tips for Navigating the Upcoming 2024 Marketing Landscape4. Embracing new technologiesMost of the key developments in marketing in 2024 will be driven or supported by emerging or developing technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI) has already made its mark on 21st-century marketing, with nearly two-thirds of marketers telling Hubspot that they are utilizing AI for market research, content creation, and improving the user experience their brands are delivering.


Chatbots have become common on many brands' websites, improving the user experience by allowing customers to access support 24/7. Combined with AI, chatbots are becoming increasingly more capable. Voice search and other voice-driven technologies are another element of leading marketing strategies in 2024.5. Community building and user-generated contentThe continuing rise of technology has led to something that could be seen as a counter-trend – the demand to create community among audiences. Early examples of these communities include Facebook's community chat feature in groups or Instagram's broadcast channels. Both give brands and creators another option to open conversations with multiple users.In addition, brand communications are no longer a one-way street from the company to the consumer. Some of TikTok's most popular videos show consumers using products and sharing their experiences authentically and in a highly relatable manner.Related: 7 Ecommerce Customer Experience Strategies for Effective Branding in 2024


6. Sustainability and purpose-driven marketingToday's consumers expect more than profit-making from their favorite brands. More and more, discerning consumers are choosing businesses with a greater purpose, such as environmental or social commitments. Two key elements of purpose-driven marketing are searching for sustainable solutions and giving back to the local community.Highlighting a company's work in that area will appeal to conscious consumers, but brands must demonstrate a real commitment. Superficial commitments and activities may grab consumers' attention in the short term, but they are unlikely to deliver long-term benefits.7. Cross-channel integrationA cohesive and integrated approach to marketing has always been considered best practice. Even though brands can use different channels to reach different audiences, marketing messages must align across those touchpoints. Most audience members will see a brand's content in different places. Inconsistent messages will be confusing and may drive potential customers away.2024 is looking promising for marketers willing to embrace technology without letting go of the need for community. While not without its challenges, this year has the potential to transform the way marketers use emerging technologies like AI to create the strongest brand-consumer connections yet.

Many execs or small business owners think social media is complete fluff — and for most businesses, it is.And when they say fluff, they don't mean to say it's pointless. It's well-documented that social media is a powerful tool. The skepticism with investing in social media is that it can be a coin toss if there is a return on investment (ROI).""That is because most marketers do not apply any direct-marketing tactics to their strategic approach — if they are even strategic at all,"" author Kim Walsh Phillips said in her latest book, Ultimate Guide To Instagram For Business, Second Edition.

50,Immediate Results Aren't Everything — Here's Why Playing the Long Game in Marketing Is Worth It,"Jan 12, 2024",Jackie Cullen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-playing-the-long-game-in-marketing-is-worth-it/467744,"
Not all marketing activities are going to net immediate results, so is it worth spending time and money on them? It is a reasonable question, and it's one I have had to address with many of my clients. Most business owners understand that, with marketing, rarely will they get instant gratification. However, when it comes to implementing a marketing strategy for their business, they may have difficulty understanding why they should invest time and effort in activities with a longer-term payoff.While there is certainly a lot to be said for incorporating marketing that will drive sales quickly, playing the long game is also an important part of any strategy because a business needs to build a reputation and create sustainable growth.Related: What to Do When Your Marketing Isn't Producing Results



The payoff is not always instantaneous, and that's OKBuilding a solid and effective marketing strategy means thinking about the present and the future. Ideally, a strategy should focus on a variety of activities that are designed to drive business in the short, medium and long term. Activities like starting a blog, creating video content, posting regularly on social media and designing a dynamic website do not bring in revenue right away. Furthermore, it is difficult to show exactly how much revenue they do generate.However, these activities are crucial for establishing a business's online presence and play a major role in developing its core reputation. It may take time for activities like these to reach the target audience, but with consistent effort, and the right approach, it typically pays off in a major way.


Take a podcast, for example. A podcast can rise to mainstream popularity seemingly overnight, when in fact, it usually takes a year or more before it reaches that point. Unless they hit on a viral topic and truly do achieve overnight success — which is pretty rare — most podcasters have to dedicate hundreds of hours doing research and producing episodes before they attract a large following. They put in a lot of effort behind the scenes to make each episode, and they are consistently posting new material, regardless of the listener count. As the number of episodes grows, more people are able to find the podcast through recommendations or based on similar interests, and listenership starts to snowball.The same type of scenario is also possible for a social media account, blog or YouTube channel. However, you cannot be discouraged when you only see 10 views after three or four posts. You have to carry on adding content. Marketing activities of this nature take time to gain traction, but the rewards can be significant when they eventually do.MomentumTargeted marketing strategies are essential for focusing on a specific product or service — for instance, my agency caters to dental practices across the country. One of the hot topics in our industry is dental implants. It is a high-value procedure for dental practices, even though, compared to a treatment like a crown, it is far less commonly performed.Launching a targeted marketing campaign around dental implants is an excellent way for a dental practice to attract higher-quality patients. So, to ensure that a practice's dental implants campaign gains momentum and keeps it up long term, my team always supports it with blog posts, social media messaging and patient testimonial videos. Even though that type of activity may not be the main driver of the business that comes through the doors, it promotes brand awareness and customer education, and it increases conversions as well.


Related: Be Grateful Your Business Isn't an Overnight SuccessSupport immediate activitiesExpanding on the last point, long-term, intangible activities are essential supporting elements for larger, more immediate activities, like ads, for example, because they strengthen the conversion rate. Ads are intended to drive conversions in from the start. They usually have a strong call to action. However, not everyone who sees an ad is going to be convinced right away. Some people will want to do further research before making contact. During their research, you want them to find more information — such as positive reviews, informative videos and a consistent social media presence — that reinforces, supplements and enhances the ad content to push them toward conversion.Trust the processA business is not a short-term undertaking. It is rare for a new business to take off immediately and never lose steam. For most new businesses or established businesses that are new to marketing, success takes time, whether that be three months or 13 months. With a well-planned marketing strategy in place, the business will have different tools with which to build a solid foundation for when it finally clicks.When my company, MDA, was new, I was constantly creating content for an audience of no one, but that did not deter me. I kept going, and, eventually, the people I was trying to reach saw my content. Additionally, because I had dedicated the time and invested in my online presence, dentists and other professionals were able to see that I knew what I was talking about. I was recognized as having authority in the dental community. My exposure grew, and I got more visibility, connections, opportunities and clients.


Not seeing immediate results from certain marketing activities does not mean they were unsuccessful. Many activities require a slow and steady approach, but the payoff is truly worth the wait. Consistency, dedication and, most importantly, believing in what you are doing — those are the keys to successful marketing. Results may not come right away, but they will come.Related: How to Create a Successful Marketing Plan: 5 Steps

51,'Literally Insane': White Claw Just Dropped a Controversial Product That's Drawing Backlash on Social Media,"Jan 12, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/white-claw-0-alcohol-premium-seltzer-divides-social-media/468279,"
White Claw, one of the most popular hard seltzers in the U.S., is stirring the social media pot with its latest offering: a 0% alcohol variety pack.The sober-friendly product hit supermarket aisles on January 1 — but comes with a price tag that has made some customers balk.The suggested retail price for the new offering is $17.49-$19.99 for a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans or $10.99-$11.49 for a six-pack of 12-ounce cans, per Fox Business.



Consumers have been vocal on X and TikTok, debating whether the new drinks are a revolutionary step in the non-alcoholic market or simply a cost-inflated seltzer water. For comparison, Total Wine & More lists the price of the popular sparkling water brand La Croix at $5.49 for an eight-pack of 12-ounce cans.Related: Are You Sober Curious? Dry January Is on the Rise and Here's Why You Might Want to Try It


The beverages, meant to mimic the taste of the brand's original seltzers, are available in black cherry cranberry, mango passionfruit, peach orange blossom and lime yuzu flavors, and have 15 calories per can with added electrolytes.Related: Cactus Is the New Coconut, and These Founders Are Going All In: 'We Decided to Drop Our Lab Coats, Put on Our Cactus Suits and Chase the American Dream'One X user posted a photo of the 0% White Claw, writing ""We've come full circle.""We've come full circle pic.twitter.com/Jq0AjAQBZ7— c a i t l i n (@hello__caitlin) January 10, 2024Naturally, not everyone is sold on the new product.""Seltzer water at beer prices,"" one user responded.""This trend of sober seltzer aka water and non-alcoholic wine aka juice and the corresponding prices are literally insane,"" another said.""Imagine drinking White Claws without the one ingredient to help you forget you're drinking White Claws,"" another quipped.But some X users came to the 0% seltzer's defense. ""I actually like this,"" one user wrote. ""As someone who can't have alcohol now I have a new drink to try?""A similar divide emerged on TikTok, where one user posted a video unveiling the new product — and admitted she ""100% wanted to laugh"" when she first saw it before coming to the conclusion that it could help non-drinkers feel more comfortable in social settings.@thebrandblueprint White claw is dropping a non-alcoholic, 0% seltzer to compete with liquid death and transform the nonalcoholic space #whiteclaw #nonalcoholicdrink #brand #branding #packaging #marketing #greenscreen ♬ original sound - Brooke?Marketing, Brand, Ecom""This is amazing for the sober,"" one user agreed.

52,4 Smart Strategies for Safeguarding Your Business and Brand Reputation in a Crisis,"Jan 10, 2024",Danielle Sabrina,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-safeguard-your-business-and-brand-reputation-in-a/467683,"
Today's business landscape is almost entirely digital. While the opportunities brought about by the digital age are nearly limitless, this new era has also ushered in waves of new threats — and savvy business owners must be not only aware of those threats but ready to protect their businesses against them and the damage they can do.Your brand's reputation is everything. Today's customer has a wealth of options at their fingertips and is more selective than ever. Simply stated, a good reputation attracts customers, and negative brand associations repel them. Creating a solid and strategic brand management plan is the first step in mitigating the potential harm that can come to your company via the internet, and this quick guide will help you get started.Related: 7 Ways to Recover After a Reputation Crisis



Identifying potential threatsBefore you can create a plan to mitigate potential threats, you need to understand where they might come from. For instance, social media is a common culprit. While social media can be harnessed to connect with your customers and spread the word about your company and the products or services you provide, it can just as quickly turn into your worst enemy.When customers feel they have had a poor experience, they often take their complaints to social media. Depending on factors ranging from the popularity of the unhappy customer's account, the severity of the experience and how many others have had a similar negative experience, a post like this can quickly go viral, destroying the reputation you've built for years in a matter of hours.


This type of public criticism can be difficult to manage. It can happen fast, even overnight, and a prompt response is needed to mitigate the damage. If a business is unprepared and takes too long to formulate that response (or the response doesn't resonate), the damage may be irreversible.Strategy: Outline potential threats to your business's reputation, including social media, unfavorable news stories, product or service quality issues and negative reviews. Just knowing where to watch is critical, and this list is a good starting point.Proactive brand monitoringNow that you know where potential threats could occur, how will you know when they do? It's impossible to monitor every possible channel around the clock personally. Fortunately, plenty of tools are available today that can actually do that for you. This makes a huge difference in brand protection because the earlier you can respond to negative activity, the better off you'll be.Strategy: Invest in reputation management software. Compare tools to determine what will work best for your company and your industry. Look for tools that offer social media listening, sentiment analysis and competitor monitoring to start with, although you may wish to add more depending on how frequently you find that your company is discussed online.


Related: Why You Must Monitor Your Online Reputation Before it Hurts YouAddressing negative feedbackIt's been brought to your attention that a customer has made a complaint about your company. Unfortunately, it's gone viral, and your brand's reputation is diminishing quickly. What do you do now?In almost every case, the right strategy is to address this issue head-on with honesty and transparency. Ignoring the problem won't make it go away, and if attempts are made to hide the full story, it will become an even bigger problem when the truth eventually comes out. A negative media experience doesn't have to be the end of the road, though. Use the negative feedback to improve your products or services, and you — and your customers — will come out ahead.In 2018, Starbucks received serious backlash when a manager called the police on two Black men who were waiting for a business meeting. The two men were arrested, and the situation blew up in both the press and on social media, with #BoycottStarbucks trending. Starbucks responded quickly, with CEO Kevin Johnson releasing a sincere statement and apology, referring to the situation as ""reprehensible."" His statement included a promise to do better, and the following month, more than 8,000 Starbucks locations across the country closed for an afternoon of racial bias training.


Strategy: Create social media scripts and talk tracks around every situation you can imagine, no matter how unlikely they may seem. Nobody ever wants to admit that a member of their organization could make a bad decision or that their product could injure someone, but both of these scenarios happen all the time, and organizations need to be prepared for the possibility. Train members of your team on how to talk to the media, and let employees know to whom they should direct media inquiries.Maintain transparency and authenticityTransparency is always the ethical choice, but it's even more important during challenging times. Your choice will significantly impact how your company is perceived by the public and even whether it can successfully navigate a crisis.Customers, investors and internal stakeholders like your employees need to feel like they can trust your company. Listening to and honestly addressing concerns offers reassurance during challenging situations. Acknowledging mistakes and committing to improvement displays authenticity and prevents rumors from starting and spreading.Strategy: Always speak honestly and authentically. Show empathy, especially if a party has been harmed. Listen when feedback is given. Has a deficit in your company been highlighted? Be prompt in creating a plan to address this deficit and then follow through.


Don't let a crisis catch you off guard. A smart and strategic communication plan partnered with transparency and authenticity will help you successfully navigate the inevitable challenging situations that an online society is bound to throw your way.Related: The Crisis Won't Kill Your Business If You Get the Response Right

53,How Being the Middle Child Impacts Your Success in Business and Life,"Jan 9, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-being-the-middle-child-impacts-long-term-success-in-life/468044,"
Have you ever wondered how birth order impacts success in business and life?Whether you're the oldest, middle, youngest or only child, your position within the family does affect your upbringing and future — though to an extent that varies considerably depending on individual circumstances.Alfred Adler, a 19th- and early 20th-century Austrian psychotherapist and founder of individual psychology, introduced the idea that birth order affects a child's development — and claimed that ""middle children are optimally positioned in the family and are characterized by emotional stability,"" per Scientific American.



Related: How Being the Oldest Child Impacts Your Success in Business and LifeYet the so-called ""middle child syndrome"" has also come to be associated with children born between the oldest and youngest siblings. Middle children might be more rebellious and sociable, and they might be more likely to move far away and less likely to strive for perfectionism, according to WebMD.


Entrepreneur sat down with Dr. Brittany McGeehan, a licensed psychologist based in Frisco, Texas who specializes in working with high-achieving women, to learn more about how being the middle child can impact success in business and life.""They're the peacemakers, typically, so they have absolutely wonderful negotiation skills.""Although McGeehan acknowledges that any generalizations about birth order and success are ""painting with a broad brush"" and may not ring true for everyone, she says that middle children tend to go down one of two paths.The first — and more common, according to McGeehan — comes with significant advantages for middle children navigating the business world.Related: Are Some People Born to Be Entrepreneurs?""They're the peacemakers, typically,"" McGeehan says, ""so they have absolutely wonderful negotiation skills, and they are usually able to read a room and see what the room needs to calm down. —[from] childhood all the way up [to] sitting in a boardroom or wherever.""Middle children who fall into this category are inclined to ""go with the flow"" and ""show up in the way that they need to in order to maintain balance,"" McGeehan adds.Related: 5 Benefits of Teaching Young Children About Entrepreneurship


""There is potential for middle-borns, in general, to end up less successful if they're hell-bent on 'I need to prove myself.'""But some middle children will try a different tack — one motivated by their desire to stand out, McGeehan says.""They feel that need to prove themselves,"" McGeen explains, ""[and] you can see this going astray versus really sort of leaning into [their] negotiation and compromise skills. There is potential for middle-borns, in general, to end up less successful if they're hell-bent on 'I need to prove myself' versus building a foundation of skills that are actually sustainably going to be able to help propel them through a career.""Fortunately, with all of the information available on the internet and social media, many parents today are well-informed about the potential challenges of being a middle child and can take steps to mitigate them, McGeehan notes.

54,6 Ways to Use Social Media to Strengthen Your Brand in 2024,"Jan 8, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/6-easy-ways-social-media-can-strengthen-your-brand/467363,"
Social media isn't new but may be part of a branding strategy that has grown stale for you over time. As an entrepreneur, you are the face and voice of your business. And the first thing someone often wants to know after learning a little about it is, ""What's your (social) handle?""To some degree, you must always be in the public eye. But there are ways to do this without becoming overwhelmed with every new social media platform and trend there is. Whether launching your brand or wanting to refresh your strategy in the first quarter, here are six ways to make it work for you.1. Establish a unique voicePosting on social media can feel like you're shouting into the abyss, with the average daily time spent on social media continuing to steadily increase. Currently, over 151 million people worldwide use it per day. Therefore, it's up to you to stand out from the crowd to be seen and heard.



Identify your message and brainstorm multiple ways to deliver it. Craft your content to reflect your brand. For example, authors don't only promote their books on social media. They also talk about their writing process, highlight book events (not just their own), and share their personal reading lists.Consider which aspects of social media you will use to grow an audience and which parts you will use to promote/sell your product or service solely.Related: 6 Ways to Ace Social Media Branding for Your Startup2. Pick a channelTikTok may be the latest social media star, and with the number of users, the instinct is to join the crowd. First, consider if that's where your audience is. Typically, it draws a younger audience, which may be the target place for retail brands, but it may not have the exact audience for you.Though LinkedIn is considered the ""less fun"" platform, it is a place to talk about business, especially if it's tips or success stories. It can be a starting place to grow your authority. The goal is to pick one channel to focus on rather than trying to master all areas.That doesn't mean you can't cross-post to other channels or switch up how you post depending on the platform. However, don't get too caught up in the next big thing if it doesn't resonate with you or your brand. Because as popular as TikTok is now, there's always a newer, flashier social media platform right behind it.


3. Develop a social calendarGet more social online by outlining a monthly or bi-monthly calendar. It focuses your time and energy on strategy without having to come up with engaging captions and edited content on the fly during your general work day.Setting aside time to schedule posts establishes a sense of consistency while also giving you the freedom to post real-time content if and when the moment strikes. Alternate between posting different types of content and always asking yourself what kind of value your post is giving rather than just posting for the sake of new content.Many argue that the more you post, the better you can beat the algorithms. However, if you have an audience that's truly engaged, they'll be looking and responding to your posts no matter what.Related: How Technology Influences Social Media


4. Decide which trends to followJust as you shouldn't jump on the bandwagon of every new social platform that debuts, so is the same with online trends. So many new gifs, memes, and slang are being introduced all the time; it can be hard to keep up. When using their popularity to your advantage, ensure it reflects your brand. Otherwise, your messaging will fall flat.Trends come and go, but having a strong position is what will attract and retain your audience. Don't be as concerned with having a viral moment or attracting hundreds of followers who are not engaged with your brand. Instead, be patient and slowly ramp up your audience of people who actually want to hear what you have to say and will eventually buy into what you're selling.5. Get creative with videoOne ""trend"" that has had staying power is video. TikTok and Instagram Reels have proven to be famous in sharing short snippets of information entertainingly. However, there are still over 2.7 billion monthly active YouTube users, allowing you to post longer videos complete with captions.Whichever avenue you'd like to take with video, scripted or live, short or long, it's a good way to share your brand personality engagingly. Not comfortable on camera? Put together a reel of business highlights or still images that showcase your offering(s); it doesn't have to be your face front and center for every video.


Related: The Rise Of Vertical Video And Its Impact On Social Media6. Keep it realSpotting a phony is so easy, and online users today aren't afraid to call you out. Also, creating dry social media captions can trigger spam warnings and make it harder for you to get in front of your audience at all.If you're having trouble crafting the perfect message, tools like ChatGPT can be helpful. While AI shouldn't be relied on to create your content word for word, it can serve as a guiding point when conveying what you want. Also, social media tools like Buffer have built-in AI features to help make captions easier and more convenient.Overall, don't let using social media overwhelm you. Rather, stay curious about what you can do with it. Pick and choose the platforms and features that speak most to you and your audience, and grow it from there.

56,8 Pitfalls Small Businesses Must Avoid When It Comes to Marketing Themselves,"Dec 27, 2023",Thomas Helfrich,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/8-pitfalls-small-businesses-must-avoid-when-it-comes-to/465939,"
Do you ever feel like, no matter how much effort you put in, your content marketing strategy always falls flat and fails to produce results? You're not alone in that boat. You're probably one of thousands of small business owners experiencing this setback.Countless small business owners make common content marketing mistakes that can sabotage their business's success. In this article, we'll dissect small businesses' top content marketing mistakes and how to steer clear of them.Related: How to Write a High-Performing Content Marketing Strategy



The power of content marketing for small businessesIt's a well-known fact that content marketing is a strategic marketing approach that has been around for years and has gained even more prominence with the continued growth of social media and other technologies.Rand Fishkin, co-founder and former CEO of Moz, puts it succinctly: ""Content marketing is the new SEO."" As a marketing technique, it's aimed at attracting a targeted audience through consistent content for profitable customer action.


For small businesses, it's a potent tool to reach a wider audience, establish their presence, build brand awareness, generate leads and ultimately bridge the gap between sales and marketing for B2B lead generation. Some key benefits of content marketing for small businesses include increased website traffic, a boost in SEO rankings, lead generation, increased brand awareness and much more.The consequences of common mistakes in your content marketingFor small businesses to survive, getting every detail right is crucial. Unlike larger brands, small business owners can't afford to get things wrong, as the consequences can significantly impact their brand reputation. When content marketing goes awry, you might experience the following:Poor performance in search engine rankings.Reduced website traffic, which ultimately affects revenue.Wasted resources, effort and time spent on creating content.A competitive disadvantage as your competitors seize the opportunity to win over your target audience.Related: 8 Things Technology Startups Need to Do Before Creating Their Content StrategyThe content marketing mistakes small businesses must avoid to succeedNow that it's clear that making mistakes with your content marketing can be detrimental as a small business owner, what are the red flags to watch out for? To solve any problem, it's important to identify it, as that makes it easier to avoid. Here are some mistakes that small businesses should steer clear of in their content marketing efforts:


Mistake 1: Failing to define your target audience clearlyWhile this may sound like a basic principle, you'd be surprised at how many small businesses have no idea who their target audience is. Simply putting your product out there and hoping it gets purchased isn't enough. Without researching your audience and building an ideal customer profile, you're setting yourself up for failure from the start.Make the most of research tools to understand your customers, their preferred platforms, the problems they're searching to solve and how you can position yourself as the solution they need.Mistake 2: Lacking a clear and consistent content strategyWithout a well-defined content strategy, achieving or sustaining your content marketing goals is challenging. Understanding the importance of content marketing is one thing, but executing it successfully is another. The absence of a content strategy can mark the beginning of the end of your content marketing efforts, and that's something nobody wants.Consistency is crucial for successful content marketing, as it allows for regularly delivering valuable information to the audience. This helps build trust and credibility, grow your audience and generate leads through an effective system.


Mistake 3: Neglecting to keep up with trendsAs a small business owner, you're doing yourself a disservice by not staying updated with industry trends. Customer behaviors are constantly evolving, and the online space provides valuable insights into those changes. Falling behind means you're in the dark when it comes to your business.Staying current with industry trends and best practices in search engines and social media platforms gives you a competitive advantage. The only way to achieve this is by being proactive, agile and adaptive.Related: Why Producing High-Quality Content Matters for Your BusinessMistake 4: Compromising on content qualitySurprisingly, the quality of your content plays a pivotal role in the success of your content marketing efforts. Unfortunately, many business owners overlook this crucial aspect, which can come back to haunt them.


High-quality content has the power to be actionable, persuasive and emotionally engaging, encouraging your audience to take the desired action. You can draw in the attention of your target audience, boost brand awareness and position yourself as an authority by producing interesting and useful content.Mistake 5: Neglecting SEO best practicesFor small businesses, leveraging organic content marketing is the most cost-effective and sustainable approach. However, getting it right requires careful attention and planning. Ignoring search engine best practices like mobile responsiveness, keyword research and on-page SEO means setting yourself up for failure.By adhering to search engine best practices and strategically positioning your business, you gain an advantage on search engine result pages (SERPs), drive traffic to your website and establish your business as a relevant and valuable brand.Mistake 6: Always sounding sales-orientedWhile it may seem like your product is a surefire sell, that's not always the case. Pushing it aggressively at your audience can have the opposite effect. One of the biggest content marketing blunders is coming across as too sales-focused whenever the opportunity arises, which can drive your audience away.


Instead, focus on providing value to your audience consistently. Since people are emotional creatures, they are more likely to buy from you because of the value you offer. Value sparks curiosity, which in turn boosts conversion rates. Pay close attention to the value you deliver through your content marketing efforts.Mistake 7: Lack of content varietyVariety is often said to be the spice of life. Imagine if your content marketing lacks variety — wouldn't it become monotonous and boring? Many small business owners fall into this trap. While a particular content type may have worked in the past, it doesn't guarantee the same success every time.To get the most out of your content marketing, embrace diversity. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to content marketing since people respond differently to various content types. Experiment with different content formats, from text-only to visual content, to achieve the best results across various marketing channels and platforms.Related: 6 Marketing Pitfalls That Can Haunt Your Company


Mistake 8: Failing to measure and analyze resultsJumping on the content marketing bandwagon isn't enough if you can't measure your results. You won't know how well your content marketing is performing without proper measurement.Ensure you have key metrics and KPIs in place to gauge what's working and what's not. The specific metrics to measure will depend on the services you offer and the objectives you want to achieve. It could include website traffic, clickthrough rates, bounce rates, conversion rates and more. Several tools, such as HubSpot, Semrush, Moz and others are available to help you track your performance effortlessly.Drawing the curtainIn summary, content marketing helps small businesses reach their audience, build brand awareness, generate leads and drive sales. However, it's crucial to steer clear of these common content marketing mistakes to achieve success; otherwise, you may be setting yourself up for failure before you even begin.

57,How (And Why) You Should Acquire New Skill Sets During The Slower Winter Months,"Dec 26, 2023",Rodolfo Delgado,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/why-you-should-learn-new-skill-sets-this-winter/466678,"
Here's a harsh truth: unemployed people are having a hard time finding a new job because many companies halt their recruiting efforts during the last quarter of the year. This is not new – it is a well-known fact that big companies often do a headcount at the end of the year, and they often significantly slow down their hiring process.Instead of unsuccessfully searching for opportunities when there is little to no hiring, many look to expand their arsenal of skill sets, which can propel their pursuit of better, bigger opportunities in the few months to come.For those looking to embark on the journey of acquiring new skill sets during the slower pace that winter months often offer, I'd like to delve into five unique avenues to discover inspiration for skill sets that can benefit your life and career in the near future.

Start by identifying professionals with positions similar to your current role, your desired career path, or roles with the title of the person you used to report to in your last job. Take a closer look at the job description for those roles, paying close attention to the skills and qualifications they require.


For example, if you're in marketing and aspire to move into a leadership role, analyze profiles of Marketing Managers or Directors. Note the skills they require or those with that job title have honed over the years, such as data analysis, digital marketing or project management. These insights can guide your skill acquisition journey, helping you align your skill set with your career aspirations.Mentorship and networkingSeek out mentors who can offer guidance on skill acquisition. If you are still close or have a great relationship with the last person you reported to, you may seek them for advice, asking which skill sets would be valuable for you to acquire if you intend to continue to pursue growth in your current career path.Conversations with mentors and industry peers can provide valuable insights into skill sets that have contributed to their success. These personal anecdotes and recommendations can steer you toward acquiring skills that align with your goals and aspirations.If you're not in touch with them anymore or would rather avoid contact with them, engage in mentorship and networking activities to discover skill sets that have proved valuable for others. Attend industry events, webinars, or virtual conferences where you can connect with experienced professionals who may have a similar career path to the one you're pursuing.


In my experience, I found people I highly admire and invited them to step into a virtual group call once every other month. In our one-hour meetings, we discuss what's been working for each of us and provide valuable guidance for everyone in the group. I like to call this exercise ""Business Therapy,"" in which we often discuss our past experiences and challenges and how we overcame them.Learning from the experiences of others may end up saving you years of continuous hustle. Never rely solely on your experiences when you can learn from the experiences of others.Related: Looking for a Mentor? The 7 Best Places to Start.Personal interests and hobbiesSometimes, inspiration for new skill sets can emerge from your personal interests and hobbies. Consider activities you're passionate about outside of your professional life. These interests can be a foundation for acquiring skills that bring joy and fulfillment.


For instance, if you're an avid photographer, you may explore photo editing or digital marketing courses to promote your work effectively. Blending your passions with skill acquisition can lead to a well-rounded skill set that enhances your personal and professional life.Fun fact: that's how my journey in the technology industry began. I am an Architect by profession, but I am such a tech nerd that I always sought to acquire technical skills, which is how I came up with the business idea that ended up becoming Replay Listings, the company I've led for over seven years now.Related: How to Turn Every Adversity You Face into an AdvantageTapping into industry trendsAs industries evolve, new demands arise, creating opportunities for individuals to acquire relevant skills. For instance, if you're in the technology sector, consider the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning. These cutting-edge technologies are shaping various industries, from healthcare to finance.


By understanding industry trends, you can pinpoint relevant skill sets and future-proof your career. Stay updated with the latest industry trends and advancements. Explore industry-specific publications, blogs, or podcasts to gain insights into emerging skills in your field.Online learning platforms and coursesOnline learning platforms offer various courses on various subjects, making skill acquisition more accessible than ever. Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning provide various courses, from technical skills to soft skills like leadership and communication.Browse these platforms to discover courses that align with your career goals or personal development objectives. The flexibility of online learning allows you to acquire new skills at your own pace, making it a convenient option for the winter months.The bottom line is the slow winter months often present a unique opportunity to embark on a skill-acquisition journey. Whether you draw inspiration from LinkedIn profiles, industry trends, mentors, personal interests, or online courses, acquiring new skill sets can enrich your life and open doors to exciting possibilities. Embrace the season as a time of growth and discovery, and you'll emerge with valuable skills that can shape your future success.

58,Popular YouTuber Banned By Airline After Calling It 'Outdated' and 'Dirty' in a Scathing Review,"Dec 22, 2023",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/youtuber-banned-from-qatar-airlines-after-bad-review/467491,"
A popular YouTuber has been banned from Qatar Airlines after ripping into the airline in a recent review.YouTuber Josh Cahill, who has more than 650,000 subscribers, posted a flight review over the summer after flying economy from Colombo, Sri Lanka, to London, calling the airline ""outdated,"" ""dirty"" and ""unfriendly"" and complaining about everything from the amount of space in the cabin, to the entertainment options and more.



""Hearing about Qatar's treatment of you brought me to this video, and I just want to applaud you for standing behind your review and not being bullied by the airline,"" one viewer commented. ""I'll be looking forward to watching your videos from now on and using them to make travel decisions.""Related: The 10 Best Airlines in the World


According to documents viewed by Insider, after posting the review, Cahill received an email from the airline asking him to remove it in exchange for a free flight — which he refused. This month, he found out while trying to board a flight he booked through Qatar Airlines that his reservation had been canceled because he was banned by the airline.Cahill confirmed the story in a December 16 follow-up to his initial review entitled ""Banned and Bribed by Qatar Airways — Shocking Move!""""In 10 years of reviewing airlines I have never been banned from any airline, nor has any of them ever offered me a free flight in return to delete the negative review,"" he told Insider. ""That was indeed a first-timer.""


Cahill stands by the fact that his review was ""negative but still balanced"" despite the harsh reaction from Qatar Airlines.Related: Airline Employee Tosses Passenger's Wheelchair Down Tarmac""I'm surprised by Qatar's drastic response,"" he said.Qatar Airlines did not immediately respond to Entrepreneur's request for comment or confirmation.

59,How to Establish a Distinct Brand Identity in a Saturated Market,"Dec 22, 2023",Chad Willardson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-establish-a-distinct-brand-identity-in-a-crowded/466846,"
In today's digital world, crafting a standout personal brand is essential for success as a business leader. One thing's for sure: Consumers trust and purchase from real people more than impersonal brand names. This is especially true with a service business. According to the recent national research study, ""Trends in Personal Branding,"" personal branding is more than just a social media personality contest. The data showed that 67% percent of ALL Americans would be willing to spend more money on products and services from the companies of founders whose personal brand aligns with their own personal values.A personal brand that captures your unique expertise can elevate your business and create a loyal customer base. That same study mentioned above showed that 74% of all Americans reveal they're ""more likely to trust someone who has an established personal brand."" In perhaps the most powerful statistic of the entire study, it turns out that 82% of all Americans agree that ""companies are more influential if their executives have a personal brand that they know and follow.Let's explore some action steps you can take to build a brand identity that cuts through the noise of a crowded marketplace.Related: 8 Reasons a Powerful Personal Brand Will Make You SuccessfulCrafting and communicating your brandYour personal brand is the story you tell the world, and your audience wants to learn something genuine about you and your brand story. It's crucial to share not only your professional triumphs but also the personal stories and passions that make you relatable, such as your hobbies, family, travels, etc. Consistency in your messaging creates a coherent narrative, while authenticity fosters a trusting relationship with your audience.



Embrace the platforms where your audience engages the most. For professionals, LinkedIn is often the go-to, serving as a space to demonstrate expertise and share personal insights. Authoring books and hosting podcasts can elevate your authority, allowing you to reach a wider audience with in-depth knowledge. My brand and reputation on LinkedIn didn't soar until I added a lot of authentic posts and stories and less boring business-focused posts. Sharing personal aspects should be done thoughtfully, ensuring each story aligns with your professional message and adds value to your brand narrative.Building community and engagementThe goal of a personal brand is to create a community, not just a following. Engagement is key. Encourage your audience to participate in conversations or debates through comments, forums and direct messaging. This interaction makes your brand relatable and accessible.Responding to feedback and adapting your brand message is important, but remember to stay true to your core values. Avoid the trap of overpromotion, and strive for a balance that promotes engagement over sales. Your brand should inspire interaction and foster a genuine connection.Building relationships with other like-minded entrepreneurs can open the door to opportunities that are mutually beneficial, such as speaking on a podcast or attending an upcoming event. When you collaborate with others outside of your immediate followers, you're able to tap into their audience, gaining exposure to potential customers who already trust your collaborators' judgment.


To be most effective in growing your audience, select partners whose personal brands resonate with your own. Their followers should have interests that overlap with the products and services you offer. For example, if your brand is built on financial literacy, partnering with influencers in the personal development space could be advantageous.Scaling your business through personal brandingSuccess in personal branding can often be qualitative. Look for engagement beyond likes and shares — genuine messages from your audience and opportunities for collaboration are indicators of a resonant personal brand. As your brand gains traction, use your influence to support your business goals. A strong personal brand can lead to new ventures and partnerships while amplifying your reach. As you scale, maintain the integrity of your brand. Growth should enhance, not compromise, the personal touch that distinguishes your brand from the rest.Building a personal brand is an ongoing process that involves sharing your journey and leveraging your experiences. It's a powerful strategy for entrepreneurs, offering a platform for growth and the opportunity to make a real impact. Maintain authenticity, consistency, and focus on community. These principles will guide you in creating a personal brand that not only stands out but also stands for something meaningful.A reputation is built up by trust, and a personal brand is a trust accelerator. Another recent study found that 76% of American Millennials are more likely to buy from a person with a personal brand.


Related: 6 Strategies You Need To Ensure Your Personal Brand Stands Out1. Define and deliver your value proposition clearlyImagine you're a chef at a bustling food market. Every other stall is offering a range of dishes, each with its own mix of flavors and ingredients. To stand out, you need to have a signature dish — something that no one else offers, that tells your story and satisfies a unique craving. Your value proposition is that dish.What is it that you provide that no one else does? Maybe it's a unique combination of services, or perhaps it's a particular approach to wealth management that's both approachable and highly effective. Once you've defined it, communicate it consistently across all platforms — be it on your LinkedIn profile, on your podcast shows or when speaking at events. Make it clear, make it appealing, and ensure it speaks to the core of what your audience values.2. Personalize your client experienceImagine each client interaction as a handcrafted gift. It's not just about the content inside the package — it's about the wrapping, the note that accompanies it and the perfect timing of its delivery. Your clients should feel that every piece of advice and every service you offer, is tailored specifically for them.


This doesn't mean creating entirely different services for each individual, but it does mean understanding their unique challenges and goals. Use client feedback to refine your offerings. Send personalized communications. Host events that cater to their interests and values. By personalizing the client experience, you build a relationship that feels exclusive and deeply connected to their needs.3. Educate and empower your audienceJust as a gardener nurtures plants to grow, so should you cultivate your audience's financial knowledge. Education is empowerment — and by providing valuable, easily digestible information, you position yourself as not just a service provider but a guide and mentor.Start a blog or a YouTube series focused on financial literacy, using simple language and relatable analogies. Explain complex concepts using common life experiences, like comparing diversified investments to a balanced diet. Not only will this reinforce your brand as a source of valuable knowledge, but it will also foster trust and deepen the relationship with your audience.Related: The 3 Questions You Must Answer to Make Your Brand Stand Out


In a saturated market, your personal brand isn't just a label; it's your distinct edge. Your key to success is authenticity and engagement. By genuinely connecting with your audience and consistently delivering on your unique value proposition, you create more than just a brand; you build trust and long-term loyalty. It's about being relatable yet professional, innovative yet grounded.Remember, in the realm of entrepreneurship, your personal brand is a powerful tool that drives not just visibility but real, meaningful business relationships. Cultivate it with intention, and watch it become your most valuable asset in navigating the competitive business landscape that we all find ourselves in.

60,5 Simple SEO Methods That Produce Major Traffic for Small Businesses,"Dec 22, 2023",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-simple-and-effective-seo-methods-for-small-businesses/465669,"
Search engine optimization (SEO) is, of course, pretty much an existential marketing consideration at this point: Without it, you're sunk. That said, a great many owners find associated strategies to be confusing and complicated, and inevitably highly technical. But worry not: There are simple yet effective SEO techniques that dependably produce more traffic for smaller and/or new businesses.Create product-specific landing pagesA common mistake is consolidating all of a company's products or services onto a single web page, but this means missing a vital opportunity to optimize product- or service-specific landing pages for target keywords.Take a Los Angeles-based family law firm, for example. Many firms list all their services (divorce, child support, child custody law, etc.) on one page. But those terms, independently, carry a ton of search volume, and so will be better optimized for individual web pages and targeted content.



So, consider all your services or products, then use keyword research tools like Semrush or Ahrefs to determine the organic search volume for each. Once you have determined a keyword target for each page, optimize content for it, which includes using a keyword(s) in the page title, subheadings and body content.Related: How to Create an Effective SEO Strategy in 2023


The power of guest postsAnother simple and effective way to generate more traffic is through guest posting —partnering with other publications, websites or blogs and writing or otherwise publishing content on their site.Reach out to peers or websites whose work interests you, and ask if they accept guest posts. You might have to present a few topics for approval and be sure to adhere to each site's guidelines (though many will accept content with no strings attached).Posting in this way can help earn backlinks to your website, which boosts its domain authority, and in turn SEO. That said, backlinks are rarely guaranteed, so also focus on the benefits of earning referral traffic via another website's audience and on the promotion of your content on their marketing channels.Related: 12 Secrets to Pitching the Perfect Guest Post


Optimize local Google and directory listingsThis strategy is particularly useful for small businesses targeting a specific geographic area (whether city, county or state), because people often use a variety of search engines to find services or businesses near home.The most obvious one is Google, of course, which has its own online listing platform: Google Business Profile. Start by creating your Profile, then select your category, and be sure to include business hours and contact information, along with high-quality photos. Keep in mind, too, that the more 5-star customer reviews you earn, the better rankings you'll have in Google Maps.Other online directories like Bing Places for Business, Yelp, The Real Yellow Pages (aka YP), Better Business Bureau, Foursquare and MerchantCircle can be used to attract local customers. Also consider industry-specific directories (such as Avvo for lawyers and Angi for home services).Related: Supercharge Your Local Listings and SEO with These 5 Tools


Generate effective contentOne of the best ways to increase traffic for a small business is by posting engaging and SEO-friendly content. Even if you don't have a large market, you'll command virtually unlimited reach if there's content on board that people are actively searching for.For example, say you own a small beauty supply boutique. Local reach used to be pretty much limited to foot traffic and traditional media, but now a vast audience can be reached with informative content on topics such as summer skin care, the best face oils for dry skin and preferred organic makeup brands.Once again, a good way to begin would be to use a keyword research tool to generate topic ideas relevant to your business and audience, then craft material accordingly (keeping in mind that non-writers can always use ChatGPT or other AI solutions). Include links to your products or service pages to attract even more attention.Related: 6 Tricks to Optimize Your Site for Search Engines


Leverage search-driven platformsGoogle isn't the only search engine in the game, to be sure: There are many others —including Pinterest, LinkedIn, Bing and YouTube — that use search-driven algorithms to connect users with brands.Pinterest can be especially effective for fashion and beauty brands, small retailers, artists, designers and marketing service providers. Similarly, YouTube and LinkedIn allow users to search for topics or content creators. On YouTube, someone might search for ""useful marketing tips"" and get directed to a marketing agency's channel, while on LinkedIn a potential client might search for ""business coach.""On all these platforms, small businesses can once again gain leverage by offering valuable and audience-relevant content. Each will have its own ""SEO best practices"" that you can apply to help content rank higher (see YouTube SEO, Pinterest SEO, and LinkedIn SEO).Related: How to Achieve Explosive Growth on Pinterest

61,"Modern Media, the Internet and Jury Duty — Is it Possible to Have a Fair Trial?","Dec 21, 2023",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/is-a-fair-trial-even-possible-in-the-era-of-influencers-and/466559,"
In a world where people are motivated by the Internet to buy everything from candles to cookware and fall victim to watching viral videos for hours on a loop, is it naive to think there's a chance for impartiality when picking jurors?An impartial jury relies on excluding jurors with previous knowledge or opinions of a case. With over 65% of the world's population having access to the Internet, it's a challenge to say the least.Related: Is Social Media Making You Less Social?



The influence of the media in high-profile casesJury impartiality dates back to the early 1800s when the trial judge in Aaron Burr's case called for jurors to listen to testimony with open minds and be questioned carefully before being accepted as jurors. Since the modes of communication and information sharing were significantly limited compared to what's available today, impartiality was easier to come by. Fast forward a couple hundred years, and it's difficult to think any potential jurors are coming in fresh to a case without preconceived notions.The subject of jury impartiality was a hot topic during the 2021 Derek Chauvin trial. When the former Minneapolis police officer was charged with murdering George Floyd, it was nearly impossible to find a jury pool who hadn't seen or heard the story on the news. If not privy to the original incident, there was no avoiding the aftermath that arose as a result, particularly in the area where the trial was being held.


It'd be hard for any juror not to have some feelings and opinions one way or another when they would be limited to listening only to instructions and testimony as presented in court. Jury selection in this case was reminiscent of other high-profile cases, such as O.J. Simpson's and George Zimmerman's trials. And, most recently, choosing a jury for the Donald Trump classified documents case faces similar challenges in finding 12 jurors who can leave their opinions — good or bad — at the door regarding the former president.Not only has Trump been a largely public presence but a polarizing one as well. There is typically no gray area when it comes to feelings about his character, a point that weighs heavily in the minds of Americans. The legal process of voir dire allows attorneys to examine potential jurors and exclude any that may be influenced past the point of impartiality.Related: Want to Gain Influence on Social Media? Get to Work.An attempt to preserve impartialityHigh-profile cases often require a lengthy questionnaire and in-person oral questioning to determine which jurors are most fit to withhold prejudice. Other tactics used to find impartiality include:


ContinuancesSometimes, trials are delayed to outlive the current wave of publicity. Once the media no longer brings their reports front and center, it allows the general public to move on from the heat of the debate and be in a place more willing to listen to the evidence presented.Changed VenueIn the case of Derek Chauvin, there was an attempt to move the trial to a different community that was less influenced by the publicity surrounding the case. However, it was ultimately decided that a trial is to include a ""jury of your peers."" Thus, the proceedings were kept local as outlined by the law's original intention.


Related: 3 Ways Millennials Are Leveraging Social Influence for Social GoodSequesteringThough jurors are always advised to disregard any outside information they've heard or seen about the case as they observe in court, it's difficult to put the genie back in the bottle. Once a person has heard, read, or seen information regarding case details, it's nearly impossible to remove those from memory, much less form opinions or make decisions without them.Press Restrictions


Judges can decide to close court doors to the press to diminish pretrial publicity and influence among potential jurors. However, beyond taking jurors' access to phones, computers and the outside world altogether, there's no way for judges to fully limit anyone's access to information, whether or not that information is accurate or pertinent to the case.Related: How to Respond When You're the Target of Bad PressAttorneys put to the test before the trial even beginsPeople may hide true opinions and political views in an effort to sit on the jury and convince their peers to rule in their own favor. Despite the expectations, instructions and oaths jurors take, people still may have their minds made up before the trial even begins, and once placed on a jury, it might be hard to undo it.In addition to legal proceedings, there's a sociological element to every trial, sometimes even a psychological one. Narrowing down a large pool of randomly selected potential jurors into the 12 that will make or break a case involves strategy and narrative-shaping far before a trial begins. When juries can evaluate and rely on the facts presented in court as their only means to make a decision, which is what they're instructed to do, it should be easy to remain impartial.


But, some walk a fine line between fact and fiction, even unknowingly. And, while all cases don't garner a strong public opinion, attorneys are tasked to ensure it stays that way. Complete jury impartiality isn't assured, but opinions aside, every case ultimately comes down to the facts and evidence.

Here's how: Navigate to your profile page on the Instagram app. In the top right corner of your profile, you will see three dashes. That's your menu. Click that. From there, you want to click ""Settings and privacy."" Then click ""Content preferences."" Then you're going to want to click ""Reduced by fact-checking."" This is where you can control how much of that fact-checked content you see in your feed.The top of the page contains this information from Instagram: ""Content reduced by fact-checking has been reviewed by independent fact-checkers and found to contain false or partly false information, altered content, or missing context.""Instagram gives users the option to either either reduce it more, keep it the same, or not reduce the fact-checked content.

In a Facebook Story she hoped would never become public, former Facebook employee Barbara Furlow-Smiles entered a guilty plea today for stealing over $4 million from the social media giant, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Georgia.The Atlanta-based Furlow-Smiles, 38, led diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs for Facebook (whose parent company is Meta) from 2017 to 2021. During that time, she used her position and Meta money to live like a rockstar, booking expensive hair stylist appointments and babysitting services. She even stole money to pay a hefty $18,000 tuition payment for a preschool.""This defendant abused a position of trust as a global diversity executive for Facebook to defraud the company of millions of dollars, ignoring the insidious consequences of undermining the importance of her DEI mission,"" said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan.Related: Beware of Prime Scams This Holiday Season, Amazon WarnsHow she did itBuchanan detailed Furlow-Smiles' elaborate scam in detail. First, she linked her corporate credit cards to her personal digital payment platforms, including PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App. Then, she used these apps to pay relatives and associates for goods and services allegedly for Facebook. But in reality, nothing went to the company. The accomplices returned most of the money to Furlow-Smiles as a cash kickback. To cover her fake credit card charges, Furlow-Smiles submitted fraudulent expense reports.



But the fraud did not stop there. Furlow-Smiles also hired friends and associates as vendors for Facebook, approving their inflated invoices and taking a percentage. Some services she acquired included $10,000 to an artist for a portrait.Meta has not said much publicly about the case. In an email to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, they wrote, ""We are cooperating with law enforcement on the case regarding this former program manager, and we will continue to do so.""

Social media is filled with vanity metrics to the point that they are often used to quantify the success of any particular campaign. From follower counts to likes, comments, quotes, and reposts, everyone chases this engagement, but few people can actually tell you what they mean or why they matter.When performing a Google search, there's an endless line of marketplaces that offer to sell us these vanity metrics so that we can flex a number on a screen. And people buy it — even the most popular social accounts have a non-trivial volume of fake followers. These fake metrics can likely do more harm than good, limiting reach for the sake of numbers on a screen.Everybody chases the dragon, but beyond website clicks and potential sales leads, the ROI of vanity metrics are thin.Related: 5 Reasons Why Your Brand Needs a Strong Social Media PresenceThe costs of social mediaSocial media quickly gained importance in the last 20 years, with giants like Facebook and TikTok dominating online conversations. In 2023, approximately 4.89 billion people use social media, with brands spending $269 billion on advertising on these platforms, expected to grow to over $300 billion next year.



Sprout Social estimates social media management costs an average of $12,300 per month, with smaller brands paying between $500-$5000, and social media companies like Meta, X (Twitter), and Reddit have been raising the ante all year with incremental increases in their pricing structures to increase their profits. For example, businesses spend $1000 monthly for the gold verification check on X, while Meta charges $21.99 per month per page on each platform.On top of that, both X and Reddit limited API access, with Reddit charging $12,000 per 50 million API requests and X's Enterprise API package starting at $42,000 per month. This negatively impacted the third-party tools businesses rely on for data analysis to determine sentiment and engagement, as well as tracking trends or scheduling posts.Related: The Importance of Customer Engagement on Social MediaMaking matters worse, the social media landscape is becoming increasingly more fragmented. There are 36 social media platforms with over 100 million users each, 21 of which are based in the United States. These platforms competing over the same 24 hours a day for our attention can leave brands struggling to appear on all platforms, especially in a meaningful way. An unorganized effort can end up wasting money on something that doesn't have a tangible return.


Even worse, any given platform could shut down or become passe overnight, and there's no telling what will be relevant tomorrow.Related: What Skills Does Elon Musk Have and Why Is He So Successful?Debunking the value of social currencyThe lure of vanity metrics is even more apparent during Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter and subsequent rebranding to X. Major advertisers like Disney, Apple, and IBM continue to pull out of the platform, and Xpats continue showing up on alternatives like Bluesky and Threads lamenting about not wanting to leave behind their follower counts.However, these cumulative follower counts are not necessarily indicative of an account's current visibility (or relevancy). These six- and seven-figure accounts grew over the course of Twitter's 15 years in existence, so it's highly unlikely they're all still active. Many Bluesky and Threads users reported similar or even increased engagement on these newer platforms, despite having a fraction of their Twitter following built in a condensed timeframe this year.


Follower counts don't include how many are active and engaged with your content, and the engagement doesn't necessarily convert off platform. Building an engaged community that supports your business involves three important steps.1. Offer exemplary products, services, and customer experiencesBusinesses often put the cart before the horse and build a social media presence before they even have a real business to promote. Keep in mind that your reputation online is very much tied to your IRL actions, so the best way to encourage positive engagement online is to show up and provide stellar value. This will go much further than pouring a lot of money into social media marketing.Related: Dominate Your Industry: How to Become the Best in Your Field2. Build an omnichannel strategyToday's social media landscape is more fractured and decentralized than ever–there's no one place to be active, as different people use different social networks for various reasons. What's most important is to choose platforms where your customers are active, and you have the capacity to provide real value.


Nobody can be on all of them. If you only give a half-hearted effort, people will notice, so be sure you have the experienced staff to manage your accounts. Creating graphics, writing copy, producing videos, and managing a Discord server are all entirely different skill sets, so be sure you have the resources and talent to maintain quality.3. Combine marketing with customer serviceSocial media combines marketing and customer service, so be sure you're effectively doing both. On one hand, you're raising brand awareness and creating thoughtful and engaging content to draw in new customers. On the other, you're on the frontline addressing negative feedback and providing solutions.Be sure you're addressing both sides of the coin, as it will yield the highest long-term ROI. To gain trust, B2C brands should lean into a positive referral system on marketplaces they exist on, and B2B businesses should lean into the Better Business Bureau and other customer service ratings.The social media landscape is flooded with fabricated numbers, and it can be easy to obsess over them or even pay to gamify them. But at the end of the day, having a million followers doesn't translate directly to ROI. Be purposeful in your actions, and build a community that engages with you across all platforms to ensure you aren't wasting time and money on something that could inevitably be worth nothing.

67,Don't Just Babble on LinkedIn — You Need to Carve Out Your Own Niche. Here's Why.,"Dec 8, 2023",Megan Thudium,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-become-the-linkedin-thought-leader-youre-meant-to-be/465346,"

LinkedIn continues to see a staggering surge in users and interactions. By defining your niche, you carve out a distinct identity amidst the multitude, allowing you to stand out and have a more significant impact.But finding your niche is not just about standing out — it's about building authority.When you focus on a specific topic that aligns with your core career or business objectives, you position yourself as an expert. This intentional specialization enhances your professional credibility and establishes your thought leadership. If you consistently contribute valuable insights within your niche, you can become a go-to resource for industry-related discussions, further solidifying your authority in the eyes of your peers and followers.Defining your niche on LinkedIn is also about strategically positioning yourself within a community of like-minded professionals. Identifying and engaging with industry leaders, company founders and subject matter experts within your niche opens doors to invaluable connections.


These connections will enrich your network and provide opportunities for collaboration, mentorship and knowledge exchange. Connecting with individuals who align with your personal goals and broader community interests ensures that your interactions on LinkedIn aren't just quantity-driven but rich in quality and value.Related: Why You Can't Ignore LinkedIn for Thought LeadershipNavigating the LinkedIn landscape with your nicheIn the ever-expanding nature of LinkedIn, discovering and embracing your niche transcends the confines of personal branding — it emerges as a deliberate strategy to thrive amidst the platform's burgeoning user base.Being strategic about your core thought leadership topics, values and the community you represent becomes paramount to enjoying the benefits of LinkedIn.

The new 'LITTLAND' economy.Today's social media tends to hold us all captive on our phones. There's a world within the apps. There's real life.

69,5 Ways SEO Can Help Grow a Mom & Pop Business,"Dec 8, 2023",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-ways-seo-can-help-grow-a-mom-pop-business/465089,"
Small, independently owned shops, almost by definition, rely on tighter teams and target smaller markets while providing often niche products or services. And small they may be, but mom-and-pop operations can be mighty: They often bring a family legacy to their customers, along with close customer service — experiences not easily found in larger commercial sectors.If you run such a shop, it's common to rely on local foot traffic and targeted social media for much of your marketing efforts. Fortunately, both of these channels benefit from good search engine optimization practices.1. Optimize your Google Business ProfileYour Google Business Profile is a prime piece of virtual real estate, and it's free. Simply sign up using an existing Google account and either claim an existing listing or create a new one. Once you can access your profile, you can optimize it to attract local customers — people looking for products/services online and those interested in visiting a physical location. A well-executed one will attract more organic traffic, phone calls, leads and, ultimately, more customers.



Related: How PR and SEO Can Converge to Supercharge Your Online ExposureA few optimization essentials:


Be sure to fill out every part of the profile, including business name, address, phone number and hours of operation (all information should be consistent with what's on your website and other online listings).Choose the most accurate category to describe your enterprise, and add relevant attributes regarding other important details.Consider including high-quality photos or videos of the physical space and products or services. Profiles with photos receive more clicks and calls.Solicit more Google reviews: Encourage customers to leave comments on your profile. Not only does this improve engagement, but it also sends positive SEO signals to Google, meaning potentially higher search results placement.List services or products, including detailed descriptions and pricing.Incorporate booking and/or reservations: If your business takes appointments, integrate booking options (such as Calendly).Keep information updated: Make sure to update your profile to reflect any changes in hours, contact information, services, etc.2. Create localized contentMost small businesses target a specific geographic area — whether they realize it or not. With that in mind, it's wise to have regionally specific website content to attract relevant traffic, including keywords indicating a particular service area. Consider, for example, geo-specific terms that describe your company, then validate that they receive actual search volume (using a tool like Semrush) and apply them on site pages (including titles and descriptions) according to on-page SEO best practices.Related: 4 Ways to Win at Local Content Marketing3. Placement in local directoriesThere are, of course, other online listings and resources that can earn you organic traffic. These include (but are not limited to) Bing Places for Business, Yelp, The Real Yellow Pages (aka YP), Better Business Bureau, Foursquare and MerchantCircle. You might also find directories specific to your service area, such as the local chamber of commerce.In the process, avoid spammy directories, which can be vehicles for unauthorized/unwanted traffic, including malware. These are often characterized by outdated web design, overwhelming pop-up ads, promises for ""links"" in exchange for a fee and a lack of moderation.


4. Social media ""check-ins""You might not consider Instagram a ""local"" platform, but with its location-tagging feature, it can be! By encouraging customers to ""check in"" on social media, you can attract potential customers from the area and/or gain more likes or follows, both valuable assets. Any business can benefit from such efforts, especially smaller ones that depend on limited traffic.One creative way to encourage customers to engage is by creating an on-site Instagrammable spot or some other kind of selfie station. Ask visitors to tag your location and include a photo with their posts.Related: 5 Reasons Why Your Brand Needs a Strong Social Media Presence5. YouTube marketingThis video colossus has more than two billion users, and just like most other online platforms, people use keywords to search it. You can boost YouTube's organic reach to your company by posting engaging content that provides true value. With the right optimization, it will generate hundreds to thousands of new views and new customers. Concepts could include the story of your business's foundation, testimonials from happy customers, product demonstrations and tutorials, local events or Q&A sessions with other business owners or thought leaders.

70,How to Get Your Business Noticed (and How to Brag About It),"Dec 7, 2023",Cynthia Kay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-brag-about-your-business-accomplishments/465818,"
Companies all across the country are doing great work that goes unnoticed. Why? There are many reasons. Some businesses don't like to brag about their accomplishments. They don't apply for awards that might put them in the spotlight because they don't want to be seen as boastful or conceited.It's great to be humble, but recognition is important to be known as an expert in your field. And who doesn't want that? Let's face it: no one wants to work with an average company. We all want to do business with innovators, those who continuously improve and push the limits.So, how do you get appropriate bragging rights? Get noticed for your work? Generate positive word of mouth and establish your ""brand promise?""Related: 20 Ways to Master Your Personal Brand on LinkedIn in 2024 and BeyondAwards that build credibilityAwards are one way to differentiate your business. However, I learned early on that to get noticed, you must do something truly award-worthy. I like awards that demonstrate business results. For example, I sit on the Michigan Celebrates Small Business (MSCB) board, a 501c3 that awards the 50 Companies to Watch. These are high-potential, second-stage companies that demonstrate excellence and support the economy.



Industry or supplier awards are also impressive. An industry group or professional organization usually sponsors these awards. They show that the work is excellent and noteworthy compared to your peers. Before you apply for any award, do your homework. What do you know about the sponsoring organization? Are the criteria specific and understandable? Is there a rigorous process? Are the judges independent experts or individuals who will simply select their buddies? Does the list of past winners include well-known and respected companies? If so, you might want to apply.Finally, there are community awards. Many non-profits recognize individuals and companies that ""do good"" and help advance their programs or mission. Using your skills and your company's resources for these non-profits can provide visibility. However, I believe this should not be your goal. Give without expecting anything back, and don't do it unless you really care about the organization. If you are honored for your efforts, accept the accolades humbly.Related: The Secret to Winning Awards for Publicity and CredibilityContent that gets you noticedHere are a few tips for making your award application stand out. Avoid boring, typical information. No one cares about detailed historical information. Instead, focus on what others will consider remarkable. Did you develop something avant-garde? Have you managed to find a simple solution to a complex problem? Are you starting or defining a whole new industry? Be creative and tell a story. It takes time and attention to apply for awards. I spend as much time writing an award application as on a client project. Sure, it's lots of work, but it is also a great way to showcase what you can do and be recognized as a leader. If you aren't going to do the hard work it takes to win, don't bother.


My company was asked to apply for — and won — the Woman Owned Small Business Supplier of the Year from Siemens in 2018. It was a great honor. Over the years, we have won five Telly Awards, which ""honor excellence in television and video across all screens."" In 2023, we won our sixth Gold Telly for a documentary titled ""A Story to Remember"" about a woman's dementia journey. These awards, and many others, have helped our team be recognized for work that we love to do. (See, that is how you brag.)One thing to note: an award is not an award is not an award. Some are just vanity awards. This year, I was told I could be ""An Inspiring Woman Leader"" for $1800, an ""Admired Leader"" for $1500 or a ""Top 10 Influential Leader"" for a mere $900. I know individuals who take advantage of these promotional opportunities, and I do not judge. However, I like to stick to awards that have substance. Not those that are pay-to-play.Related: Winning Small Business Awards Can Boost Your Company's Credibility. Here's How to Get Started.Spread the wordIt shows staying power when you are consistently recognized, and you should capitalize on the news.


Today, social media and online communities can help spread the word. But it is not just going to happen. You need to have an established social network and understand what you want to be known for in advance. You can blog or share content you have aggregated on relevant communication channels. Then, when you do win a big award or get noticed, people will promote and share that news on your behalf. Be sure you make these announcements on time.There are also some simple ways to pass along the news and brag. Add an announcement to your company phone greeting. Put a tagline on the bottom of your e-mail signature or other digital communications saying ""The Winner of..."" Add it to your website or Facebook page if you get press coverage. You want the information to live on beyond the initial announcement.Knowing how to go after important recognition awards and then leverage them can impact your business in the long term. It adds credibility as you expand your reach into new markets. It boosts employee morale and pride. And, if you are looking to position your business for an acquisition, merger or sale, the goodwill you get from recognition makes your firm more desirable and saleable.So, start applying for awards, and when you win, go ahead and brag. It's not a bad thing.

71,What's the Best Social Media Influencer Option for Your Business?,"Dec 7, 2023",Dmitrii Khasanov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-work-with-these-4-different-kinds-of-influencers/465816,"
The landscape of influencer marketing has undergone a great transformation in recent years. No longer tethered to the allure of celebrity endorsements and macro-influencers boasting millions of followers, brands are now gravitating towards nano- and micro-influencers, armed with smaller but fervently engaged audiences.The key to forging authentic connections with consumers lies in partnering with content creators who deliver visibility, genuine endorsement and effective advocacy. Marketers have shifted their focus, acknowledging that the quality of engagement trumps the sheer size of an influencer's following.Navigating the influencer marketing world to find the ideal match for your brand can be daunting for marketers. Let's delve into the intricacies of selecting the right influencer for your business needs.



Nano-influencers: The community connectorsWith follower counts typically below 10,000, nano-influencers excel in fostering genuine connections within tight-knit communities. Unlike mega-influencers, they prioritize personalized interactions, responding authentically to comments and messages. Their recommendations feel like friendly advice, often collaborating with local businesses to provide relatable reviews.Nano-influencers stand out for their authenticity, as they haven't yet reached the celebrity status that can dilute genuineness. Brands are recognizing the power of micro-communities, shifting towards targeted influencer marketing. These community connectors bridge the gap between brands and specialized audiences, proving that in the era of authenticity, smaller followings can have a more significant impact on community building and trust.


Pros:High authenticity in engagements.Cost-effective and affordable partnerships.Direct and personal communication channels.Easy-to-reach influencers.Cons:Limited audience reach.Potentially less polished content.Primarily organic growth, with a slower scale.Best for: Localized promotions, niche products, and community-driven campaigns.Related: Influencer Marketing 101: A Blueprint for Running a Successful Campaign


Micro-influencers: The engaged enthusiastsWith 10,000 to 100,000 followers, micro-influencers are niche experts, captivating dedicated audiences with their specialized focus. Balancing reach and engagement, they provide in-depth content, connecting intimately with followers through valuable insights.Collaborating with brands aligned with their niche, micro-influencers offer authentic endorsements, leveraging their perceived expertise. Their recommendations carry weight, making them influential tastemakers within their specific domain. Micro-influencers blend trust with a substantial reach, offering a strategic middle ground for brands seeking diverse yet engaged audiences. In a content-saturated digital environment, they stand out as trusted guides, showcasing the impactful role of a focused and knowledgeable approach in shaping consumer trends.Pros:Easy-to-reach influencers.Strong connection with their audience.Higher engagement rates.A balance of reach and authenticity.Cons:


Still limited to mid-tier reach.Platform-specific influence.Varied content quality standards.Best for: Brands targeting specific hobbies, emerging products, and authentic narratives.Related: 5 Things You Should Know Before Collaborating With An InfluencerMacro-influencers: The broad spectrum voicesWith followers ranging from 50,000 (or 100,000 sometimes) to a million, macro-influencers act as bridge figures, connecting reach with niche expertise. Positioned between micro and mega-influencers, they bring a unique dynamic to influencer marketing. Macro-influencers offer a balance, possessing a significant following while often maintaining a specialized focus. Their content resonates across a broad spectrum, capturing the attention of diverse audiences while still catering to specific interests.This tier of influencers collaborates with various brands, making them versatile partners for companies seeking a mix of reach and targeted impact. Their content often reflects a polished and professional image, adding a touch of aspirational appeal to their recommendations.


Pros:Broad exposure to varied audiences.Professional approach to collaborations.Established reputation in their domain.Cons:Relatively higher collaboration fees.Potential for a diluted personal connection with followers.More pronounced competition among brands for partnerships.Best for: Established brands, diverse audience campaigns, and larger product launches.Related: How Influencer Marketing Took Power, and What the Future Holds


Mega-influencers: The digital titansWith over a million followers, mega-influencers stand as digital titans, commanding vast territories of influence across social media platforms. Their reach is extremely high, making them key players in shaping trends, opinions, and consumer behaviors. These influencers often transcend specific niches, appealing to a broad and diverse audience. With a celebrity-like status, mega-influencers can turn products into trends and shape the cultural zeitgeist. Their endorsements can lead to widespread recognition and catapult brands into the mainstream.Mega-influencers collaborate with major brands and participate in high-profile campaigns, leveraging their massive following to amplify messages. While their content may exude a polished and aspirational vibe, the challenge lies in maintaining a genuine connection with such a large audience.Pros:Extremely high reach across regions.High-quality content production.Amplified brand visibility.Cons:


Premium collaboration costs.Time-consuming collaboration (can't deliver results right here and right now)Hard-to-reach influencers (sometimes it involves communications of different levels)Potential disconnects from individual followers.Scrutiny and higher public relations considerations.Best for: Luxury and global brands, mass audience campaigns, and trendsetting initiativesInfluence marketing is a great tool in the strategic marketing strategies of companies and brands of varying sizes. Collaborating with bloggers and opinion leaders facilitates the conveyance of information about goods and services and the spreading of business values. However, the success of an entire marketing campaign involving influencers hinges on the meticulous selection of the right social media blogger.

Elon Musk has never been one to hold back when it comes to his critics, but the latest live interview with the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX could be considered over the top — even for him.At the 2023 DealBook Summit in New York on Wednesday, Musk spoke to journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin about the mass exodus of big-name advertisers from X (formerly known as Twitter) due to antisemitic content reportedly published on the platform.Related: Elon Musk Says Remote Work Is 'Morally Wrong'""If somebody's going to try to blackmail me with advertising?

75,How Modern Technology is Rewriting the Rules of Marketing,"Nov 29, 2023",Christopher Tompkins,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-social-media-and-modern-technology-are-rewriting-the/465449,"
Ads look a little different in today's world than they did in 2013, and it's all thanks to the innovative minds of marketers and professionals who saw the changing marketing landscape and found new ways to adapt and refine their work.So, with that said, let's take a look at some of the biggest trends and tools that have emerged in the last decade and how they've shaped today's digital marketing space.Social media and search engines have become a stapleFirst up, we have the (in)famous social media platforms. These have become every extrovert's dream and connected billions of people together. In the marketing world, these spaces have provided businesses with a stage to strut their stuff.



Sure, social media was big in 2013, but today's social media blows it out of the water. Take Facebook, for example. It remains the largest social media platform today, just as it did a decade ago. Here's the difference: in 2013, Facebook had 1.2 billion users. Today, it has over three billion.Unsurprisingly, this massive growth of users has also led to social media ad spending skyrocketing from an estimated $4.1 billion in 2013 to over $72 billion in 2023. Along with a rise in the number of users, social media platforms also provide advertisers with more ways than ever to interact with their audiences. For example, stories and short-form videos have become pivotal, providing brands with immersive ways to engage their audience.


Next is SEO. Remember the days when finding information was like searching for a needle in a haystack? Thanks to the evolution of search engines, today, if you need to find the best tacos in town, you can simply ""Google it.""The practice of search engine optimization has grown in importance as businesses strive to optimize their online presence and rank higher in search engine results. This visibility is crucial — can you even remember the last time you looked at the second page of a Google search?Without SEO, your website might as well be hiding in plain sight, and we all know how well that works out.It's not just about keywords and metadata — marketers need to grasp the nuances of voice search, featured snippets, and mobile-friendliness to maintain a competitive edge in the digital realm.


That brings me to my last point in this section: mobile optimization.It's a phone's world and we just live in it!In the last decade, mobile devices have become more than just another piece of tech — they have become the centers of our universe. With the mobile-first approach, marketers have had to adapt to a world where screens are small and attention spans are even smaller.The key to success? Responsive design, user-friendly mobile apps, and embracing the thumb-scrolling generation.Related: 6 Free Tools That Help Optimize Your WebsiteTraditional marketing has moved to digitalThe power of digital PR is also something that cannot be ignored. Remember when PR was all press releases, phone calls, and snazzy press events?Well, in walked the digital space, where PR has transformed into managing online reputations, securing backlinks, and crafting compelling narratives that capture customer's attention while scrolling. This opened many doors for businesses to connect with their audience on a more personal level.Moving from print ads to digital ads allowed brands to reach a variety of highly specific audiences in a short amount of time - something that has truly revolutionized marketing in the last decade. The term more for less stands true in this instance.


Now, brands can have successful digital PR campaigns involving influencer collaborations or virtual conferences at the click of a button instead of fighting to be on the front page of the newspaper.Related: 10 Marketing Strategies to Fuel Your Business GrowthContent marketing has become crucialLast but definitely not least is content marketing. Content marketing has transformed from mere blog posts and newsletters into a full-blown art form in the past decade. It's not just about creating content; it's about telling compelling stories through podcasts or live shows.Whether it's an engaging video, an informative infographic, or a heartwarming blog, content is king, and creativity is your crown. With this reliance on connectivity — trust has moved to the front of every consumer's mind.


If you want to build trust — you better be prepared to prove it. We have learned in the last decade that our audience won't just take our word for fact anymore. They want to see the proof in the pudding. Customers demand the truth, and they can sniff out dishonesty from a mile away. So, be open about your brand, products, and values. Authenticity is the name of the game, and consumers appreciate it more than ever.This means every strategy should be hyper-focused on personalization. Gone are the days of generic, one-size-fits-all marketing campaigns. Now, it's all about making your customers feel like each message was created just for them.Using data, we can personalize our marketing efforts to each customer, delivering a more unique and tailored experience. This not only improves customer satisfaction but also drives more sales and revenue for businesses.

76,"5 Tips to Grow Your X Followers From 0 to 10,000","Nov 28, 2023",Nick Zviadadze,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/5-tips-to-grow-your-x-followers-from-0-to-10000/465205,"
X.com (formerly Twitter) is a great platform for building an online presence, solidifying your authority and finding quality leads. Still, many entrepreneurs don't realize the potential this platform can bring, either because they're uninformed or can't figure out how to use it effectively.I began my X.com journey in November last year. In less than a year, I grew my profile from zero to more than 12,000 followers. Now, I want to share what I've learned in the process.Let's explore the five strategies I've used to grow my X.com presence, form connections, establish authority and generate more leads for my business.Related: How I Grew My Twitter Following in 30 Days With Just 30 Minutes of Use Each DayIs X.com a good platform to generate leads for your business?X.com is still relevant for generating quality leads. In a recent update, X's CEO Linda Yaccarino revealed that the platform now boasts over half a billion unique monthly users. This impressive user base solidifies X.com as a perfect platform where you can build your brand, establish your expertise and even generate new leads.



Below, we'll talk about the five exact tips I used to grow my X.com following to 12,000 within a year and how you can do the same.Here's how you can use X.com to get more followers and leads:1. Focus on youOne of the common mistakes I see entrepreneurs make on X.com is creating a company profile and adopting a corporate persona to talk to your audience. Nobody wants to read content from faceless corporations. Instead, users seek authentic experiences and stories they can relate to.You need to focus on building a personal brand to connect with your audience and attract more leads. Be yourself, share genuine experiences, and tell your unique story. That way, more people will want to engage with you, and you'll generate more leads.


2. Pre-load your profileMost entrepreneurs getting started on X.com delay publishing new content because they don't have an audience. But how do you gain an audience without quality content?The answer is you can't. So, a smart strategy is to pre-load your X.com profile with quality tweets and threads. That way, when people visit your profile, they can instantly see the value you bring to the table, which makes them more likely to follow you.In addition, you need to optimize your profile with a clear and engaging bio that explains what you do and why people should follow you. You should also add an eye-catching cover image and pin a tweet thread that showcases the content that people can expect from your profile. That helps show what you're all about from the get-go and is more likely to convert profile visitors into followers.Related: Why It's Important to Incorporate Twitter Into Your Business's Marketing Plan


3. Create native contentIf you want to make the most out of X.com, you need to create content native to the platform. Nobody wants to read the same old articles from your company's blog or posts from other social media platforms. X.com users seek fresh insights and unique tweets tailor-made for this platform.The good thing about X.com is that you can quickly figure out what type of content has the most potential to go viral and generate more engagement.A great way to do this is to find influencers in your niche and see what content performs the best. Then, you can use it as an inspiration to create something similar but add your unique spin.For example, if you're in the digital marketing world, you can observe top tweets from leading influencers to see how much traction they create. Maybe it's a quick marketing tip or a tweet thread showcasing their recent case study. Use this insight to design tweets and threads showcasing your experience and perspective to engage the X.com audience effectively.


4. Use tweet threadsTweet threads are a series of connected tweets that allow users to share longer, more detailed content. That's a great way to overcome X's word count limit, share longer stories, provide insights or offer step-by-step guides.Tweet threads are the best way to engage your audience, create viral content and generate more leads. That's why you need to focus on creating value-packed threads and do it as often as possible.To create a quality tweet thread that can go viral, you need to:Create valuable, action-packed contentUse an excellent hook to grab attentionAdd screenshots for visualsUse copywriting techniques to keep people readingInclude a clear call to action to let the audience know how you can help5. Build connectionsBuilding an organic audience on X.com is vital to bringing in more leads. The trick is to connect with people who are actively engaged on the platform because otherwise, you won't get meaningful results.The best way to stay active and build connections is to find influencers in your niche and engage with their content. Always be the first to comment and share your insights.This will help you create and foster authentic relationships, which is vital for establishing that initial audience.Related: You are Missing Out if You Don't Use Twitter. Here's 3 Reasons WhyIn summary, X.com is still a great platform to build your online presence and drive more qualified leads to your business.To do that, you need to focus on building a personal brand, pre-loading your profile with content, creating content native to the X.com platform, using tweet threads effectively and making genuine connections.These practices helped me gain over 12,000 followers in less than a year, and they can do the same for you.

77,How Social Media Is Accelerating the Path to Thought Leadership Fame,"Nov 16, 2023",AJ Kumar,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-social-media-can-accelerate-the-path-to-thought/465115,"
I grew up going to Satsang, a traditional Indian religious activity where millions of people, including my family, would seek the opinion and advice from a spiritual guru (similar to a pope) on how to live life. This early and frequent exposure to the guru-follower dynamic sparked my lifelong fascination with what makes a guru so influential.After dropping out of college, I carved out a career helping business leaders and entrepreneurs position themselves as gurus and thought leaders in their respective niches. I've worked directly with renowned gurus across diverse industries — from marketing guru, Neil Patel, to nutrition and wellness guru, Kimberly Snyder.Through my work behind the scenes, I've discovered that a guru is more than just an expert in their field. True gurus attract almost cult-like followings of devoted students who cling to their every word. Their teachings, frameworks and philosophies are embraced as absolute truth. Their followers don't just casually admire them, they feel an almost spiritual connection and loyalty.



So, what does it take to achieve this elite, almost holy status of a guru?Related: So You Want to Be a Thought Leader? Here are 5 Steps to Take


The influencer hierarchyEvery industry has an influencer hierarchy. To become a guru, you must move up the ladder:Generalist: Jack of all trades, master of none. Basic knowledge across disciplines.Specialist: Influencer focused narrowly on one field or topic. Advanced niche knowledge.Authority: Trusted and respected influencer in a specific niche. Known locally in their niche.Guru: Renowned thought leader with a devoted following of disciples. Seen as a foremost authority.Guru's Guru: The rare thought leader who mentors other top influencers. The coach of industry titans.The key to reaching guru status is becoming a definitive authority and celebrity in a tightly defined micro-niche. You provide immense value by intensely focusing on solving specific problems for a well-defined audience.For example, a cardiologist specializes solely in heart health. They have dedicated their career to becoming experts in cardiac care. Patients seek out cardiologists specifically for their precise niche knowledge. A cardiologist offers more advanced expertise in heart health than a general practitioner.


But it's not enough to just be a specialist or authority. To become a guru, you must establish yourself as a household name — someone who immediately comes to mind when people think of your niche.Below are the steps to rise up to guru status.Related: How to Showcase Your Expertise and Become a Thought LeaderHow to rise up to guru statusCreate a signature origin story and persona. Let your personality and backstory shine through. Use storytelling to build an emotional connection with your audience.Consistently produce free, high-value content like blogs, videos and podcasts. Provide incredible value consistently over time to draw in followers.Develop unique frameworks, teachings, philosophies and catchphrases. Give your students something proprietary to latch onto and make their own.Interact regularly with your audience through your content and messaging. Build familiarity, trust and a personal connection.Take bold, controversial stances that resonate with devotees but also polarize others. Don't be afraid to be provocative.Blend complimentary niches together so you can create diverse areas of interest beyond your core focus, making you more multi-faceted and interesting, while still benefiting from the focus that niching down provides.Foster an exclusive, tight-knit community around your brand. Make followers feel special and part of an inner circle of insiders.Encourage students to become evangelists. Equip your followers to organically spread the word about you.Strategically partner with existing well-known gurus to inherit their followers and credibility.Create predictable rituals, imagery and behaviors that define your persona. Be recognizable.Host live events like conferences that let followers engage with you in person.Most importantly, focus on differentiation and developing true thought leadership. Successful gurus build devoted followings based on the immense value they provide — not slick marketing or gimmicks. Their reputation naturally drives opportunities like book deals, speaking engagements, consulting and lucrative partnerships.Related: The Journey From Expert to Guru Is 3 Simple-But-Powerful Steps


Becoming a guru is just the first step. To then become a guru's guru, you must make another shift — from being a leader in your industry to being a leader for your industry. This is when you ascend to the highest echelon, becoming like an Oprah, Ellen, or Martha Stewart of your field. A guru's guru wields tremendous influence. This level of thought leadership notoriety is so powerful that it can grant access even to the president's office.The rise of social media has dramatically accelerated the path to guru status. In the past, building wide public awareness required extensive mainstream publicity, time, money and connections. Now, anyone can leverage digital platforms and niche communities to organically establish thought leadership within a fraction of the time. With people spending an average of 2.5 hours a day on social media, there is ample time to watch hundreds of videos and carve out a niche. If you want to be seen and heard, social platforms provide that opportunity through consistent engagement. The key is simply being consistent — regularly creating content that provides value and builds your authority over time.The guru path isn't for everyone. It requires intense focus, a tireless work ethic and an almost fanatical devotion from followers. It's not just about being a ""generalist"" influencer who snaps pictures of a luxury lifestyle, but about positioning yourself as the leading voice in your niche. Create binge-worthy content that keeps followers constantly engaged and coming back. Interact with your audience to foster a connection. In time, you too can enjoy the fame, influence and abundant opportunities of a celebrated guru.

Wikipedia founder, Jimmy Wales, has strongly criticized X, formerly known as Twitter, following its recent acquisition by Elon Musk.Speaking to CNBC at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Wales expressed his concern over the social media platform, claiming that it has been ""overrun by trolls and lunatics."" He also highlighted the decline in user engagement on X compared to previous years.Image Credit: Horacio Villalobos | Getty Images. Wikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales.Related: Elon Musk's Twitter 2.0: 'Long Hours, High Intensity' for WorkersWhen asked about the impact of Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter on the social media landscape, Wales stated: ""It's a huge problem.""



Wales said thoughtful and serious users are abandoning the platform due to the increasing presence of trolls and inappropriate content. He emphasized that Twitter has been the default public square for people around the world, but the current state of the platform is detrimental to everyone.Millions of users have left X following Musk's takeover. According to data from market intelligence firm Similarweb, X's global website traffic dipped 14% year over year in September, and U.S. traffic fell by 19% in the same period.This latest statement from Wales adds to the growing conflict between the founder and Musk, which started last year when Musk accused Wikipedia of having ""a non-trivial left-wing bias,"" per CNBC. The dispute arose from a debate among Wikipedia editors about removing the platform's entry on the Twitter Files.These files were cited by Musk as evidence of biased content moderation against conservatives under the prior management of Twitter. Despite the controversy, Wikipedia opted to keep the entry, as the platform relies on a community of volunteers to maintain its content.

So I didn't really respond to that.""Wales clarified that what Musk perceives as censorship, Wikipedia views as thoughtful editorial judgment. He concluded by saying, ""Elon will be Elon.""Earlier this year, Wales launched Trust Cafe, his alternative to X. Describing it as a ""pilot project,"" he aims to create a community of trustworthy individuals. This platform seeks to provide a quality user experience based on content trustworthiness, rather than virality, and is not ad-supported, per CNBC.

This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, is finally getting his own movie.The biopic is in development at A24 – the indie studio that made ""Moonlight"" and ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" — with Darren Aronofsky set to direct, according to a report by Variety.



Aronofsky is the Oscar-nominated director of films including ""The Whale"" and ""Black Swan.""The film will apparently be based on Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk published earlier this year. Isaacson shadowed the Tesla and SpaceX CEO for two years for the book, including during his chaotic acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter.


People are already speculating about who could play the controversial billionaire, with Reddit threads and social media buzzing with suggestions. Here are the top picks.Rami MalekTheo Wargo/Getty Images via BIRami Malek, best known for his Oscar-winning performance as Freddie Mercury in ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" is a social media favorite for the role.


Michael FassbenderGisela Schober/Getty Images via BIMichael Fassbender has worked with Walter Isaacson's material before. The actor played Steve Jobs in a 2015 biopic based on Isaacson's biography of the Apple cofounder, which earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination.Robert Downey Jr.Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images via BIRobert Downey Jr. has been floated as a prime contender for the role on both Reddit and X.

Oscar award-winning Cage is the top-voted suggestion on one Reddit thread. He's playing a very Nicholas Cage-type character in the film ""Dream Scenario"" that's just been released.Jesse EisenbergGetty Images via BIJesse Eisenberg is a popular but most likely a troll suggestion given he famously played Musk's arch rival Mark Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network.""


Chris PrattJamie McCarthy/Getty Images via BIChris Pratt has also been suggested by some for the role – presumably just because he's Chris Pratt.Mads MikkelsenJoel C.

Damon is also an Academy Award-winner, but not for his acting: he and Ben Affleck co-wrote the screenplay for ""Good Will Hunting,"" in 1997 and picked up an Oscar in the process.

83,Why This Business Metric is Crucial to Understanding Your Business,"Nov 10, 2023",Ross Kernez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/understanding-cac-the-cornerstone-of-business-economics/464496,"
In the intricate world of business metrics, some indicators take precedence due to their direct correlation with the viability and growth of a business. One such crucial metric is CAC or Customer Acquisition Cost. Delving deep into its significance, calculation and impact can provide a clearer perspective on a company's health and long-term prospects.Defining CACCustomer Acquisition Cost, commonly called CAC, represents the cost of acquiring a new customer. In simpler terms, it answers the question: ""How much does it cost the company to gain one new customer?""It encompasses all the costs related to marketing and sales - from advertising spend and salaries of the marketing team to the cost of creating content and tools used for marketing automation. CAC is important for the following reasons:



Financial Health Check: If the cost to acquire a new customer (CAC) is higher than the value that the customer brings to the company (Customer Lifetime Value or CLTV), the company is, in essence, losing money every time they gain a new customer.Resource Allocation: By understanding CAC, businesses can make informed decisions about allocating resources in their marketing and sales strategies.Growth Perspective: A sustainable CAC indicates that a company can scale its operations and customer base without depleting its resources.Investor Relations: Investors and stakeholders keep a keen eye on CAC as it gives them insight into the company's growth potential and operational efficiency.Related: How to Balance Profits With Purpose at Your BusinessHow to calculate CACThe formula for CAC is quite straightforward: CAC= CA/MCWhere:MC is the total marketing and sales costs for a specific period.CA is the number of new customers acquired during that same period.For instance, if a company spent $10,000 on marketing in a month and acquired 100 customers in that same month, the CAC would be $100. These factors influence CAC:Industry Type: Certain industries, like luxury goods or niche software, naturally have a higher CAC due to the nature of the market and competition.Business Model: Subscription-based models might have a higher initial CAC but gain more in terms of Customer Lifetime Value.Target Audience: Targeting a broad audience can drive up advertising costs without a proportional increase in conversions, leading to a higher CAC.Marketing Channels: Some channels, like content marketing, may have a lower CAC compared to paid advertisements.Product Pricing: Expensive products might require more touchpoints and prolonged marketing efforts, thus increasing CAC.Related: 10 Marketing Strategies to Fuel Your Business GrowthCAC in relation to LTV (Lifetime Value)CAC doesn't exist in a vacuum. Its real value comes out when juxtaposed with Customer Lifetime Value (LTV). LTV represents the total revenue a company expects to earn from a single customer throughout their relationship.


For a business to be viable: LTV>CACIdeally, the LTV should be at least three times the CAC for a company to have a healthy balance for growth and profit.Improve Conversion Rates: By enhancing the user experience, offering clear value propositions and optimizing landing pages, businesses can get more customers from their existing traffic, thus reducing CAC.Leverage Content Marketing: Organic reach through content marketing often has a lower CAC compared to paid channels.Referral Programs: Encouraging current customers to refer friends can lower CAC as the marketing cost for these acquisitions is usually less.Optimize Ad Spend: Regularly assess and adjust advertising campaigns to ensure they target the right audience and offer a good ROI.Retain Customers: Increasing customer retention can increase LTV, providing more room for a higher CAC if necessary.Customer Acquisition Cost is more than just a metric — it's a mirror reflecting the efficiency of a company's marketing and sales efforts. While it's essential to invest in acquiring customers, it's equally crucial that this investment leads to profitable outcomes.Balancing CAC with LTV, continually optimizing marketing strategies, and keeping a pulse on industry trends ensures businesses can grow sustainably. Understanding, calculating and acting upon CAC remains a steadfast cornerstone of operational success in the ever-evolving digital business landscape.


Customer Acquisition Cost doesn't just act as a gauge; it's the lifeblood that determines the sustainability and scalability of business strategies. In today's competitive market, where customer preferences shift rapidly and new competitors emerge almost daily, a company's ability to maintain a healthy CAC becomes its shield against volatile market forces.Furthermore, metrics like CAC provide actionable insights in an age dominated by data, allowing businesses to pivot and adapt in real time. This agility, powered by a deep understanding of CAC, enables companies to stay ahead of the curve, seize new opportunities and mitigate challenges.Yet, it's essential to remember that CAC isn't just about numbers. At its core, it's about understanding the value of human relationships in business. Every dollar spent in CAC is an investment in building a connection, fostering trust and creating lasting relationships with customers. This holistic perspective ensures businesses don't merely chase lower CAC for short-term gains but strategize for long-term growth and loyalty.In the intricate tapestry of business metrics, CAC stands out not just as a measure but as a philosophy, guiding businesses toward both profitability and meaningful customer engagement.

That looks like it hurt!Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed on Instagram and Threads (both of which he owns) that he had ACL surgery on his knee last week — and recovery is proving to be a challenge.Zuck told followers he suffered the injury while practicing MMA in his backyard for an upcoming fight.Related: Mark Zuckerberg Rents Out Private Arena for MMA Fight""I was training for a competitive MMA fight early next year, but now that's delayed a bit,"" he said. ""Still looking forward to doing it after I recover. Thanks to everyone for the love and support.""

""My fighter started 39 years old, but turns out every time you lose your fighter needs 9 months to recover from injuries plus time to get a new fight and then training camp,"" he explained. ""I chose the hardest difficulty and found myself sitting here at the peak of post-surgery pain with my fighter 0-8, almost 54 years old, still trying to get his first win in the UFC.""A classic case of life imitating art.Zuck's long since been a fan of martial arts (he rented out the entire UFC APEX in Las Vegas for a match in 2022, after all) but has been taking the sport more seriously as of late.Related: Mark Zuckerberg Posts Shirtless Photo After MMA TrainingThis past May, the billionaire won a gold medal in his first-ever Jiu-Jitsu competition in Woodside, California.""MMA is the perfect thing,"" Zuckerberg told host Joe Rogan on an August 2022 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience.

85,8 Ways Social Media Use Can Backfire on Your Personal Branding,"Nov 9, 2023",Jon Michail,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/8-ways-social-media-use-can-backfire/464498,"
Personal branding is hot! Everyone wants to build their personal brand and grow their following on social media. But most go about it the wrong way, getting caught up in vanity metrics and quick hits of validation that don't lead to real success.Here's why chasing branding just for the sake of branding can backfire.1. Hooking followers is not the main goalA common mistake is thinking getting more followers or likes is the end game. But followers are not the same as fans. Just because someone clicks ""follow"" does not mean they truly value what you offer. They may just be vaguely curious or think you look attractive in photos. Maybe they followed back to be polite. But they are not necessarily engaged or loyal.



Authentic personal branding means cultivating true fans who eagerly await your next blog post, course or product. They champion you as friends because your work has impacted them.That's powerful branding — not just accumulating followers who barely know you. Chasing follower counts encourages taking shortcuts, including black hat tactics like fake connections. But meaningful connection requires consistent, quality work.


Related: 8 Reasons a Powerful Personal Brand Will Make You Successful2. Don't just play at being an influencerSome treat building a personal brand like playing dress-up. They emulate influencer photos without having in-depth knowledge to share. Content stays superficial because creating deep value is hard work. But those who put in the effort to truly master a niche can build an authority site or platform. That leads to collaborations, consultations, courses and other income streams. Faking it for the 'gram just won't cut it in the long run.To be sustainable, becoming an authentic influencer takes tremendous expertise, consistency and work ethic. It's not something you can fake your way into with stylized photos and curated aesthetics alone. True influencers dedicate themselves to providing real value, not just appearances.Related: Why Personal Branding Must Be Your First Focus


3. External validation feels good...But is fleetingGetting likes and positive comments provides a quick hit of dopamine. But these emotional highs are ephemeral. Once the notification buzz wears off, people feel empty again.In contrast, focusing on meaningful work provides a lasting sense of purpose and pride. Look for validation from within by creating content that contributes value to your field. That will sustain you much more than chasing outward validation from others.The validation that comes from creating something of value is deeper and longer-lasting than the fleeting rush of seeing likes roll in. Learn to notice your inner sense of satisfaction from a job well done.4. Personal branding has a dark sideAn obsessive focus on self-image has downsides. I've seen it firsthand with clients. Continually posing for selfies to show off perfect outfits or get flattering angles can damage self-esteem. Comparing your metrics to others breeds jealousy.


There are ethical concerns when income depends on followers buying things. The pressures of constantly creating, always being ""on"" for followers and monitoring engagement stats can be psychologically unhealthy. Balance personal branding efforts with other pursuits.The unending competition for likes and follows can quickly become addictive. Be mindful of when these activities start interfering with mental health or relationships. Remember, social media is an enabling tool. Use it smartly.Related: 7 Social Media Mistakes Every Brand Should Avoid5. Branding should not eclipse your purposeSome lose sight of why they started creating content in the first place — like sharing hard-won life lessons or helping others in their field. But their original purpose gets obscured by visions of internet fame and riches.


Staying true to your deeper ""why"" leads to more meaningful work. Keep perspective by asking if you'd still create without the personal brand attached. If sharing your message is what matters most, the right audience will eventually find you.Don't let the quest for branding overtake your core purpose. Start by identifying your intrinsic motivations for creating beyond money or followers. Keep asking yourself what unique value you offer and who you most want to help. Then, let that sincerity come through.6. Beware the hype around building a massive following'Gooroos' make it sound so easy — just strategically use hashtags, leverage influencer collaborations and you, too, can amass legions of fans. But behind the scenes, it often takes serious money, connections or black hat growth tactics.Building an engaged community organically around your specialized niche takes time. Scale your expectations and define success on your terms - not someone else's promises of internet riches.


You should focus on growth through consistently providing value, not buying followers or fake engagement.7. Form connections, not just followersNetworking to make strategic connections has value. But collecting superficial contacts just to boost numbers helps no one. Similarly, mentioning big names in your posts just to get on their radar looks desperate.Focus instead on forming mutually beneficial partnerships with those who align with your values and can expand your reach. Partner selectively rather than chasing every possible connection.Seek out collaborations that make sense by providing value to potential partners' audiences as well. Don't just pursue people for what they can do for you. Find ways to support others in your field authentically.


Related: Is Social Media Making You Less Social?8. Slow and steady brand building wins the raceConsistency and patience are key for organically growing a personal brand. Creating value and building authority in your niche can take years. There are no quick fixes or instant shortcuts.Remind yourself that lasting impact matters more than immediate metrics. Keep perspective by reflecting on how far you've already come. Your long-term progress is more important than any temporary setbacks or plateaus along the journey.In conclusion, focus on real relationshipsRather than chasing the temporary high of driving likes, comments, and follows, focus on developing real relationships with potential superfans. Create content that provides true value for them. Build trust by being authentic and delivering consistently over time.


A small, engaged audience that loves your work can become your tribe and spread your message further than a faceless mob of followers ever could. Nurture real connections - not just vanity metrics. The rest will follow.

87,9 Steps for Building a Reputation Management Plan That Wins Customers and Gives You an Edge,"Nov 7, 2023",Adam Petrilli,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/9-steps-for-building-a-reputation-plan-that-wins-customers/464457,"
As an entrepreneur, you probably already know that your company's reputation is one of your most valuable assets. In an era where information spreads like wildfire, your reputation can make or break your business in a hurry.This underscores the importance of a solid reputation management plan, something that can help you not only protect your brand but also leverage consumer sentiment to win more customers and gain a competitive edge.Below, I outline how to build a reputation management plan that will protect your business and set you up for success. Let's delve into the steps you can take to create a plan that will not only protect your brand but enhance your company's image and bottom line.



1. Define your brand identityBefore taking steps to manage your reputation, it's crucial to clearly define your brand identity. That means creating clear statements on what your business stands for, your core values and, critically, what sets you apart from competitors.Once you have a firm grasp on those core pillars of the brand and what your company is built on, you can better align your reputation management efforts with those principles.


2. Monitor your online presenceManaging your reputation effectively means tracking the online conversation surrounding your business. Generally, that includes setting up alerts and regularly monitoring social media platforms, review sites and news outlets for mentions of your company, when and wherever they pop up.Fortunately, there are various tools available (with varying degrees of reach and effectiveness) that can automate this process, making it easier to stay on top of the online chatter.Related: Is it Time to Strengthen Your Company's Reputation? Here's How to Get Your Online Image (and Reviews) Back on Track3. Turn positive experiences into positive reviewsPositive online feedback can be a powerful tool for cultivating trust and strengthening your online reputation. Bulking up your positive review presence starts by encouraging satisfied customers to leave reviews on platforms like Google, Yelp and the social media channels they enjoy the most.


It's also crucial to make it as easy as possible to leave great feedback. Providing links and reminders at important touchpoints can help facilitate this process. Responding to these reviews promptly and thanking customers for their feedback also goes a long way toward encouraging positive comments and praise in the future.4. Build a strategy for addressing negative feedbackIn business, negative feedback is inevitable. But how you respond to it can be a game changer, especially for the image you create across the web.When you come across negative reviews or comments online, it is essential not to ignore them or lash out in anger. Either can make the situation far worse in a hurry.Instead, focus on crafting a solutions-based review response framework–one centered on polite, professional responses that address customer concerns and seek resolution in every scenario. This shows not only that you care about customer satisfaction but have prioritized it as part of your customer service model and are willing to go the extra step to make things right.


5. Create content that strengthens your positionManaging your online reputation is about more than just tracking your brand and dealing with reviews. To really shape and control your online image, it's critical to create, share and promote quality content that touts your value and strengthens your credibility with customers.This includes blog posts, articles, videos and social media updates that can consistently reinforce your expertise and authority in your industry, as well as any content containing information that educates and inspires your target audience.6. Reach out to your audienceEngaging with customers is vital to building a positive reputation. On the surface, that means responding to comments and messages on social media. On a deeper level, it means publicly showing that you value customers' input and are willing to engage in meaningful conversations outside the customer service process.Conducting meaningful interactions with your audience helps humanize your brand while strengthening long-term connections between your business and your customers.


7. Create buy-in through authenticityFor a reputation management plan to work, you have to incorporate authenticity. Being honest about your products, services, company updates, and any challenges your business faces demonstrates your willingness to make consumers a trusted part of the brand journey.Transparency builds trust and buy-in with your audience, and customers are far more likely to forgive and support your business when you're upfront about where you've been, what you're doing, and what steps you plan to take down the road.8. Follow your competitors closelyTo build a reputation strategy that puts you on top, it's important to keep a close eye on your competitors' online behavior, interactions and sentiment. Understanding what's being said about the competition can provide unique, helpful insights into industry trends and what customers are looking for at any given moment. It can also help you identify areas where you can outshine the competition, allowing you to build on those strengths and maximize your advantage.Related: 4 Ways to Pull Ahead of Your Competitors in Business


9. Be ready for a crisisNo matter how well you monitor brand mentions or navigate online reviews, there will likely be a time when you face a PR crisis. This could be anything from a minor customer dust-up to something more substantial, such as a product recall, data breach or other public relations disaster.In any case, having a crisis management plan in place is essential, allowing you to identify potential crisis scenarios, outline a response strategy and empower a crisis management team to handle such situations quickly.Whatever you do, have a plan to protect your reputationIn our hyper-digital business landscape, a strong reputation management plan is not just recommended; it's essential. Your reputation affects your ability to attract and retain customers, differentiate yourself from competitors, and weather crises when they arise, and because of that utility, building an effective reputation strategy is more than worth the effort.

88,Elon Musk Wants X to Be a Financial Hub and Dating App,"Oct 30, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/elon-musk-wants-x-to-be-your-bank-stock-trader-matchmaker/464540,"
Elon Musk said he envisions X as the central hub for all financial needs, aiming to revolutionize how money is managed in daily life, The Verge reported.He plans to launch new features to make X an all-in-one financial center for users by the close of 2024, Musk reportedly told X employees during a call last Thursday. While Musk didn't disclose specific features, he has said in the past that he envisions X eventually offering debit cards, checks, and loans, ultimately becoming a ""high-yield money market account.""In the meeting, Musk emphasized that the concept of ""payments"" transcends mere transactions, but rather encompasses an individual's entire financial ecosystem.



""When I say payments, I actually mean someone's entire financial life,"" Musk said on an all-hands call on Thursday, according to audio obtained by The Verge. ""If it involves money. It'll be on our platform. Money or securities or whatever. So, it's not just like send $20 to my friend. I'm talking about, like, you won't need a bank account.""Related: Social Media App X Is Struggling to Attract Users — But Another Once-Beloved Platform Is Making an Unexpected Comeback


CEO Linda Yaccarino also expressed confidence in X's evolution on the call, considering it a substantial opportunity expected to be fully realized by 2024, per The Verge.X is currently in the process of acquiring the necessary licenses in individual U.S. states to provide banking or money transfer services, per Business Insider. Presently, the platform holds licenses in nine states (Arizona, Maryland, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Iowa, and Mississippi), per Coindesk. Is X Turning Into a Dating App? Musk also expressed enthusiasm that X will evolve into a ""fully fledged"" dating site by 2024, Business Insider reported. However, a source present for the call told the outlet that Musk did not delve into the specifics of how X would transition into a dating app, whether there was user demand for such features, or what other product changes might be enacted to facilitate this transformation.Still, Musk's ambitions for X in the coming year align with his previous statements about establishing X as an ""everything app,"" akin to the multifaceted apps prevalent in regions like China, such as WeChat, which provide extensive services from shopping to transportation.


""He wants people to pay for everything,"" one of the X sources on the call told Insider.Related: Twitter Just Got a Major New Feature — and Is One Step Closer to Becoming Elon Musk's 'Super App'

89,Why Brands Still Belong on Social Media Despite the Changing Landscape (and How They Can Leverage It for Greater Success),"Oct 30, 2023",Bryanne DeGoede,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-brands-still-belong-on-social-media-despite-the/463669,"
In the dynamic digital landscape, the role of social media is continually evolving. Today, an estimated 4.9 million people globally are on social media platforms, but the way we consume content, plus the content itself, has shifted significantly since the boom of these platforms in the late 2000s and early 2010s.Today, some argue that with the surge of influencers, brands may no longer hold their once-celebrated place on platforms like Instagram, Twitter or TikTok. Going a step further, with the substantial increase in advertising and sponsored content, many users have learned to tune out brands selling their products or services through social media.I've been helping my clients leverage social media for the past 15 years and have seen firsthand the shift in what kind of content performs well and what strategies and metrics actually translate to a higher ROI.



Ultimately, in this multifaceted digital playground, there's no denying that it's becoming harder and harder to capture an audience's attention. However, when brands can understand the platforms and how each user base reacts — and create authentic, relatable content — they can maximize their reach, improve brand awareness and perception, and build a consumer base that not only trusts your content but is excited to see it.Related: 7 Creative Ways to Boost Your Social Media Strategy


Metrics that matter: Going beyond follower countTo optimize your content, you first need to understand your objectives and what metrics are important for evaluating the success of your strategy. In the early days of social media, follower count was the main — if not, only — metric that brands cared about and agencies tracked consistently. Even just a few years ago, despite the rise of bot followers and purchased likes, a brand's clout could still be relatively gauged by its follower count.Today, however, this metric is becoming increasingly obsolete. Since TikTok came onto the scene with its personalized approach to user ""For You"" feeds, other platforms like Instagram and Snapchat have followed suit, integrating similar features into its platforms and mimicking TikTok's algorithm. With this shift, users no longer needed to be following an account to see its content — instead, the platform itself sorted through millions of posts to present a perfectly curated page of content for each user. These discovery pages often now have the highest user traffic and have ultimately reduced the user's need to ""follow"" individual pages.With the rise of these personalized recommended feeds, other metrics like views, engagement and reach have become better measures for audience resonance and brand perception overall. While followers will always be a relatively important measure of a brand's clout, understanding how your users are finding your content will help you tailor your posts for both new and existing followers.Creating your home baseConsider this: If someone hears about a brand, where's the first place they're likely to look? More often than not, they go to social media. A strong, consistent presence can legitimize a brand, enhancing its credibility. It's where customers come to ""window-shop"" — to learn more about the brand, its ethos and its offerings.


In a 2021 survey by Sprout Social, they found that 68% of consumers have actually purchased at least one product directly from social media. With the shift to ""for you"" pages as previously mentioned, social media is also becoming increasingly effective at introducing new products and brands to shoppers who otherwise wouldn't know about it. Plus, with the rise of affiliate marketing and social media shop features, a brand's social media profile has become an actual digital storefront, as your audience can purchase products directly through the app.In essence, social media profiles have become a brand's digital home base. As such, a poorly managed profile or one with just a few low-quality posts can raise red flags for potential customers and actually de-incentivize a purchase. Ensuring your social media pages are well-branded, consistently managed and polished will improve your chances of attracting and retaining customers long-term.Related: 10 Laws of Social Media MarketingThe way forward: Authenticity and collaborationUltimately, a brand's social media strategy should revolve around developing engaging content that provides a direct value to your target audience. These days, with hundreds of thousands of brands and creators all fighting for views, it can be difficult to know what to post. So, how should brands navigate this transformed landscape?


Storytell, don't oversell: Traditional advertising monologues won't cut it. While you can, of course, have posts about the benefits and details of your products, brands need to foster conversation and go beyond ad posts to build an actual persona that consumers want to connect with. Engage with followers, respond to comments, and be part of conversations that your audience is having.Collaborate authentically: Partner with influencers who genuinely align with the brand. It's not about getting the creator with the most followers, but about finding those whose audience will genuinely resonate with the brand's message and who will create high-quality content that your audience will love.Diversify content: Go beyond the up-close, photoshoot-quality product shots. Share genuine behind-the-scenes glimpses, customer testimonials or even relevant industry news with your brand's perspective. The goal is to offer value and keep the audience engaged with a variety of on-brand content that won't seem repetitive.Harness user-generated content (UGC): In the same way as word-of-mouth marketing, UGC is a valuable tool to provide credibility for the brand. In fact, a report by Stackla found that consumers were 2.4 times more likely to view UGC as authentic compared to content created by brands. Reposting and encouraging UGC not only provides authentic testimonials but also fosters community and shows customers that they're valued.While the landscape has shifted, counting brands out of the social media equation would be premature. Instead, the onus is on brands to evolve, re-strategize and leverage the platforms in ways that align with today's digital dynamics. By focusing on authenticity, building genuine collaborations and establishing a consistent digital presence, brands can not only remain relevant on social media but thrive.Related: Why It Is Crucial To Create Authentic Social Media Content

90,Why Subscription Models Will Be the New Normal for Social Media,"Oct 27, 2023",Christopher Tompkins,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-subscription-models-will-be-the-new-normal-for-social/463963,"
So far, we've all enjoyed free, ad-supported social media platforms, but that could be changing. Many platforms have seen their ad revenues drop due to several factors, and now they're looking to make some changes to their business model.Enter the subscription-based social media model. Today, let's explore what this model looks like and how it could change the future of social media.Related: The Business of Harnessing the Power of Social Media



The problems with ad-based social mediaAd-supported social media platforms are focused on one thing: generating revenue through targeted advertising and sponsored content. Thanks to their large user bases and complex targeting algorithms, ads have made these platforms extremely profitable over the last few years.However, this model isn't without its issues, including privacy concerns, prioritization of sponsored content over more relevant content to users, and a lack of transparency regarding user data usage. This leaves many users feeling unsafe on these apps.


In response, Apple released its App Tracking Transparency feature, which allows users to stop social media platforms from tracking them. While this was a great tool for users, social platforms like Facebook announced that they would end up taking a major ad revenue hit as a result.This was an existential threat to the ad-based social media business model, so it's no coincidence that they all started introducing paid subscriptions before long.Snapchat+, X Premium, Meta Verified and YouTube Premium — social media companies created these subscriptions to reduce their dependence on ad revenue. But what does this subscription-based model mean for marketers?Related: 4 Ways Meta-Verified Subscription Has Impacted Instagram


Understanding the subscription-based modelThe subscription-based model is a mixed bag for marketers, with some distinct advantages for brands that subscribe and major risks as more users buy in. Let's look at how this approach changes the digital marketing landscape.Ads will be less effective — For users, one of the biggest selling points of these premium social media subscriptions is often that they reduce or outright remove ads. It's great for users looking to free up some space on their feeds, but it could prove to be a major problem for marketers, leading to:Loss of target advertising will make it difficult for brands to reach their ideal customers efficiently and could limit their ROI. When platforms begin to remove ads from social feeds, brands lose the ability to reach that audience, making it almost impossible for marketers to reach their projected KPIs for paid campaigns.Increased reliance on organic reach — As audiences become harder to reach with paid ads, brands must rely more on organic reach to connect with them. This could get extremely competitive as it places brands on an even playing field with all other users on the platform. Tactics like influencer marketing will be key to reaching those premium users.


Challenges for small businesses with limited resources — Smaller brands may not have the budget to invest in influencer marketing or sponsored content, meaning they'll face an uphill battle to reach their audience.Related: 4 Influencer Marketing Secrets Entrepreneurs Need to KnowLeverage unique featuresOne of the upsides to the subscription model? To make these subscriptions worthwhile, social media platforms have a new incentive to develop new features for marketers and creators.Take X as an example. Before, verification check marks were reserved only for large, reputable accounts. Now, any brand subscriber can verify their account, unlocking longer character counts, formatting features, editing posts and more.


Of course, there's a dark side to this, too. You may recall a few months ago when TweetDeck, now known as X Pro, became locked behind the X Premium subscription after years of being free for all users.To stand out from the free versions of their platforms — these subscriptions need exclusive features such as verification, improved content moderation systems, enhanced customization options and more, even if that means making users pay for something that was once free.Related: Why You Should Use a Subscription Business ModelThe elephant in the roomThat's right, we have to talk about Elon Musk and his place in the subscription-model conversation. That's because while many platforms have introduced premium subscriptions, X is the only one that seems to be considering charging all users for access. Is that where every social platform is headed?


Short answer… no.It's hard enough to convince someone to pay for something that's always been free. Still, it's hard to see most users coughing up the cash when that something is X. It's true that the ad-supported social media model has weaknesses, but it's still a winning formula for making money.Beyond profit, there's also an ethical argument against charging all users for access to the platforms where they communicate. Not everyone can afford to pay a recurring fee for access to a social media platform.This raises questions about inclusivity and the risk of creating digital divides, where those who can't afford subscriptions are excluded from online communities — further deepening existing societal inequalities. For better or worse, social media has become a vital part of people's daily lives.


Any move towards charging users must be carefully considered and balanced with measures to ensure inclusivity and fairness. A subscription-based social media model has the potential to address many of the problems associated with ad-focused platforms, but it also has the potential to create entirely new problems.The only constant in social media is change, and that's still true now. Ultimately, the success of such a model will depend on its ability to deliver real value to users and build trust in a more transparent and ethical social media ecosystem.

92,Squash the Online Hate — A Business Owner's Guide to Taming Trolls on Social Media,"Oct 26, 2023",Ross Cameron,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/a-business-owners-guide-to-taming-trolls-on-social-media/463825,"
Working in an online space or being a public figure means you will be dealing with trolls. Even the most beloved public figures have people who inexplicably harass them. A Pew survey from a few years ago shows that 41% of Americans have experienced online harassment. I'd be willing to bet that when you talk about public figures, that number goes up to around 100%, as trolling has become so common in online culture.As somebody who talks openly about turning $583 into over $10 million to over one million subscribers on YouTube, and as the owner of Warrior Trading, I'm enough of a public figure that I've dealt with my fair share of trolls. I'd like to share with you what I've found is the best way to disarm the trolls. But first, I think it's essential to establish some baseline assumptions.Related: 3 Options for Dealing With Internet Trolls



Who are the trolls?My definition of a troll is someone who posts/comments/ or otherwise publicly communicates hateful, derogatory or defamatory messages on social media pages in a persistent and harassing way.To understand how to respond to trolling, we must understand the mindset of a troll. Trolling is so pervasive there have been numerous studies on the topic. Studies show that individuals who regularly engage in this type of behavior online are maladjusted and often suffer from various personality disorders in their real lives.


Looking at the behavior of trolling through this lens, that it is a symptom of a deeper psychological struggle that somebody is experiencing, has helped me take the comments a bit less personally.Naturally, some comments will be easier to brush off than others, but trolling can be deeply triggering and painful for anybody who grew up with self-esteem issues. So much so that we routinely hear about influences saying they must take mental health breaks from social media. I recognize that I don't have it nearly as bad as others, but as a small business owner, I also can't afford to take breaks.Here's how I've handled trolling:Don't feed the trollsWe must remember that the goal of a troll is to elicit a reaction and a response. The moment you start engaging, they've won. I would say 99.9% of trolling doesn't warrant a response. The best practice with most trolling is to mute, block and delete.


For business owners, it's essential to know that up-and-coming businesses in your space may try to leverage your name to amplify their own voice. It's called ""trend jacking"". For example, Mr. Beast is the #1 content creator on YouTube. I often see new content creators struggling to gain an audience using ""Mr. Beast's"" name or his picture to try to piggyback off his audience. If you make a salacious post about Mr. Beast, it will probably get a lot of views, right? In fact, one of the easiest ways for anyone to spur engagement on social media is to trigger emotion with divisive, exaggerated, salacious and triggering content. Tabloids still sell copies in the grocery store, right? Even though most people know it's not credible, it's a form of entertainment.Related: Why the Most Successful People Have the Most HatersHire a professional ""Troll Patrol"" to deal with the most offensive commentsIt's important to engage on social media with your most loyal subscribers. It's not only good for the algorithm; it's what creates that brand loyalty. It's also worth noting that these subscribers will come to your rescue and be some of your fiercest defenders when you become the victim of trolling. As my business has grown, I have hired people to clear trolls/spam comments before I sit down to answer comments.That way, I can spend my time responding to the good comments and engaging with my fans without losing any mental bandwidth to negativity. It took me a long time to figure out that I needed to do this, but it is necessary. If you are the face of your business or it's something you've put your blood, sweat, and tears into, it's hard to have a level head when it comes to responding to trolls.


Have an easy and nonpublic way for customers to give you feedbackThere are certainly people who exhibit trolling behavior who are not malicious but merely frustrated. For businesses, you need to have a way for your customers to obtain (good) customer service and also give feedback. When customers feel ignored, they often take their grievances to social media to make themselves heard. I've invested heavily in customer service for my business, and I think it is enormously important. My team is also trained to take public grievances offline ASAP and find a solution for the customer via email if possible. The saying ""the customer is always right"" is good to remember.Have a good lawyer on standby when things cross the lineThere is a fine line between trash-talking, trolling, harassment and defamation. As your business grows, or as your personal influence grows, you will likely face a troll that crosses the line. Now, the question is whether you respond publicly or privately. A public response gives the troll exactly what they want. A private direct response is how I respond. And I do it via legal counsel.When faced with a cease and desist letter written by your attorney, most trolls will realize the anonymity of the internet has not protected them from potential liability. This usually will stop the behavior. In the rare case it doesn't, the legal system offers court-ordered restraining orders and permanent injunctions. Sadly, I've had to use these remedies at Warrior Trading. Most other large businesses do, too.I believe when somebody crosses the line, it's better to be known for being aggressive than to be known as a pushover. But when considering this step, it's essential to consider the time, effort and cost it will take and if it is worth it to your business. Luckily, my wife, Lauren Cameron, is meticulous about getting our lawyers what they need to do the job, and I do not have to waste my time on the craziness.


The choice is yoursPublic figures, including entrepreneurs and business owners, will have detractors that create persistent, derogatory, misleading, false, nasty and malicious content on social media. To a certain extent, consider it a badge of honor that you have become significant enough to attract trolls. However, how an individual or business deals with these trolls, either engaging with them or ignoring them, will impact public perception of your brand and your personal image. This choice is yours to make and must be carefully calculated.

93,Social Media App X Is Struggling to Attract Users — But Another Once-Beloved Platform Is Making an Unexpected Comeback,"Oct 26, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/elon-musks-x-struggles-while-snapchat-sees-user-growth/464347,"
Elon Musk's Twitter takeover has been fraught from the beginning, and though the billionaire still claims to have big plans for the ""everything app,"" now called ""X,"" the numbers aren't adding up yet.X is struggling to attract users and revive its advertising business after a major dip in revenue following Musk's acquisition, according to third-party data reported by The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, Snapchat, the social app known for its disappearing messages, is seeing significant user growth.Related: Elon Musk Says X 'May Fail' Amid Competition, Ad Losses



In August, Musk posted that X saw records for ""user-seconds"" (a metric Musk uses alongside ""unregretted user-minutes"") in recent months, and in September, the company said it has 245 million daily active users compared to the 237.8 million Twitter had the last time it publicly filed financial results, per the outlet.But X has also lost nearly 15 million users during Musk's tenure; the app's daily active users via mobile app declined by 16% in September compared with the month Musk took over, according to an analysis from research firm Sensor Tower.


Additionally, advertising, X's primary source of revenue, has taken a hit, with many large agency executives revealing there hasn't been a mass return to X and that returning brands aren't spending as much as they used to, per the WSJ.According to Sensor Tower's data, X had 183 million daily active users on average in September compared to 10 million on Threads — and 385 million on Snapchat. That's right: The social app founded in 2011 and declared ""dead"" by major outlets in 2018 is experiencing an increase in revenue and users and trying to get them to make more in-app purchases, like clothing and concert tickets, Quartz reported last year.Related: Elon Musk X to Charge New Users $1 to Post, Prove Not a BotAnd Snapchat's parent company, Snap, just revealed better-than-anticipated results for the third quarter, posting revenue of $1.19 billion, an increase of 5%, and a net loss of $368 million, or 23 cents per share, Variety reported.

94,Meta Sued By 42 State Attorneys General For Allegedly Designing 'Addictive' Features on Facebook and Instagram,"Oct 25, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/meta-sued-over-addictive-features-by-42-state-attorneys/464277,"
A group of 42 state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against Meta on Tuesday, alleging that the features on its Facebook and Instagram platforms are designed to be addictive to children and teenagers.The lawsuit argues that Meta deliberately designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users engaged for extended periods and entice them to return repeatedly. It alleges that Meta achieved this through algorithmic design, frequent alerts and notifications, and infinite scrolling through platform feeds.""Meta has harnessed powerful and unprecedented technologies to entice, engage, and ultimately ensnare youth and teens,"" the lawsuit states. ""Its motive is profit, and in seeking to maximize its financial gains, Meta has repeatedly misled the public about the substantial dangers of its Social Media Platforms.""



New York, California, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Washington are among the myriad of states involved.Furthermore, the lawsuit asserts that features such as ""likes"" and photo filters contribute to negative effects on teens' mental health, promoting social comparison and body dysmorphia.


Related: FTC Says Facebook Violated 2020 Privacy Order, Proposes More Protections for Teens and ChildrenThe lawsuit argues that Meta's scheme involved creating a business model to maximize young users' time on its platforms, implementing ""psychologically manipulative features,"" publishing ""misleading"" safety reports, and continuing to use harmful features despite evidence of harm while ""downplaying the impact"" on young users' well-being.The suit additionally accuses Meta of violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting personal data from users under the age of 13 without parental consent. The states seek to end the ""exploitative"" and ""harmful"" practices by Meta, which they deem unlawful, as well as seeking penalties and restitution.""Just like Big Tobacco and vaping companies have done in years past, Meta chose to maximize its profits at the expense of public health, specifically harming the health of the youngest among us,"" Phil Weiser, Colorado's attorney general, said in a statement to the New York Times.


A Meta spokesperson told CNBC that the company is committed to providing safe online experiences for teens and their families and has introduced numerous tools to support this goal.""We're disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,"" the spokesperson added.Entrepreneur has reached out to Meta for comment.Related: U.S. Government and 17 States Sue Amazon Over Alleged Anticompetitive Practices That Led to Higher Prices for Consumers

Kittch is a platform for culinary creators unlike any before. By giving a place for chefs to livestream content and connect with a community of fans, CEO Brian Bedol and Kittch are helping food entrepreneurs make more money while building their brands.Think of Kittch as a mix of Twitch and OnlyFans but for the culinary industry.Brian Bedol found inspiration during the COVID-19 pandemic when restaurant operators and others were reaching out anxious about the impact of shutdowns on their businesses.



In response, Bedol with co-founders Elana Karp and Douglas DeLuca created Kittch, a platform aimed to connect chefs and culinary creators with consumers, providing a space to share and monetize their skills.Brian Bedol is a TV pioneer and media entrepreneur who previously founded Classic Sports Network and College Sports Television to great success. He knows the power of storytelling firsthand.


""I figured there must be a platform like we had built in sports for chefs and culinary creators,"" says Bedol to Restaurant Influencers series host Shawn P. Walchef of Cali BBQ Media. ""Kittch was just the Twitch of Cooking. We're surprised that it didn't exist.""Kittch, from its inception, was positioned as a platform for stories, allowing chefs to share their experiences, inspirations, and aspirations online. These bonds with local and global communities are a foundational aspect of Kittch's development.For Bedol, the key to successful business lies in storytelling and building emotional connections. He believes the best salespeople aren't merely focused on selling a product but engaging customers in meaningful conversations.""The best salespeople are not salespeople. They're people who engage you in a conversation and make you feel like you're privileged to buy something,"" explains Bedol.


Brian Bedol approaches business from the standpoint of passion. He emphasizes the importance of loving what you do as a way to get others to love it as well.You should create a business that you adore and focus on seemingly small niches in your industry to allow for more personal and authentic connections with customers.""I'm one of those people who believes that to really love the business that you're doing, you need to create a business that you love,"" says Bedol. ""If you love it, it becomes much easier to help others understand what you love and to help them love it.""From sports media to livestreaming, Brian Bedol knows the things that resonate most with people come down to one idea: ""It's about storytelling.""

TikTok'ers are raking in thousands by posting their content to...Facebook, Business Insider reported.Some content creators are referring to Facebook as a ""cash cow"" due to the various monetization opportunities the platform offers.Despite Facebook usage among teens between 13 and 17 significantly in recent years (dropping from 71% in 2015 to 32% in 2023, per Pew Research Center), the social media network still has nearly 3 billion monthly users as of October, according to Statista.



Facebook's monthly usage surpasses other platforms typically preferred by Gen Z such as YouTube (2.5 million monthly users), Instagram (2 million), and TikTok (1.1 million). For content creators, this untapped user base presents a unique opportunity to reach a broader audience and boost earnings.Morgann Book, a lifestyle influencer with a significant following on TikTok, told Insider that, between September 2022 and July, she earned over $93,000 from Facebook payments by posting reels on the platform. While initially skeptical, Book managed to rake in over 214,000 followers by posting her TikToks on Facebook.

Also, Facebook employs bonuses and incentive programs for creators like the Performance Bonus, which can pay some creators up to $30,000 per month, per Insider.For some content creators, Facebook's demographic (42% of which are between the ages of 25 and 44, per Statista), is a key component of its appeal, as compared to TikTok, where 37.3% of users are between the ages of 18 and 24.

A convincing artificial intelligence voice, closely resembling that of former President Barack Obama, emerged on TikTok in late August, addressing allegations surrounding the death of his former chef.""I am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Tafari Campbell [mispelled in the video as Talafi Cambell],"" fake Obama says in the video, ""who was not just an employee, but a valued member of our extended family.""The (eerily convincing) voice is the result of new tools allowing AI to clone and manipulate real voices with ease and humanlike mimicry, commonly known as ""deepfakes.""



Since the release of these tools in 2017, AI-generated voices have been employed in videos to propagate disinformation, as exemplified by the fake Obama video identified by NewsGuard, The New York Times reported.


TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew listens to questions from U.S. representatives during his testimony at a Congressional hearing on TikTok in Washington, DC on March 23rd, 2023. Nathan Posner/Anadolu Agency | Getty Images. The NewsGuard report released late last month found that the deepfake Obama video was one of 17 in a network of accounts generating and posting fake news content. Thirteen of the 17 accounts were discovered to be deceptively branded to resemble mainstream news outlets, TV shows, and well-known TikTok accounts, blurring the lines between what is real and AI-generated for an unsuspecting scroller.Platforms like TikTok are now grappling with the challenge of flagging and labeling AI-generated content, and although TikTok has introduced tools for labeling AI-generated content, the issue remains a concern as new content is rapidly posted on various platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook.Related: 'Biggest Risk of Artificial Intelligence': Microsoft's President Says Deepfakes Are AI's Biggest ProblemWhile motives may vary, AI-generated content can serve as a means for bad actors to manipulate public opinion and spread falsehoods.EU Calls on Meta and X to Take Action Against MisinformationOn Wednesday, European regulator Thierry Breton penned a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, urging him to be ""vigilant"" in combating disinformation on his company's platforms amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, CNBC reported.""After the terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel on Saturday, we quickly established a special operations center staffed with experts, including fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers, to closely monitor and respond to this rapidly evolving situation,"" a Meta spokesperson told the outlet. ""Our teams are working around the clock to keep our platforms safe, take action on content that violates our policies or local law, and coordinate with third-party fact-checkers in the region to limit the spread of misinformation.""Breton sent a letter to X owner Elon Musk the day before, stating that there were ""indications"" that groups were sharing misinformation and content of a ""violent and terrorist"" nature concerning the Israel-Hamas conflict on the platform.

Well, let's first go over the importance of PR and media coverage, as well as the benefits of being a guest on podcasts and using social media. Not only can using these strategies enhance an entrepreneur's reputation, expand their reach and ultimately drive more traffic to their business, but it helps give an entrepreneur trust and credibility. If a potential client can't find much about your business on Google or social media, you're in trouble. Staying relevant with current PR, podcast interviews and repurposing them for social media content will help you achieve the success your business needs to scale.Related: How to Attract Sales Leads through Your Podcast Guest Appearance



Build brand awareness through pressPublic relations is a strategic communication process that helps entrepreneurs create and maintain a positive image in the eyes of their target audience and the public. By leveraging PR, entrepreneurs can manage their reputation, effectively communicate their brand's story and differentiate themselves from the competition. All well-known businesses have press, and you should, too.Media coverage and press releases are essential components of PR and branding. Being featured in reputable publications and or having press releases published can significantly boost a business's credibility. Media coverage provides third-party validation, positioning the entrepreneur as an authority in their niche and gaining exposure to a much larger audience. Additionally, the right media coverage can lead to increased brand awareness, which can convert into new customers, strategic partnerships and investor opportunities.


Hire PR helpHaving the right team to help properly share your story with the media is a huge part of building a public identity with trust and authority. A great public figure business coach or PR agent can help you gain a competitive edge in your industry, as they will have established relationships with journalists, editors and influencers. This allows them to secure media coverage and feature placements, increasing your brand visibility.Podcast guest appearancesThe popularity of podcasting has opened up new doors for entrepreneurs to reach their target audience. Appearing as a guest on popular podcasts allows entrepreneurs to share their expertise, give insights and connect with a new audience.Podcasts provide a valuable opportunity to tell one's story in a conversational format, allowing entrepreneurs to showcase their personality and authenticity. By sharing their experiences, lessons learned and industry knowledge, entrepreneurs can establish themselves as thought leaders and build a rapport with listeners they may have not had before. The credibility gained from these interactions can lead to increased brand loyalty and new customers.Additionally, podcasts often have a niche focus, catering to specific industries or interests. By requesting to be a guest on podcasts aligned with a like-minded audience, entrepreneurs and business owners can reach a highly targeted demographic and generate quality leads and possible fans. Each podcast appearance serves as an endorsement and recommendation from the podcast host, enhancing the entrepreneur's reputation with the listeners, which is why being a guest is so valuable.

Find podcasts that align with your expertise, interests and story so that you can add value to their audience. You can use platforms like Apple Podcasts, Spotify or Podchaser for your research. It's wise and recommended to listen to any podcast show before you send a pitch. Get a feel for the type of guests they typically have on their show.Create a 1-page media kit to give a brief on who you are. Include photos, a short bio, website link and your social media handles with insights. This makes it easy and attractive to present yourself professionally, especially if the show gets lots of pitches.Once you have done your research, know you're a good fit for the show and can add compelling content, it's time to develop a strong email or DM pitch. Make sure to include your credentials and potential topics that you can share with their audience. Your pitch should be what you can do for the podcast and their audience, not why you want to be on their show.


I recommend pitching yourself first for free, however, if time is money for you, hire an expert to do the pitches for you. A good PR firm can easily book you on ideal podcast shows.Synergistic impactWhile PR and podcast appearances are powerful strategies on their own, their true potential is realized when they are combined. By strategically coordinating PR efforts and podcast appearances, entrepreneurs can amplify their brand's visibility and credibility exponentially.For example, entrepreneurs can leverage their media coverage by sharing it with podcast hosts and producers, increasing the likelihood of securing guest appearances. On the other hand, podcast appearances can generate interest from media outlets, resulting in additional press coverage and creating a cycle of positive exposure.The synergy between PR and podcasts helps create a consistent brand narrative. When entrepreneurs align their messaging across media coverage and podcast interviews, they strengthen their expertise and brand identity. This consistency builds trust and recognition among the target audience, building long-term relationships and loyalty.

Make sure to share your media articles and podcast interviews on Instagram, LinkedIn and ""X."" Your story may inspire others and get shared many times on social media, giving you additional free traffic and brand awareness.PR, podcast appearances and social media all go hand-in-hand. They are all a part of branding and are important tools that can help entrepreneurs reach their goals, land more business and pave the way for long-term success.

101,"Facial Recognition Tech Even Google Determined Was 'Too Dangerous' Raises Alarm Bells, Privacy Concerns","Oct 11, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/controversial-tech-pimeyes-fuels-privacy-concerns/463483,"
A consistent social media presence leaves little room for mystery, especially if one's profile is public. However, as technology progresses, one might not even need to be on social media for their face to be recognizable on the internet.PimEyes, a facial recognition website, uses AI-powered reverse image technology to allow users to upload a picture of anyone — even a stranger — and find their identity.Initially conceived by two computer programmers in Poland, PimEyes scans a face within a photograph and delves into the depths of the internet, unearthing images of individuals that they might not have been aware of, NPR reported. Although the company contends that its service aids individuals in monitoring their online presence, it has sparked controversy due to its potential for misuse by stalkers and other bad actors.



""[Former Google CEO] Eric Schmidt as far back as 2011 said this was the one technology that Google had developed and decided to hold back, that it was too dangerous in the wrong hands — if it was used by a dictator, for example,"" Kashmir Hill, New York Times reporter and author of Your Face Belongs to Us, told NPR.PimEyes offers a basic version free of charge for anyone to use, with three tiers of advanced features available for a monthly subscription fee — $29.99, $79.99 and $299.99. One of the features included with the nearly $300 ""advanced"" subscription is what the company says is ""Deep Search (more thorough search).""


Related: What is Lensa AI? And Does it Pose Privacy and Ethical Concerns?PimEyes imposes rules that specify users can only search for themselves or individuals who have consented to a search. However, there are no significant barriers preventing individuals from conducting searches on others without their permission, NPR reported.""If facial recognition is deployed widely, it's virtually the end of the ability to hide in plain sight, which we do all the time, and we don't really think about,"" Woodrow Hartzog, a professor at Boston University School of Law specializing in privacy and technology, told the outlet.Hartzog advocates for governmental regulation or even bans on such tools before they become too widely available to the public.""I simply don't see a world where humanity is better off with facial recognition than without it,"" he added.PimEyes has garnered significant traction on social media platforms like TikTok. Videos showcasing the use of the tool have millions of views, including one video that has racked up over two million views. In it, a user deploys the technology and other tools to identify a camera operator at a Taylor Swift concert, subsequently exposing his full name and Instagram profile in the video. ""This is terrifying,"" one user commented, ""All fun and games but no this is actually scary.""PimEyes allows individuals to opt out of its database by filling out a request form, which requires a photo of their face and ID verification.Related: As Privacy Concerns Increase, Look Deeper Than Data for Innovation Opportunities

102,Social Media Fraud Is On the Rise — And Even the Most Savvy Are Getting Scammed. Here Are the Most Common.,"Oct 9, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/social-media-scams-cost-users-27b-since-2021-report/463353,"
Social media use can provide a slew of opportunities — from furthering your career to cataloging memories to finding love and friendships. However, it can also offer opportunities for criminals, like scamming and defrauding.According to a new report by the Federal Trade Commission, one in four individuals who reported losing money due to fraud since 2021 said that the scam began on social media.The cumulative losses reported from these schemes during the same period have amounted to $2.7 billion, the report found, eclipsing any other communication method by a considerable margin. By comparison, the losses from websites or apps were $2 billion for the same period, phone calls were $1.9 billion, and email was $0.9 billion.



While social media scams affect all age groups, the report found that it's not senior citizens who are experiencing the most substantial impact. In the first half of 2023, individuals aged 20-29 reported that social media served as the primary method of contact in over 38% of fraud cases, while for those aged 18-19, the figure soared to 47%.Related: I'm a Business News Editor, and Even I Fell Victim to an Online Scam That Cost Me $300


Social media gives scammers an ""edge,"" the agency noted, as fraudsters can craft fake personas or compromise existing profiles, tailor their approach based on the information shared on social media, and use advertisements to target individuals according to personal details such as age, interests, or previous purchases — all at minimal cost and with the ability to reach a wide range of users.The most common instance of fraud on social media in the first half of 2023 was users attempting to purchase a product on a platform, accounting for 44% of all reported social media fraud. Most of these incidents involved undelivered products, with clothing and electronics ranking highest on the list.Counterfeit investment opportunities were the second most prevalent form of social media scams at 20%. However, it cost victims the most monetarily in the first six months of 2023, accounting for 53% of total losses from all social media scams, while shopping-related scams accounted for a mere 8%.Related: Instagram Influencer Allegedly Scammed 'Older' And 'Vulnerable' Americans Out of $2 Million in Romance SchemeWith social media scams running rampant, the FTC is offering tips on how to stay vigilant:Restrict the visibility of personal information on social media by adjusting privacy settings.Be wary of messages from friends or acquaintances requesting money or offering a questionable opportunity, and verify their identity by contacting them off of the platform.If someone on social media hastily pushes for a friendship or romantic connection, exercise caution, as romance scams are the third most common form of social media fraud.Before making a purchase, conduct an online search of the company's name along with keywords like ""scam"" or ""complaint"" to assess its credibility.

103,This Ex-Facebook Designer Co-Founded an Accelerator for Indigenous People. Here's What She Wishes They Knew About Pursuing a Career in Tech.,"Oct 9, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/shes-making-tech-careers-accessible-for-indigenous-people/463021,"
Natives Rising co-founder and CEO Danielle Forward is a Bay Area Native American who grew up surrounded by tech — and the struggles facing her community. An affiliate of the Cloverdale Rancheria of Pomo Indians, Forward remembers attending tribal council meetings, listening as people spoke about trying to get by on a $600 check every few months.One in three Native Americans is living in poverty across the U.S., with a median income of $23,000 per year, according to the American Community Survey reported by Northwestern University's Institute for Policy Research. A recent poll from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that inflation has caused 69% of Native Americans significant financial problems.Forward recalls feeling ""helpless"" when she heard about the challenges those in her community were up against. But a passion for drawing led her to enroll in California College of the Arts' interactive design program and land a full-time position in UX/UI product design at Facebook (now Meta) that ""transformed [her] life"" — and ultimately gave her the tools necessary to change the lives of Indigenous people in her community and beyond.

""I want to see really, truly empowered Indigenous people that feel like they can actually achieve their purpose in the world.""""I'd always wanted to do something [for my community],"" Forward tells Entrepreneur. ""It was just a matter of time."" Forward's senior thesis project would give her the push she needed; tasked with designing something ""important to [her] and important to the world,"" she realized it was the opportunity she'd been waiting for — and seized it to ask a critical question: How might we economically empower Indigenous communities?""I want to see really, truly empowered Indigenous people that feel like they can actually achieve their purpose in the world, and the prerequisite to that is having economic stability,"" Forward explains. ""It's not living in survival mode; it's being able to pay your bills.""Related: How to Honor Indigenous Peoples' Day at Work | EntrepreneurForward dove into her project's research phase and discovered that most Indigenous people aren't exposed to tech. Often, their parents encourage them to pursue traditional career paths, like becoming a doctor or lawyer. Forward also read up on Indigenous history, an ""empowering"" experience that helped her ""see deeply into all of the lineage of how these conditions and communities came to be.""


She had a firm grasp on the problem and knew that tech could be a solution. Tech roles don't necessarily require a college degree and are often remote, which can be a game-changer for Indigenous people who live on reservations. Careers in tech typically come with sizable paychecks, too. ""Six-figure salaries just out of school,"" Forward says, ""which is completely life-changing for anybody, especially a lot of Indigenous folks who have never even imagined that they could make a salary like that.""""It was the first time that I truly publicly embraced being Indigenous and started talking about it.""Forward wanted to expose more Indigenous people to careers in tech and give them the support necessary to pursue them. But she was the only person working on her project and didn't have any funding. So she used the ""social equity"" she'd built during her time at Facebook to make an impact, ""gathering up"" the Indigenous people she knew in the field and launching a website to tell their stories, arrange talks, provide mentorship and further access.""It was the first time that I truly publicly embraced being Indigenous and started talking about it, which was important for me,"" Forward recalls. ""Before that, I didn't talk about it because — and maybe folks from other marginalized communities can relate to me on this — people will sometimes say stereotypes or something ignorant, and I just didn't want to deal with it.""


Related: This Founder Wants to Share Indigenous Beauty With the WorldIn 2022, Forward joined forces with co-founder Betsy Fore, a three-time entrepreneur turned investor and the first Native woman to raise a series A round, and board member Hannah Cirelli, who helped lead the American Indigenous Business Leaders (AIBL). Fore and Cirelli were already eyeing a Native-focused nonprofit for entrepreneurship, and the idea was folded into Forward's original vision, bringing forth the current iteration of Natives Rising, ""a holistic career accelerator"" for Indigenous founders and Indigenous people in tech.Image Credit: Courtesy of Natives Rising. Danielle Forward, left. Betsy Fore, right.""They're seeing so many other inspiring people doing this that look like them, that come from the place they come from.""Forward left her job at Meta about six months ago and has been working on Natives Rising since. Today, the accelerator boasts three major programs: a Native Women's Tech Fellowship, Indigenous STEM Camp and Founders Circle. The Native Women's Tech Fellowship is for Native women working on bachelor's degrees in technology. Through speakers and in-person events, Natives Rising aims to increase the number of Native women in tech by 50% — which ""sounds like a lot,"" Forward says, but explains it's only 156 women because the number is so low.In just six months, Natives Rising has already increased that number from four women to 23 and counts at least 200 women from different tribes across the U.S. in its network — representing more than a quarter of the 567 enrolled tribes nationwide, Forward says.Natives Rising's STEM camp is open to Indigenous high school students nationwide. The program strives to increase students' interest and confidence in tech and had a strong initial showing. Thirty-five Native high school students representing 21 tribes joined six Native women college fellows for a 4.5-day retreat in Washington D.C. — and the number of female high school students who answered ""How likely are you to pursue a college degree related to technology?"" with ""strongly agree"" went from 0% pre-camp to more than 28% post-camp.Related: Opening New Pathways to Careers in Technology for Indigenous Learners


Finally, the Founders Circle is where the entrepreneurial side of things comes in: It's similar to the fellowship in many ways, Forward says, connecting Indigenous founders who've achieved $1 million in revenue in a year with an emerging cohort of Indigenous founders for mentorship and coaching. It's a small program to allow for larger grants right now, Forward explains, but its mentors already include Jenn Harper of Cheekbone Beauty and Joey Montoya of Urban Native Era, among others.Now, Forward and her team are looking ahead to Natives Rising's continued growth — and attracting more Native women and students to the powerful ecosystem they've built.""They're seeing so many other inspiring people doing this that look like them, that come from the place they come from,"" Forward says, ""and it starts to create even more of a positive feedback loop. We are incubating the leaders of Indian country. We are empowering them with financial independence and knowledge.""""Sometimes people are intimidated by the amount of time something takes or its complexity, but we're all learning machines.""It's a holistic empowerment, too: Natives Rising also provides emotional health coaching. ""We have some of the highest rates of suicide in our communities, and trauma,"" Forward says. ""And we'll discover sometimes the thing holding them back isn't a material thing. It's not a better laptop. It's not financial; it's emotional, it's psychological, it's with their family, it's interpersonal, it's relationships."" Forward is already a certified life coach, and her co-founders are in training.Forward's best advice for Indigenous people ready to leap into tech careers of their own? They should join the Natives Rising community, first and foremost — and then adopt a growth mindset. ""Learning is uncomfortable,"" Forward says, ""and it's supposed to be that way. Sometimes people are intimidated by the amount of time something takes or its complexity, but we're all learning machines, and just because you might not know something immediately doesn't mean you won't be able to in five days or five weeks — it's just how the brain works.""""Everybody can grow,"" Forward adds, ""[so] keep focusing on what you do want and stay motivated on that path. It's the best thing you can do for yourself.""

104,5 Key Elements to Master Thought Leadership and Establish Your Credibility,"Oct 6, 2023",Annie Scranton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-key-elements-to-master-thought-leadership-and-establish/457805,"
Thought leadership is a tactic publicists and marketers often rely on as a way to grow media presence and brand awareness for an individual or an organization. Thought leadership establishes the voice of key leaders within a company, positioning them as experts within their industry and thus driving positive engagement back towards the leader and the brand.As the founder and CEO of leading PR firm Pace Public Relations, I know firsthand that refining a thought leadership strategy to amplify my clients' voices is paramount for them to make an impactful contribution that influences, inspires and even challenges the status quo.But how do you become a thought leader?Here are five key elements to ensure your voice is authentic, knowledgeable and influential.Related: How to Showcase Your Expertise and Become a Thought Leader



1. Find the best peopleChoosing the right thought leader for your company is a crucial task that demands attention and care. Start by fully understanding your company's industry and niche, and dive deep into these specifics.Next up, look at the possible thought leaders within your company. It's not just about high ranks and titles; it's more about who has the right experience, insight and communication skills. A founder can share the heartfelt story of the company's birth and mission. On the other hand, a CEO might be better at discussing the company's current goals and strategies.Additionally, keep your audience in mind. Consider who among your potential thought leaders would resonate most with them — an intern or an individual with diverse experiences should not be overlooked. Remember, the ideal thought leader is not solely knowledgeable, but also profoundly connected with your audience's interests and concerns.Take the time to chat with these potential thought leaders. What's their take on the industry and your company's place in it? Do they have an interesting personal story? Their answers can give you a good feel for whether they'd make an effective thought leader.


Remember, the best thought leader is knowledgeable and deeply connected with your audience's interests and concerns.2. Dive deep into industry nuancesA thorough understanding of your industry and where you fit in it is a crucial first step.The modern business environment is riddled with nuances — it is no longer sufficient to label yourself under broad categories like ""healthcare"" or ""tech."" Are you in healthcare focusing on pharmaceuticals or medical research? In the vast world of technology, is your niche software-as-a-service (SaaS) or property technology?By first identifying these intricacies, you can tailor your thought leadership content and insights to be more relevant and valuable to your target audience.


Imagine you're the CEO of an electric battery startup. When a sudden plunge in Tesla's stock or a surge in Americans opting for electric vehicles is being reported on in the news, there's a golden opportunity to have your voice heard. The insights you could provide would reflect your unique expertise in the field, promote your company to a relevant audience and let you drive conversations around these shifts.Related: 5 Effective Ways to Establish Yourself as a Thought Leader3. Synchronize internal and external worldsWhile a company's external communications are pivotal, the company's internal culture is the linchpin of authenticity. Employees, stakeholders and even investors often gauge a company's credibility based on the alignment (or lack thereof) between what's preached externally and practiced internally.As a thought leader, a founder and/or CEO plays a pivotal role in bridging this gap. When employees witness their leadership echo the same values internally as they do on public platforms, it fosters a sense of trust and alignment. On the flip side, a major lack of trust occurs when employees experience something differently internally than is projected to external stakeholders.


A synergy between internal and external worlds enhances a company's reputation while ensuring that the thought leadership stance remains genuine rather than being perceived as a mere PR exercise.4. Utilize the right social media platformsGone are the days when thought leadership was limited to newspaper op-eds or conference keynote speeches. The rise of social media has democratized this space, offering a plethora of platforms to voice opinions, share insights and engage with a broader audience. Yet with an abundance of opportunities comes inherent challenges.Each social platform caters to a distinct demographic and has unwritten rules. It is imperative to understand which platform aligns best with your persona and your company's target audience.Tailoring the choice of platform is paramount; a LinkedIn post might work wonders for B2B thought leaders, while an Instagram Live session could be the key for those in more consumer-centric industries.


Moreover, navigating the delicate balance between personal and professional boundaries on these platforms is essential. Each organization has its own level of comfort — and knowing where you and your organization stand is a necessary first step before making a social media plan. Some organizations might encourage leaders to be candid, sharing glimpses of their personal lives, while others prefer a strictly professional tone. Navigating these nuances is crucial in curating an online persona for thought leaders that is both authentic and appropriate.Related: 5 Ways to Level Up Your Thought Leadership5. Find stories that resonate and inspireWhile unique expertise forms the bedrock of thought leadership, the infusion of personal stories and experiences imparts the emotional resonance necessary for your message to truly connect with your audience.People are inundated with information, so we naturally seek authentic narratives that they can relate to or draw inspiration from.


Tapping into the personal journeys, challenges and significant milestones of your own life can be a game-changer and yield transformative outcomes as a thought leader. These narratives humanize leaders in the public eye, emphasizing the unique value and distinctive contributions they bring to their industries.Ultimately, successful thought leaders balance showcasing industry knowledge, aligning internal and external narratives, leveraging the right platforms and weaving in personal stories that touch the heart. With the right approach, thought leadership can transform your reputation, influence industry conversations and pave the way for genuine, lasting impact. Thought leadership transcends mere visibility and involves crafting a legacy that's built on expertise, authenticity and meaningful contributions to your industry.

106,Move Over Boomers and Millennials — Here's How Gen Alpha's Top Entrepreneurs Are Printing Money,"Oct 5, 2023",Lena Grundhoefer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/move-over-millennials-how-gen-alphas-top-entrepreneurs/462793,"
Youth culture is always important for staying in the zeitgeist, and Generation Alpha (those born between 2010 and 2025) is well on its way to creating big waves in the business world. They're too young to vote and too young to drive, but they're already taking the digital world by force.Take Ryan Kaji, for example. Born in 2011, Kaji is one of the most successful YouTubers in history, with 35.5 million followers on his Ryan's World YouTube channel, and he's turning 12 years old with an estimated net worth of over $100 million. Pixie Curtis is the CEO of Pixie's Fidgets and became a millionaire at the age of 11.The top 10 Roblox creators (which are mostly Gen Alpha and younger Generation Z) earned an average of $23 million last year, with at least 500 creators earning over $140,000, according to the company. Meanwhile, I spent my childhood out and about in Chicago, hanging with friends, not thinking about get-rich-quick schemes, and in my late 20s, I still get told I'm too young to run a business.



Related: 'Not Much Financial Education' — Yet Millennials Have Boomers and Gen X Beat When It Comes to Retirement Savings. Here's Why.These numbers are obviously outliers, but they represent a young generation eager to make some cash.


Social media, streaming and video games opened a lane for younger kids to earn a living doing something that comes naturally, as they were the first generation born with iPhones and now ChatGPT. Experts say this can have benefits and consequences. Kids who work can get so caught up in their jobs that they miss out on essential childhood experiences they can never go back to relive. This is a contributing factor to the growing loneliness epidemic among young people.Still, some children have an entrepreneurial spirit and may often get in trouble following the traditional path of graduating from school before starting to work. Before discussing Generation Alpha's entrepreneurialism, let's address the uncomfortable conversation that's been coming up more often in the age of young influencers… child labor.Related: How to Raise Entrepreneurial Minded KidsAre kids even legally allowed to work?Among the changes brought forth from the Industrial Revolution were fair labor practices, which included the introduction of child labor laws. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets the minimum age for non-agricultural work at 14 years old and restricts the number of hours minors can work during school days. This is the minimum safety net; state laws may provide even further protections.


The laws are intended to keep children from being exploited, although we only need to look to Hollywood to see the long history of working children. Every child actor, from Shirley Temple to Millie Bobby Brown, was protected by California state laws, which have some of the most stringent requirements around children used in theatrical employment.California is not the only state doing it – nearly every state has some exemption for children working in performance-related jobs. Many of them have legislation to address these types of jobs to ensure the industry follows the rules geared specifically toward child actors, musicians, models, streamers and influencers.However, California law is notable for mandating that 15% of a child actor's earnings are placed in a trust until they are 18 so they can benefit from the headline-making paydays a-list child actors can receive. While this does make the entertainment industry more accessible to children, it's not the only industry they can work in.Related: 3 Reasons to Choose Real-Life Human Models Over AI for Your Next Campaign


Advice for Gen Alpha entrepreneursChild entrepreneurs can be found even outside the metaverse and YouTube. Consider ABC's Shark Tank.Throughout the show's 14-year history (it premiered in 2009, placing the show in Gen Z), it featured a lot of children-owned businesses. Moziah Bridges, for example, founded Mo's Bows at the age of nine with his mom, and by the age of 11, he appeared on ""Shark Tank"" and landed an investment from Daymond John.There are actionable steps for young people hoping to follow his path (or forge your own).First, don't feel pressured to build the ""next big thing."" You don't have to scale a company to 10x and become a multibillion-dollar company. That's not how everyone defines success, and you can learn a lot about entrepreneurialism just by running your own lemonade stand in the neighborhood.


Also, please know that there is no age limit on taxes. Even if you begin working straight out of the womb, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) wants its cut. However, you won't pay social security and Medicare taxes or the Federal Unemployment Tax. Talk to an accountant to ensure the business is on the level and set up for success.Above all else, seek mentors from many industries and ensure you're using the opportunity to foster positive working habits. Business is tough, and even adults want to quit when times inevitably get hard. Find someone willing to talk you through what you need to steer the business forward.Doing chores is as much a normal part of being a kid as playtime, and if you find a way to monetize either of those things, then it may be family time well spent. Ensure you protect everyone involved by having your legal caretaker file the proper paperwork and set realistic and attainable goals to succeed.Everyone starts somewhere, and the path to entrepreneurship takes a lot of persistence and grit to succeed through the various stages of being a founder.Related: How Brands Can Connect with Generation Alpha

107,How to Build a Marketing Function During the Early Stage of Your Startup,"Oct 5, 2023",Bryan Karas,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-build-a-marketing-function-during-the-early-stage/458779,"
Companies gaining traction in the early-to-mid growth stages have a few common marketing attributes: they're seeing good returns in paid media, they have some resources to deploy, and they're facing a dilemma of building an in-house team or hiring an agency to help them scale.I'm CEO and founder of a marketing agency — I'll put that out there right up front. Yes, that means I have a bias toward brands at this stage hiring agencies, but it also means I've seen plenty of brands over-invest where they shouldn't and under-invest in the places that will actually move the needle.This article will cover a few considerations for how to build a marketing function at this stage: core competencies you must have covered, how to address common mistakes and how to gauge the pros and cons of agencies and in-housing.



Related: 6 Key Roles to Build an Efficient Marketing TeamMust-have competencies of early-stage growth marketingCompanies of every maturity stage are generally focusing their advertising spend on Google and Meta (and perhaps LinkedIn, if you're B2B). There's a good reason for this: between those channels, which still account for nearly 50% of all digital advertising spend, you have huge audiences and engagement capabilities at every point in the funnel. All told, that's a perfect focal point for companies in the early stages of growth.


So what competencies do you need to have on hand to make the most of these channels? It's a surprisingly long list:Fluency in bidding and audience levers on each channelCreative production and testing at scaleExperience with tracking and taggingMartech fluency (GA4, CRM and email platforms at minimum)Channel contacts who can help with insights and access to early betasThe ability to look at budget holistically (attribution modeling, media mix modeling, lift testing)Even if your in-house resources can account for the first few points (which would put you far ahead of the curve), I almost guarantee you're spending inefficiently within your current channels. The ability to do native-to-platform lift studies and advanced analyses that look at incrementality and marginal return is a difference-maker at any stage – but particularly at this stage, when every dollar of spend and your burn rate should be under scrutiny. This is especially true in 2023, as the gap between Series B and C funding rounds has widened, and Series C funds are much harder to come by.Related: 3 Marketing Fails That Demonstrate The Importance of FundamentalsHow to reduce mistakes in early-stage growth marketingAt this growth stage, striking a balance between being too cautious and moving too quickly is key, and it's hard to do. It's a state of being for early-stage marketers, particularly those with VCs or private equity investors scrutinizing the use of their investment dollars, to feel the crunch of time and budget in bringing a product or service to the mainstream.


The common mistakes I see at this stage involve spending where a channel/product or channel/audience fit hasn't been firmly established; spending to acquire customers who would have purchased anyway; ignoring current customers in the rush to acquire new ones; and tying up resources in unnecessarily long commitments.Related: Should Your Small Business Hire a Marketing Agency or Build a Marketing Team?Early-stage growth marketing: the agency/in-house debateIf none of the above mistakes apply to you, and if your marketing team can account for all the core competencies I listed, your biggest takeaway should be giving those team members whatever they ask to stay with your company. You don't need to pay for an agency, and you should feel secure in knowing that your marketing team has a more thorough understanding of and investment in your company's goals, objectives and philosophies than any agency will.If, on the other hand, you know your team is too small or stretched too thin to cover the above, or you would value the perspective of an objective third party on your approach to meeting your business goals, it's time to start researching potential agency partners. If you're at that step, look for agencies with a strong perspective on customer retention and demonstrated experience in driving scale and efficiency within your vertical, and ask them to analyze your current media mix setup.


If you've chosen your shortlist well, each agency will be able to demonstrate the potential value of working with them. The right agency partner will work with you on contract terms that will keep you from tying up too many funds over the long term (and for what it's worth, something that every agency owner has learned during economic dips is that it's much easier logistically, financially and emotionally to fire an agency than to fire a colleague). But don't settle for an agency doing grunt work and simply taking orders; make sure they can proactively define a strategy to get you several steps further on the growth path and demonstrate a holistic understanding of the challenges in your space.What's nextGrowth at this stage is a high-speed blend of action, analysis and planning to enable future growth. It's a tough blend for fully resourced teams and an even tougher ask of teams trying to assess hiring needs on the fly. Whether it's an outside party or expertise already baked into your team, a resource with the time and perspective to help you plan for the year ahead, not just the week to come, is essential to longer-term growth.Speaking of longer-term growth, I'll close the series with a look at an ideal marketing function for established brands – remember, it's harder to stay on the mountaintop than to get there.

108,The AI Job Market Is Surging and Paying Up to $300K a Year. Here's How to Snag a Role.,"Oct 4, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/ai-related-job-postings-are-surgingand-paying-six-figures/463166,"
With the emergence and widespread use of artificial intelligence over the past year, questions loom over how the technology will impact the job market — but according to a new report, it already has.A recent report from the job and networking platform LinkedIn found a significant surge in job postings worldwide that reference AI or generative AI. In fact, between July 2021 and July 2023, such job listings more than doubled globally.Moreover, the increase of AI-related roles isn't industry-specific, but rather spans a myriad of sectors, Olivier Sabella, vice president of talent solutions at LinkedIn, told CNBC.



""These job posts vary from roles where professionals will directly work on AI development, such as AI engineer, to job postings where AI is listed as a required skill — for example, a digital product manager or cyber security consultant,"" Sabella told the outlet.The report also found that it's not just employers warming up to the implementation of AI, but the new tech is also piquing job seekers' interest.Related: Netflix is Hiring an AI-Focused Role—and the Starting Salary is up to $900,000Job postings that mention AI or generative AI have seen 17% ""greater application growth"" over the past two years.""As for the popularity of job posts mentioning AI, candidates are savvy,"" Erin Scruggs, vice president of global talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said in the report. ""They're showing they want to go where opportunities are.""And some companies are willing to shell out big bucks for those who fit the bill.


A report by ResumeBuilder earlier this year found that of 1,187 business leaders in the U.S., 92% are hiring, and 91% are looking for ChatGPT experience. One in four is willing to offer starting salaries exceeding $200,000, and 17% of respondents said they'd surpass a $300,000 salary for AI ""prompt engineers.""Related: Hiring Managers Are Looking for ChatGPT Experience — And Some Are Willing to Pay Up to $800,000 For It

109,Marketing Company Sues Elon Musk's X Corp for Twitter Rebrand That Caused 'Serious Irreparable Harm' to Its Business,"Oct 3, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/twitter-rebrand-faces-trademark-lawsuit-over-letter-x/463070,"
A legal battle has unfolded over a single letter, and the fate of its rightful ownership looms.Legal marketing company X Social Media is suing X Corp (formerly Twitter) because it alleges the platform's rebrand has infringed on its trademark and caused consumer confusion.In the lawsuit, filed on Monday in a federal court in Florida, the marketing company says that it has used ""X"" as part of its name since ""at least"" 2016 and that the company has used the letter in its name to symbolize the ""act of obtaining hope"" through social media for individuals facing various injustices. Meanwhile, Elon Musk rebranded the widely-known social media platform Twitter as ""X"" in July, aiming for it to be an ""everything app.""



Now, X Social Media claims that X Corp's rebrand under Musk ""has caused and will continue to cause serious irreparable harm"" to X Social Media.""X Corp has wielded its social media clout, marketing resources, and overall national notoriety to dominate consumer perception of its 'X' mark,"" the lawsuit states. ""This has resulted in the perception that X Corp is the source for services offered under the X SocialMedia Mark, despite the fact that X Social Media has offered services under its own X mark for over eight years.""


The lawsuit seeks to protect X Social Media's trademark rights and seeks damages for the financial harm caused by X Corp's alleged trademark infringement and consumer confusion.Although the financial damages X Social Media seeks remain undisclosed, the marketing company says in its suit that it has invested more than $400 million in advertising and more than $2 million to build brand awareness related to its name.Related: Twitter User Who Had the 'X' Handle Says He Was Kicked Out of His Account by Elon Musk: 'All's Well That Ends Well'X Social Media alleges that X Corp was ""well aware"" of the legal implications of using ""X"" but chose to pursue its ""X"" agenda anyway, causing consumer confusion and ""harm"" to X Social Media. The marketing company also states that X Corp continued to use the mark after it sent a cease-and-desist letter in August.


The strength of X Social Media's case remains uncertain. Alexandra Roberts, a law and media professor at Northeastern University, told The Verge in July that a trademark doesn't necessarily have to be highly unique to receive legal protection, but what matters is if people associate the trademark with a specific brand.""There are thousands of single-letter trademark registrations; many, but not all, of them are more elaborately stylized than the one that now appears on the site formerly known as Twitter,"" she told the outlet. ""Given the large user base on Twitter and the number of people following and reporting on this rebrand, I expect it wouldn't take very long to establish that the new 'X' functions as a trademark and consumers associate it with Twitter's services or brand.""Related: A Twitter User Turned Down Offers to Sell His Popular Account.
