0,More Companies Are Holding on to Their Employees — and Vice Versa. Here's How to Capitalize on This Labor Market.,"Apr 25, 2024",Daniel Altman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-era-of-quiet-quitting-is-over-heres-how-to-take/472388,"
The labor market has found a new normal — again. After the dramatic swings of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as a bevy of buzzwords, the market has settled into a pattern we've never seen before. If it lasts, businesses will have to think about human resources in a whole new way.First, we had ""The Great Resignation,"" then ""Quiet Quitting,"" which was quickly followed by ""Quiet Hiring."" And now we're in an unprecedented situation that some economists are calling ""The Great Stay."" It's an unusual moment in time given how workers are holding onto their jobs and companies are holding onto their workers.In February, new hires amounted to just 3.7% of existing payrolls and quits totaled just 2.2%. The last time the sum of these two percentages was so small was in December 2017, when the unemployment rate was 4.1%. To see this little churn in the labor market with an even lower unemployment rate — only 3.9% — is unprecedented in the data we have, which go back to 2001. Usually, churn falls when the unemployment rate rises. But right now, we're still near the all-time low for the unemployment rate.



One reason for this lack of churn is the uncertainty that still plagues the economy. The path of interest rates, the upcoming elections, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine and the possibility of corrections in asset markets are all on the minds of managers, workers and investors. Businesses are also concerned that if they let workers go in such a tight labor market, they'll have a hard time hiring when they need workers again. In the meantime, even expert opinions on the future of the economy aren't carrying much weight, since so many forecasters were wrong about a recession coming last year.So what's a business leader to do? The best approach is to take the labor market at face value and adjust strategy accordingly. This means thinking about new hires and existing workers as partners for the long term. Here are some ways to do it.

In the Bureau of Labor Statistics's most recent figures, the median job tenure of American workers had bottomed out at 4.1 years after a long decline. With fewer people walking out the door, you don't need as many walking in. You can spend more time searching for candidates for a given position, but that doesn't mean you can be choosier — there's still stiff competition for the best hires.2. Invest more in trainingThe longer workers stay with you, the more benefits you receive when they pick up knowledge and skills. To reap these benefits over the longest period of time, you have to start investing in training as early as possible.You can be savvy about the types of training you offer, too; boosting workers' ability to use equipment, software, and processes that are unique to your business raises their value to you but doesn't necessarily make them more likely to change jobs. But if you're having trouble attracting workers, you might want to offer training on skills that are in high demand across the labor market. Then you can figure out how to make them stay — which might help you to discover why you had trouble attracting them in the first place.


3. Shift the mix of benefitsTraining isn't the only way to invest in workers. Helping them to build their human capital through subsidies for education also makes them more valuable. Again, you can be savvy about the kinds of education you'll support, such as part-time MBAs for potential managers or skills-specific degree programs for individual contributors.Investing in workers also means keeping them healthy and happy. Comprehensive medical benefits including exercise programs, mental health services and wellness care can make a big difference, as can free healthy meals and paid time off. Businesses that offer support for growing families, such as paid parental leave, are also more likely to hold onto workers for longer.4. Structure incentives differently for retentionHolding onto workers was such a challenge in the past several years that some businesses offered retention bonuses after as few as three months. With workers less likely to leave, these incentives can be pushed back. Laddering incentives can also encourage workers to stay longer. For example, if a worker's bonus for staying two years was 50% more than the bonus for staying one year, then the worker might be more likely to hang around rather than start from the bottom rung at another business.Related: Don't Lose Those Talented Team Members. 3 Ways to Hold on to Them.


5. Explore long-term options in all areasWorkers increasingly think of their labor supply as a portfolio of different kinds of jobs and flexible work, and business leaders can do the same — especially in this labor market. Just as there are ways to take advantage of long-term relationships with permanent employees, there are also big benefits from commitment and consistency among temporary and flexible workers. Reducing turnover and deepening experience in these groups can raise productivity. Our surveys of workers on the Instawork platform suggest that more than half can commit to stay with the same business for at least three months working full-time hours.Matching these workers with businesses looking for long-term staffing — in all of its forms — is a critical task in the current labor market. It's also one that will have benefits far into the future, as workers deepen their skills and receive steadier incomes via more committed relationships with businesses.

1,Offering Your Valuable Knowledge and Services For Free Comes at a Price — Here's How to Avoid Paying It.,"Apr 24, 2024",Liang Zhao,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/this-is-the-true-cost-of-free-work-as-an-entrepreneur/472196,"
People enter entrepreneurship with the mindset that their creation will ""change the world."" The question is: What is the cost of changing the world, and more importantly, who pays?Even fictional heroes have to budget accordingly. There's a reason our most recognizable superheroes — the Tony Starks and Bruce Waynes of comic book fame — are all established, generationally wealthy billionaires who have the abundance of time and money to concern themselves with bigger, more worldly problems. Even Mission Impossible's IMF team is specifically hired to stop the bad guys for a large chunk of change. Everyone wants to be a hero, of course. But the crux of the issue is that, well, no one can afford to save the world for free.Truly passionate entrepreneurs can find themselves in a quandary when it comes to monetizing their efforts, especially when their primary motive isn't profit. When the harvest is for the greater good, whether for the gain of one person, the community or humanity as a whole, altruistic entrepreneurs find themselves frozen when forced to put a price on one's creation. The various scenarios where an entrepreneur might work for free:



Family or social obligations: The desire to support and share, coupled with the informal nature of such relationships, can lead to scenarios where work is heavily undervalued or under-compensated.Passion projects: When an entrepreneur is deeply invested in the results of a project, they might prioritize its completion or overvalue its impact without immediately thinking about the financial costs of the effort.Beta testing: Offering services for free for a case study or as a beta test could be a way for entrepreneurs to demonstrate results and capabilities to win business in the long run.Building skills and experience: Growing your skillset and gaining valuable experience can easily incentivize an entrepreneur to work without compensation as an apprentice or mentee, especially when it also offers a pathway to a new industry or network that isn't typically accessible to them.Market penetration: Offering free trials and sample work can help individuals and newer companies enter into a new market, launch a new product and attract a hard-to-reach customer base.The list of why an individual might work for free is exhaustive, and it can include many more incentives like strategic partnerships, philanthropic contributions and even educational purposes. The 2021 Volunteering in America Report found 60.7 million adults (23.2%) volunteered 4.1 billion hours. For an entrepreneur, unpaid or lowly paid work, though rich with potential, demands a slice of the entrepreneur's most precious resource: time.Related: The Only 2 Good Reasons to Work for Free


A currency of its own, time is paradoxically boundless and yet finite for the entrepreneur. The essence of the entrepreneurial spirit — ambition, passion and a relentless drive — can veer into murky waters if unchecked, especially when commitments continue to stack on top of one another.Many entrepreneurs work 60+ hours each week serving clients, juggling business operations, managing employees, volunteering and balancing family and friend obligations. But doing it all doesn't get a medal or the front page of the newspaper. In a survey of startup founders around the globe, Startup Snapshot found that 72% of founders struggle with mental health — with over 37% suffering from anxiety, 36% experiencing burnout and over 81% reporting that they feel the need to hide their stress, fears and challenges from others. Superheroes rarely count the toll their battles take on their psyche, and entrepreneurs too can overlook the mental and emotional expenditures of their quests.Another unintended dark side of entrepreneurial hero work is one that many so-called ""valued"" workers have faced before — in that the more that you do, the more that you're expected to do. Many clients, eager to capitalize on the dedication and availability of budding businesses, often feel at liberty to push boundaries, reaching out at all hours and expecting immediate responses. How often has a client called at 10 p.m. — or on a weekend — and expected urgent work to be completed without complaint, or more importantly, without additional compensation? For the new entrepreneurs who prioritize customer satisfaction above all, this could be a sincere opportunity to delight. But in the pursuit of building a reputation that shatters expectations, it begs the question: When does ambition become an exploitable liability rather than an asset?For an entrepreneur, how your time should be allocated is a decision that must be made with careful consideration — and for any initiative to continue to make a real and notable impact, it must also be financially viable. Time, effort and resources are all uniquely and equally as valuable to a growing business as the passion that fuels it.


Related: Entrepreneurship Can Be Draining — Try These 3 Strategies to Restore the Joy.To better navigate the relationship between generosity and professional standards, entrepreneurs can employ strategies that respect both their inherent value and entrepreneurial spirit, while still safeguarding their personal well-being. Here are some tips:Map out your schedule: There are only 24 hours in a day with no time-turner. Therefore, it is crucial to set limits around specific times when you are available for various types of work, including unpaid projects. The goal is to help manage expectations and prevent overcommitment.Set clear boundaries: Be upfront about the value and/or cost of your time. Communicate clearly when work is being offered as a favor, as a part of a strategic partnership or with the expectation of future reciprocity. Even between friends, a clear contract or agreement can help prevent future misunderstandings.Prioritize time management: Utilize time management tools and techniques to ensure that time is being allocated efficiently. Not all free work offers the same return when it comes to exposure, experience or potential business.Value one's work appropriately: Understand the market value of your services and strive to maintain that standard. It is always easier to start at a higher price that has a wider scope and work your price down rather than start too small.Keep tabs on one's contribution threshold: Regularly assessing one's contribution threshold helps to keep an eye on the entrepreneur's capacity tank. Driven by passion and motivation, a regular check-in provides a moment of reflection to assess whether time, energy and resources exerted are in balance with the benefits received. An imbalance can manifest into financial strain, lack of personal time or diminished passion for the work.Balance is imperative for sustaining the impact and viability of your endeavors. When it comes to the success of any venture, entrepreneurs must become comfortable in the space between fervor and practicality. Mastering these dueling motivations is crucial; acknowledging the true value of one's efforts ensures that the vision doesn't just survive the early stages of growth driven by motivation — it thrives with sufficient fuel and funds, without compromising the entrepreneur's mental, physical and emotional welfare in the attempt to change the world.Generosity in pursuit of vision should never overshadow an entrepreneur's professional worth. Time and energy is not infinite, but rather, finite.

2,The Most Innovative Leaders Use These 3 Mental Models to Unlock Their Best Ideas,"Apr 23, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/unlock-your-most-innovative-ideas-with-these-3-mental-models/471485,"
In a world where GPS is a thumb stroke away, most people take maps for granted. It's hard to fathom that the oldest surviving maps had little to do with reality. The Babylonian Map of the World, for example, was a clay tablet about the size of a first-generation iPhone. Created between 700 and 500 BC, the map shows Babylon in the middle, with the Euphrates River cutting through the center and the ocean on all sides. As Smithsonian Magazine explains, it wasn't a map for navigation — more of a way for the map-holder to understand the idea of the world around them. Accuracy was an afterthought.It would be centuries before an astronomer and astrologer named Claudius Ptolemy attempted the first realistic map — a two-dimensional depiction of what Ptolemy understood to be a spherical Earth. This is a prime example of when a great thinker applies a new mental model — essentially, a new way of thinking about things; a heuristic for interpreting the world. Rather than accepting earlier, more symbolic pictures of the Earth, Ptolemy ventured to create a true-to-life representation. He shifted the way of thinking from storytelling to describing reality.Mental models help us to understand things more fully and come up with smarter, more innovative solutions. But as Charlie Munger, former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., used to say, you have to build a ""latticework"" of mental models, employing various models to maximize your understanding of different situations.

3,10 Big Ways to Shine for National Small Business Week (and 5 Things to Avoid),"Apr 23, 2024",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/10-big-ways-to-shine-for-national-small-business-week/471698,"
Small business is big business. More than half of all Americans either own a small business or work for one, and two out of three new American jobs are small-business jobs. National Small Business Week is a yearly event, one too few businesses take advantage of.For all the things Americans disagree about, small business is one they all support: According to Pew Research Center, 86% of Americans were reported to have a favorable opinion about small businesses in February (up from 80% in October of 2022).With big-time government support and the favor of almost every American, you should be taking advantage of National Small Business Week.Related: One Founder's Super-Sized Side Hustle Is Helping Small Businesses — and It's On Track to Generate More Than $50 Million This YearWhat to doNational Small Business Week is a great opportunity to remind customers, prospects and your community that you're in business, that you're an important part of the American economy and that you're an important part of the community. Through a few basic activities, you can leverage your community's predisposition to favor you. If you do it right, you'll find yourself with a few extra dollars in your pocket. You'll strengthen ties with current customers and connect with potential customers.



Keep these six basic goals in mind as you plan.Create awareness. Do something that tells everyone that you're a small business in the community.Thank your customers. Do something that shows your customers you appreciate their business.Tell your story. Explain who you are, what your business is and how you connect with customers and the community.Team up with other small businesses. Displaying a ""we're-all-in-it-together"" front to the community adds good feelings and keeps shoppers and customers in the neighborhood. This strategy is ideal when your business complements another (for instance, a home painting business and a landscaper, or a dogwalker and a veterinary clinic).Network.

Many start with a free trial option; this email is a great opportunity to test them out. (And if you don't have an email list: make one!)Make a local promotion. Remind people that your business is part of their community. What you do will depend on your business, but some ideas can include discounts, buy-one-get-one-free, a free sample or trial service or a giveaway item for business conducted during the week. Announce it by email, a sign in your window or buy an ad in your local newspaper or community web page. Then track how well it works by comparing sales or web page codes. A document management system (DMS) helps handle the tracking by scanning all your receipts and invoices and assigning them to this promotion.Unpaid local media. Talk to your local media about doing a story on National Small Business Week and mention you're participating. They may wind up mentioning you in their story or even doing a remote from your venue if you've got a brick-and-mortar location.

4,How to Own Your Place at the Table as a Minority Leader,"Apr 22, 2024",Charity Hudnall,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-own-your-place-at-the-table-as-a-minority-leader/472620,"
I remember when I got a job at my first big tech company. Walking into my office on my first day, I was brimming with excitement and ideas. I was going to work directly with the CEO — amazing, right? But it didn't take long for me to realize that the environment I had joined was vastly different from what I had anticipated.First, I was the only minority woman in the boardroom, which made me feel like I had to accept the role I was given. Then, at a company led by an overpowering CEO whose mantra was ""execute, don't elaborate,"" I often felt more like a parrot than a partner. I became really good at capturing my boss's voice. I knew exactly the stories he wanted to tell and how he wanted to articulate them. But I didn't own the role, and most of my ideas were left unsaid.In my over 20 years of marketing leadership and management experience, I have learned to stand up for myself in rooms full of people who looked nothing like me. To minority women entrepreneurs and executives still establishing themselves, here are three steps to own your place at the table rather than be content to just be in the room.



Related: Don't Just Sit At the Table, Flip It. A Reflection for Women Entrepreneurs.1. Understand the landscapeEvery workplace is like a little world, complete with its own secret codes and power players. If you take time to observe and learn the lay of the land, you will find yourself getting around way smoother.


Get social, ask many questions, and start building relationships with those around you. This is your chance to see where you fit in. What are your strengths and weaknesses? How do your skills complement others'?To truly own your place at the table, it's crucial to grasp the immediate tasks at hand and the broader context in which your work sits. What are the industry trends? How competitive is the landscape? How does your individual role contribute to the organization's long-term goals?Remember, humility in the workplace means recognizing that there is always more to learn. It's about being open to feedback, being willing to admit when you don't have all the answers, and being eager to grow from each experience.Related: How I Earned My Seat at the Table


2. Do your homeworkImagine if someone new came into your company and said: ""I've been working for 25 years in this industry. We're gonna do it my way or the highway."" Wouldn't you be turned off?So, take the time to research and understand your organization's business model, history and culture. Studies show that ""people-first"" cultures can drive amazing outcomes. According to Gallup, companies that prioritize culture see a 33% increase in revenue.This means understanding your company's culture can make a massive difference in how your performance is graded. For one, this knowledge will help you do your job better and also enable you to make informed contributions during discussions. Then, you are showing that you are more than just a participant — but an invested and knowledgeable team member. I always tell my team that your product is going to be so much better if you have done your due diligence rather than if you go into meetings cold. Be prepared.3. Approach what you know with confidenceMichelle Obama once said: ""Whether you come from a council estate or a country estate, your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude."" Obama had to endure some of the most unfair criticisms as First Lady. She was called ""strikingly ungracious,"" not ""classy enough,"" and a ""feminist nightmare"" by people with half her talent. But did she let those words stop her? Of course not, because as she's demonstrated time and time again, confidence starts with you.


Owning your achievements and standing tall in your space is crucial, but there is a magical balance between confidence and humility that makes interactions richer and more productive. Envision yourself walking into a room, head held high with the knowledge of your successes, yet your heart is open, ready to listen, learn and grow. This balance isn't just about being approachable; it is a powerful leadership style that fosters a culture of respect, collaboration and mutual support.Anybody can be a good soldier. Anybody can participate in the way they think is best for their boss. But in my experience, I had to ask myself: Am I really growing? What part of myself am I adding to this organization? My experience at the tech company was a glaring example of the nuanced barriers that minority women executives and leaders face in the corporate world.But I want to take this opportunity to change this narrative a bit. Stereotypes exist, but the unfortunate reality is that they are not going anywhere anytime soon. So, we must protect our confidence as minority women by realizing that we are worthy and capable of overcoming these wrongful assumptions. If you are not believable, how do you expect anyone to value your words? Understanding the value you bring and having the confidence to do so is crucial.Related: 3 Ways to Support Minority-Owned Businesses


Shaping your reality through mindsetYour mindset is more powerful than any list of stereotypes you can muster. It is the foundation upon which you construct your reality, break down barriers and redefine what is possible for yourself. To my fellow minority women leaders, you do know what you are talking about. You took the time to build those relationships. You do have the experience. So, leave the stereotypes at the door.The journey towards owning your achievements and asserting your presence is as much about inner work as external actions. By committing to changing your mindset and dedicating yourself to thorough preparation, you lay down the stones on the path to building unwavering confidence, even amid the loudest naysayers' objections.

5,The SEC's New Climate Transparency Rules Mean Sustainability Isn't Just a Buzzword Anymore — Here's How to Embrace It.,"Apr 22, 2024",Christine Wetzler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/green-entrepreneur/what-the-secs-new-climate-transparency-rules-mean-for-you/470994,"
Discussing sensitive topics can be challenging for business owners. This is one of the top three or four reasons I receive initial calls for public relations assistance addressing a hot-button issue. The latest confusing trend is sustainability and how to talk about it openly. Surprisingly, people need clarification about how much to talk about it, why it's important and when to bring it up. There's even a new word for this fear: ""greenhushing.""The most recent bit of pressure on companies regarding eco-messaging is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) recent efforts to enforce regulations that protect investors and maintain market integrity. Basically, the SEC has revised environmental transparency rules and introduced mandatory climate risk disclosures for public companies.This is the first time a sustainability mandate has emerged nationally, and it's expected to have a notable impact. In my opinion, even for private companies, it's a call to pay attention and stop neglecting this discussion.



We are entering an era where climate objectives, targets and governance frameworks will become mandatory in corporate reporting. This shift also aligns with the increasing consumer demand for environmentally and ethically sustainable products — a trend that, despite its popularity, has seen many companies struggle to translate into tangible demand.Related: Sustainability for Entrepreneurs — Why It Matters (and How to Achieve It).


The paradox of consumer demand and greenwashingConsumers' enthusiasm for sustainable products often starkly contrasts with their actual purchasing behavior. While surveys indicate a robust desire for sustainability, sales frequently need to catch up to expectations for new, environmentally conscious products. This discrepancy is exacerbated by greenwashing — where claims of environmental stewardship are not backed by practice — further eroding consumer trust and complicating the landscape for genuine initiatives.I'd counsel any company today to prepare for sustainability discussions and engagement. It is now an unavoidable topic. Because I have been a fractional CMO and external public relations consultant since 2002, I've received many calls from companies facing these watershed moments. Here is the advice I'd give a leadership team aiming to be more vocal about sustainability.The imperative of transparencyIn this context, the necessity for transparency is undeniable. Beyond mere regulatory compliance, transparency is crucial for cultivating consumer trust and loyalty. Companies must now proactively measure and refine their approaches to climate change, so this journey has got to start with a comprehensive understanding of your environmental footprint, including greenhouse gas emissions, resource utilization and waste generation.Typically facilitated by external consultants or an internal sustainability team, this foundational assessment is critical for setting realistic sustainability goals and improvement strategies. Employing standardized tools and frameworks like the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Life Cycle Assessment provides a methodical approach to this task and will result in data and benchmarks you can use consistently in your messaging efforts.


Armed with this data, specific and time-bound goals can be set that meet compliance requirements (if necessary) and drive significant environmental and social improvements. Engaging stakeholders, particularly employees, at this stage, helps bring to the surface any practical concerns and integrate these insights into the goal-setting process.Related: 70% of Consumers Say They'll Buy 'Green' Products, but Only 5% Actually Do. That's Due to a Common Marketing Mistake By Eco-Friendly Brands.The role of public relations in implementationPublic relations in the realm of sustainable messaging goes beyond just issuing press releases. PR is a strategic tool for amplifying and embedding climate-change initiatives into the corporate ethos. Compelling storytelling highlighting a company's progress and impacts on sustainability can significantly boost its reputation and foster third-party credibility.Leveraging various channels — from press releases and social media to comprehensive sustainability reports — enables these stories to reach and resonate with a broad audience, sparking engagement and advancing the sustainability agenda.


Cultivating a sustainability-centric culture internally is essential. Companies can ensure that sustainability principles are deeply ingrained in every aspect of their operation through regular educational programs, active participation in sustainability initiatives and acknowledgment of individual and team contributions. This not only reinforces the company's commitment to sustainability among employees but also mobilizes them and other stakeholders as ambassadors of these values.Continuous monitoring and evaluation of sustainability initiatives and how they are being perceived in public are vital measurement points to consider when assessing progress. Like any meaningful initiative, setting and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) allow companies to measure effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. Further, engaging with employees and stakeholders through feedback will enrich this process and provide real-world insights.It seems counterintuitive, but in my experience, challenge is often in partnership with opportunity. Tackling tough subjects can uncover opportunities for innovation, stakeholder engagement and corporate accountability that otherwise would've been dormant. Talking specifically about sustainability is not always about compliance. It is a chance to appeal to buyers and lead the market with integrity, innovation and vision.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Meta's large language model and AI assistant are getting upgrades.



On Thursday, the company released the first models of Llama 3 in two sizes, 8B and 70B parameters. They've also been integrated into Meta AI, the company's AI assistant.""With this new model, we believe Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday in an Instagram post.


Meta said in a blog post Thursday its newest models saw ""substantially reduced false refusal rates, improved alignment, and increased diversity in model responses,"" as well as progress in reasoning, generating code, and instruction.""With Llama 3, we set out to build the best open models that are on par with the best proprietary models available today,"" the post reads. ""This next generation of Llama demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of industry benchmarks and offers new capabilities, including improved reasoning. We believe these are the best open source models of their class, period.""Though Meta bills Llama as open-source, Llama 2 required companies with more than 700 million monthly active users to request a license from the company to use it, which Meta may or may not grant.In the near future, Meta hopes to ""make Llama 3 multilingual and multimodal, have longer context, and continue to improve overall performance across core LLM capabilities such as reasoning and coding,"" the company said in the blog post.


So what do the changes mean for Meta AI now?The AI assistant can help with tasks like recommending restaurants, planning trips, and making your emails sound more professional.Using Meta AI's Imagine feature also now produces sharper images faster: They'll start to appear as you're typing and change ""with every few letters typed,"" according to a press release issued Thursday.Meta AI is available across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and on browsers. The company says multimodal Meta AI is also coming to its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses soon. It's rolling out in English in over a dozen countries outside the US.


As for what comes next, Meta says it's working on models over 400B parameters that are still in training.""I don't think that today many people really think about Meta AI when they think about the main AI assistants that people use,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told The Verge in an article published Thursday. ""But I think that this is the moment where we're really going to start introducing it to a lot of people, and I expect it to be quite a major product.""Meta AI, of course, faces stiff competition from better-known AI assistants, including the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and Anthropic's Claude.

7,You Won't Have a Strong Leadership Presence Until You Master These 5 Attributes,"Apr 18, 2024",Don Weber,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-five-basics-you-need-to-master-to-develop-an-executive/472738,"
Consider the most impactful leaders you've encountered. What about them made you eager to trust and follow their lead? Perhaps they possessed a subtle yet unmistakable ""presence"" — a magnetic aura that commanded respect and instilled confidence.This intangible quality, often referred to as ""executive presence,"" is a potent force in leadership. This article delves into the essence of executive presence, its significance in today's competitive landscape, and actionable steps to cultivate it. Join me as we explore the vital components distinguishing ordinary leaders from those who inspire, influence and leave a lasting impression.Related: This Leadership Technique is the Secret to Optimal Team Performance



What is executive presence?Executive presence is the projection of authority and credibility, and your signature presence defines your personal and professional brand. It encompasses the unique blend of demeanor, communication style and demeanor that distinguishes you as a leader.Individuals with executive presence maintain a detectable, but undefinable, attitude about themselves. Although others might not be able to put their finger on why they want to follow these leaders, they will be more inclined to trust them.


David Roberts, CEO of Verra Mobility, recently defined executive presence as ""the total combined manner by which an executive ""shows up"" for the job of leadership. It's that unique combination of skills, style, actions and reactions in service to the goal of leading your employees forward and driving organizational results.""The strength of your executive presence can also be gauged by how others perceive and respond to you in professional settings. It influences how you are perceived by colleagues, stakeholders, and industry peers, ultimately shaping your career trajectory and your leadership's impact.How to develop executive presenceExecutive presence isn't a skill you're necessarily born with. Fortunately, that means anybody can develop this skill!It is crucial to remember that developing executive presence is both an inner and outer game. If you are a poor leader internally, you will be a poor leader externally. Executive presence involves cultivating the skills of a leader and projecting them strategically and consistently.


Related: How to Develop an Executive Presence and Earn RespectDeveloping inner executive presenceBefore we discuss the external features of executive presence, we must address the ""inner game"" of executive presence.This inner game of executive presence refers to self-awareness, or a profound understanding of one's values, emotions, and behaviors. This self-awareness forms the bedrock of emotional intelligence, enabling active listening, emotional agility, and controlled emotional reactivity. It's this internal alignment that radiates confidence, calmness, and composure in professional interactions.Recognizing that internal character incongruencies can inadvertently surface in external nonverbal communication, decisions, and actions is crucial. The stories of Adam Neumann of WeWork, Trevor Milton of Nikola, Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos and Rajat Gupta of McKinsey & Company serve as cautionary examples. While they initially exhibited high executive presence, their lack of ethics and integrity ultimately eroded their credibility.


The great news is we can always improve our internal selves and therefore benefit others through our external presence and actions. For instance, if you identify difficulty in managing stress, seeking coaching or therapy can foster healthier internal coping mechanisms that will reflect positively in your external demeanor and decision-making.Related: How to Develop Self-Awareness and Become a More Effective LeaderNow that we've explored the foundational aspects of building an internal executive presence, let's shift our focus to developing the following external attributes that will amplify your leadership impact and project a compelling executive presence.1. Positive body languageEffective communication begins with active listening and thoughtful responses. Letting others speak first, actively listening, and then speaking clearly and concisely demonstrates respect and authority. Thoughtful gestures such as nodding affirmatively and maintaining open body posture convey engagement and confidence.

AppearanceThe significance of appearance in leadership dates back to ancient civilizations, wherein attire signified status and authority. Research consistently shows that a well-groomed appearance commands respect and fosters positive impressions. Pay attention to grooming, attire, and personal presentation to align with professional standards and enhance your executive presence.Related: Five Tips to Optimize Your Appearance for Business Success3. ConfidenceConfidence is a learnable trait that emanates from within and is reflected in external demeanor. It's not just about physical posture — true confidence is about controlling your environment and projecting assurance through gestures, voice tone, and spatial presence. Walk purposefully, maintain eye contact, and use deliberate gestures to convey confidence and credibility.


4. Intonation and cadenceThe tone and cadence of your voice convey confidence and command attention. Speak with clarity, emphasizing key points with controlled intonation. Practice modulating your voice to convey authority and conviction while also maintaining a calm and composed demeanor.5. Trust through consistencyConsistency is essential for building trust and credibility. Ensure your actions and behaviors align with your core values and leadership principles. Consistent leadership fosters trust among colleagues and stakeholders, enhancing your executive presence and influence.Remember, executive presence is not merely a set of skills — it's a holistic approach to leadership that integrates authenticity, confidence and professionalism in all aspects of your professional journey. By honing these external attributes while nurturing your internal self-awareness and integrity, you can cultivate a compelling executive presence that inspires trust, drives results, and leaves a lasting impact on those around you.

8,How to Make the Most of In-Person Gatherings for Remote and Hybrid Teams,"Apr 17, 2024",Cheri Beranek,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-make-the-most-of-in-person-gatherings-for-remote-and/472430,"
In February, at our annual ""Return to the Mothership,"" as I call it, our team came together to spend three days at an airport hotel in Minnesota. We wanted attendees to be able to fly where they needed without stepping outside into the cold Minneapolis winter. There was even a direct connection via mass transit to the Mall of America for sightseeing, but the place itself was not where everyone found the most value.Since the pandemic, people have been less engaged and more disconnected from their company's mission and purpose. A strong workplace culture can create healthier, happier, and more productive people who stick around and increase profits. Still, as leaders adopt greater remote and hybrid flexibility, that culture becomes harder to achieve.Regular in-person gatherings help us bridge that gap for our mostly hybrid company. We spend a lot of money on our annual event, but the cultural boost and energy lift we receive in return is always worth the investment. Rather than considering the cost of holding these in-person experiences, I evaluate if I drew out the most possible value from them. Here's what I consider:



Related: 5 Things You Need to Bridge The Gap Between In-Person and Remote MeetingsDo what is digitally impossibleDesign in-person activities that can only be done in person. Rather than on-screen product demos, we put products into people's hands. Instead of speakers in big lecture halls that could be watched over Zoom, we rent many small rooms for round-robin exchanges between small groups. In-person training should go beyond skills development to ensure alignment around the leader's vision, direction, and path. At the heart of every activity, consider all possible ways it can drive and blend culture.


Even lunch can be an opportunity. Encourage team members to get to know coworkers with whom they might not normally socialize. Gallup data has long connected having close friends at work to higher engagement, a stronger culture and increased profitability. These are business outcomes that, since the pandemic, have become even more pronounced. Some experts estimate a high degree of belonging among employees can save a 10,000-person company $52 million a year. Taking every advantage to promote meaningful connections in person can be an effective way to build that sense of community.Related: The 3 Meetings You Should Have for Remote WorkersConsider everyone in the roomPlan activities with the needs of all attending groups in mind. Most of our salespeople are remote and might need more support to feel connected. Rather than keeping them separate, we plan their time with others by considering shared needs. We held one large group sales training but restructured the conversation to accommodate the inclusion of non-salespeople. By helping accountants better understand the goals of the people requesting commission checks, they can more easily build relationships and improve cross-departmental collaboration.What people want out of in-person gatherings may be different, so ask. When our company was smaller, we knew one another's spouses and families and often included them in team gatherings. Today, our workforce is larger, younger, and less oriented toward spousal or family events. Compared to an in-person gathering of 200 employees, a 400-person event, including spouses, is much more expensive. By asking what my team members want, I can determine if that extra cost is needed or if $100 gift certificates to recognize a spouse's support would be more appreciated.


Related: 5 Unconventional Ways to Boost Remote Work Culture and Enhance ProductivityTiming is everythingWe used to hold our annual gathering in October at the launch of our fiscal year, but last year, we were in transition and unable to dedicate our focus to the event. So, we delayed until February, but cancellation fees cost us an incremental 20 to 25% of the whole event. Still, if we had paid the full expense and called everyone into the field without being ready to offer them an event worth attending, the negative energy in response would have been much more devastating.As it turned out, rescheduling the event gave us an energy boost, leading to our busiest time of year and maximizing our annual opportunity. To help sustain that elevated energy, we also encourage smaller gatherings throughout the year as needed. Our regional sales teams meet several times a year, while our inside sales group prefers to meet quarterly. Schedule in-person events with enough frequency to sustain the resulting energy from one gathering to the next and, if lagging, adding another might be a valuable investment.Related: Don't Make Your Team Dread Meetings — Try These Tips Instead


Follow up and improveAsking for feedback ensures that efforts to bring people together in person are most effective. Our leadership team monitors the event throughout for signs of enjoyment or discontent. We also ask people to share what they liked most as the event wraps up. Within the week following, we send out a formal survey requesting feedback on each part of the agenda, including factors like the environment, hotel, and event dates. Finally, we discussed our notes as a planning committee to adjust and improve for the following year.This year, we tried to help people mitigate agenda conflicts with their day-to-day jobs. Rather than setting aside another 15 minutes of unassigned free time, we built intentional breaks into the day dedicated to doing work. We also asked people to prioritize that time for work and free themselves from distractions the rest of the day. Be direct in asking employees for buy-in and start early, long before the gathering happens. By getting people to invest their focus on the special environment, we better ensure they get as much out of it as we do.Despite a mild winter, we got lucky this year, and it snowed — a picture-perfect dusting. We had attendees from across the country and beyond, including from our Mexican manufacturing team, who had never seen snow. We all watched with shared joy as they got on the ground to make snow angels for the first time — a moment I could never have planned and will probably never be able to recreate. As long as we set the stage to maximize authentic connections, some of the most meaningful interactions happen when we simply sit back and let them.

9,Renowned Psychologist Adam Grant Says This 3-Step Leadership Method Will Help Fight Employee Burnout,"Apr 16, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/adam-grant-these-3-steps-will-help-fight-employee-burnout/472803,"
Let's face it — U.S. workers are burned out.Research from Aflac on the stress levels of U.S.-based workers found that over 50% of respondents experienced burnout in 2023, and nearly 75% reported having moderate stress levels at work.But organizational psychologist and bestselling author Adam Grant, a go-to expert for mindset and organizational habits, says that leaders in the workplace are to blame, not burned-out employees.



Adam Grant onstage during a panel at the 2022 Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit (Brian Stukes/Getty Images)""I think about burnout as a sense of emotional exhaustion that's both persistent and impairing, meaning it's not just a blip — it sticks. It also interferes with your ability to function,"" Grant told Entrepreneur at BetterUp's Uplift conference last week. ""It's a structural and cultural problem if you have more than one person burning out. That is a challenge to tackle in your organization that leaders need to be responsible for.""


Related: 5 Ways Leaders Can Fight Burnout CultureAs the issue of burnout continues to plague employees and their employers, Grant, a Wharton professor, said the solution is to focus on what he calls the ""demand, control, support"" method of leadership that can help employees find meaning and motivation in their work — and tackle burnout in the process.Grant broke down his strategy for us below using data from Return to Office Insights researched by BetterUp Labs.DemandGrant says leaders need to examine what the demands are that are causing burnout in the first place.


""That has to do with overload, that's having too much work, it's having work that doesn't have clear expectations, it's being expected to be on 24/7,"" Grant says. ""Those kinds of demands are taxing. We need to figure out if there are pockets of people who are burning out with similar kinds of work — that's a sign to me that the demands are excessive.""Reducing demands can mean anything from hiring more staff to delegating responsibilities, but the end goal should always be to make employee demands ""more manageable.""ControlBut sometimes demands can't be eliminated. For example, if you work at a startup and customers are placing orders from all around the world, eliminating hours might not work. Instead, Grant says companies can give employees more control over their day.""What we can do is to try to give more choice and more freedom around how you manage those demands,"" Grant explains. ""We want to give people control over what they're working on, when they do it, who they do it with how they get it done. And those sources of autonomy tend to make demands more manageable is the general finding."" 


Grant also said that today's employees prefer controlling their office hours and want to have a more flexible work environment. Offering this control back to the employees could be effective in mitigating burnout.""There's been a lot of discussion about where we work as a form of flexibility. My read of the evidence is that people want discretion over when they work more than where they work,"" Grant explained. ""So if you give people the flexibility to set their own hours, they are very happy to come to the office, if that's a tug of war.""SupportGrant says ""support"" is about ""giving people the tools that they need to cope with demands"" in the workplace and making mental health a priority.""It's also about building a culture where [employees] feel that they can be candid about their emotional well-being and seek help if they need it,"" he said.But telling employees that you prioritize mental health and actually making them feel comfortable talking about it are two different things, he says.The most effective way to combat this, he says, is when a leader sets an example and is open about needing to take time off for mental health reasons and fostering an open dialogue amongst employees when they're struggling.""I think modeling that makes it clear to people at all levels that this is not just lip service, we're not just claiming that you can take care of yourself, we're actually demonstrating through our own behavior that it's acceptable and encouraged around here,"" Grant says. ""It's been frustrating to watch a lot of companies say, alright, we have a burnout problem, we're going to give you mindfulness training or we're going to teach you stress management skills as if this is not a psychological problem.""

10,5 Ways to Move Forward After Shutting Down Your Business,"Apr 16, 2024",Philip Blackett,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-move-forward-after-shutting-down-your-business/472327,"
When entrepreneurs start a business, we envision it succeeding beyond our wildest dreams. But what happens when reality does not align with our goals and vision for our business? How do we recover and move forward after closing down our business?I experienced a similar nightmare when I shut down one of my businesses after battling the recent pandemic. Now, several months after making such a tough decision, I want to share five ways you can move forward from an unfortunate business failure.1. Give yourself time to grieveYour business may have been a labor of love or even your baby. It's hard to face the facts and move on. Be fair to yourself and give yourself time to grieve the loss, even if it is frustrating and heartbreaking to the point of tears. You cannot truly move on to the next chapter while still holding on to what could have been in the old chapter.

Reconnect with loved ones and recover from burnoutLeading up to the decision to close your business, you likely exhausted all possible options. You used all your physical, mental and emotional energy in the process. Now that it's over, give yourself the freedom to relax, recover and rejuvenate. It may mean taking a trip outside your city for a few days in a new setting.


Consider unwinding to movies you had meant to watch but had no time or picking up that hobby you abandoned while building your business. This is a great time to surround yourself with family and loved ones who love you beyond the business and can support you regarding the next steps.Related: The 10 Warning Signs of Employee Burnout and How to Handle It3. Reflect on your past journey and consider possible next stepsOnce you have had time to grieve and recover emotionally, now you are in a position to consider what's next in your life. Take inventory of the lessons you learned from your experience running your business beforehand. It may help to document them, so you can carry them into your next adventure. You can also share such lessons with other aspiring entrepreneurs or colleagues who are running businesses. Ask yourself what you can see yourself doing in the next chapter and start researching what that would look like and what the first few next steps to pursue.4. Consider getting a ""bridge job""Once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur, right? Well, running a business is not for the fainthearted. Some former entrepreneurs may desire the security of a paycheck and fewer responsibilities that they had as an owner accountable to everyone. While you consider the next steps, it may be a good idea to take a mental break from your previous responsibilities and get yourself back to work, even if it is working for someone else on a temporary basis. Doing work that provides a regular paycheck for you and your family can help you stay active, take down the mental workload you once had, and give you oxygen — and money — while you consider your next move.


Related: What To Do If Your Company Shuts Down5. Make a decision: stay an employee or launch out as an entrepreneur againNow that you have had some time to grieve, recover, reflect, and even work again, only you can make the decision whether you want to build a business again. You may be in a better position to consider collaborating with others to build again or consider building on your own. Give yourself a suitable timeline (ideally between 3-12 months) to decide your next steps and then commit to your next adventure all the way.Recovering from failure is never easy. Your dreams are broken. You may feel like a failure in the eyes of your family, friends, and fellow entrepreneur community. However, one of the biggest lessons I learned as an entrepreneur is that success does not happen in a straight line. Failure is part of the process. Depending on your mindset, you can view failure as a stepping stone to your subsequent success or as a barrier that dissuades you from ever trying again. Mental toughness and resilience are built not only through the ups and downs of running your own business but also when you have to make a tough decision to close down and move on with your life.The good news is that you are not alone in experiencing failure. You do not have to be an entrepreneur to know what failure feels like. You live long enough, and you realize that everyone has to respond to the failures and misfortunes they experience. It is not a question of whether or not you will fail. It is more a question of how you will respond when failure knocks on your door, even when you least expect it. I hope these five ways can help you recover from your business failure and build the courage to forge a new adventure on your entrepreneurial path.

  Many of Your Employees Are Probably Healing From Past Workplace Trauma. Here's How You Can Help Empower Them.
  
    There is no magic way of healing people of their preexisting workplace trauma — but leaders can (and should want to) help.

      Key Takeaways    



        Toxic workplace environments can cause trauma, leading to fear, insecurity and diminished effectiveness among employees.
      


        Leaders and managers have a crucial role in creating a positive work culture by aligning their actions with company values and fostering trust through consistent behavior.
      


        Regular check-ins, authentic recognition and emotional safety all support healing from past traumas and lead to stronger, more committed teams.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""Are you stupid?""The words are harsh, even to look at. I could never imagine saying them to a member of my team.Yet, when I set out to write this article and asked everyone in my company to talk about workplace trauma, these were among their experiences: CEOs calling people stupid in a meeting; managers blowing up over small mistakes or lying about a promotion; feeling stressed and being yelled at every single day. Fifteen percent of my employees were willing to share their stories. Some were hard to believe.



Most surprising was how prevalent workplace trauma is. Not big ""T"" trauma that results from dangerous or criminal behavior, but rather ""little t"" trauma that still causes serious harm, but results from poor leadership. Toxic work environments leave people feeling unworthy, incompetent and unhappy, diminishing their potential contribution to a company. While it does take individual responsibility to work through trauma from one job to the next, leaders and managers can and should want to help empower them to heal.Related: How Managers Can Dismantle Workplace Trauma


The horror storiesTrust is easy to lose and harder to gain, but a history with toxic leaders can make that even worse. At every traumatic workplace, my employees reported hearing the same messages: ""We're transparent,"" ""a family"" and ""We trust you to do your work."" Then, the inconsistencies began. One described a former manager, who spread negative gossip and was hypercritical of even the smallest mistakes, as leaving her with PTSD. One called his particularly condescending former manager a ""nonviolent psychopath.""Even after leaving a toxic company, employees risk carrying that trauma to their next workplace. They may read articles on spotting a healthy culture, even join a new team, hopeful, but any signs of toxic behavior and they quickly lose that optimism. Many stay, feeling trapped without options or economic stability, but the more time spent in these toxic work environments, the deeper they instill fear and insecurity. Without healing, people carry that trauma with them, reducing the potential value they might contribute or desire to contribute to any future company.The impact of leadersLeadership behavior sets the tone for the entire organization. In my 30-year career, I have never yelled because yelling would be incongruent with my expressed beliefs that mistakes are opportunities for growth and continuous improvement. When words and actions are inconsistent, an employee who experienced trauma will be quicker to lose all trust in that company's leadership.While the vision and actions of senior leadership lay the foundation for a supportive workplace culture, daily experiences with direct management and coworkers have the greatest impact. As a CEO, I can equip managers with the tools they need to build trusting relationships and empower them to support healing, so we hired someone to package the insights and skills of our top-performing managers into a training program. By training them in effective communication, recognizing trauma and fostering an emotionally safe environment, leaders can help managers mitigate the effects of past traumas on the rest of the workplace.


Related: Why Trauma Integration Will Give You a Competitive Advantage in LeadershipRebuild with consistencyTo rebuild trust after a traumatic experience, consistency is key. Leaders and managers need to do more than talk about emotional intelligence and living company values — they need to visibly and consistently demonstrate actions that measure up with those words over time. One team member remarked how surprised he was that the CEO would email him to recognize his efforts only days after joining the team, but even more so that every ongoing experience with leadership since has aligned with that behavior.Start working to rebuild trust from day one. One person commented on the authenticity and transparency he felt in having his first interview with the CEO and how, after over nearly four years with us, that has continued. Most of my employees recalled smaller, day-to-day events making the biggest difference — supportive emails, free movie tickets and flexibility to handle last-minute emergencies. They also mentioned opportunities for team bonding over non-work topics, like our Vegas trip and book club, as helpful in releasing trauma by calming concerns that coworkers might cause similar problems.Plan, assess and improveThere is no magic way to heal people of their preexisting trauma, but regular check-ins are the best way to help. It can be uncomfortable speaking about toxic experiences, but one-on-one, managers can more easily draw out, identify and help resolve individual workplace challenges. Create a standardized process to ensure consistent experiences and leverage technology platforms to facilitate scheduling and clear communication.


HR can be valuable in supporting these check-ins: taking in employee feedback, assisting managers or participating themselves. When we hired an HR leader, she took over regular one-on-ones and her open-ended questions were incredibly successful in unearthing past workplace trauma. Her ability to make people feel comfortable garnered valuable feedback, which has built stronger relationships and done so much good for the company.When check-ins are successful, recognize and reward the efforts behind that success. One employee described the profound impact of a simple ""thank you"" on his trust in leadership and organizational commitment. By exemplifying and sharing stories of successful check-ins, leaders encourage an environment of supportive manager-employee interactions.Related: Career Trauma Is a Real Thing. Here's How to Recognize and Recover From It.Our positive resultsAt a social event in February, we invited everyone to send their coworkers Valentines expressing how special it was to work together. The next day, we received the messages others sent us and a second wave of positive feelings. Then, people took to social media and deepened the impact: ""Amazing to wake up and read all the love from our Influence Mobile family. Thank you for encouraging such an enjoyable and positive workplace environment."" That single spark of positivity became contagious.


No one can heal someone else's trauma, but leaders can do a lot to facilitate their healing journey. By fostering a culture of consistency and support between employees, managers and coworkers, we can build a work environment where people overcome past workplace trauma.

12,How to Overtake Your Competition With Creative Brand Precision,"Apr 10, 2024",Bora Celik,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/disruption-through-design-how-brands-can-beat-out-their/471347,"
What do you do when every shelf and screen overflows with options? Your brand needs to do more than show up; it must shine. Exceptional design is a significant way to shine. It goes beyond colors and logos to become a story, a feeling, a memorable moment. More than aesthetics, it's about wielding design as a strategic tool to cut through the noise and as a deliberate strategy to disrupt the status quo.My first startup, Jukely, excelled in design. My co-founder was an incredible designer, one of the first designers at Kickstarter. Through his design vision, we kickstarted a movement by innovating in a stale space and created the world's first concert subscription service. Our product was featured as one of the best apps multiple times in Apple's app store, which gave us credibility.At the core of this exploration is a belief in the power of design to alter perceptions. In this article, I explore how challenger brands can stand out through striking design and how they draw a clear line between them and the incumbents.



Related: 4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win HeartsStanding out: The real dealNavigating the crowded marketplace today is like finding your voice in a roaring concert. Every brand is vying for attention, hoping to leave a lasting impression. This challenge requires more than just traditional advertising or a flashy logo. It demands a strategic approach to design — a method that intertwines aesthetics with function, creating an experience that resonates deeply with consumers.


The essence of standing out lies in the ability to merge visual appeal with storytelling, ensuring that every interaction with the brand is not just seen but felt. This approach transforms casual browsers into loyal customers, encouraging them to choose your brand amidst a sea of options. Design, in this context, acts as the silent ambassador of your brand, speaking volumes without uttering a single word.Keep it simpleToday's consumer is bombarded with choices, making the decision-making process increasingly complex. In this chaos, simplicity becomes a beacon of clarity and assurance. Brands that master the art of distilling their message into clean, innovative design capture attention and earn trust.Ritual demonstrates this beautifully by stripping away the unnecessary and focusing on what matters. By introducing a clear, minimalist bottle that showcases its equally transparent capsules, Ritual invites consumers into a visual and physical experience of openness and honesty. Their minimalist packaging is a testament to their philosophy, highlighting the quality and thoughtfulness of what's inside. It's a bold statement in an industry often cluttered with claims and counterclaims, providing a clear, unambiguous message about the brand's values and commitment to transparency. This simplicity extends to the user experience, making the journey from discovery to purchase seamless and straightforward.Related: Why Brands are Simplifying Their Logos and Visual Identity


Connecting on a deeper levelThe power of design transcends mere aesthetics; it has the potential to evoke feelings and forge emotional connections. When a product transcends its utility and becomes a part of the consumer's identity, it has achieved something remarkable. Brightland's approach to olive oil packaging illustrates this perfectly.By engaging artists to create visually stunning labels, they turn each bottle into a collector's item, a token of beauty that stands out in the monotony of kitchen staples. Each bottle becomes a conversation piece, a medium through which consumers share their tastes and values. I've seen numerous reviews where the reviewer was attracted to the brand based on how the bottles would look in their kitchen. This deeper connection is what transforms first-time buyers into brand evangelists, creating a community of users who don't just use the product but love and advocate for it.Related: How to Design an Eye-Catching Website That Truly Captures Your AudienceStorytime through designA well-crafted design does more than please the eye; it serves as a window into the soul of the brand, inviting consumers into a narrative that captivates and enchants. Onyx Coffee's award-winning packaging is a masterclass in this art of storytelling. Each bag is meticulously designed to hint at the unique story of its origin, processing method, and flavor profile. This narrative approach transforms the act of purchasing coffee into an exploratory adventure, inviting consumers to experience the journey from farm to cup. The packaging serves as a prelude to the product itself, setting expectations and building anticipation.


This level of engagement ensures that Onyx doesn't just sell coffee; it offers an immersive experience that begins at the point of sale and continues to the last sip. It's a testament to how thoughtful design can elevate a brand, turning everyday transactions into meaningful interactions.The lesson here? When brands get bold with design, they lay out their ethos for the world to see. And in a market crowded with choices, this courage to be different paints the future of how we connect with what we buy. Looking ahead, it's the brands that embrace this blend of innovation and authenticity that will lead the pack, turning everyday choices into gateways of discovery.

In 1919, the United States was gripped by two seemingly unrelated trends: a global pandemic (influenza) and a wave of labor unrest. Four million workers, or one-fifth of the labor force, went on strike that year.Flash forward a century, and history appears to be repeating itself. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and other multi-layered economic factors, labor strife has rocked a variety of economic sectors: automotive workers, nurses in multiple states, Hollywood writers and actors, and journalists all went on strike. Unionization movements within tech and other nontraditional sectors sprung up all at once. Could it all just be a coincidence, or is something more happening here?Any broad shift in dynamics between workers and management has implications for the present and future of employment in the United States. A deeper understanding of the forces at work could be valuable for a variety of businesses.



In analyzing the commonalities and trends from these recent examples, three lessons stand out:1. Rewarding labor for corporate successWhen business is booming, executives who hold an equity stake in the company are rewarded. Workers lower on the food chain typically do not see a similar boost in their paychecks. This phenomenon is nothing new; however, many workers were hit disproportionately hard in the 2008-2009 financial crisis and again during the recession stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Now that the economy has improved in several sectors, employees are looking to recover lost gains and receive what they feel is their fair share.


Questions like this motivated the United Auto Workers (UAW), which accepted lower pay for newer workers after the Great Recession. Business results for auto companies have significantly improved, and the UAW looked to recapture lost benefits and increase wages for all levels of workers. Their members, motivated by rising inflation and leveraging their collective power, successfully navigated a significant step change in compensation and massive increases in benefits. Similarly, Hollywood writers and actors have recently struck significant deals to navigate changing business models and protect livelihoods. The question is: did it need to be this difficult?The takeaway: today's labor force is increasingly aware of how their companies are performing and has significantly more transparency into what their peers and superiors are earning. They also have more avenues to mobilize. Work diligently and proactively to understand and design systems in which business success can bring increased rewards for your workers to avoid the need for protracted negotiations.Related: 75000 Kaiser Permanente Workers Strike, Demand Better Pay2. Disenfranchised employeesWhen HBO's streaming unit rebranded to ""MAX"" in 2023, it ceased crediting writers, directors and producers individually. That hit a nerve within the guild representing each faction. Fears of AI adoption — were addressed in the ultimate resolution to the writers' strike.


The sense of disenfranchisement among workers upset with the direction of their companies or their industries wasn't unique to the labor strikes in entertainment. Although the money at stake in Hollywood might have been greater, many fields of work run the risk of intrusion from AI in a way that threatens workers' livelihoods.The takeaway: Open communication from management about changes to company policies, practices and directions is essential. Businesses must evolve to stay afloat; the more transparent management can be about that evolution, the less likely workers are to feel disenfranchised. Engage with them directly in the process to think through how shifting technology can help, what concerns exist and how to navigate it together to retain key talent and keep engagement levels high. With AI in particular, consider what skills will be required as business models evolve and how you can properly support and train workers along the way so they can leverage these new tools to help your business grow.Related: Huge UPS Strike Could Wreck U.S. Economy and Benefit Amazon3. Investors and owners can be disconnected from workers' day-to-day realityThe increase in venture capital and hedge fund investments in healthcare and print journalism — to name two — drove pushes for increased efficiency and profits. This correspondingly made a number of employees, many of whom entered these careers with altruistic or public-service-oriented mindsets, feel like their companies were becoming increasingly disconnected from their day-to-day work and, in some cases, their values/reasons for working in the field. A number either left their careers or became disillusioned, feeling they had misaligned incentives between the purpose of their jobs and the processes they were now being asked to follow.


The takeaway: The more disconnected management is from its labor force, the more it invites the potential for misaligned incentives between the two parties. Bridging the gap is necessary as industries consolidate and pushes for efficiency continue. Narrow the knowledge gap between executives in the C-suite and workers on the ground. Understand what motivates employees to do their jobs well and involve them directly in designing more effective and efficient processes - it will drive improved results, engagement, and better change management as businesses evolve.Related: How Your Business Can Be Ahead of the Curve by Looking Backward and Thinking ForwardIn summaryHow can managers anticipate sources of labor unrest before they rise to the level of concern? The following practical considerations can help achieve one or more of the objectives outlined above.Structure incentives and compensation models so everyone wins as business results improve.Keep your employees informed about where business models are shifting (e.g., streaming, AI, etc.), and proactively think through potential employee concerns and how to address them.Involve employees directly in designing more effective and efficient processes and more transparently share your goals. Listen to their concerns and find a way to improve business results, but employee engagement and alignment are a strong part of the equation.Demonstrate the value of ""walking a mile in the employee's shoes"" - have leaders spend time doing the day-to-day work better to understand their thoughts, areas of opportunity, etc.Put in place a system of regular pulse checks with the entire organization to catch issues before they become significant.

14,HR Could Be Withholding The Critical Data You Need to Boost Retention and Drive Results. Here's How to Take Control and Gain Access,"Apr 10, 2024",Ryan Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/hr-could-be-withholding-the-critical-data-you-need-to-drive/472002,"
Have you ever waited longer than you'd hoped for a package? You've experienced the proverbial ""last mile"" problem. A parcel zips all the way across the country, but then somehow, it gets stranded at the post office a few blocks from your home — so close, but still out of reach.To borrow a term from the field of logistics, HR departments have a ""last mile"" problem, too, and it's just as frustrating. Companies are generating more people data than ever — insights about everything from how employees work best to ways to boost retention — but that intel isn't getting into the hands of the managers who need it most when it's needed.For example, let's say a manager needs to know what kind of raise to give a valued employee. The clock is ticking. HR has relevant data, but often, it takes weeks for someone to tally industry averages and cross-reference the employee's specifics. In a fast-moving business environment where competition for top talent is scarce, companies can't afford such delays, which can end up impacting the bottom line.



Related: A Practical Guide to Increasing Startup Success Through Data AnalyticsThat lag reflects a broader sluggishness in getting people's data into the right hands. A recent global survey found that about three out of four companies are driving business innovation with data. But less than half have created a data-driven organization, the key to unlocking insights about people, their most precious resource.


As the co-founder of a business that helps companies use people's data to drive results, I know there's a better way. Here's why the last mile problem exists and how businesses can solve it to ensure timely delivery of HR data that makes an impact.What's behind HR's last mile problem?The fundamental reason HR data doesn't travel that last mile: It's languishing in silos.Essentially, there's a wall between HR and the rest of the company. Many HR departments hoard their people data, on the grounds that it's personal and confidential. At large companies, this siloing problem even happens within HR itself. Recruiting, talent management, compliance, learning and development, compensation — all have their own data fiefdoms.To make things worse, that data may not be very meaningful to anyone except HR pros. Even when it is shared, it often lacks context and is hard to interpret. That's partly because it's rife with HR jargon, not framed in the language the rest of the business speaks. Don't know what utilization analysis is, or featherbedding, or negligent referral? You're not alone.


Even familiar concepts like turnover rates can be confusing or misleading in the absence of context. HR might report that your department has a 10% turnover rate. Sounds terrible — but is it really? How does that compare to competitors? Is it impacting revenue or performance? The underlying problem: data is shared in the language of HR, not the language of business.Companies that lack the ability to connect HR data with business impact risk falling behind. Over a three-year period, businesses that made sophisticated use of people analytics reported more than 80% higher average profits than their less data-savvy peers.How to solve HR's last mile problem Getting over HR's last mile hurdle calls for both a culture and technology shift.Culturally, HR leaders need education around the idea that using people analytics doesn't mean sharing personal information — far from it. In fact, the data in question can be readily aggregated and anonymized, so nothing sensitive gets divulged.


It's also essential to drive home the message that HR's contributions can and should go well beyond compliance and administration. After all, people are a company's biggest line item and greatest resource. HR is ideally positioned to help connect the dots between talent and results.Technology can help, too, especially when it comes to getting the right insights in the right hands. Believe it or not, many companies still rely on old-fashioned charts and spreadsheets to manage HR data. I've seen how this creates challenges for frontline managers, many of whom lack the time, training or inclination to sit down and crunch numbers.The good news is that new generative AI technology is finally helping liberate that data. Using the latest tools, managers can quickly find the answers they need by asking a question in plain English. Is an employee being paid fairly? Rather than poring over a dense chart or waiting for a data analyst to weigh in, managers can get answers in real-time, with data specific to their company and the employee in question, along with industry benchmarks.Finally, the best companies find ways to integrate people data into the rhythms and routines of daily company culture. Instead of quarterly blasts, they share insights with decision-makers on a consistent basis, whether it's weekly or monthly. They're selective, tailoring reports to the department or business need in question, and they put the data in context by telling the story behind it in business language. If turnover will be 10% this year, what does that number mean for the company, and how does it stack up against the competition?


Related: Using Data Analytics Will Transform Your Business. Here's How.The payoff for closing the last mileWhen people data gets where it needs to go, fast, the entire organization benefits.HR can now focus on the ""art"" of the profession rather than rote, time-consuming requests for information that can easily be handled by analytics tools. That means fewer hours spent on admin, compliance and tickets — and more time for the people who drive the business.Managers get the information they need when they need it. For instance, they can use people analytics to find out who's most likely to leave the company before it actually happens. Thanks to today's generative AI tools, which many executives see as a profit booster, that's no longer a guessing game. Ask, and you get a straight answer about individual employees' engagement levels based on data pulled from chat, email, calendars and other workplace apps.


For the business at large, fixing HR's last mile problem equates to a sea change in efficiency and performance. Talent decisions can be made in real time, not months (or even years) too late. Best guesses and gut instinct give way to data-backed insights. Ultimately, the ability to draw a straight line from people to business results boosts customer satisfaction, employee retention and the bottom line.Granted, we're not there yet. Institutional biases linger — from HR's warehouse mentality toward data to frontline managers' aversion to being analyzed and judged.Wariness of AI is another potential blocker, especially in the context of privacy and misinformation — areas where the right guardrails are essential. (At my company, for example, we do ethics testing of our generative AI tools to ensure that their guidance is free of racial and other bias.)Ultimately, however, solving HR's last mile problem is well within reach. We have the data. We have the tools to share it safely and responsibly. Now, it's time to get it into the hands of the leaders who need it most.

15,Employees Are Burning Out — and the Culprit Isn't What You Think,"Apr 9, 2024",Rob Cross,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/employees-are-burning-out-and-the-culprit-isnt-what/471340,"
Imagine you're headed home from work, unwinding by listening to your favorite podcast. Your phone chimes with an email from your boss. They want you to revamp a slide deck. Rather than resting, you spend the evening working and come into work the next day fried.All of us have encountered this kind of microstress — a term I coined with my co-author, Karen Dillon, in our recent book ""The Microstress Effect."" Microstressors are small but stressful moments that add up to harm our health, work performance and personal lives. Data suggests that these small negative interactions are up to five times more impactful than positive ones.Very stressful events trigger our brains' fight-or-flight mode, a response that helps us identify and deal with stress. But microstressors are minor enough that our brains don't always notice them, even as our bodies produce stress hormones like cortisol. Research suggests that microstressors can accumulate in our bodies. Our brains then pick up on the fact that something's wrong, but without always knowing what's responsible for our mood.



Microstress helps explain why employees are so burnt out. As a professor at Babson College who has studied the workplace for decades, I believe every company needs to tackle microstress if it wants to reduce burnout and boost productivity. Here are three ways you can reduce stress in your organization.Related: I Was Experiencing Extreme Burnout Until I Practiced These 3 Things to Come Out Stronger


Reject ""toughing it out""High-performing people are used to toughing it out. Push through the next deadline, convince yourself it will ease off after that and repeat as another deadline emerges. But no one can work at a perpetual sprint without sacrifice. I've spoken to some executives who worked their way to exorbitant wealth at the cost of multiple divorces and ruptured relations with their children.Toughing it out also falsely assumes that working longer and harder means working better. This isn't always true. My research suggests that we spend up to 85% of our time on collaborative work — from check-ins to project meetings to all-hands and more. We can cut down on that time and boost output by being more intentional and efficient in how we collaborate.Reject a culture of toughing it out in favor of one that focuses on working smarter. And recognize that burnt-out employees innovate less and are more likely to leave their jobs.Related: How I Pulled Myself Out of Burnout and Turned My Ambitions Into Reality


Identify and target microstress through team interventionsMessages from the top signal organizational priorities. But the best place to address microstress is at the team level.I recently worked with a group of employees to tackle microstress. Each Monday, the employees emailed me describing a new microstressor they wanted to focus on that week. Maybe a colleague was asking for too much help on projects. Maybe their boss kept shifting expectations. Maybe family obligations were creating too much pressure. On Fridays, they sent me an update on their progress in tackling that microstressor.For three weeks, I noticed only incremental movement. But in week four, employees began to see how working to control microstressors could make a big impact in their lives. There are three important lessons from these experiments:First, awareness of microstress can help us solve it. Employees need examples, a list they can look at and say, ""Oh, yeah, I know that feeling!"" In my work, we used ""The Microstress Effect"" app, which catalogs different sources of microstress.


Second, because microstress consists of dozens of small things, don't try to solve everything at once. Reducing stress shouldn't cause more stress. Take microstressors one at a time and begin with an easier one — not the most impactful — to build momentum.Third, microstress should be addressed at the team level. Teammates should be paired up in groups to generate ideas for actions to reduce microstress, as well as to build accountability by updating one another about their progress. This team structure also recognizes that we can be a source of microstress for others and that the only way we can communicate about our stress is in a supportive, open environment.Related: Improving Yourself Takes 9.6 Minutes of Work Each DayBe proactive, set new norms and change cultureToo often, it's easier to absorb microstress than to do something about it. If you've ever shied away from an uncomfortable conversation—even though avoidance led to lingering stress — then you know what it's like. But microstress accumulates in ways that are devastating to our well-being, so it's important to be proactive. One very effective step in tackling microstress is to change the culture to avert stressful moments.


In one exercise I do with companies, we list out collaboration tools in one column, from video chats to instant messaging to email. The second column focuses on the positive ways these tools should be used. In the third column, we brainstorm norms of use we'd like to improve.Let's take emails for example, one of the most common causes of microstress. Employees often feel like they're drowning in emails that take too long to read and respond to. Moving forward, a team might agree to write emails only in bullet points to prioritize brevity.Some people might see this as silly. Who has the time to set up systems for how we email one another? When we're in constant firefighting mode, we feel too busy to think of tweaking systems. But not tweaking those systems and changing culture is why we're so busy. A few hours of proactive work now can save hundreds of hours and prevent microstress down the line.Microstress can harm you, your team and your business. The stressors may seem small, but that doesn't make them any less important. So, reject toughing it out. Encourage teams to identify and target microstress. And then work together to generate new norms and change culture.

16,Stanford Professors On the Counterintuitive Strategy That Helps Google Hire Top Talent,"Apr 8, 2024","Robert I. Sutton and Hayagreeva ""Huggy"" Rao",https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-google-attracts-top-talent-with-this-counterintuitive/470067,"
Everyone knows the exasperation of unnecessary friction.We've all navigated systems that create maddening ordeals rather than give us simple answers, services, or refunds. We've sat through endless meetings with blabbermouths and ill-defined agendas. We've pulled our hair out over rules, procedures, traditions, and technologies that once made sense, but are now antiquated, pointless, and inefficient. These are all soul-crushing forms of organizational friction that make it difficult to do simple things. And as professors at Stanford's School of Engineering and Graduate School of Business, we spent the last seven years researching the causes and cures for these problems.But one of our biggest discoveries surprised us. It turns out that friction isn't always a problem. In fact, sometimes it can be a solution.

17,You Need a Community With Shared Values to Find Long-Term Success — Here's How to Cultivate It.,"Apr 6, 2024",Megan Thudium,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/everyone-wants-long-term-success-heres-how-to-find-it/470976,"
Don't underestimate the possibilities of growing a purpose-led community. It's one of the most influential tools in the entrepreneur's toolkit to help guide your business toward longevity and long-term happiness.Because let's be honest — no one wants to be unhappy in their business. In this article, you will learn the importance of building a community of shared purpose and how it impacts the continued success of your business.Entrepreneurial success sits at the heart of purposeI would like to see more purpose-led businesses being built in the world.



Purpose-led businesses are run by entrepreneurs who lead from the heart and with the conviction that their business is doing good in the world. The business solves an important problem — maybe one that is societal or environmental. Purpose-led businesses aren't driven solely by profit but by the change the entrepreneur wants to see in the world.Surprisingly, my entrepreneurial journey didn't start with purpose. It began with the idea of starting a marketing agency and solving complex marketing problems. But as my business grew, I became less driven by profit and success. Over time, my main driver became purpose, or the value that I want to bring to the world. It doesn't matter where you are on your business journey. You can take the alternative path and refocus your business on purpose.


Building a community of shared purpose-driven entrepreneurs helped me forge this path of success. It was their inspiration, advice, and support in tough times that got me to five years in business. Remember, 2 in 10 businesses fail in the first year of operating. If you're past this point, you're thriving!When you forge a community of shared interests, you see more business projects aligned with your values, better collaboration opportunities and new service verticals emerging. Don't underestimate the power of collaboration and aligning with other business leaders on purpose. Nurturing this community is a successful ingredient to business growth — equally compared to organizational, marketing and sales tactics.Related: Why a Purpose-Driven Business Is the Real Key to SuccessIdentify your communityWho will you build your purpose-led community with? That question is answered by identifying your values and purpose as an entrepreneur.


Start the process by identifying the purpose of your business. It took me hours of reflection to narrow down my purpose and values, which then fed decisively into my business. Personally, my purpose is to forge meaningful connections, lead by example and support marketers and creatives on their path to climate work — and become an ecomarketer, someone who puts people and the planet at the center focus of all their marketing campaigns.Understanding my purpose has equipped me to identify a community of like-minded entrepreneurs interested in sustainability. It also helped me to connect with them on a deeper level. When you have a shared purpose, community connections go deeper, from transactional to building a world collaboratively for the better.Once you've identified your purpose, find your community. The LinkedIn community is a great platform to connect with entrepreneurs and to identify those who might share the same values as you. It's truly the largest business networking social media platform in the world with 1 billion members. You can use the search function to identify members sharing and talking about similar topics to yours.But being engaged actively in the community will help you identify those with common values. These individuals are pure gold and will help your business grow. They champion your ideas, connect you to opportunities and push your industry forward. Remember, identifying the group is only the beginning. As mentioned, your long-term success comes from fostering relationships with those having a shared purpose.


Related: 3 Reasons Why Purpose-Driven Businesses Can Help You Find Better Hires, Mentors and InvestorsHow to build a community of shared purposeOnce you've built the bridge, you can follow these three pathways to building a community of shared-purpose entrepreneurs.Change of mindset: Long-term — To build a community, you must have the right mindset. First, put personal gain aside and focus on the community. You will be surprised to see that the community-first mindset leads to more authentic connections that build long-term business growth. It also focuses your sights on the future, building connections that last years and don't stop at the end of a transaction.Step up: Contribute — Contributing is another important step toward building a community of purpose-driven entrepreneurs. You can't ask for value from others if you're not willing to step up and give the value yourself. Meaningful connections are made by giving a helping hand, passing along business opportunities to your community and offering collaboration opportunities. To build a community of shared purpose, you must embody your values and practice them openly.Pass the torch: Champion other entrepreneurs — Long-term entrepreneurial success comes from taking you out of the equation. Your growth goals, objectives and business strategy aren't the most important things in the entrepreneurial circle. Champion others' work, give referrals and forge meaningful connections.Find entrepreneurs with the same values and a similar journey as yours. Then, work on forging a community of shared purpose with those entrepreneurs. It's this one business tactic that will bring you longevity and long-term business success.

18,Men Are Seen as Experts More Often Than Their Women Counterparts — and It's Time to Break Those Gender Biases.,"Apr 5, 2024","Kara Alaimo, PhD",https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-amplify-womens-wisdom-and-voices-in-a-mans-world/471783,"
I once sat next to a senior executive at a lunch during a conference and chatted with him about the subject of the research I do as a communication professor. He immediately began quoting a piece about the topic that he had just read in The New York Times – which I had written myself. The possibility that I was the author didn't seem to have occurred to this man when I had told him my area of expertise was this exact topic.The problem, of course, is that when people in our society picture experts, they often think of (white) men.I heard this complaint endlessly when I interviewed women across the country about their experiences using social media for my new book, Over the Influence: Why Social Media is Toxic for Women and Girls – And How We Can Take It Back. These women often told me something I have experienced myself: When they posted about topics related to their professional expertise on social media, their posts got little engagement; yet when men in their fields posted about the very same thing, they seemed to get a lot of reposts.



Research backs my findings up: When women use social networks to advance their professional careers, they often end up with fewer followers, reposts and resulting opportunities than the men in their fields. Why? In Entitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women, Cornell philosopher Kate Manne writes that often men are considered to be the ones in possession of knowledge in our society. Too often, women simply aren't seen as experts.Related: 8 Ways To Empower the Next Generation of Women Leaders


This can help explain why, when people are looking for a professional — whether they need to hire someone, want to follow people on social media to learn more about a topic or are making an appointment to see a doctor — they so often turn to men. To overcome this implicit bias, women's knowledge needs to be given greater visibility in our society. If people were constantly reminded of women's wisdom and accomplishments, eventually, they would come to see women as experts, and would therefore turn to women for their expertise more.All of us can help make this happen. Women who are experts in our fields should recognize that the more we can share our knowledge publicly — whether it's giving a talk at the local library or writing an op-ed about important work we are doing — the more we can help reshape these perceptions. Serving as a guest speaker in schools, from elementary schools to graduate classes, is another great way of making our knowledge visible. We should also post regularly about our work on social media and emphasize its value to society, so people can see the important contributions we are making.We can all also help by following more women on social media and sharing the posts of women more. To help us get started, I've posted a list of ""feminists to follow"" on my website. They are a diverse group of women doing amazing things in many different fields. The database SheSource, created by the Women's Media Center, is also a good resource for finding women experts in many different areas.What's more, we should try to boost other women in our professions, such as by nominating them for awards or writing Wikipedia bios about them, so their knowledge becomes visible to others outside our fields. One woman I profiled in my book, Jess Wade, has created Wikipedia pages for over 1,800 women and minorities working in science and engineering. She told me that simply having a Wikipedia page can be ""transformative"" to women's careers, because it allows people to find them when they're looking for nominees for things like awards and fellowships.


Related: How We Can All Elevate Women and Give Them a Voice in the Business WorldEmployers also have an important role to play. Companies should book women staffers for media interviews and speaking engagements and share their expertise on their official social media channels. They should feature the work women are doing on their websites and ask women to handle public-facing activities like earnings calls with investors and congressional testimony.Employers should also make it easier for women to attain leadership roles, such as by ensuring that people at all levels of their organizations can achieve work-life balance. As I've warned before, the expectation for executives to overwork is one of the major factors that holds women back in our careers, because so many of us need to balance our jobs with major caregiving responsibilities. They can do this by not expecting executives to be available 24/7 (economist Claudia Goldin's work demonstrates the value of having professionals like lawyers and accountants take turns being ""on call"" for client emergencies). Chief executives should also model the expectation for staffers to take time off for things like family vacations and children's sick days by doing so themselves.Our society's tendency to look to men for expertise is one of the things that holds women back in our careers. But we can all help give women's knowledge and accomplishments greater visibility, which will cause people of all genders to view women as experts and turn to women for expertise more.

Decades ago, I went to a breakout session at a BNI conference that was called ""The Mathematical Formula for Networking Success."" Well, as the founder of the organization, I absolutely had to see this presentation to learn the working formula for successful business networking.The speaker began his presentation by writing a formula on the flip chart. He talked about ""D"" representing Dunbar's average number of relationships and ""M"" representing Metcalf's law (also known as the Squared Connection Effect). He continued with a very convoluted and confusing formula doing the square root of one thing and multiplying it by something that seemed totally irrelevant to me.He hesitated as he spoke to us. He put his fingertips to his lips and hemmed and hawed in his presentation. It was uncomfortably clear to all of us that he was confused and bewildered by his own formula. Not only that, but we were also very confused and bewildered by his formula as well. We all sat there feeling pretty embarrassed for him.

20,Prioritizing Your Employees' Well-being Is the Smartest Business Decision You Can Make — Here's How.,"Apr 4, 2024",Durana Elmi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/prioritizing-your-employees-well-being-is-the-smartest/466999,"
Employee wellness is more important than ever in today's fast-paced work environment. With my six years of experience leading the Cymbiotika team, I've learned employee wellness is more important than ever.Businesses prioritizing their staff's health and well-being see increased productivity, morale and overall job satisfaction, according to a 2016 article from the National Library of Medicine. Implementing wellness strategies is not only a smart move for the company's long-term success but is also a new standard to consider in a healthy workplace — so here are seven to take into consideration.Introduce meditation spacesMeditation is a powerful tool for managing stress and enhancing mental clarity. Recognizing this, companies have introduced dedicated meditation rooms, offering employees a tranquil space to unwind and refocus during the workday. These quiet areas serve as a physical reminder of the company's commitment to its employees' mental health. By encouraging regular breaks for meditation, businesses can help employees reduce stress and boost their productivity.



Related: This CEO Became a Better Leader By Harnessing a Practice Traditionalists IgnoreMake physical fitness a pillar of well-beingExercise is a key component of both physical and mental wellness. Many companies offer their employees access to personal trainers, encouraging them to incorporate fitness into their daily routines. This promotes physical health, helps manage stress and improves mental well-being. Such initiatives demonstrate a commitment to the holistic health of employees, acknowledging the strong link between physical activity and mental health.


Providing opportunities for exercise before or after work hours makes fitness more accessible and convenient for employees. It also creates a culture where health is valued and encouraged. Whether it's a group workout session or personalized training, the presence of a personal trainer can motivate and guide employees in their fitness journey.Incorporate culture-building events and activitiesPromoting holistic wellness in the workplace is about creating a supportive community. Many companies take advantage of this through internal wellness events, focusing on activities like breathwork classes and grounding exercises at the beach. These events not only celebrate the team in the office but also provide them with mental health and well-being tools. Such initiatives create a supportive environment where employees feel valued and their wellness is prioritized.In addition to these events, integrating regular wellness activities into the work routine can have a profound impact. For example, initiating yoga sessions or arranging informative talks on health topics provide a space for learning and relaxation. They also facilitate stronger connections among employees, fostering a sense of community and belonging. This approach benefits individual employees and enhances the overall work culture.Related: Workplace Wellness Isn't Just for Big Corporations. Here's How Small Businesses Can Build a Culture of Health.


Cultivate team spiritSocial connections at work are vital for a positive and collaborative work environment. Specialized team lunches provide a casual setting for employees to connect, share experiences and unwind. Such gatherings are an opportunity to build relationships and a sense of community within the team.These gatherings can be a platform for celebrating successes, sharing ideas or simply enjoying each other's company. They encourage open communication and a more relaxed atmosphere, leading to increased creativity and collaboration. Integrating social gatherings into the work culture strengthens team bonds and creates a more inclusive and enjoyable workplace.Boost morale with weekly raffles and wellness incentivesInnovative approaches to boosting morale, such as weekly raffles and wellness incentives, can have a significant impact. These activities add an element of fun and anticipation to the workweek. Raffles for wellness accessories or event tickets encourage employees to engage in activities that promote their health.These raffles and incentives serve a dual purpose: They reward employees and promote wellness-oriented activities. Participating in these raffles can be a motivational tool, encouraging employees to focus on their health and well-being. The excitement of winning and the benefits of the prizes contribute to a positive work atmosphere. This approach to employee engagement is a creative way to integrate wellness into daily work life.


Strengthen bonds with team building eventsTeam building is essential for creating a cohesive and collaborative work environment. Hosting multiple events each month is an excellent strategy for strengthening team bonds and improving camaraderie across internal teams. These events, from recreational activities to wellness workshops, provide employees with unique experiences that foster teamwork, offering a break from the routine and helping employees connect in new and meaningful ways.The nature and direction of internal events can vary in nature, but their impact on mental health and team dynamics is uniformly positive. Whether it's a group outing or an in-office workshop, these events create shared experiences that build trust, shared experience and understanding among team members. They also provide a platform for employees to showcase different skills and interests, contributing to a more dynamic and engaging workplace. Incorporating such events into the company culture can significantly enhance employee satisfaction and team cohesion.Related: Employee Morale Is More Than Pep Talks and High Fives — Here's How You Can Really Capture the Power of Team Spirit.Take employee fulfillment beyond the officeCommunity outreach is a powerful way to extend wellness beyond the office walls. Activities within your community, like a local beach cleanup, not only contribute to environmental conservation but also give employees a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Participating in these activities allows employees to connect with their community and with each other, fostering a sense of belonging and shared responsibility. This kind of involvement can be deeply rewarding, offering a break from the daily grind and a chance to make a positive impact.


Investing in employee wellness is a strategic move that yields significant returns. Businesses can cultivate a holistic approach to well-being, empowering employees to flourish both inside and outside the workplace. This translates to tangible benefits: increased productivity, enhanced morale and a more positive work environment, ultimately contributing to the company's long-term sustainability. Remember, prioritizing employee well-being has always been — and continues to be — a smart business decision.

21,3 Customer Service Trends to Follow this Year,"Apr 4, 2024",Michelle Van Slyke,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-customer-service-trends-your-business-needs-to-follow/471717,"
Customer service has never been more important. Today's customers not only desire fast and seamless service but also expect a personalized and delightful customer experience (CX). To add even more to the mix, the stakes are high for businesses that don't measure up. According to a recent PwC report, one-third of customers would leave a brand they love after one bad experience.The good news is that succeeding in customer service can reap incredible benefits for businesses. In fact, 86% of customers are willing to pay more for a great CX, per the Tempkin Group. Due to these factors, customer service has become one of the top priorities for businesses in 2024. Here are three CX trends every business leader should buy into to help them excel in 2024.The evolving role of self-service technologyToday's customers expect fast, seamless and convenient service. One recent study found that half of all customers will not wait more than 3 minutes in a store. It's unrealistic to expect businesses to provide instant, in-person service all the time – that's where technology has to play a role. Gone are the days when these technologies were viewed as taboo. On the contrary, many of today's customers prefer customer service, which technology supports in some way. Per a recent study by Aspect, 73% of customers want the ability to solve product or service issues independently. Even many small businesses and franchises should invest in technologies like self-service kiosks or technology tools that support customer service efforts.



If your business hasn't invested in self-service technology for customers, 2024 might just be the year to do so. A great place to start is with self-service kiosks onsite. This is a tool that The UPS Store recently introduced, with over 1,800 self-service kiosks now installed at franchise locations across the country. These kiosks streamline online returns and item drop-offs for The UPS Store customers and offer an option to get in and out of the store faster than ever. Whether self-service works into your business plan or not, technology will be a key player in customer service in 2024.Related: 10 Reasons Why Good Customer Service Is Your Most Important Metric


Connecting with Gen-ZYou may not realize this, but Gen Z is growing up fast. The oldest members of this generation will be much closer to 30 this year than 20. With Gen Zers becoming a bigger sect of most companies' customer base, one of the biggest CX trends in 2024 will be the importance of appealing to this group. So, where should you start? One place is on social media. As the first actual digital-native generation, Gen Zers are often most comfortable interacting with companies on social media. A survey by Hubspot found that 90% of Gen Z expect brands to be active on social media, and 13% claim social media as the preferred form of customer service. If you're not on social media, 2024 is a great year to use it.This shouldn't just be reserved for large national brands; even small businesses should find ways to be active and interact with younger customers on social media. LinkedIn or Instagram are great places to start for most companies, but consider where you feel most comfortable or which platform your customers are most active on. Authenticity must be prioritized in social media customer service, especially when interacting with Gen Z. In addition to responding to customer needs, being active on social media will allow your company to build more trust with Gen Z and interact with customers more often.Related: What You Must Know About the Next Generations of ConsumersHarnessing customer insightsOne CX trend that has persisted in its importance is using customer service interactions for their insights. While customer service should prioritize the customer experience, all companies should also look for ways to learn from these interactions. This can be achieved through high-tech and low-tech means. For example, businesses can use data intelligence software to get real-time insights or social media analytics to collect information. Plenty of data intelligence vendors can offer real-time insights based on customer touchpoints. On the other hand, businesses can also tap their customer service employees for their insights following a customer interaction.


Employees often have some of the best feedback to offer since they interact daily with customers. All businesses should view their customer touchpoints as an opportunity to not only make their customers happy but also as a chance to learn and adapt for the future. In 2024, you should consider finding ways to better obtain customer insights, whether that be through investing in data analytics or looking for insights from your employees.Providing great customer service should always be a priority for business leaders, but it continues to be more important each year. As we move through 2024, be sure to keep tabs on customer service trends, especially when it comes to the importance of self-service, appealing to Gen Z and harnessing customer insights.

22,How An Unmarked Dive Bar in Vegas Became One of America's Must-See Destinations — Within 3 Years of Opening,"Apr 2, 2024",Kristen Bayrakdarian,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-an-unmarked-dive-bar-in-vegas-became-one-of-americas/471448,"
You might not guess that in Las Vegas — a place known for luxury resorts, opulent casinos, and just about any amenity imaginable — one of the city's most beloved establishments is in a single-story building a six-minute drive from the Strip.There's a sole neon sign in the window that says, simply, ""Open."" But inside is a bit of magic: a bar, called The Silver Stamp, that makes just about everyone feel like they're back home, no matter where they're from. And in a city like Las Vegas, that's a high-wire act. ""It's a transient city,"" says Andrew Smith, one of The Silver Stamp's co-owners. ""We have so many different people coming here."" And not just locals. Tourists seek the bar out in almost equal measure.The Silver Stamp has become so beloved that when Entrepreneur held a vote to select America's favorite mom-and-pop shop™ (out of 150 of the most popular small businesses in the country, selected in partnership with Yelp), the divef bar won first place.



Related: These Are America's Favorite 150 Mom & Pop Shops™, According to Yelp and EntrepreneurThis is all the more impressive given that Smith and his co-owner and life partner, Rose Signor, only opened the business three years ago, in February 2021. In that short time, they've paid off their two small investors, the business has averaged 23% revenue growth year over year, and by popular demand, extended their hours from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m.So what is the Silver Stamp getting right?""A lot of people say, 'I don't know what it is, but I just feel so comfortable in your space,'"" Signor says.Comfort — it's no small thing. It's possibly the most important feeling a mom-and-pop shop can evoke. But it's also mysterious. You can't simply buy comfort. You can't follow a checklist to create it. You have to understand, deeply, what it means to you.


Image Credit: Mike BellemeSignor and Smith met in 2017, when she hired him to work at Atomic Liquors, the oldest freestanding bar in Las Vegas. ""It was an instant connection,"" Smith says. They'd both been in the service industry for years — Smith had managed a nearby bar before coming to Atomic Liquors — and they both shared an interest in the craft beer industry. Smith had planned to move to the Northwest at some point, but when he met Signor, he had a good reason to stay. And Signor had actually moved from Las Vegas to Seattle back in 2011 — only to move back a year later. She missed Las Vegas and the desert, and was inspired to infuse Sin City with some of the wholesome beer culture she loved.But Signor and Smith's connection went deeper than a love of pilsners and IPAs. They'd grown up in small towns on opposite sides of the country — Peru, New York, and Yuma, Arizona, respectively — that instilled in them a strong sense of community and, perhaps more importantly, empathy. ""I remember seeing situations [growing up] where I felt truly bad for people getting treated poorly and embarrassed because they didn't have enough money,"" says Signor.Related: A Small Business Owner's Guide to Managing Funds and InvestmentsWhen Signor and Smith discovered that they had both, individually, been saving to open their own bars, joining forces was a no-brainer. ""We knew we wanted to do something together,"" Smith says. They started dreaming about the bar they'd open, and even collecting decorations. A vintage clock here, a disco ball there. A wooden toucan to hang from the ceiling, sock monkeys to dress in funny, seasonal outfits. Their nostalgic, oddball, something-for- everyone aesthetic was representative of their mission for the business. ""We'd been to so many establishments that have not made us feel welcome, or have made us and others feel like outcasts,"" Signor says. ""We wanted everyone to feel included.""In May 2018, they took the leap. They quit their jobs together and backpacked for nine months through Europe and the U.S. to learn more about the history of beer. When their former boss at Atomic Liquors, Lance Johns, reached out and told them he had bought a few buildings in the downtown area, and he would lease one to them, the couple jumped at the chance. They had a vision, and they were ready.  Image Credit: Mike BellemeConstruction on the Silver Stamp began at the end of 2019. A few months later, we all know what happened: The pandemic hit.Smith and Signor had planned to hold other jobs as they built out the space, but the shock to the service industry left them unemployed. They had already sunk $60K of their savings into gutting the space, buying materials and paying contractors, so they pressed ahead. But there were mistakes and setbacks during construction, and the funds dried up way before the bar was finished.


Related: Would You Turn Your Small Business Into a Franchise? Here's Why Everyone From Hardware Stores to Hot Dog Shops Are Doing It.""We were beside ourselves,"" Signor recalls. ""I remember stepping outside and thinking, We don't really have any money left.""At some point, the couple assessed their situation. Nothing was going to plan, sure, and the money was gone. But they had their own two hands, and a community of friends who were willing to help.They began spending long nights repurposing old, torn-out wood, running electrical lines, and laying plumbing themselves, to cut costs. They sought out any help they could get. ""One of the biggest things I learned during this process,"" Signor says, ""and this is even after we've opened — is to not be afraid to ask as many questions and to reach out to as many people as you can. Sometimes you think you're bothering people, but in that dire moment, I remember panicking and hitting everybody up, asking for suggestions, and looking to people that have a little bit more experience with the situation. There were some really surprising people that came forward to help us just by mentioning what our situation was."" People coached them through different processes, gave them a discount on their services, or lent them materials and machinery. They turned to others for counsel or attempted to replicate, through trial and error, what seemed to have worked for other successful establishments.One person they leaned on a lot was Lance Johns, who knew how hard they worked from when he was their boss. ""Lance is somebody that will give back to people who give to him,"" says Signor. ""Having a mentor saved us a lot of time not having to second-guess ourselves.""One thing they never doubted was how they wanted their bar to feel: inclusive and, of course, comforting.Related: Experts Say This Is the Key to Marketing a Mom and Pop BusinessThey poured those values into every detail and decision. Christmas lights strung across the ceiling help keep the ambience neither too dark nor too bright. Bar stools are repurposed gaming chairs, designed for people to sit in one place for an extended period of time. The collection of cozy nooks and small seating areas encourages intimate conversations, and the music is kept at a low enough decibel that you can hear your neighbor talk. There are only two screens, an anomaly in otherwise tech-saturated Las Vegas. And this low-tech ethos extends to printing physical menus, even though the bar has served over 1,700 different beers in three years — averaging out to nearly two new beers a day. Finally, there's the diversity of decorations and memorabilia — a bubbling lava lamp, vintage beer posters, kooky seasonal decorations, scavenged beer-can art installations — that Signor and Smith had collected over two years before the bar's opening. They're now strewn across the wood-panel walls and, really, everywhere, so that customers have something fun and different to look at in each corner. Customers have even begun adding their own contributions to the decor.


""We have been to enough bars in our life to know what makes us feel comfortable,"" Signor says, ""So how we created the bar was based on our own preferences."" By trusting their own well-defined feelings, they built something universally relatable.Image Credit: Mike BellemeBut creating an environment that is comfortable and relatable is about more than just creative decisions. It's also about financial decisions, and from the start, Signor and Smith were determined to keep costs down. ""We have low overhead because our decisions weren't fueled by [trying to make] money,"" Signor says. ""We intentionally made choices like a cheaper building off the beaten path and being our own managers and cutting out that salary.""Being intimately involved in the day-to-day operations of the space has also helped them foster the spirit of the bar and its employees. ""Our definition of a bartender isn't someone just serving drinks,"" says Signor. ""It's about building a relationship with these guests. When we're hiring, we look for people who genuinely appreciate other people, treat them with respect and kindness, and create a really safe space that people want to come back to."" Their ideal hire is someone who has positive energy, is able to leave their personal life at the door, can laugh and joke with people, and is humble (which they define as ""not intimidating and able to put people at ease"").Related: 50 Amazing Grants, Accelerators, and Free Resources Being Offered to Entrepreneurs by Champions of Small BusinessIt's painful to let people go when they don't live up to those standards, Signor says. But it's also essential. ""When prioritizing what to do next, I always think of the guest sitting in that barstool,"" she explains. ""We tell the staff to pretend we're the guests on the other side. What are they seeing? Really envision it from their perspective.""But, while Signor and Smith want their employees to put themselves in their customers' shoes (or, rather, stools), they also believe that employees have to be happy for customers to enjoy themselves. They offer health benefits — something they say is mostly unheard of in their industry, but something they wanted when they were employed by others. They are also transparent with their employees about finances and business decisions, sharing numbers and providing reasoning for changes. They take their workers' thoughts into consideration, whether it be opinions on events or on shifts in workflow. And they don't ask employees to do anything they wouldn't want to do. (The pair continue to work bar shifts alongside their staff — including cleanup duty.)""Don't be afraid to get feedback,"" says Signor. ""Our staff is so important to us and really we wouldn't be the bar that we are without them. So we lean on them, and they lean on us.""


The same way she encourages her employees to look at things through the customer's eyes, she makes a habit of looking at a situation from the viewpoint of her employees. ""I've learned to always try to put myself in the mindset of the other person,"" she says. ""I roleplay with myself in my head: If I say this to them, what do I think their response will yield? And could I say it differently? I just really try to understand where they're coming from before we approach the situation."" She adds, ""And then if we're frustrated, we sleep on it. That was something that my mentor told me: 'Always take a couple of days to reflect.'""These days, when Smith and Signor reflect on their business journey, it's notable that, in a city known for its fabulous attractions, The Silver Stamp has become its own must-see destination. ""We've become a bar people bring their families to when they're in town because they have to show their parents, their uncle,"" Smith says.Signor adds, ""We've had grown people cry when they first come in here. The space touches them immediately.""People are always looking for comfort, and the Silver Stamp shows that if you devote yourself and your business to that quality above all, people will feel it — and deeply appreciate it. You just need a vision, and a willingness to get your hands dirty. ""Every single aspect of this bar we've had our hands in,"" says Smith. He and Signor think it's funny that one of the bar's quirks that locals and tourists love — the fact that they don't have signage outside their building, giving the bar that local, in-the-know vibe — came about because they couldn't afford the sign they had designed.That's the kind of thing you never could have planned for. So, while Smith and Signor have received offers to franchise the bar, they don't think what they've created can be replicated. They do have other plans in the works. But The Silver Stamp will remain dependably unique — news that is its own kind of comfort.Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big Brands

23,4 Ways the Labor Market Is Changing Right Now,"Mar 29, 2024",Daniel Altman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-ways-the-labor-market-is-changing-right-now/471109,"
The worker shortages of the Covid-19 pandemic may be a thing of the past, but that doesn't mean the labor market looks just like it did in 2019. Some trends have accelerated, and new ones have been set in motion. Here's what to look out for as you plan for your staffing needs.Remote work is leveling outAccording to the latest data from the Census, 30% of Americans ages 18 and older spend some time working from home. Among those aged 25 to 54 — the prime working years — the number rises to 38%. About half of these people work from home five days a week.These numbers were much higher during the pandemic, but they are largely stable now. And though the data include people who are self-employed and others who may have worked from home before the pandemic, they still represent a huge increase. In 2019, the share of Americans working from home was only around 6%.



With so many people expecting remote and hybrid working arrangements, companies will have to rely more on flexible schedules, fractional positions and job-sharing to fill their payrolls and meet their targets. Also, training workers to perform multiple roles will become more valuable, so that production can continue no matter who is in the office or on the factory floor.Related: Where Will the Economy Go Next? What to Watch For in 2024


Churn is finally slowing downIn 2020, the median tenure of American workers — the time they'd spent in their current jobs — fell to 4.1 years, the lowest number since 2008. Both of those years included recessions, where more people were losing their jobs. But the recent low persisted until 2022, thanks to people switching jobs and raising their pay in a tight labor market.All of that is changing now. In January, the share of workers quitting their jobs dropped to 2.1%, the lowest rate since 2018, after peaking at 3.0% most recently in April 2022. The hiring rate has also plunged back to 2018 levels. The sum of these rates tends to peak around 6% in a normal economic cycle, as it did in 2005 and 2019. Both employers and employees are showing more caution now.Indeed, less churn — fewer hires, fewer quits — signifies uncertainty. And despite the economy's strong fundamentals, an outsider might see a couple of causes for concern: a divisive presidential election coming up later this year and a stock market that looks overvalued by historical standards. Even with a low unemployment rate, workers are no longer as eager to move.From a corporate perspective, this is a great time to invest in existing employees. With workers less likely to leave, the returns to training are more likely to stay inside the company. It's also a good time to launch projects that require a team to work together for the long term. Increasingly, companies are even bringing in flexible workers for long-term assignments rather than one-off shifts. On the Instawork platform, where I work, the share of shift bookings for long-term assignments has doubled over the past six months.


Related: These 5 Economic Trends Will Drive Consumer Spending in 2024Pay rates are stabilizingEven though the unemployment rate has only risen half a percentage point off its lows, job openings have come down by roughly 25%. The labor market is gradually loosening up, and increases in pay are starting to ebb. These increases peaked at about 7% on an annual basis in July 2022, but now they're down around 5% — just a couple of percentage points above inflation.Wages usually rise a little faster than inflation because of workers' growing productivity. In fact, we may see unusual productivity gains in the near future as artificial intelligence spreads across the economy; the same thing happened when the internet, mobile telephony and fiber optic cabling arrived on every worker's desk. So pressure on wages could return soon, though for different reasons.With inflation roughly under control and pay increases moderating for now, forward-looking companies will be thinking about locking in their labor costs for the next few years. Companies with union labor can do this via contract negotiations, and other companies can do it by setting pay scales and planning cost-of-living adjustments.


Older people are leaving the workforce againIn November 2023, the share of people ages 55 to 64 who were working reached an all-time high of over 66%. For several decades, rising life expectancies had led people to extend their careers to stay active and fund their retirements. The trend was reversed during the pandemic, thanks to health concerns and the rising stock market, among other factors. But then higher costs stemming from inflation and interest rates drove older people back into the workforce.And now, the trend may be turning around once again. In December, this rate dropped by more than half a percentage point, the biggest decrease outside of the pandemic since 2010. With the stock market again hitting record highs, inflation coming down and interest rates poised to follow, there is less pressure on people to delay retirement (or to come back out of it).Related: The 12 Best Jobs for Retirees and SeniorsMoreover, a significant share of the older people who stay in the workforce are choosing flexible work rather than full-time jobs. The average age of Pros working shifts on the Instawork platform in February was 38.5 years, with 8.4% of the shifts being completed by Pros aged 55 or older. This percentage is back where it was five years ago, before the pandemic.


This is an important insight for recruiters. The most experienced talent in the labor market hasn't gone missing; it just has to be accessed in a different way. By offering flexible schedules and temporary positions, companies can still bring in older workers to guide and mentor their younger staff. The labor market is still pretty tight, and tapping every possible source of talent is paramount.

24,These Are the Five Attributes of Highly Successful and Happy People,"Mar 29, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/these-are-the-five-attributes-of-highly-successful-and/470701,"
During my 21 years in corporate America, I spent thousands of hours observing others. Now, as a coach and consultant, I often get asked what attributes I value most in people — and these five stand out. If you're looking to achieve new levels of happiness of success this year, consider how well you embody the following five attributes. Not only do they drive success in leadership, but they drive success in life.1. VisionHumans have a gift that no other living organism has: the power of imagination. Successful, happy people use this gift. They imagine a compelling and different future than the present, and they believe in their ability to create and shape it. They don't reactively accept the status quo or things they don't like. Instead, they work hard to improve the world around them.They recognize that they have agency and can proactively alter their surroundings and environment. They never say things like: ""That's just the way it is"" or ""We've always done it that way."" Instead, they imagine their desired or ideal state and then compare that vision to their actual state. If they identify a gap, they immediately begin devising possible solutions that will close that gap. Then, they get to work in employing and experimenting with those. People like this show us that anything is possible, and they're fun to be around because they tend to inspire us to do the same.



Related: There Are 6 Types of Great Leaders — Which One Do You Fall Into?2. PassionWe all have unique gifts and talents that excite us tremendously. Time flies when we use them. We tend to be better at them than our counterparts. They come more naturally and easily to us than others. Thus, we're able to hone and improve our skills at a rate faster than our peers. Doing these things feels more like play than work, and we can hardly believe that someone pays us to do them.


Life is too short not to invest in yourself. We're most successful and happy when we identify what unique gifts and talents we have, and take the time to practice them. Not only does this help us feel fulfillment and joy, it allows us to best serve society. Many individuals experience burnout, anxiety and depression because they spend 40 hours or more a week not doing what they love. When we engage in activities that energize us (instead of things that drain us of energy), we're not only happier, but we're healthier.I've had a few jobs I didn't like and my life suffered while I had them. I felt drained of energy when I arrived home. I struggled to find the motivation to exercise and pursue personal hobbies. I gained weight and lost touch with friends. When I got back to a job I loved, all this changed. I became a marathon runner, reconnected with friends and pursued personal hobbies like photography, scrapbooking and writing. Focusing on what we're passionate about is incredibly important.3. CourageFear is a powerful motivator. Research shows that our brains all have a subconscious component that works to protect us and keep us safe. Many of us hold back and live life with the brakes on because we're afraid of change and trying new things. We have a fear of being uncomfortable, making mistakes, failing or facing judgment from others. Courage sets us free.As Franklin Roosevelt said, ""Courage is not an absence of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear."" Courage allows us to speak our minds in the board room, express our true opinions, suggest unconventional courses of action and go against the status quo. This is what allows us to progress, develop and innovate.


It can be scary to speak up. But, it's important. The right people will value your bravery; not squash it. Having the courage to be vulnerable, authentic and transparent gives other people permission to do the same thing. Going against the grain and inciting real, honest dialogues when others can't or won't usually doesn't hold you back, but helps you progress, especially if you're in the right environment.Related: Why Successful People Never Second-Guess Themselves — and 5 Strategies to Help You Get Rid of Indecision4. CompassionWhen we empathetically hold space for others, we free them from their own fears and worries. Compassion allows us to create a safe space for others to be themselves, and that's when people are most able to contribute in a meaningful way. Our spouses, families, and friends aren't the only ones who appreciate compassion. Our employees do, too. When others feel valued, appreciated and seen, they give us their all. They do their best work and deliver their best ideas, which is what helps us move forward.Over the years, numerous employees have thanked me for being so kind and understanding. They've told me how enjoyable it is to come to work when they have a boss or colleague who truly cares about them. Sadly, compassionate leaders are somewhat rare. If you're one of them, you stand out and this breeds a tremendous amount of loyalty and respect. When people respect you, they're more willing to push through challenges and find solutions for you, which means you'll get better results.


5. AccountabilityIt's amazing how much traction you create in life when you keep your word. The most successful people I know always do the things they said they'd do. They regularly keep their commitments, including the ones they make to themselves. Over time, people notice. This breeds a great deal of trust. When you take responsibility for both your behaviors and the results, you'll work harder to find solutions in the toughest of circumstances. When the buck stops with you, and you don't blame others for your problems, you save a tremendous amount of time.Most people spend an inordinate amount of time finding scapegoats and assigning fault to anyone but themselves. This behavior prevents us from getting better. People who are truly accountable stay focused on their circle of control, not their circle of concern. Therein, lies all the difference. Whether you're leading others or just leading yourself, accountability is what makes progress possible.Related: The Super Successful Have These 5 AttributesPractice these five attributes and your life is bound to improve. If you haven't been doing one or more of these things and start now, you'll be shocked at how quickly others around will notice and appreciate the changes. This holds true for your personal and professional relationships.

25,How To Improve Your Soft Skills and Emotional Intelligence in 7 Easy Steps,"Mar 27, 2024",Zamir Shukho,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-improve-emotional-intelligence-in-7-steps/471524,"
We are not born with certain skills, though it could be such a great default option, right? If we could choose the level of patience, emotional intelligence and empathy right away, we would overcome all life challenges much easier. So, what are soft skills? Can you learn them? Why can they add some extra points when you are networking or looking for a job?Soft skills are qualities and social abilities that show how well someone can interact with others. At work, they go alongside hard skills (practical job abilities), which are about what a person knows and can do in their job.In the fast-changing world of business (and not just business), success isn't just about what you know — it's also about how you connect with others. That's where soft skills come into play. They're the secret sauce that helps you communicate, lead and problem-solve your way to the top. In this article, I want to explore why soft skills are so crucial in business and how they can help you reach your goals.



Related: What are Soft Skills and Which Do You Need For SuccessHard skills vs. soft skillsToday, soft skills are all about how you interact with people — communication, empathy and adaptability. The last one is always tested when you are looking for a new job or moving to another country. Unlike hard skills, which you can learn from formal education, soft skills are more about intuition and experience. They're the qualities that make you a great listener, a supportive teammate, and a problem-solver who thinks outside the box.


What is the difference between a soft skill and a hard skill? Hard skills can be measured and are usually acquired through training, education and practice. They are the abilities needed to perform a specific task or job. For example, hard skills in engineering might include proficiency in coding languages, while hard skills in healthcare might include medical procedures or knowledge of pharmaceuticals. In many professions, hard skills are essential for completing tasks efficiently and effectively. Soft skills are behavioral and interpersonal skills that relate to how effectively people interact with others and handle situations.Soft and hard skills are important for success in most careers. However, the relative importance of each can depend on factors such as the nature of the job, the industry, the organizational culture and the specific requirements of the role. In many cases, employers value a combination of hard and soft skills, recognizing that individuals with diverse skill sets are often better equipped to handle the challenges of the modern workplace.Related: Why Prioritizing Soft Skills in Hiring is Crucial to The Modern WorkplaceSoft skills and businessFrom my experience, I can say that being a leader isn't just about giving orders — it's about inspiring and motivating your team. Great leaders know how to connect with their team on a personal level and create a positive work environment where everyone can thrive and achieve more.


Leaders (by that, I mean CEOs, Founders etc.) with strong soft skills are highly valued in today's professional landscape for several reasons. Firstly, effective communication lies at the heart of leadership, and soft skills such as empathy, active listening and clarity enable leaders to convey their vision and expectations clearly while also understanding and addressing the concerns of their team members.Moreover, soft skills are essential for building strong relationships within the team. Leaders who demonstrate empathy, interpersonal skills and a genuine interest in their team members' well-being can establish personal connections, inspiring loyalty and commitment. This ability to connect with individuals and understand their unique perspectives enables leaders to motivate and empower their teams, driving performance and productivity.Conflict situations in business are inevitable. Soft skills also play a crucial role in conflict resolution and problem-solving. Leaders with strong emotional intelligence can navigate disagreements and tensions within the team with tact and diplomacy, facilitating constructive dialogue and finding mutually beneficial solutions.Related: The 5 Soft Skills of Every Good Employee


Can you develop soft skills?Let's imagine you already have good soft skills, but there is always room for improvement. To broaden your skill set, you need to have an open mind and desire to develop personally and professionally. Various training and workshops are beneficial. Once you attend those trainings, you can practice your soft skills by getting feedback from your family, friends and colleagues and working towards their improvement. Sometimes, it's good to have self-reflection to identify your strengths and weaknesses and highlight points for future growth.Lastly, for valuable guidance, it might be a good idea to have a mentor, especially a seasoned manager in a company who has worked with hundreds of people, managed different teams and has experience in communications on different levels.Working with a mentor can help you improve your soft skills and your job performance and build better relationships with colleagues – this is a path towards a successful career. There is a framework that I follow when it comes to emotional intelligence or soft skills:#1. Show empathy. This means imagining yourself in other people's shoes and trying to understand them rather than trying to fix them.


#2. Assume good intentions from people. First, believe that people mean well and show them trust. Then, you can ask questions later, which helps build good relationships.#3. Try to pause before reacting to a situation or in communication you need to do. You know you need to stop, think and respond because emotions can often hinder the conversation rather than help it. So, don't rush into replying too fast – pause, take a deep breath and then continue with what you really mean and want to say.#4. Ask before assuming. Please let the other person explain what they meant, what they wanted, their worries, or their viewpoint on the situation because none of us are mind readers. Clarify any confusion by asking direct questions.#5. Keep your promises because they give your words a lot of credibility. It allows people to rely on you as a person, leader, colleague, or partner. Reliability builds trust and respect, which will pay off in the long term.


#6. Accept and own your mistakes. Admitting where you did something wrong shows strength and allows you to learn and move forward. When other smart people surround you, it's very appreciated that you act as an adult, understand that you also make mistakes, and be willing to fix them.#7. Be grateful and say ""thank you"" to people, appreciating their efforts.Using these simple but effective approaches will help a person in their business, in their life and in their relationships with others, and will be deeply appreciated by everybody around you.Want to see more stories like this?

27,Empower Your Customers and Exceed Expectations With These 3 Customer Service Strategies,"Mar 26, 2024",Cheri Beranek,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-ways-to-exceed-expectations-in-customer-service/471321,"
Giving people what they want drives the bottom line. Statistics consistently show that consumers are more likely to buy, purchase again or recommend a company to a friend based on the quality of their customer service. Until recently, competitive businesses knew the equation to meet those expectations and stay ahead: Listen well enough to understand what customers wanted and provide it, but one step better.Today, customer needs have changed. In a 2023 Salesforce survey of 14,300 global consumers and business buyers, 80% said the buying experience is now just as important as the products or services a company offers. Seventy-three percent expect greater personalization alongside advancing technology. Competitive companies now need to ""win hearts and wallets"" by proving their ability to consider the customers' best interests.This year, rather than New Year's resolutions, our company made reaffirmations to the core institutional practices that have driven its success, including efforts to exceed customer expectations. Knowing those expectations have fundamentally changed and may continue to do so, here are our three main customer service strategies:



Related: 5 Reasons Setting Customer Expectations Goes a Long Way1. What they want, and…In the past, our approach to exceeding our customers' service expectations was simple: focus on product and network training so we could provide the best quote and turnaround with the least amount of lead time. Now, our customers still want quality, price and lead time, but to provide that one step better, we need to help them navigate new purchasing problems and find new ways to make them happy.


Our post-pandemic path of high demand and supply chain challenges has left many industries in a position of over-inventory. As a fiber-optics connectivity supplier, exceeding our customers' expectations has meant helping them make better decisions with what they have and, in the face of rising inflation and interest rates, more cost-effectively.To do this, we take the word ""no"" out of our vocabulary. Saying ""no"" to a customer request would not exceed their expectations. Instead, we find a way to give them a ""Yes, and…."" If a customer comes asking, ""Can you take my inventory back?"" on a non-returnable item, I can say, ""Yes, I understand your inventory challenge, and I can reach out to some customers who might need what you have to help resolve it."" If they want a specific product unavailable at our company, I can say, ""Yes, we have an equivalent product, and I think it could fulfill your requirements equally or better.""Never lie if something is not possible. Rather, empower people to offer ""Yes, and…"" honestly. The truth opens the door for a future opportunity to work together, but getting caught in a lie can keep someone from ever returning for more business. Empower individual contributors with a clear understanding of what is possible and alternative options so they can apply their ""Yes, and…"" response most effectively.Related: How to Keep Up With Customer Expectations


2. ListenSometimes, to arrive at a successful ""Yes, and…,"" we need to listen. Suppose a customer wants ten items delivered within eight days, and I know we can only turn around an item per day. In that case, asking for more information might help me respond with a suitable ""Yes, and…"" Customers are not always aware of what they truly need when it comes to technology components, and listening to how they intend to use the products might empower me to say, ""Yes, I can get you eight of the items you need in eight days, and still achieve the same solution.""The best customer service salespeople talk only 30% of the time because the other 70%, they spend listening. Listening to customers keeps them sticky. When a significant potential customer came to us looking for a new fiber optic cabinet supplier, we listened and heard them describing a desire to do more with fewer resources. So, we conducted field studies to assure them that our cabinets could allow twice as many connections. We also provided free field training so they could conduct the study and see the results for themselves. That customer stuck with us even after they passed through their economic difficulties because, by listening, we were able to go above and beyond what they needed.Related: 8 Ways Customer Service Affects Your Business's Bottom Line3. Reset and alignExceeding customer expectations is an opportunity to reset — a reintroduction to your customers and their needs. We were previously focused on drawing the early majority in the technology product adopter lifecycle: more adept and in need of constant change. Now, our biggest customers are in the late majority, who are less confident, require more support, and are more convinced by lower prices. Our job is to strike the right balance.


So, to replace the requirement of having a sales engineer present the first time installing a product, we invested in building a technology platform. Using the same application that could explain how to assemble a newly purchased grill, customers can now learn our technology in bite-sized chunks over their phones. Exceeding the expectations of the late majority meant providing more accessible support and requiring less effort.After a reset, we need to break down silos to ensure organizational alignment. Nearly eight out of ten of Salesforce's 2023 survey respondents said they expected consistent service interactions across a company, but more than half felt like they were communicating with isolated departments. Under pressure to make a sale, a product manager might offer to meet a price that undermines gross margins, while among leadership, we find that greater customer awareness of market prices tends to diminish such expectations. Especially after a customer reset, breaking down silos ensures alignment around best practices when meeting customer needs. The pandemic allowed me some time to work on my business, but now, we need to work in it. Our leadership teams are getting more hands-on, and we are working to empower our people to say, ""I'll get right back to you."" Whenever they find themselves without a ""Yes, and…,"" they can turn to their manager or leader for more insight. Our examples and experiences help team members navigate their customer challenges and discover new ways to exceed expectations.

28,"Your Business Will Always Require Most of Your Attention — But You Need to Make Time for Yourself, Too. Here's How.","Mar 26, 2024",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/your-business-will-always-require-most-of-your-attention/470553,"
As an entrepreneur, your days are jam-packed with meetings, emails, tasks and more. However, one thing your day might be missing is some time for yourself, also known as the ever-elusive ""work-life balance."" I get it — your business is your baby! You nurture it, care for it and are there for it 24/7, but are you there for yourself, too?Working all the time can lead to burnout and loss of motivation. And, as any seasoned entrepreneur can tell you, your business will always require most of your attention. This is why it is incredibly important to block out time for yourself to do something you enjoy to relax. This will look different for everyone, but here are a few ideas to help you avoid burnout and unlock your entrepreneurial potential.1. Schedule time for yourselfBlock out time on your calendar. That's right, add a chunk of time to your calendar where no one can schedule meetings with you. In fact, block out two separate times on your calendar. One chunk of time should be for you to do something you enjoy. This might look like lunch with friends, reading a book or even going for a nature walk so that you can disconnect for a short time.



The other chunk of time should be set aside for your productivity. This is when you do not have meetings, accept phone calls or acknowledge emails that came in during this time. Instead, you sit down and focus without interruption on your to-do list. Make it through the emails that came in earlier in the week, wrap up a project or two or whatever has been hanging over your head causing you stress. While you do not need a productivity block every day (although I recommend it), you do need to add time to unwind and relax to your everyday life. Prioritize some time for you so that your business can continue to grow and you remain healthy mentally and physically along the way.Related: 3 Insights From the First Large-Scale Study on Burnout and Entrepreneurs


2. Add movement to your dayManaging your stress sounds easy enough, but as we all know it is far easier said than done. While most people will tell you to just remove whatever is causing stress from your life, we know as entrepreneurs that is not likely to happen which means you have to figure out ways to manage your stress — and the number one way to do this is to add movement to your routine.Sitting at your desk all day is not only hard on your body, but it is bad for your stress levels, too. Stress needs to go somewhere, and if you do not have an outlet, it will stay in your body. That is why you should add physical activity to your daily routine. Be sure to include a variety of things such as cardio, stretching or weight training. Cardio does not have to be something with crazy high intensity, just going for a short walk or two can make a huge difference. Stretching can be as simple as stepping away from your desk to stretch a bit before returning to work.3. Practice mindfulnessDo you have goals set for your company? How close are you to achieving those goals? Where is your company going this year, or the next, or the next? Do thoughts like these constantly swirl around your mind and add to your stress? Define the direction of your company and protect your mental health by practicing mindfulness.Step one here is to get all your thoughts out of your head and organized. This might be the old-fashioned way through paper and pen, or you might prefer to use something like your notes app on your phone. Whatever it is, get your thoughts down and work on organizing them. Not only will this help calm your mind, but it also helps define where your company is going while providing accountability so that you can see the progress you are making toward accomplishing your goals.


Step two is to work on relaxing your mind. During your scheduled time for yourself, you might choose to do cardio exercises which is great for the tension you hold in your body, but it does not always help with the tension you hold in your mind. This is where meditation practices can come in handy. Find a quiet, relaxing space. Sit comfortably, close your eyes and let your mind wander. Acknowledge thoughts as they appear, but do not try to hold onto them. Slowly breathe in and out, breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. It can help to count for a certain number of seconds while breathing in and then exhale for that same amount of time. This can help settle and clear your mind so you return to work more focused than before.Related: Worried That You Don't Have Time for Self-Care? Here's How to Fit It Into Any Schedule4. Practice prayer and/or meditationThe best way I've found for me to de-stress and get re-energized is to spend quiet time in prayer. I've also found meditating on the truth in God's word to be instrumental for me in my business, but of course, everyone holds different beliefs. I gain wisdom and clarity when I turn to God and try to unclog some of the mental stress of running a business. I also find great peace and tranquility in spending time in prayer — but you have to find what works for you.Armed with these ideas and tactics, you can return to your work refreshed and motivated to tackle even the most complex problems. Stepping away from your business is an integral part of maintaining your drive for your company and avoiding burnout. Include the aforementioned tactics into your daily routine and truly unlock your utmost potential as an entrepreneur who lives a healthy, balanced life!

29,Want Success? Invest in Your Biggest Enemy,"Mar 26, 2024",Jon Michail,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-people-to-follow-you-invest-in-yourself/471357,"
When most people think, talk or try to research investment, they often focus on opportunities in areas like real estate and stocks. For many people, investment is all about financial gains. Of course, pursuing and building an investment portfolio that would yield financial gains is a commendable feat. Yet, an investment that is equally as important, if not more, is self-investment.Self-investment is hard because one can often be their own worst enemy, as they are intimately aware of their weaknesses and insecurities, which can lead to self-doubt and self-sabotage. Their inner critic often amplifies their fears and magnifies their failures, hindering their progress and potential for growth.According to Warren Buffet, one of the most successful and wealthiest men in the world, ""The best investment you can make is an investment in yourself… The more you learn, the more you'll earn."" This statement is not cliché; it is straightforward and practical, but people still often overlook the importance of self-investment.



Whether you want to earn the highest figures, reach the peak of your professional career or become a better person overall, investing in yourself is non-negotiable. It's that sort of investment that yields a substantial gain every time.Now that we're in a constantly and rapidly evolving era, self-investment — an investment in personal development and self-growth, is the best insurance policy for these challenging times. Here are some instances of how self-investment can set you up to nurture growth, personal fulfillment and career success.


Enhancing personal growth and developmentIt's impossible to talk about self-investment without its impact on personal growth and development. Self-investment involves using available resources to improve your overall well-being. This goes beyond formal education; self-investment sets one on a path of continuous learning and development by pursuing passions, curiosity and innate skills. Apart from the apparent rewards, those who remain dedicated cultivate adaptability and resilience — the ability to be flexible, composed and decisive in crucial times. These traits are essential for anyone who will successfully navigate today's competition and uncertainty.By investing in their personal growth and development, individuals become self-aware and authentic to their true selves. This sets the foundation for a purposeful and successful life.Related: Want to Succeed? Learn to Say 'No'Promoting mental and physical well-beingMost people are not proactive, paying little to no attention to their mental and physical well-being in pursuing success until a problem arises, and then they react. People often believe their physical and psychological well-being must suffer if they're to attain success until a problem arises. This couldn't be farther from the truth; to give yourself the best chance of achieving your goals, your mental and physical well-being has to be in the best conditions possible. By investing in your mental and physical well-being, you get to


Sustain your energy and productivity for longer periods due to improved fitness levels.Cultivate the habit of remaining focused and peaceful because you know how to manage stress.Operate at your optimal level and give your best effort daily because you're well-rested.By investing in a sound mind and body, you strengthen your cognitive and problem-solving skills, thereby increasing your chances of excelling in your ambitions.Facilitating financial excellenceWhile it's true that the reward for most investments is money, self-investment promises more than just financial gains. Self-investment helps nurture a healthy relationship with the pursuit of money. You can create feasible financial goals because you understand the importance of savings and planning. The result is that it almost looks like you earn more than you do because you still have enough to pursue your goals and aspirations. By investing in yourself, you equip yourself with the basics and foundational knowledge necessary to live the life you aspire for.Advancing your careerGlobal incidents in the last couple of years, like the pandemic, have emphasized that the modern workplace is dynamic. You can't afford to stay stagnant. However, when you consciously invest in yourself, you plug yourself into lifelong learning and the perfection of your strengths. By so doing, even when there are disruptions, you're well equipped not just to cope and stay relevant but also to use such disruptions to further advance your career.Also, proper self-investment allows you to refine your skill set continuously, thus giving you the right to establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry.


Related: Why You Need to Invest in Your Happiness (and How to Do It)Improving social and emotional intelligenceThe success and meaning of every relationship, whether personal or business, are determined by those involved's social and emotional intelligence. By investing in yourself, you develop the ability to communicate effectively. Improved emotional intelligence means not only knowing what to say and when to inspire those around you, but you're also able to gracefully manage and resolve conflicts, thereby making you a professional and distinguished leader. This modern day is characterized by diversity, so interpersonal skills, empathy and emotional regulation are needed to navigate social complexities with grace successfully.Building legacy and impactThe final reason we're going to discuss self-investment is the subsequent impact such a person can have in the community. By striving to become the best possible version of ourselves, we spread our impact and influence across our immediate environment. This impact can come from providing resources, mentorship or philanthropy to drive progress and build a legacy in society. To put this in simple terms, the better we become as individuals, the better our contributions and services to society will be.Related: 4 Ways to Begin Investing in Yourself


ConclusionIt's worth remembering that the best investment anyone can make is to invest in themselves. This is particularly important in our present-day society, where material success and external validation are primarily the order of the day. An investment in core values like self-development and purpose-driven growth will set anyone apart. Not only does self-investment set you apart, but you also give yourself a better advantage in achieving all your goals while living a prosperous and fulfilling life.In navigating the challenges of our modern society, we should always remember that our greatest investment lies in treasures within. When leaders and entrepreneurs embrace and practice this reality, they realize their 'value' possibilities in new and inspiring ways.

31,5 Delegation Strategies To Help You Flourish With Less Stress,"Mar 25, 2024",Jessica Fisher,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-delegate-as-a-business-owner/471260,"
One of the hardest parts about owning a business is getting it off the ground and establishing it. However, once you make it a success, the responsibilities increase, and you have to let others take control of certain tasks to maintain the business' momentum.Delegation can seem terrifying to a business owner. Taking someone into your company and trusting them to do a job is a big leap for someone who's been handling every aspect of the business from day one. Fortunately, there are strategies you can implement to maintain smooth operations while letting go of control.Related: Want to Succeed? Learn to Say 'No'



1. Find someone who excels at the task at handIt's crucial to find the right person for the job. When looking at resumes, pay attention to employment histories with similar duties to those you seek. During interviews, ask questions regarding their past responsibilities and follow up on their responses by asking them to elaborate on how their skill set would translate to the type of work you need them to do.If you're stuck between two or more candidates, closely consider those who have experience that aligns with your field. Prioritizing skill over availability is always a smart move, especially when the work you require is specialized or imperative. The ideal person is likely to complete their duties more efficiently than someone who is less suited for it but more available.


2. Maintain a watchful but trusting eye on their responsibilitiesWhen a team is small, it's especially vital to stay aware of everyone's duties and daily work. While you must delegate tasks and loosen up control on certain aspects of the business, you also need to be in the loop, as errors and overlooked responsibilities can have a detrimental impact if you don't pay attention.For a business that includes sales or frequent client interactions, one way to stay on top of events is to have your staff BCC you on every email they send. This way, you are still trusting that they can complete their tasks, but you can also look over things should any questions arise and quickly jump in on any conversations.Reduce mishaps by having your team utilize email templates when writing people outside of the organization. A business that involves continual back-and-forth with others often follows similar patterns of conversation. Identify those themes and copy the proper responses into a shared document that workers can reference when they're responding to someone. Google Drive is an excellent tool for this type of collaborative work.Related: 10 Simple Ways to Build a Collaborative, Successful Work Environment


3. Recognize their skill and adapt accordinglyEven if someone seems like a good fit, they may struggle at first to learn their responsibilities and how best to complete them. If the company is smaller, their job may have a larger scope, with many small but cumulative elements that require time to master. When a team member seems ambitious and reliable but slower in the first few days, offer more guidance and support. Thorough training of an individual with talent pays off.If they seem to be still struggling with specific tasks later on, it can be helpful to eliminate those from their job duties and have them focus on what they are good at. Hand those tasks to someone else on the team or hire another person who is comfortable doing them. When outsourcing is not an option, resetting your expectations may be beneficial. The job might be done differently than you would do it, but it is still getting done.Related: 5 Invaluable Soft Skills to Seek in Your Next Hire4. Set clear expectations and define successTo do their jobs well, workers need to know what exactly you need from them. As workers settle into their position, help them understand what is important to you as their superior and what you expect to see from them. Outline specific goals, such as 'we want to increase sales by 25% this year' rather than 'we want to increase sales this year.' Providing tangible measures of success will enable them to create a plan to reach those benchmarks.


Timelines are also useful, preventing staff from spending too much time on one task or not enough time on another. Each project or assignment should have an expected due date, helping to establish priorities.Provide workers with resources for support so they know who or what to turn to in case anything goes awry. Examples include going to their manager for advice, looking at company email templates or giving them access to specific company information so they can problem-solve on their own.5. Keep an open line of communicationFor staff to effectively take charge of a task, they need to be able to speak with you or a manager without difficulty. Similarly, you need to be able to come to them when you have questions about any of their responsibilities.There is no shortage of ways teams can stay in contact. Google Chat is especially useful for businesses using Gmail as their company email. Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Discord are other chat apps popular with businesses of all sizes. Try to only utilize the chat feature for quick questions, and always hop on a video or phone call for clarity. Typed words tend to get lost in translation and can seem ambiguous.


Regardless of the method you choose, workers need to know they can always approach you for advice, information or general dialogue. A company's success is synonymous with its ability to communicate effectively.Mastering the art of delegation is a transformative chapter in a business owner's life. When you can confidently pass on responsibilities to a competent employee, you can establish a healthy work-life balance and focus on what you do best: growing the company. By choosing skilled, reliable workers, adapting to their abilities, setting clear goals, and fostering communication, you lay the foundation for a thriving business environment.

I understood its importance, of course, but it wasn't personal.Then, an officer in a nearby town was killed. It changed everything.His name was Louis Pompei. He was 30 years old, served in Glendora, California, and was killed while off duty, as he heroically tried to stop a grocery store holdup. We'd never met, but we had many mutual friends. When some of them invited us to his funeral, my wife, Melissa, and I immediately accepted.

33,Want to Attract Success? Don't Do These 9 Things,"Mar 20, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-success-dont-do-these-9-things/471131,"
Every entrepreneur has their version of what's led to where they are today. Whether it's a specific routine or tried-and-true perseverance, there's a lot of advice on the ""to-dos"" of success.But what about the things to avoid?There are as many ways to limit your success as stepping stones to lead you to where you want to be. Avoid getting in your own way and making it harder to get to your destination. There's plenty not to do to prepare for success as well. Here are nine things to avoid. Often, simply switching to a more positive mindset (eliminating negative habits) can clear the path.



1. Neglect self-careToo often, entrepreneurs focus on the grind alone without taking breaks or paying attention to their physical and mental health. This isn't sustainable and will lead to burnout or, worse, giving up on their business dreams altogether.Schedule time to exercise, sit down for meals and sleep at approximately the same time every night. These simple habits are as important as any metrics to measure your business success. By taking care of your health, you'll see the difference in your energy and outlook, which only helps fuel your growth.


2. Doubt yourselfSelf-doubt plagues every entrepreneur, at least in the beginning. Being your own boss means you need to be your own cheerleader as well. Turn to trusted peers and friends to give you constructive feedback when needed, but keep confident in your abilities.Once you begin second-guessing your choices, it becomes harder to move forward. Getting stuck due to indecision or feelings of unworthiness creates additional barriers. As entrepreneurs, there's already enough of those to deal with.Instead, explore different things and experiment with what works. Not every move will be perfect, but everyone can help you learn and improve as you go, which makes for a better entrepreneur and a better business.Related: The Biggest Threat to Your Boundaries Isn't Your Boss or Family — There's Someone Else You Need to Face First


3. Refuse to ask for helpEven if you have years of experience in your industry, stay humble enough to know when you need guidance. Trying to juggle every aspect can be overwhelming and means you don't have time to concentrate on the things that really matter.You must consider not only your trade or craft but also accounting, taxes, marketing and all the other aspects that help you grow. Whether it's advisory support from a respected colleague or outsourcing help for things like social media or copywriting to build your brand, delegating tasks helps you grow your business.4. Avoid networkingBuilding strong professional relationships leads to limitless opportunities. Expand your connections by networking with those both in and beyond your field. Start online through LinkedIn. Interact with posts and share helpful information of your own.Also, attend in-person events to meet with like-minded individuals. It will expand your business circle, and networking can be motivational as you take your business to the next step. You never know who might cross your path and who may be a valuable resource for you or vice versa.

Aiming high is great, but taking it step by step is a more realistic way to get you to your goals and continue once you reach them. Don't put off your goals because they seem out of reach today. Instead, put steps into place that can lead there so you get closer to your goal every day until you realize you've arrived at its doorstep.6. Overlook planningPlanning is the catalyst that helps you reach your goals. Without a plan, days go unstructured, and it's easy to do many small things that aren't linked to any objectives. Instead, take time at the beginning and end of each day to look at the day/week ahead.Also, prioritize deadlines. Though everything may seem urgent, trying to do it all at once means fewer things are likely to get done or, at least, get done well. Being an entrepreneur means balancing schedules to ensure you have enough creative time to dream and enough productivity time to do.

Explore new areas where you can take the next leap and avoid getting too comfortable. It could be speaking on a panel, authoring an online article, or broadening your services.There is always another lesson to learn or another goal to create. Stay curious and eager to head to what's next. However, don't skip over the wins, big or small.Related: Want Success? You Have to Take Risks.


8. Minimize winsThere was once a time when you wanted to be an entrepreneur, and you put the plan into action to make that come true. Every time you achieve something, make sure to celebrate the win.It can be a revenue goal, a new client, or even crossing off your weekly to-do list. Looking back and adding up all the wins motivates you to keep going and lets you know you have what it takes to succeed.9. Stray from valuesAlways hold true to your values no matter how much success you achieve. When people slip away from their integrity, it trips them up and prevents future success.Stay aligned with your vision, work ethic, and how you treat people. You will go further when you align, and the wins will feel all the more worth it.

A few years ago, on a family vacation, my wife and I took a cooking class. I like cooking, but I'm a novice at best — and the recipe, French macarons, wasn't a cakewalk. Lucky for us, the chef-instructor was there to guide us each step of the way.That day I learned many things: how to beat egg whites until soft peaks form; the importance of sifting the flour; how to pipe the batter. I also learned how much work goes into one macaron, which translates to the price we pay at the bakery. I left with a new appreciation for those tiny cookies.As CEO of Jotform, I spend a lot of my time managing and guiding others. It's nice to switch hats (or rather, toques) once in a while, and let someone else teach me. It's humbling to realize how tricky something as seemingly simple as mixing ingredients can be and helps me maintain the ""beginner's mind"" mentality — staying open to learning new ideas and subjects. That's why, even when I'm not on vacation, I try to make time for my hobbies — like cooking, writing and listening to old records. It turns out that I'm not alone. Many leaders make time for their leisure interests, and research shows that it's beneficial for business.

36,From $0 to $10 Million — Here's How to Build a Winning Prop Trading Team,"Mar 15, 2024",Blake Olson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-build-a-winning-prop-trading-team/470675,"
Some issues in prop trading are the same as those faced in any niche, but some are unique to this constantly evolving segment. When I look at the structure, staff and technology from 12 months ago, my company is almost unrecognizable.Without the right mindset, keeping a handle on growth can be a bit like juggling chainsaws.The pivotal role of technologyTechnology is the lifeblood of the trading industry. By definition, our business only exists online. The rapid evolution of tools and platforms can dramatically alter the landscape overnight. We've seen this firsthand.



Leaders in this sector must exhibit an exceptional degree of technological savvy and an ""anticipatory"" vision to foresee and adapt to these changes. The adoption of new technologies forces a culture of continuous learning and innovation within the team. There is no such thing as the status quo!Team members who are slow to pursue ongoing education, experiment with new tools and dedicate time to strategic thinking don't last long. The desire to adapt is required for growth and competitive advantage.


Related: Earn Through a Recession by Learning Stock Trading StrategiesHarnessing diversityThe global nature of trading today means teams contain a variety of cultural and professional backgrounds. Our current team is spread over five different countries. This diversity, while a tremendous asset, also presents unique leadership challenges.Effective leaders must promote a cohesive team environment where every member feels valued and understood regardless of background and location. Solutions to lessen the ""artificial isolation"" team members from other parts of the world can experience are essential. This involves using technology to facilitate communication across different time zones, fostering an inclusive culture and seeing it as a strength rather than an obstacle.One example is having occasional video conferences that are not business-specific. They allow time for team members to speak freely about their lives, making a connection that business-only video calls don't allow for. You'd be amazed at the personal details that have come out of these calls. Everyone enjoys these moments. (And yes, everyone's camera must be on!)


Invariably, we see innovation and closer collaboration as a welcome result.Balancing the dynamics of contractors and full-time employeesProp trading is no different than every other company out there. Our team faces the ""contractors and full-time employees"" issue. We all know companies that failed to handle this properly and paid dearly.This mix can enrich the team with flexibility and specialized skills. Still, it also requires careful management to ensure everyone is on the same page and working steadily toward the company's goals.During a growth phase, when certain roles expand while others vanish, it's vital to constantly ask the question, ""Is this best handled internally, or will we outgrow this need in 6 months?""


Leaders must integrate these contributors, ensure clear communication and set firm expectations. Verbalizing clear expectations saves a lot of headaches. This issue mirrors the geographic challenge just mentioned. Promoting an environment where contracts feel ""vested"" in the company vision.There's another concept in play here. The principle of ""fire fast, hire slow"". I don't mean this in a purely ruthless sense. But having the readiness to make tough decisions is a spark for growth.Ensure that every member's presence is not just warranted but beneficial for the collective goal. Again, this philosophy is not rooted in a lack of compassion but in a commitment to excellence and the team's long-term success.Upholding integrity as a core valuesThe temptation for quick gains in the prop industry can lead to ethical quandaries with clients and business entities alike. Integrity is non-negotiable.


Bad actors exist in every niche. Unfortunately, prop trading is not immune from this. This makes it even more important for leaders to adhere to the highest ethical standards themselves and to instill these values in their teams.This involves creating a culture where ethical behavior is recognized and rewarded and where team members feel comfortable voicing concerns. Customer service sees different behaviors from clients than the tech team on the back end.As a rule, whenever cash changes hands or profits are on the line, someone will create a way to skirt the rules. By prioritizing integrity, leaders build a team that not only achieves success but also does so respectfully and legally. And in line with the company's long-term vision.Adapting team composition for future challengesThe skill sets and mindsets that contributed to initial successes may not indicate future success. Leaders must be vigilant in assessing the team's capabilities and ready to make adjustments as needed.


This might involve seeking out new talents with specific expertise or redefining roles within the team to better align with strategic goals. The same talent pool that gets a company $0 to $1 million in annual revenue is unlikely to be the one in place from $10 million to $50 million. Spotting ""talent bottlenecks"" is an acquired skill. But it is very necessary.Related: Learn Candlestick Trading: This E-learning Bundle Is $25 This Week OnlyThe art of leading a trading team to successLeading any team to success is an art that requires a blend of strategic foresight, technological proficiency and evolving interpersonal skills.Short version: If I had to pick a trait that pinpoints someone likely to stick with you through growth and challenge, I'd likely go with a desire for continuous learning.


By embracing these principles, leaders can build resilient, adaptable teams capable of sustained growth and even friendship. The journey is demanding, but I've found the rewards of cultivating a high-performing, ethically grounded team immeasurable.

37,Making the Strong Business Case for Driving Human Brilliance,"Mar 15, 2024",Fasika Melaku,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-harness-human-brilliance-to-power-organizational/470753,"
Twenty years ago, when I first worked with my current CEO at a different company, she taught me what it truly meant to always think about the human element first. When she promoted me, she launched my professional journey, but she also did something I'll never forget — she invited me over for wine.At the time, she was a director, and I had only just started as a manager. I was one of two African Americans working at the company and an immigrant. I often felt that reality with others, but never with her. I remember asking myself, ""Does she not see that we're so different?""Her invitation was the first time I saw someone create a space for human brilliance. Fast-forward 20+ years, and she is at it again. As my current CEO, she is still creating spaces for me to do my best work, fueling my career to Senior Vice President of HR and Chief Learning Officer at Denny's. When human brilliance thrives, we create positive change: where we sit, work, and live in the world and for an organization.



Related: How To Attract (And Encourage) Brilliance In Your WorkplaceWe do our best when brilliantHuman brilliance is different for everyone. Like a stone polished to its gemlike core, bringing out an individual's brilliance is smoothing away externally imposed ideas to uncover raw, authentic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We bring out our strengths from that essence and polish them to our ultimate brilliance.


Human brilliance is not just what we get right, but all the times we fail, realize where we went wrong, and learn. Years ago, we ran the ""Surprise and Delight"" campaign, a marketing initiative that included surprising our guests by paying for their meals. By leaving extra cash in their pockets and treating them with unexpected kindness, we put our guests in a position to do better, achieve more and positively impact more people in their day.We considered the campaign successful, but reflecting, we realized we could have done more. Our current CEO joined the organization and established a new level of thinking: impact comes when those who create impact — our teams. She asked how we surprised and delighted the cooks, servers and staff. By not considering the rest of the team, that successful campaign missed an opportunity to create more points of exponential brilliance across the organization.Related: Eight Steps To Build Teams That LastMake the most of time and moneyIn my most challenging moments — heartache, illness, even death — I often realize the preciousness of time. These moments teach us that any time spent on being our most brilliant selves is an invaluable investment into who we can become and the impact we can have on the world. By helping others realize the value of investing time in developing their brilliance, I simultaneously help myself realize mine.


Time is a precious commodity in business, and the cost of capital has reached an all-time high. Not harnessing the full potential of a team's talents is a lost financial opportunity. When leaders focus on enhancing the brilliance within their organization, they unlock a competitive edge. It starts with just one person believing they can make a positive difference; this inspires others, creating a domino effect. When individual brilliance is connected and amplified, we cultivate collective wisdom, accelerate innovation, boost performance, and ultimately increase profitability.Related: Seven Ways You Can Establish Loyalty (And Even Love) In Your TeamBrilliance thrives in safetyBrilliance thrives in environments where everyone feels safe to authentically express their ideas and identity — to learn, fail, and cry ugly tears. When an organization provides such an ecosystem, it evolves into a community, and its people find a common purpose in doing their best work together. Upon this stage, we create places of brilliance. To build this foundation:1. Help remove self-limiting beliefsMany of us struggle with self-limiting beliefs that can hinder our ability to support ourselves or contribute effectively to others. I was recently diagnosed with chronic self-doubt. When leadership once presented me with an advancement opportunity, better pay, and an improved title that could open future doors, I hesitated and, ultimately, said no. This was not for a lack of qualifications but rather my self-limiting beliefs preventing me from fully committing to my organization and unleashing the full scope of human brilliance within me.


By cultivating gratitude and resilience, we can tackle these doubts head-on and inspire our teams to develop these crucial qualities. When facing self-limiting beliefs, I practice pausing and engaging in deep reflection. I ask myself, ""What's preventing my progress right now, and how can I navigate past it to unlock my true potential?"" Acknowledging obstacles and actively seeking ways to surmount them encourages growth.Related: Why Gratitude is the Missing Piece to Your Success2. Understand the existing frameworkEvery group of people has its own culture. When I greet someone from my Ethiopian heritage with three kisses on the cheek to represent warmth and connection, this customary gesture is unique to that culture. Similarly, within any organization, unique methods of connection and communication prevail, reflecting its distinct cultural environment. Leaders aiming to unlock the potential of human brilliance should first aim to understand and support the existing group connection.The approach must capture everyone for it to succeed, so get to know people and really listen. Putting in the work to understand them and meet them at their table helps pave the way for more authentic connections and a stronger foundation for collective brilliance.3. Build upon strengthsOnce at their table, I explore questions like: What is the general language of connection and can everyone easily understand it? How does our communication foster inclusivity? What rituals define and unite us? Just as childhood rituals shape our identities and lay the groundwork for trust and unity within our families, the same happens in a company.


We uncover hidden cultural strengths and insights by thoroughly examining how people learn, engage, and show vulnerability. When new leaders enter an organization believing a complete cultural overhaul is needed, when it isn't, they waste time and money. Instead, they should focus on enhancing existing strengths, nurturing and supporting them to unlock significant impact and foster human brilliance.Working with 12 million people or one, with $1 or $1000 in your bank account — anyone can foster environments that illuminate the brilliance in others. Make mindful decisions to craft spaces for individuals to reach their fullest potential. Progress towards brilliance is a mosaic of smaller yet significant achievements — each one a spark of brilliance deserving of celebration in its contribution to the larger glow of success.

38,63 Small Business Ideas to Start in 2024,"Mar 15, 2024","The Staff of Entrepreneur Media, Inc.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/need-a-business-idea-here-are-55/201588,"
Many people dream of starting their own business. Running an enterprise in your home, garage or on the go means you can take more control over your professional goals, set more ambitious financial targets and achieve a more desirable work-life balance.But what if you're ready to start a business but don't know what type of services to provide? You've come to the right place if you need profitable business ideas. Below, find a detailed breakdown of 63 small business ideas — from financial services to physical labor and creative contracting — to help you chart a path forward.Some of these opportunities require more experience or credentials than others. Some can be started from home for cheap, while others require dedicated office space and capital investment. To ensure you choose the right business venture for yourself, it's crucial to consider a few factors before you pursue a sole proprietorship.



How do you determine the best small business idea?Consider your current skill set and credentials.For instance, if you already have a CPA license, venturing out as a freelance accountant (as detailed below) would be a natural avenue to explore. If you have experience as a writer, you might consider editorial services, or if you've spent years working in the food and beverage industry, you could explore catering or becoming a personal chef.As you explore your options, consider if you'll need to secure special licenses (for example, hairstylists and electricians) or if the work requires additional education and credentialing.Determine the goals of your small business.For some people, starting a small business means leaving their full-time gig and committing to the new endeavor. For others, a part-time business provides meaningful supplemental income and can be managed in addition to other work. Consider how much money you're hoping to earn from the business, how many clients or customers you'll need to be profitable and how many hours you'll need to work each week to make it feasible.Think about capital costs, as well as growth: Will launching the business require the purchase of equipment or other serious financial investment? Do you plan to hire employees? Will you expand to multiple locations? At the outset, it's a good idea to create a formal business plan.Study your location and identify what's most feasible there.Finding customers and clients is essential to any small business, so conduct a market analysis before you open shop. For instance, your boat cleaning business will be significantly more successful if you live near a coast, and your side hustle as an interpreter will likely be more profitable if you live in a diverse community.You should also research what businesses already exist. Is there a dearth of dependable landscapers in your market? Is there a glut of professional photographers in your town? Answering these questions will help you determine the viability of your idea.Decide if you want to run a business online or in person.The digital age has created many opportunities for entrepreneurs to run a business from behind a laptop, meaning their enterprise can go wherever they choose. That's not for everyone, though. If you want to run a brick-and-mortar shop at the heart of your community or are more comfortable interacting with customers and clients in person, launch a business that will allow you to achieve those goals.Financial and Business Service Ideas1. Accounting and Tax ServicesExperience, training or licensing may be needed


At some point, most people seek the advice of a good bookkeeper or accountant, whether to prepare for tax season, get advice for starting a business or simply plan for the future. If you're already a Certified Public Accountant, you can earn good money by going out on your own.If you're not already trained as an accountant or licensed by the state you live in, you'll want to explore the recommended educational prerequisites and plan to obtain the appropriate credentials. Most tax preparation franchises offer courses, seminars and training to get you ready to work for them.You'll also want to think about the types of services you'll provide:Do you want to simply do bookkeeping for small businesses?Or do you also want to prepare balance sheets, income statements and other financial reports?Other specializations can include tax accounting — a huge area of potential work.2. Business ConsultingHas expansion possibilitiesWith a consulting business, you can work with a wide range of businesses on a variety of business problems. You could help new entities get off the ground by creating business plans, conducting market research and organizing a management structure.Depending on your level of experience, you could also help large organizations through difficult transitions and periods of restructuring or outline a successful exit strategy by providing executive-level advice and guidance on an array of matters core to the business' mission.A good calendar app will likely come in handy as time-tracking is crucial to accurate billing.3. Financial Planning and AdvisingExperience, training or licensing may be neededFinancial advisors help millions of Americans save for things like retirement and college funds while also helping them grow their wealth through various investments. If your goal is to become a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), you'll have to complete coursework and ultimately pass an exam. This will earn you a certificate that shows potential clients you have expertise and credibility. Once you're certified, working as an independent financial advisor can provide a steady income.


4. Buying a FranchiseSome business experience neededThe benefits of buying a franchise are many: You'll have a proven business model, the market research is already done and the brand typically provides support to franchisees as part of the purchase. Plus, many franchises can be launched for less than $10,000, including:Dream VacationsCruise PlannersJazzercise Inc.To learn more about how to buy and launch a franchise, read Entrepreneur's basics of buying a franchise business.Related: Considering franchise ownership?

Notary Public ServicesExperience, training or licensing may be neededIn most states, a notary public is a state officer who is authorized to witness and attest to the legalities of certain documents by stamping a seal and signing. Most states require that you pass an exam and a background check, but it costs very little to become a notary. You can generate significant income from notary work by charging fees for services such as loan-signing notarizations.Manual Labor Business Ideas6. General ConstructionExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you have experience working in construction, you may be ready to start your own handyman business and take on projects of your own. From building a fence to hanging drywall or framing an addition, many people need skilled laborers who can do quality work on time.If you have a network of skilled people whose work you trust, you could also subcontract some of the construction and spend more time finding clients and growing your business. Check with your state to determine what permits and licenses you need to get started.7. LandscapingExperience, training or licensing may be needed


Put your green thumb to work. Most people want their yards tidied up in the spring, their lawns mowed in the summer, their leaves removed in the fall, their shrubs trimmed and their trees cared for. Your landscaping business could also offer irrigation services, including the installation and repair of sprinkler lines, as well as blowing them out before winter.Garden work, such as planting annuals and perennials and vegetable garden preparation, can also be a lucrative business. There is plenty to do in the yard that has nothing to do with plants: stone wall restoration, fencing, artificial turf installation and more.Read This: Start Your Own Lawn Care or Landscaping Business by The Staff of Entrepreneur Media and Cheryl Kimball | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble8. House PaintingExperience, training or licensing may be neededRegardless of the season, you can make good money with a residential painting business — inside and out. Before you begin offering services, you'll want to work with professional painters and learn the basics:Masking a houseLaying a drop clothChoosing the appropriate paints and brushes for various indoor and outdoor climatesYou'll also need to invest in some basic equipment — ladders, brushes, trays and more. Once you're set up, you can begin marketing your services to customers through a variety of online platforms with relatively low upfront costs.9. CarpentryExperience, training or licensing may be neededWoodworking is in high demand these days, and if you're a talented carpenter, there are a variety of ways you can make money. Residential projects like cabinets, tables and shelves are often high on homeowners' lists and typically pay well. You can also make good money with boutique projects like gallery frames, hand-carved figurines and other work. In some cases, you can work for general contractors to frame doorways and support larger construction projects.10. Electrical WorkExperience, training or licensing may be neededBecoming an electrician is not easy — you must take classes, work as an apprentice and pass licensing exams before you can start your own business — but there's no shortage of work for electricians. Master electricians are always in demand for small and large projects, and you'll have the ability to hire apprentices, build a team and scale your business offerings.


11. Moving ServicesHas expansion possibilitiesWhen people move, they often want to hire someone to do the heavy lifting for them — literally. You can focus your work on local moves across town or to the town next door. As your business ramps up, you may also offer large-scale, long-distance moving services if you have the personnel and equipment to accommodate it. Advertise around town to convince the locals to let you take care of their move, provide excellent customer service and watch your business grow.Read This: Start Your Own Freelance Writing Business and More by Entrepreneur Press and George Sheldon | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & NobleCreative Work Business Ideas12. Content and Editorial ContractingHas expansion possibilitiesAlmost every business or organization needs good writers and editors, and if you have the skills to go out on your own, you'll likely find a bevy of work. From copyediting to developmental editing, ghostwriting and digital content production, freelance writers and editors can find clients in a host of industries, including marketing, communications, journalism and book publishing. To get started, you'll need to create a portfolio of work that exemplifies your skills for writing, content creation and/or editing–this will help you build relationships with potential clients.13. Graphic DesignExperience, training or licensing may be neededHave an eye for design?

VideographyExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you can do quality work behind a camera and edit footage well, there are plenty of opportunities for videography work, from creating brand videos for organizations to filming events, weddings and interviews. Your clients could include outdoor brands, small nonprofits and big corporations, but you'll want to have some filming and editing training and experience creating quality content before you launch your business.18. Audio EditingExperience, training or licensing may be needed


Audio storytelling is a growing industry, with countless podcasts being streamed daily by listeners all over the world. If you have experience recording and editing audio, you could shop your services to media brands, businesses or individuals who might want to launch their own podcasts. And who knows? Maybe you can use your skills to launch and monetize a podcast of your own.19. Social Media ManagementSome experience neededAlthough many businesses want to enhance their social media presence, they often don't have the skills or internal bandwidth to grow their following and post engaging content.If you're skilled at brainstorming content plans and writing snappy copy — and you already spend many hours on social media — it might be worth launching your own social media marketing enterprise. Clients might have you create a content marketing plan, monitor and reply to comments and report growth statistics monthly.20. ArtHas expansion possibilitiesIf making art is already your hobby, you might be able to turn it into a profitable business. You can sell your work on sites like Etsy, enter your work in shows or ink contracts with clients who need illustrators or custom art as part of their brand assets.

Repair and Maintenance Business Ideas22. Mechanic ShopExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you've spent years working on your vehicles and know your way around an engine, it could be time to offer your services to customers. Depending on where you live, you may not need to obtain a mechanics license, but taking some formal classes and earning a certification will help build trust with customers.Many shops require licensing before hiring mechanics, so if you're looking to get some experience before launching your own business, you'll likely want to take some classes.23. Appliance RepairExperience, training or licensing may be neededEvery household has several appliances — from refrigerators to dishwashers to dryers — and appliances tend to break down, so appliance repair is one of the best business ideas for any area. You can work on your own or contract with appliance stores to cover their warranty service calls — or some of each.Start slow and build your customer base on recommendations and referrals from work well done. You could also develop relationships with contractors to be the go-to person to install appliances in newly constructed houses.24. Bicycle RepairSome experience neededAlmost every bike needs a good tune-up. This business tends to be seasonal in many parts of the country, but you can find ways around that. If you have the space, you could offer to store people's bicycles during the winter after you do a tune-up and any needed repairs on them.And if you keep Saturday shop hours, you could make your shop a meeting place for cycling enthusiasts. If you live in a bike-oriented place, you may be able to purchase and sell used bikes, making some money as a retailer on top of your repair business.25. Boat CleaningExperience, training or licensing may be needed


Boats hauled out of the water for the winter or even just for mid-season repairs will need their hulls cleaned. Depending on the type of boat, it might also be time for a major cleaning of everything else—the decks, the sleeping quarters, the head and the holds.Start by advertising on Nextdoor, Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, reaching out to homes with boats sitting in their yard, or marketing your services to a local marina.26. Car Cleaning & DetailingHas expansion possibilitiesMaking a car shine inside and out isn't easy work, which is why many people don't want to do it themselves. Plus, because drive-thru car washes don't clean every corner, there's a market for car cleaning and detailing across the country. With a little investment in materials (soaps, scrubs, hoses, vacuums, etc.), you could make house calls or rent a garage space where customers can drop off their vehicles.27. Electronics RepairExperience, training or licensing may be neededWhether it's a laptop, a television, a tablet or a specialized radio, if you're handy with circuit boards, you could run a profitable business for customers whose electronics are on the fritz. You'll want to run the business out of your home or a storefront so people can bring equipment directly to you. Not unlike other repair shops, your business may evolve to the point where you're buying used electronics and selling them to your customers.28. Furniture RestorationExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you have a knack for sewing and woodwork, upholstery and restoration might be a natural business idea. Many books and online videos can be helpful as you learn the trade, but nothing will be as helpful as finding some discarded furniture and tearing it apart before restuffing and constructing it.Often, furniture in need of upholstering will also require repairs—sanding, staining, or reinforcing damaged areas. Much of this work is relatively minor (you don't have to be a carpenter) and can add significant upsell value to your services.Read This: Spruce: A Step-by-Step Guide to Upholstery and Design by Amanda Brown |Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble


29. Rug CleaningExperience, training or licensing may be neededMost people don't have the time or space to do more for their rugs than a basic vacuum.

You should also decide whether you will take on valuable antique rugs and family heirlooms. If you do, you should consider getting specialized training in handling and properly cleaning these carpets.Learn how to get tough stains and odors out of carpets — such as dog and cat odors — and customers will seek your services out. You'll need a dedicated space for people to drop off their rugs, so plan for that as you set up your business.30. Jewelry Making and RepairExperience, training or licensing may be neededThere are many different ways of getting into the jewelry business and different types of materials you can work with. Manipulating metal will require specific tools since you need to heat the metal and use tools to cut and engrave, but you'll likely also work with glass, gemstones, and maybe even wood. The wider the variety of materials you can work with, , the broader the range of repair services you can provide to your customers, including stone polishing and setting.Read This: Start Your Own Fashion Accessories Business by Entrepreneur Press and Eileen F. Sandlin | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & NobleProperty and Real Estate Business Ideas31. Real EstateExperience, training or licensing may be neededEvery community needs trusted real estate agents.

Once you've done that, you can start offering services and building your business from scratch.32. Property ManagementExperience, training or licensing may be neededMany people manage properties as a side hustle. Maybe you have a vacation home that you use for short-term rentals or perhaps you have an additional property with a long-term lease. If you want to dive in full-time, you can acquire multiple properties and be a full-time landlord. In the case of rental units, your job will be to make sure the property is running smoothly, ensure tenants are paying rent and honoring their lease terms, and be available in case of any issues. You can also contract with individual property owners to serve as their property manager, lightening their load by taking care of the landlord duties for them.


33. Cleaning ServiceNo experience neededThere are many directions you can take this small business idea. If you want to work during hours when no one else does, you can focus your cleaning business on office clients. You can provide cleaning services to retail businesses and keep your customers within one or two blocks. Restaurants need daily thorough cleaning and can also be a great source of steady clients. But, if you're more interested in house cleaning, you can start with a small number of clients, and new customers will likely emerge via word of mouth.Read This: Start Your Own Cleaning Service by Entrepreneur Press and Jacquelyn Lynn |Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble34. Professional OrganizingHas expansion possibilitiesSpatial planning is not everyone's strength. If it's yours, you can make good money as a professional organizer for individuals and businesses. For individuals, you can choose either to do the organizing work — maybe a kids' playroom or a cluttered garage — or consult with the homeowner to help them better organize themselves.Businesses, too, don't always know how to organize their office and maximize the efficiency of their spaces. You can consult on ways to better arrange furniture, desks, conference areas, stockrooms and more.35. Home InspectionExperience, training or licensing may be neededTo be a successful inspector, first establish contacts with real estate agents who can recommend your services to customers. Home inspection can be an incredibly competitive market so you will need to constantly update your education and knowledge. For instance, Builders are constantly introducing new materials. If you only know about wood decks, you will not know how to inspect and assess the new materials on the market, such as composites that look like real wood. Also, stay apprised of all safety updates regarding materials and problems with things like off-gassing, carbon monoxide production and other chemical hazards.Read This: Start Your Own Home Inspection Service by Entrepreneur Press | Amazon |eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble36.

Nutritional AdvisingExperience, training or licensing may be neededWith so many different dieting trends and supplements in the world, a nutritionist can help people better understand the landscape of healthy eating and living. Although nutritionists don't offer medical nutritional counseling or treat illnesses (as a dietitian does), there is still a wide market for the work.First, determine what kind of nutrition service you want to provide — pediatric, sports, holistic or something else — and then work toward credentialing.

Life CoachingExperience, training or licensing may be neededLife coaching has exploded in popularity over the past decade, as many people are looking to recreate or realign their personal goals.

Start by choosing the subject area that best fits your strengths. For instance, if you're a professional writer or English teacher, you could offer essay writing help.

Consider branching out into catering to serve large events like weddings and corporate banquets.

Maybe you've already been experimenting with brewing at home.? If so, opening a brewery could be an option. But first, you'll want to pursue training in brewing sciences and work as an apprentice to someone who knows the craft well.

Hair Styling / Barber ShopExperience, training or licensing may be neededStyling hair or working as a barber is a popular business idea that can be lucrative if you have the right skills and online presence. Typically, a home-based hairstylist business or barber shop would be started by someone with a cosmetology career who wants to go out on their own.

You'll need to obtain the appropriate licenses before you can launch your own business.58. Nail TechnicianExperience, training or licensing may be neededIf you'd like to offer professional nail styling to clients, most states require that you complete cosmetology school — the number of hours varies depending on where you live.

Storage FacilityHas expansion possibilitiesPeople tend to acquire more things than they can reasonably store in their homes. If you have land, you could make meaningful income by storing large items like recreational vehicles, boats, trailers and campers.

Independent Car Service / Ride-Sharing DriverDriving experience neededIf you drive for companies like Uber and Lyft, you lose a percentage of your wage to the company. However, there are still market demands for private drivers.

Anyone can get into this type of business as long as they're willing to hustle.63. Interpreting or Translating ServicesExperience, training or licensing may be neededIn communities with international populations, dependable interpreters and translators are extremely valuable. If you already speak multiple languages, you could earn extra income as an interpreter if you pursue a certification, which typically involves about 40 hours of training.From there, you can determine what type of translation service clients you're seeking: business professionals, government officials, folks who need documents translated and more.How to Get StartedAddressing these foundational ""business checklist"" elements early on can set a strong course for growth and operational efficiency for your entrepreneurial endeavor.1.

39,How to Battle Burnout While Protecting Your Most Valuable Asset — Your People,"Mar 14, 2024",Apu Pavithran,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-battle-cybersecurity-burnout-and-protect-your-people/470720,"
The cyber threat landscape is a relentless battlefield. As leaders in this unforgiving arena, we wear many hats — strategists, innovators, risk mitigators and, most importantly, leaders. In this constant state of defense, it's easy to overlook the most critical line of protection: our own people, the cybersecurity professionals who stand guard day and night. They are the human firewall, the skilled hands deciphering cryptic codes and thwarting insidious attacks. But here's a brutal truth: they are burning out.The numbers paint a grim picture. A Forrester study last year revealed that a staggering 66% of cybersecurity professionals experienced extreme stress and burnout, with 51% being prescribed medicine and 19% consuming three drinks daily to deal with the stress. This isn't just a human cost; it's a business vulnerability. Burnout threatens to leave our digital castles unguarded in an industry already plagued by a 4 million talent gap.Related: How to Spot Entrepreneurial Burnout (Before It's Too Late)



Reframing the narrativeThe causes of cybersecurity burnout are multifaceted. The ever-evolving threat landscape generates a constant sense of urgency and an unending race against unseen adversaries. Long hours, on-call expectations, and the weight of potential breaches together create a highly strenuous environment. In addition to the resource crunch, understaffed teams grapple with inadequate budgets and outdated tools, further amplifying the stress.To reframe this narrative, realizing that fostering such an environment starts by acknowledging stress is important. Hence, the first step is to promote open dialogue about the pressures associated with cybersecurity work. Creating a safe space for employees to express their concerns and providing adequate support can significantly impact them.


Companies that promote and facilitate the exchange of information and knowledge among different functions and departments tend to be more cohesive in pursuing objectives. Enhanced collaboration often leads to greater trust among teams, which in turn promotes additional sharing of knowledge. This positive cycle can significantly enhance organizational cybersecurity, as each employee's actions contribute to overall resilience. Another pillar of a stress-free workplace is encouraging a healthy work-life balance. Cybersecurity professionals must be reminded to take breaks, utilize vacation days, and disconnect after working hours. Moreover, leading by example is essential; as leaders, demonstrating healthy boundaries sends a powerful message.Related: Are You at Risk for Burnout? This Psychologist-Created Quiz Lets You Know in 5 MinutesBuilding sustainable systemsAddressing burnout doesn't stop with individual-level interventions. It necessitates a strategic and systemic approach that addresses the root causes. Businesses must take charge of building sustainable systems that support and enhance the resilience of the cybersecurity workforce.One significant contributor to burnout is the overwhelming workload faced by IT teams. As companies embrace digital transformation, they have access to many solutions, each with its own benefits. However, a major drawback is the increasing burden on IT professionals. In this context, solutions integrating multiple capabilities are invaluable in lightening the workload.


For example, implementing a unified endpoint management (UEM) solution consolidates device management, application management, patch management and more into a single console. Similarly, secure access service edge (SASE) combines network connectivity and security functionalities into a unified platform.Another approach is promoting cross-training. This facilitates knowledge sharing and fosters a collaborative approach within the cybersecurity team. Furthermore, it helps distribute workloads more effectively while also cultivating a sense of collective ownership. Finally, offering avenues for continuous training and upskilling ensures that employees have the necessary knowledge to stay ahead in the ever-evolving threat landscape.Related: Cyber Attacks Are On the Rise — Here's How Your Business Can Continuously Prepare for ThreatsCultivating an atmosphere of appreciation and recognitionIt's often easy to overlook the tireless efforts of our cybersecurity professionals, working diligently behind the scenes to thwart attacks without seeking recognition. Yet, this silent service deserves acknowledgment. Recognizing their contributions and celebrating their successes can reignite their passion and dedication. Highlighting successful security outcomes and the individuals responsible fosters a sense of pride and accomplishment.


Additionally, to foster a culture of collaboration and trust, break down silos, and encourage open communication and information sharing across teams. Empowering employees to contribute their unique perspectives fosters a sense of belonging and deepens appreciation for their invaluable contributions.We are fortunate to be in an era where mental health is regarded as important as physical health. However, in a field known for high-stakes scenarios, mental health often takes a back seat. Therefore, businesses should ensure that employees have access to assistance programs and mental health resources, fostering an environment where discussions about mental health are normalized and stigma-free.In short, cybersecurity burnout is not an inevitable consequence of the job. It's a systemic issue demanding leadership. We can turn the tide by prioritizing our people's well-being, empowering them with the right tools and resources, and fostering a culture of support and appreciation. Remember that protecting our data and systems starts with protecting the human beings who are our most valuable assets in this digital warzone.

41,"If You Want to be Successful, Become a Better Speaker — Follow This 7-Step Process for Effective Speaking","Mar 13, 2024",Scott Deming,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-be-an-better-communicator-in-7-steps/470597,"
Back in the late 1980s, when I was in the early stages of establishing my advertising agency, an invitation came my way to speak at a Chamber of Commerce event in Upstate New York. I turned it down. At that moment, the idea of declining might have seemed counterintuitive, especially given my aspirations to grow my business.The reason? I was afraid. Fear held me back from seizing an opportunity that could have propelled my agency forward. Not long after that failed opportunity, a pivotal moment arrived during a staff meeting. A few days after the meeting, my Art Director approached me with feedback that was both unsettling and enlightening. He said that everyone had been confused about a particular topic I had discussed, yet no one felt comfortable confronting me about it.This incident served as a wake-up call, prompting me to confront my fears and recognize the crucial role effective communication plays in business success. It was clear that if I intended to thrive as a businessperson, especially in a leadership role, mastering the art of public speaking was not just an option — it was a necessity.



Fast forward to today, forty years later. I started and ran a very successful advertising agency for nearly twenty years. I have been speaking and training globally for over twenty years. I can say with 100% certainty that focusing on better presentation skills after that feedback from my employee was the most important career decision I've ever made.Related: The Complete, 20-Step Guide to Ace Public Speaking


You don't have to be a professional speaker to speak like a professionalThroughout my career, I've had the distinct privilege of coaching aspiring professional speakers as well as numerous executives, guiding them toward becoming not just better communicators but compelling presenters. Whether it's delivering a critical pitch to board members, leading a staff meeting, or captivating an audience at industry conferences, the power to communicate with both passion and precision is paramount. And by precision, I mean far more than just covering bullet points. It's about hitting those crucial, emotionally charged points that truly connect with your audience.Related: What is a Keynote Speaker and Why Are They Important?Improving presentation skills is an ongoing process that can significantly enhance a leader's effectiveness and ability to achieve organizational objectives. Here are seven steps to becoming a better presenter and a more effective communicator.Understand your audience: Begin by researching and understanding your audience. What are their interests, challenges, and expectations? Tailoring your message to the audience's needs and perspectives increases engagement and impact.Master your content: Know your material inside and out. This doesn't mean memorizing your presentation word for word but being comfortable with the content so you can adapt on the fly, answer questions, and engage in meaningful dialogue.Practice relentlessly: If possible, practice your presentation multiple times in various settings. This can include practicing in front of a mirror, with a trusted friend or colleague, or recording yourself to review your performance. The goal is to become comfortable with your delivery and refine your pacing, tone, and body language.Engage with storytelling: Incorporate storytelling into your presentations. Stories are powerful tools for making complex information understandable and memorable. Use personal anecdotes or hypothetical scenarios that resonate with your audience's experiences.Hone your nonverbal communication: Pay attention to your body language, eye contact, and use of space. Nonverbal cues can reinforce your message or, if not managed well, distract from it. Ensure your posture is confident, your gestures are purposeful, and you maintain eye contact with your audience to build a connection.Manage nervous energy: Learn techniques to manage anxiety and nervous energy. This can include deep breathing exercises, positive visualization, or a pre-presentation routine that helps you center yourself. Recognize that some nervousness is natural and can be channeled into dynamic energy that enhances your presentation.Seek feedback and continuously improve: After each presentation, seek constructive feedback from peers, mentors, or audience members. Reflect on what worked well and what could be improved. Consider working with a coach or joining organizations like Toastmasters International to gain insights and practice in a supportive environment.By following these steps and committing to continuous improvement, you'll become a better speaker or presenter and a more effective communicator, capable of inspiring and leading others with confidence and clarity.


Related: 10 Public Speaking Hacks I Learned From My TED TalkRemember, effective public speaking is essential in leadership — it's not just a skill. It's a necessity. Now, let's delve into the key benefits of mastering presentation skills for any leader.Influence and persuasion: Effective presentation skills enable leaders to influence their audience's attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Persuasive presentations can motivate teams, sway stakeholders, and drive organizational change. A leader who is a compelling presenter can better advocate for their vision, inspire action and garner support for initiatives.Clarity and direction: Leaders often need to communicate complex information, strategies, and visions to a diverse audience. Being a better presenter helps ensure that messages are delivered clearly and concisely, reducing misunderstandings and aligning the team with organizational goals. Clear presentations help demystify complex issues and provide a roadmap for what needs to be done.Credibility and trust: Presentation skills are directly tied to a leader's credibility. Leaders who present confidently and effectively are more likely to be perceived as knowledgeable and competent. This perception builds trust within the team and among stakeholders, which is essential for effective leadership and collaboration.Engagement and inspiration: Dynamic presentation skills help leaders engage their audience emotionally and intellectually. By being a better presenter, a leader can connect with their audience on a personal level, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose. This engagement is crucial for inspiring teams and driving them to embrace challenges and achieve goals.Adaptability and impact: Leaders must be able to tailor presentations to different audiences and situations. Effective presenters can adjust their message, tone, and delivery to suit the situation, whether they're motivating a team, pitching to investors, or speaking at a large conference. This adaptability maximizes the impact of their communication, ensuring that their messages resonate broadly and drive desired outcomes.In conclusion, becoming an exceptional presenter is a personal and professional evolution, marking a leader's commitment to excellence and influence. It's a path that amplifies a leader's effectiveness and elevates the entire organization. For leaders aiming to leave a lasting imprint on their teams, stakeholders, and industry, refining presentation skills is not just a strategy — it's a mission. As we've seen, the benefits are clear, transformative, and within reach for those ready to embrace the challenge and harness the power of truly impactful communication.

42,You Can Fear It and Still Use It — Why Are So Many American Workers Shy About AI?,"Mar 13, 2024",Artis Rozentals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/you-can-fear-ai-and-still-embrace-it-heres-why/470581,"
Recently, a study followed over 100,000 workers from the USA, Europe, the UK and India, tracking time spent in various AI applications during work hours. The tracked apps include AI apps such as ChatGPT and Perplexity and AI-enabled tools such as Canva and Bing that have added AI features to their apps.Here's how many hours the average worker spent using AI apps by country/region in 2023:USA – 93.6h (~12 eight-hour workdays)UK – 150.1h (~19 workdays)Europe – 175.1h (~22 workdays)India – 241h (~30 workdays)Moreover, generative AI darling ChatGPT was the most used AI app in all regions — except for the USA, where it came in second to the AI-enabled design tool Canva.



The data, corroborated by other studies, also strongly points to the average US worker being an outlier regarding AI adoption, which raises the question — why? And is it something to be worried about?Related: Why People Fear Generative AI — and What to Do About It


Why is it a worrying trend?Much ink has been spilled on how AI is a game-changer for businesses and knowledge workers. For employees specifically, it promises heightened efficiency and productivity across various fields, from content creation and design to business operations and data analysis.The general consensus is that companies and workers who fail to capitalize on these benefits will inevitably have to give way to those who do. Accordingly, there is a real risk of Americans falling behind the curve unless adoption is encouraged.Not just in terms of lost efficiency but also knowledge. We're still in the early stages of the AI revolution, meaning AI will only grow more advanced and capable as time passes. So, understanding the fundamentals of what AI is and how to leverage it can be invaluable in the long term, especially when AI becomes fully ingrained in our way of life and work.A good analogy is GenZ's relationship with technology. Having grown up with smartphones in hand, they're often unfairly expected to be tech-savvy and are even ridiculed when they struggle with some tech tasks that older generations may find self-evident. But this self-evidence comes from having grown up in tandem with the developing technology (What do you mean why is the save button a weird square?!) rather than any innate superior comprehension. Similarly, I expect that being intimately aware of how AI evolves will be advantageous to its users in the future, and early adopters will have the upper hand.


Related: Why You Shouldn't Be Afraid of Artificial IntelligenceOn top of all that, prompt engineering — the action of giving AI the best prompt for the intended results — is a skill, and just like any other skill, it must be honed. AI is a tool that must be learned and explored to get the most out of it, and the earlier you set out on your exploratory journey, the better equipped you will be for future challenges.At this point, one might ask – but what's the point if AI will take our jobs anyway?It's about attitudeUnderstandably, AI's disruptive potential and multifaceted capabilities have many workers worried about being made redundant. The public attitude toward AI is grim — nearly half of Americans believe that AI automation may hurt their job security, and three in four expect AI to negatively affect the job market at large, according to Gallup.


Of course, these worries are by no means exclusive to American workers. A public attitude survey by the UK's Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation found that ""while AI is expected to produce increased day-to-day convenience and improved public services, apprehensions remain about job displacement and human de-skilling."" French companies and employees are also concerned.But there's an outlier – India.While more than half of Indian workers mirror the growing unease about AI's potential impact on jobs, it's paired with optimism about the technology, with 74% excited about the prospect of AI in the workplace. The overwhelming majority view AI as an enabler that can significantly improve efficiency, productivity, quality of work, job satisfaction and overall happiness.I believe this, namely, attitude toward technology, is one major reason why workers in India use AI over two-and-a-half times more than American ones.Related: AI May Not Take Your Job, But Someone Using AI Likely Will — Here's Why.Unsubscribe from the nihilistic narrativeIn the Western public discourse, AI is generally portrayed as an existential threat to our way of life, as a foe coming to take our jobs and upend any shred of normalcy left in these turbulent times.Understandably, the natural response is to resist or to close your eyes and hope the trend will pass. But neither of these is realistic, as AI continues to permeate modern business and work environments.Faced with the fact that AI is here to stay, I believe the only viable avenue is to embrace it. Though its inner workings may be complex, the technology itself is extremely accessible, and any misconceptions can be quickly dispelled by simply trying it. In this regard, business leaders should carry the torch and encourage employees to begin using AI, if for no other reason than at least to alleviate their own daily workloads.


It's okay to be worried about change – everyone is. But don't let that stop you from growing as an entrepreneur or professional.As the freshly minted adage goes, ""AI won't take your job. Workers who use AI will.""

43,4 Types of Toxic People That May Be Undermining Your Path to Success,"Mar 12, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-types-of-toxic-people-you-need-to-keep-out-of-your-life/469742,"
Since becoming a personal and professional coach, I've noticed with increased intensity how much the people we surround ourselves with matter. In his 2005 book, The Success Principles, Jack Canfield quoted motivational speaker Jim Rohn, saying that we're the ""average of the top five people"" we associate with. I've found this to be incredibly true. The people we spend the most time with influence nearly all our thoughts and values. Essentially, we become a reflection of them.As we identify the right people, it's equally important that we identify the wrong people. In my recent book, 6 H.A.B.I.T.S. of Powerful People, I identified four types of people that are best avoided. If you want to generate a successful and happy life, avoid associating with the following people.Related: 7 Toxic People to Avoid When Starting a Business



1. Gossips: If they gossip with you, they'll gossip about youThere's only so much airtime in conversations. When we focus on one topic, we can't focus on another. Each minute you spend discussing other people is a minute you're not spending discussing your own ideas. Often, gossips stay stuck because they're so busy talking about things they can't control (other people) that they don't make time to talk about the things they can control (themselves). When you're with them, you forego opportunities to explore your own visions of the future: things you're passionate about, what you stand for, the life you'd like to create for yourself and how you plan to make an impact in the world.Psychologist Murray Brown theorized that a two-person emotional system is unstable: under stress, it forms itself into a three-person system or triangle. Gossiping with others can be a way of building a bond with them, which serves as a substitute for bonding over something more meaningful. Sadly, when people learn to build bonds in this way (triangulating: involving a third absent party), it's hard for them to turn it off. It becomes a pattern of behavior, and this habit is hard to break.


Ask yourself how much you're gossiping with friends. Consider how you'd feel if these friends gossiped about you. If you want to feel happier in your friendships, look for new things to discuss besides other people. Talking about your recent challenges, learnings and successes usually feels good. Talking about your future dreams, goals or plans is also quite exciting.2. Liars: They'd rather save face than face a tough conversationHonesty is critically important in relationships. People who lie, especially repeatedly, break trust. Relationships built on distrust are extremely unstable. You waste valuable time wondering if what you're being told is the truth, and once again, that time is better spent building bonds of connectedness. It's possible to regain trust when it's gone, but it isn't easy and takes a lot of work.Healthy relationships are built on trust, not lies. Anyone who feels it's a good idea to deceive you instead of having a tough conversation usually lacks character. If you've lied to anyone recently, consider proactively fessing up. It might not be pleasant, especially in the moment, but telling people the truth feels good and shows your companion that you truly value them and the relationship. It also helps you get right with yourself.Related: How to Improve Your Relationships — Both Personally and Professionally


3. Dream killers: They don't support your goalsIdentifying and manifesting our dreams is hard work. Surrounding ourselves with people who don't believe in us or aren't willing to support us is a surefire way to fail. We can all do nearly anything we want in life, if we have the right level of desire, focus, determination, discipline and preparation. But associating with people who tell us our dreams are silly (especially if it's coming from someone we respect or love) makes it much harder.In 2014, I decided I wanted to become a runner. Back then, I couldn't even run a 5K. I logged hours of training and in 2015, I completed my first half-marathon. I then decided to run a full marathon. A close friend (whom I greatly admired) told me this feat would be nearly impossible for me: I didn't have the years of experience to achieve such a lofty goal. I almost listened to her. Before I did, I enlisted the advice of a few running acquaintances I'd met in the previous year. These new friends offered an incredible amount of encouragement and helped me recognize how strong and capable I'd become.I decided to listen to them instead of my close friend and ran my first marathon in early 2016. I now see I was on a slippery slope at that time. Had I listened to my longtime friend instead of my new acquaintances, I might never have run a marathon. Now, I've run 12. I found so much strength in their words. Surrounding myself with the right people at a time of major mental and physical struggle and growth helped me accomplish something remarkable (to me).Ask yourself if you have any friends who continually tell you that things are out of reach for you. Great friends will support your wildest dreams and cheer you on, not tear you down. After this experience, I decided to only keep friends who encourage my success even when it has nothing to do with their own success.


Related: 8 Toxic Types of People You Should Keep Out of Your Life4. Post-Its: They put you in sticky situationsNo good friend will do this. The best relationships in life are the ones where we feel safe and secure. We feel able to be ourselves. We don't feel unaligned with our core values. Any person who feels comfortable putting you in uncomfortable situations so they can advance a selfish motive isn't a friend. Think about your friends. Do you have any who routinely put you in dangerous or uncomfortable situations that don't result in your growth? Or encourage you to compromise your values? If so, it's time to reevaluate.Keep these kinds of people out of your life, and I guarantee you'll be happier and more successful. Even though it can be hard to tell a toxic friend goodbye, your life will improve because of it. The discomfort of making the decision and having the conversation is well worth the benefits that come from being choosy about the company you keep.

44,I Attended an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class and Learned How Steve Jobs Became a Better Leader in 10 Minutes,"Mar 8, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/heres-how-steve-jobs-became-a-better-leader-in-10-minutes/470841,"
Hitendra Wadhwa, professor of practice at Columbia Business School and founder of Mentora Institute, teaches the university's most popular class on personal leadership and success — two topics that most business students are eager to learn more about.That much was clear on the rainy January day when I sat in on the afternoon session of Wadhwa's course; despite the dreary weather, the energy was palpable, with every seat taken and some attendees even standing in the back.Wadhwa wrote the literal book on looking inward to find outward success. In Inner Mastery, Outer Impact: How Your Five Core Energies Hold the Key to Success, Wadhwa reveals how activating purpose, wisdom, growth, love and self-realization can help people make a real mark on the world.

During the session I attended, Wadhwa relayed a compelling story about Steve Jobs that captures those core energies in action — and shows that the best leaders are willing to pivot, even when it's difficult.""Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.""The story starts in 2001, just before Apple was set to open its first retail store. Ron Johnson, the company's senior vice president of retail from 2000 to 2011, was riding to a weekly planning meeting with Jobs when he shared his concerns about the proposed layout of the new store.Like most retail outlets, Apple planned to organize its store by product. But Johnson saw an opportunity to design it according to activity, like making movies or listening to music, and lean into the innovation that had already helped Jobs' brainchild become a category of one.


But Jobs wasn't having it: The store's opening was fast approaching, and he didn't think there was time for a complete overhaul. Johnson and Jobs sat with the tension of that disagreement as they rode the rest of the way to the meeting.Related: As Steve Jobs Once Said, 'People With Passion Can Change The World'Then, about 10 minutes later, the pair walked into the meeting, and Jobs surprised Johnson by telling the team that Johnson believed the store's design was completely misguided — and that he agreed. Jobs said he was going to step aside while they all worked together to figure out the best way forward.By telling the story about Johnson and Jobs, Wadhwa makes an invaluable point: The kind of leader someone is in one moment doesn't have to dictate the kind of leader they'll be in the next. A willingness to change your mind and think outside of the box, even when it means additional challenges in the short term, isn't a weakness — it's a strength.

45,Having Time Management Problems? Then You Must Do One Thing to Avoid These 3 Consequences,"Mar 8, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/having-time-management-problems-try-this-weekly-habit/469749,"
Nearly everyone wishes they had more time. One of the biggest challenges facing most of my clients is finding enough time to ""do it all."" We have more time-saving tools and resources at our fingertips than ever before. Many of them come in the form of electronic devices that exist to serve us. Yet, most of us report having less time than ever before.Ultimately, time management is just self-management. Those of us who do it well experience much higher levels of satisfaction and success in every area of our lives. My advice? Carve out 1-2 hours early in the week to strategize and plan your time and calendar. Many of us don't make time to do this (because we feel we can't), but that's a mistake. Here's what happens if you don't do this every week.Related: 5 Reasons Why You Need to Learn Time Management for Your Business



1. You'll never connect to your wildest goals and your core valuesWhen you don't regularly make time to check in with yourself, you rob yourself of opportunities to identify what you're passionate about, where your talents lie and what you were put on this earth to do. You'll start to forget your ""why."" The things that must be done today will always feel more urgent than the things you'd like to do tomorrow — but the latter is often far more important.Without alone time to focus on the future, it's incredibly easy to get sucked into the day-to-day minutiae or whatever deadline your boss gave you that's fast approaching. Without intentionally pulling yourself out of the daily grind, you'll never develop a true plan for where you want to end up in five or 10 years and what you stand for. Without that, it's nearly impossible to take the right actions this week to manifest your future self.


If you have an idea of what you'd like to be remembered for, it's imperative that you spend time now crafting that specific vision and how you plan to make it happen. It won't happen on its own. This is also a chance to ensure you're living in accordance with your core values. Many verbally say things like ""family is the most important thing to me,"" but then don't back those words up with action. If you take time to remind yourself of your most important values on a weekly basis, you'll have an easier time prioritizing and committing to them.2. You won't know who to empower and what to delegateWe all have the same 24 hours in a day. Strategy time doesn't add more hours to your week; it only takes time. It doesn't allow your plate to become any bigger, but it does allow you to decide how you'll remove things from your plate. A weekly strategy session allows you to figure out what can be automated, delegated or eliminated. Ask yourself: Is there a way I can use technology to make this process faster? Is there someone around me who is better suited than me to complete this project or task, and who would also view it as a great growth opportunity? Do I have the right people on my team? How am I helping them become ready to take on more?When you make time to ask questions like these, it's amazing what epiphanies you'll have. Private strategy sessions are a great place to make plans for who you'll ask to do what and why it's the right decision — not just for you, but for them. In my days as a senior leader in financial services, I'd use my strategy time to make careful decisions about which direct reports I'd ask to lead our weekly conference calls and monthly meetings, as well as who I might tap to complete special assignments. Until I made this shift, these were all things I felt I had to do myself. It was incredible how many hours I was able to free up on my calendar once I realized that empowering the talent around me is a key part of great leadership.Related: What Are You Wasting Your Business Time On?


3. Your calendar will fill up with other people's most important priorities instead of your ownWhen you make time to strategize and plan each week, you get to load the things that matter most (to you) onto your calendar before others have the chance. As Stephen Covey said, ""Act or be acted upon. It's easier to say no when you have a greater yes in mind."" It's true. It's much easier to turn down an invite for a meeting or an event when you already have a conflict scheduled on your calendar that feels more important to you. Saying no becomes far less personal.Taking time on Sunday night or Monday morning to map out your week and give your most important priorities a place to live and breathe on your calendar strongly increases the chance that those things will get done. It's amazing how much metaphorical gravel and small rocks will fit onto your calendar (between all the cracks) once you schedule your big rocks first. This allows you to be proactive instead of reactive. If you've already been intentional and deliberate about what you want to get done each week and where you feel your time is best spent, you'll be able to articulate those thoughts more easily in the heat of a moment when someone spontaneously asks you if you can spare time for them.If you already feel that you don't have enough time, I understand that making time to strategize around your biggest priorities, plan for the future, and calendar your week feels nearly impossible. But remember: Time is not found; it's made. Don't be a slave to time. Practicing this discipline does take time, but this practice returns more time back to you, especially in the long run. This process will help you (and everyone around you) become stronger. If you consistently make time for this activity on a weekly basis, you'll eventually find that you're ahead of whatever is coming down the pike and you've got time for all the things that matter most, both professionally and personally.

46,The Era of Faceless Branding Is Over — Here's Why Modern Brands Fail and Publicity Reigns Supreme in 2024,"Mar 7, 2024",Erica McMillan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-faceless-brands-fail-and-publicity-reigns-supreme-in/470333,"
In the dynamic landscape of 2024, where brand differentiation is more vital than ever, a stark truth shines through: the era of faceless brands is fading. A brand can no longer hide behind its company logo and expect to thrive.In a world where clients and partners demand transparency and connection, being the face of the brand is paramount. This imperative finds its expression in CEOs, entrepreneurs, and founders stepping into the spotlight as thought leaders, amplifying the brand's essence and values.Related: 90% of Online Businesses Fail in Just 4 Months. You Can Avoid the Same Fate By Using These Strategies.



Turning leaders into thought-leadersIn a crowded landscape where brands compete for attention, it's not enough to merely offer a product or service. Clients and partners want more — they want to know the people behind the brand. They want a name, a face, a person they can trust. CEOs, entrepreneurs, and founders are uniquely positioned to fulfill this need. Their insights, experiences, and expertise breathe life into their brands, transforming them from impersonal entities to relatable entities.Imagine a CEO who writes an article on the future of artificial intelligence in healthcare. This piece becomes a beacon of insight, published in a prestigious outlet. This effect ripples through two dimensions: the brand emerges as an innovator, and the CEO ascends as an industry authority, a thought leader. This level of publicity instantly sets them apart, painting the business as a guiding light in the field.


Related: What Exactly Is Thought Leadership?The influence of media exposureThe days of concealing oneself behind a corporate website are over. In 2024, consumers will be savvy and discerning. They demand authenticity, transparency, and a personal connection with the brands they engage with. The notion that a brand can remain faceless while thriving in this atmosphere has become obsolete.In a world saturated with information, sifting through the noise to find credible sources is a challenge. This is where top-tier media outlets step in as the gatekeepers of credibility. When a CEO, entrepreneur, or founder is featured in such outlets, their words gain an instant aura of authority. The public perception shifts from seeing them as mere business leaders to recognizing them as trusted voices in the industry.Related: 3 Step Process to Get Exposure and Press Coverage for Your Business


Rise above the competition by showcasing expertiseIn an era of information overload, consumers are on a quest for genuine expertise. They are bombarded with choices and are discerning in their selections. This is where thought leadership shines. When a CEO or founder appears on top-tier media outlets, they're instantly separated from the crowd. Their insights are no longer confined to their website or a blog; they're showcased on platforms that command respect and readership.Imagine a founder of an investment portfolio consultation firm interviewed for a feature on Nasdaq to share his insights on navigating wealth strategies. This isn't merely an article; it's a roadmap rooted in experience, shaping the path ahead. By sharing their wisdom in a respected forum, they assume the role of a guide, steering clients and partners toward success. This differentiation isn't just about being seen — it's about being seen as a cut above the rest.Establish authenticityTrust forms the bedrock of fruitful brand-consumer relationships. CEOs, entrepreneurs, and founders stepping into thought leadership roles construct this foundation with every article, interview, or podcast appearance. The insights they share, the challenges they've overcome, and the successes they've achieved contribute to a narrative of authenticity and relatability.Picture a CEO sharing their journey from startup to industry disruptor in a feature on a publication like Entrepreneur Magazine. This transparency not only showcases their accomplishments but also the hurdles they've faced. By sharing both triumphs and tribulations, they're inviting the audience to connect on a human level. This builds trust — a trust that becomes synonymous with the business they lead


Now imagine a founder who shares their personal journey of triumphs and challenges in building a sustainable fashion brand through a feature in Vogue. This isn't merely a business story — it's a tale of perseverance, vision and values. The founder becomes a living testament to the brand's essence, breathing authenticity into its identity. Clients and partners seeking more than just products are drawn to this narrative, forging a bond that transcends transaction.Related: 5 Considerations When Seeking a Celebrity to Endorse Your BrandA roadmap to trustThe pathway to differentiation through publicity and thought leadership isn't a one-time sprint; it's a continuous voyage. As CEOs, entrepreneurs, and founders amplify their insights and experiences, they cement their positions as industry trailblazers. This journey isn't a quest for celebrity status — it's a quest to become a source of expertise, counsel and trust.In a time when consumers wish to engage with individuals they recognize, believe in, and trust, the potential of personal branding cannot be overstated. It isn't confined to logos or catchphrases—it's a reputation, a legacy, a commitment. As we navigate the complexities of branding, let's acknowledge that embracing publicity and thought leadership isn't just about differentiation—it's about paving the way toward lasting trust, credibility, and success.


The power of publicityThe shift from faceless brands to embodied leadership is here to stay. Clients, partners, and consumers seek services, products, and relationships. They desire a story and a reason to believe.In a world where trust is currency, the power of publicity is immeasurable. Differentiation through publicity isn't just about standing out; it's about standing tall—head and shoulders above the competition.

48,Are the Days of Good Customer Service Over? These 7 Hacks Can Bring it to Life at Your Company,"Mar 7, 2024",Micah Solomon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-revamp-your-customer-service-with-these-7-hacks/470299,"
As a customer service trainer, speaker, and consultant, I am approached by all sorts of people who tell me all sorts of things. Some refrains are, ""Customer service is dead,"" ""Nobody provides customer service like they did back in the day,"" or even, ""Kids these days don't know how to give good customer service.""I don't buy into this negative strain of sentiment. I think what's going on is that customer expectations have grown higher and higher, and customer service levels haven't kept up. But to the extent that today's customers — your potential customers — feel this way about your competitors in the marketplace, there's an extraordinary opportunity for your business to get ahead of the curve and use exceptional customer service as a competitive advantage.Related: 4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win HeartsAs a start, consider this list of pointers.1. Stress a pro-customer purpose to all employeesEmployees need to know that you want them to step away from their functional tasks if a purpose-driven task requires a different use of their time at the moment.



The thing about above and beyond customer service is that it, by definition, requires extra effort. These extra efforts are elective; employees (no matter what their delusional bosses may believe) can contribute or withhold at their discretion. We all know people who keep their work level just above where HR would come in with a performance improvement plan and thus stay under the radar without contributing much at all.You need to get that additional, creative effort out of your employees, and a key factor in doing so is in stressing, from onboarding onward, the importance of a pro-customer purpose that takes you above and beyond your functional, checklist-style duties.2. Empower employees at every level of your organizationIf you get serious about employee empowerment, you'll move a lot further and a lot more quickly toward being an organization where purpose-driven employees contribute their elective efforts. Exceptional customer service requires room for interpretation, with your employees making those interpretations, deciding, and bringing to life what exceptional customer service really looks like in action.And if they lack empowerment — power, really — they'll remain hobbled, no matter how good their intentions.Related: Want a Customer Service Revolution? Start By Changing Your Culture3. Review and revamp your employee selection (hiring) criteria.Restaurateur Danny Meyer has written and spoken eloquently about the mix of skill and attitude criteria that can reveal an ideal new employee together. Personality traits are generally stable and unlikely to change once people reach their 20s, so it's valuable to look for a pro-customer orientation in every potential employee you consider, alongside whatever skills criteria you are also screening for.4. Celebrate your customer service accomplishments companywideI suggest you systematize this celebration along the lines of what has worked for years—decades, actually — for the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. Twice a week, every Ritz-Carlton hotel and resort shares a ""wow story"" of over-and-above hospitality from one of its more than 100 properties. This works wonders in inspiring all the employees who hear these stories to contribute similarly wow-level customer service themselves.5. Adapt to the rapid pace of response that modern customers expectReview and, if necessary, update your response times to meet today's customer expectations: What was ""fast enough"" a couple of years ago is no longer.Related: 4 Keys to Satisfying 21st Century Customers6. Involve everyone in customer experience innovationGreat customer service should constantly be growing and adapting. Get people at all levels and all positions in your organization excited about contributing suggestions for innovation. At the very customer-centric insurance and financial behemoth USAA, employees have been responsible for over 1,000 patented innovations!These come from every corner of the company (one security guard alone is responsible for contributing 28 patented ideas!) Be sure to explain that multiple areas are available for (and need) innovation. While everyone thinks of innovation as product-based, it's only one of the three areas that are ripe for contributions:Product: what you sell or make; in spite of the name, this includes services as well as goods.Process: how you make your product or service and how you sell it.Business model: how your company is conceptualized and organized.7. Embrace the triangular model when considering technology, including AIIn the customer service triangle framework, the human agent occupies one vertex, the customer the next, and AI or other technology the third. These three entities should work interactionally rather than in an either-or manner. A customer who started interacting with your company via AI can switch to a human agent, for instance.


But after that handoff, AI will still be involved behind the scenes for the agent to serve the customer best. And the customer can also be expected to use AI themselves, even while they're speaking to the agent (most likely the world's biggest AI experiment, Google).

49,He Owns and Operates a Dozen Popular Nightlife Venues in New York — Here's How He Kept All of His Businesses Afloat in a Crisis,"Mar 7, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/he-owns-12-nightlife-venues-in-nyc-heres-how-he-stays-open/470684,"
It's a Sunday afternoon in December, and a slew of NFL games are about to hit television screens. But instead of being cozy at home, I'm standing in line with hundreds of others in 13-degree weather to try and get into Rocco's Sports and Rec in Manhattan's Noho neighborhood. The line is around the block, despite the below-freezing temperatures and plenty of bars nearby with available stools.But this is what it's like sometimes trying to get into a Thatcher Shultz establishment.Shultz, a New York-based entrepreneur, owns and operates 12 New York nightlife venues, including Make Believe, a rooftop hotspot known for its signature pink decor and lively outdoor scene, and Virgo, a tasteful new subterranean lounge. He is also opening two new spots before the end of the year, including Music for a While at the Selina Hotel Chelsea, which opens on March 8. Thatcher is a partner at The Garret Group which owns The Garret West, Bandits, and Rocco's Sports & Rec.""I'm really trying to push the boundaries here,"" Shultz tells Entrepreneur. ""There's so many fresh new concepts out there that have opened in the last year. You've got to keep evolving, I have to stay relevant and stay on top of my game.""



Shultz has a penchant for seeking out underutilized or misused spaces and transforming them into an ""experience"" for customers – but somehow his establishments never seem to feel overcrowded or overstimulated. 


    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by The Garret Group (@thegarretgroup) Shockingly, all of his establishments survived the pandemic, and these packed football days at Rocco's are a far cry from 2020, which destroyed the restaurant and nightlife scene in New York.And the aftereffects still linger — although you wouldn't know on this football Sunday. (At least I managed to make it inside to watch my team lose.)Here's how Shultz kept this head — and businesses — above water and set a path toward growth during a rough few years.     View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Thatcher (@thatcher) 


Nightlife has changed — and not just in New YorkAccording to a report by the NYC Hospitality Alliance in December 2023, over 50% of restaurants and bars reported a decrease in revenue in 2023, and 72% cited ""labor costs"" as their main concern for 2024 and the months ahead.""The margins are just brutal right now because of labor issues and people cutting back on spending, people cutting back on drinking. It's more difficult now than it ever has been,"" Shultz said.In January 2024, Eater reported more than 40 restaurant and bar closings in New York City, noting that sales and related operating costs haven't returned to pre-pandemic levels, and rent costs have inflated.Related: He Made Hats for His Friends Using a Logo His Mom Drew on a Napkin in the '80s. Now He Counts Gary Vaynerchuk and Aaron Judge as Customers.


""New York City's restaurants and bars are experiencing an uneven pandemic recovery nearly four years after COVID-19 struck our city,"" Andrew Rigie, Executive Director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance said in a release for the organization. ""While some have recovered, others still struggle.""By the Spring of 2021, it was estimated that nearly 90,000 restaurants (including diners, cafes, taverns, and bars) had shut down nationwide.Shultz says the pandemic changed also consumer behavior when it comes to how they approach nightlife.""People's mindsets have changed in a way where they're almost scared to explore nightlife,"" he said. ""They want to be listed for everything, they want to buy a ticket, they want to RSVP, otherwise, they just don't want to go. It's not the consumer's fault. It's just a byproduct of COVID.""


It's still all about locationOne good thing that came out of the pandemic, Shultz says, is that a lot of deals were made for venues that probably wouldn't have been able to happen without rent prices plummeting.""I signed a few really favorable leases during COVID,"" Shultz says, pointing to his diner and dive bar Bandits as an example of one of these venues, an eclectic cocktail destination located in the West Village.     View this post on Instagram           A post shared by BANDITS | Diner & Dive (@banditsnewyork) ""A lot of cool spaces have opened as a result of COVID,"" he adds. ""With that being said, there's just a lot of competition right now, [but] I welcome competition.""When looking for a new location, Shultz says sometimes he'll seek out the venue but other times, the deal will find him, and he'll start creating something after seeing the space.""I've taken a lot of chances, and most of them have paid off, but some of them haven't,"" he says, noting that he looks for spaces that are unique and smaller in nature.


Find a similar threadAlthough none of his spaces are alike, there are similar aspects to each venue, which makes each location feel like it has Shultz's signature.""I think the smaller the better, the more intimate the better,"" he says of the trademark similarity in all of his spaces.In each of his establishments, Shultz prioritizes high-end lighting, design, and sound regardless of the venue's size. 


    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Virgo (@virgopresents) Take Virgo, for example, a posh downstairs nightclub in Manhattan's Lower East Side, which has a capacity of 300 people. But the space itself is U-shaped with many areas for guests to dance and mingle, meaning that even if the venue is empty, it will never feel cavernous.Money is not the (entire) motiveIf you're entering the nightlife industry just to make money, look elsewhere, he says.


""I never got into this industry for money. It takes years to make money at any venue, it's brutal,"" he said. ""You just have to accept that a lot of venues break even, some of them lose money. But you can't be doing it for the money.""Shultz says he has several side hustles, including owning rental income properties and a vintage car import business, allowing him to take off the pressure of focusing on pure profit from his venues.""I haven't relied on hospitality as a main source of income,"" he says, noting how historically tough the restaurant industry has been to break even.Focus on how you want people to feel when they walk inAt Shultz's new spot, Music for a While, there will be costumes (for customers to wear) and a listening bar experience without the pressure of needing to be a music buff.


""People can really just be super weird and just be whoever they want to be,"" he said about his newest venture, which opens Friday.""I want people to come and have this feeling of escapism, where they can just forget about their difficulties and just have fun, meet someone new, hang out with their friends, have a nice cocktail or an amazing meal,"" he adds. ""And hopefully, it turns their day around and turns their night around.""

52,Want to Scale Up Without Selling Out? Do This First,"Mar 6, 2024",Heather McLeod,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/want-to-scale-up-without-selling-out-do-this-first/470278,"
Ambition is a beautiful thing, but growing a business takes more than the will to succeed. As part of the team that launched Authority Brands in 2017, I knew that our trajectory would be explosive. Aggressively pursuing growth isn't just about the numbers, it's also about taking the time to build foundational elements of the business to support continued growth.Growth should strengthen, not dilute, the spirit of a company. Is your business ready to grow? Make sure you've done these three things first.1. Find true northA strong company vision is a beacon that each individual in the system can look to to guide their work. When everyone on the team knows exactly where the company is headed, they become stakeholders in the growth process.



All too often, the core values of a business are relegated to a slide in onboarding training and rarely heard of again. Instead, they should be woven into the fabric of the organization. The goal is an unshakable company-wide vision.However, it's easier said than done. According to Gallup, only 23% of U.S. employees strongly agree that they can apply their organization's values to their work. No matter the scope of any individual's work, they should clearly understand how their contributions are important to the vision. Every action, from marketing initiatives to operational support, has a part to play, and it's up to leaders to draw connections for their teams.


A vision is most powerful when it's a shared promise and commitment. It is worth the time it takes to articulate to each and every employee how they contribute to overall success.Related: Unlock the Secret to Crafting Compelling Core Values With This Step-by-Step Guide2. Invest in a culture of collaborationA business's culture is where vision is put to the test. A toxic culture can sap the promise out of a compelling vision, while a healthy culture offers a structure for success. A strong culture is especially crucial for growing sustainably.A true commitment to collaborative culture touches every element of the employee experience. Setting clear expectations about culture starts at recruitment and never stops. People should feel just as comfortable communicating pain points as sharing successes or floating exciting ideas.


A diverse range of perspectives arms a company with endless approaches to problem-solving. As a system grows, so does the pool of great minds you have to draw inspiration from. If you empower each team member to contribute their best and focus on cultivating a strong culture of collaboration.Related: The 4 Personalities You Need on Your Marketing Team3. Plan a flexible path for growthConstant growth means constant change, and your systems must account for that. A flexible path for growth is about planning in a way that serves your business's current state while actively shaping its future. Think of the way tall buildings are carefully constructed to flex rather than break in adverse weather.Every level of a growing business needs processes and procedures that can scale and adapt as the work changes. Because process planning and documentation can feel like it's not the ""real"" work, it's easy to overlook, especially when a team is small and focused. That's a grave mistake. Your goal is for that team to grow and grow, so it's never too early to give it a guiding structure. Build teams with an eye toward the future. Map out future improvements and what circumstances would allow you to implement them.


From day one, you must prioritize systems that accommodate the dynamic nature of a rapidly growing business. Our franchise system is an excellent example of the power of process and scaling. Back-of-house infrastructures like IT, HR, legal, and marketing are handled by best-in-class professionals so that franchise owners can keep all their focus on providing best-in-class service. With the corporate office focused on making business efficient and scalable, each brand levels up. Managing this kind of growth requires a holistic viewpoint and a high level of interconnectedness throughout the business.Related: How to Turn a Crisis into an Opportunity by Managing Negative Publicity

53,Many Confident Leaders Resist Change — And These 5 Emotional Wounds Could Be to Blame,"Mar 6, 2024",Kelly L. Campbell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-reasons-why-leaders-resist-change/469901,"
Confidence can be an effective leadership trait, and assertive self-confidence requires getting ahead of limiting beliefs to achieve what we desire or deem successful. But what if a leader's confidence is actually just one of the masks that help them assimilate in groups where power dynamics call for boldness and strength?How could that mask of confidence work against them and hinder the success of an organization when a leader is afraid of change?Five Soul WoundsRejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal and injustice are the five soul wounds often passed down to us by our parents, following us from childhood into adulthood. While first identified by an American physician and psychiatrist, a Canadian therapist wrote about them in her book and brought the research to the masses. The transference of wounds from generation to generation is actively discussed on social media, podcasts, and in other books like Heal to Lead.



Let's break down each of the five primary wounds as they apply to low-conscious or unhealed leadership.1. RejectionLeaders with the wound of rejection might withdraw from situations or discreetly avoid them altogether for fear of being rejected. Their ability to work anchors them in reality, which starkly contrasts the many ways in which they prefer to escape. Their people-pleasing tendencies are a means of self-protection, which can manifest as perfectionism and not asking for help in leadership roles.


Related: Rejection Is Part of Entrepreneurship. Here's How to Handle It.2. AbandonmentLeaders with the wound of abandonment project a type of sadness that is almost indefinable, as their deepest fear is loneliness. To combat the inner strife that causes mood changes, they can seem dependent on others, seeking advice and support to keep themselves in center focus. Compliments are a natural reward for overgiving, and if those are in short supply, leaders with wounds of abandonment may create drama to receive attention differently.3. HumiliationDeep feelings of shame accompany the wound of humiliation. For wounded leaders, this might show up as humility and taking care of others. They keep themselves busy because they fear freedom — associated with the absence of limits and engaging in too much fun, pleasure, or the like. These wounded leaders often tend toward self-deprecation to make others laugh; in this way, they control who humiliates them and to what extent.Related: Bullies At Work: Stamping Out Abuse In The Workplace


4. Betrayal (linked to Abandonment)The wound of betrayal shows up most often in people-controlling leaders because control is the mask they wear to avoid separation and denial. In demonstrating a lack of trust in others, these wounded leaders disempower those around them by setting standards impossibly high to ensure failure. Though unconscious, these authoritarian leaders are out to prove their perceived value by stepping on, manipulating, and mandating that others do things precisely how they would.5. Injustice (pairs with Rejection)Leaders with an injustice wound also tend toward people-pleasing, but the difference is in pretending that nothing impacts them. They refuse help and would rather run themselves into the ground than admit that they're tired or angry. In not wanting to be treated unfairly, they can project that onto others without realizing it. Everything must be justified, even if it means exaggerating or outright lying.Related: Why Trauma Integration Will Give You a Competitive Advantage in LeadershipResistance to changeSo, how do these soul wounds correlate to a strong resistance to change? Wounded leaders often employ unconscious survival strategies to ensure their worst fears don't materialize. In the face of uncertainty of any kind — where their safety could potentially be at risk — low-conscious leaders dig their heels into what will protect their ego, even if the change at hand would benefit their organization.


Change can be stressful and even terrifying for most people, but add the layer of a soul wound, and it can feel like life or death — because that's how the ego perceives it.When leaders are unaware of these unhealed aspects of themselves, those around them can suffer unnecessarily when on the receiving end of unhealed projections, from an organizational perspective, that can lead to higher employee attrition, a negative impact on morale and overall culture, and a plateau in revenue and innovation.When they feel resistance to change arises, the best thing leaders can do is to take radical responsibility for their own trauma integration. They can start with small steps that develop self-awareness, like listening to podcast episodes or reading books on the topic, or perhaps talking with a trauma-informed therapist or coach.If they won't do it for themselves (at first), they can think about how many others will benefit from their inner work. From family members to business partners, employees, clients, and community members — when leaders do the work, they become more adaptable to change. As a result of their improved abilities to self-regulate, embrace curiosity, and make decisions for the good of the whole, their organizations grow more flexible to meet uncertainty with ease.

54,These 5 Economic Trends Will Drive Consumer Spending in 2024,"Mar 6, 2024",Daniel Altman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/these-5-economic-trends-will-drive-consumer-spending-in-2024/469732,"
Spring is just around the corner, promising a thaw not just in the weather but also in household spending. Consumers will be leaving their homes again to enjoy baseball games, soccer matches and other outdoor events, as well as conventions and corporate meetings. In the past few years, consumers were able to fund their exploits by drawing on trillions of dollars in savings that built up during the Covid-19 pandemic. But what about this year?1. The spending bonanza is about to run its courseAccording to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, households saved about $2.1 trillion more than usual during the pandemic. Because people were confined mainly to their homes, they simply didn't spend as much money. When the economy started to open up in 2021 and 2022, consumers started spending this money with a vengeance — in some cases literally.Now, however, only a fraction of this money is left. The same economists have written that only about $200 million in extra savings remained at the end of last year, and they expect it to disappear in the first half of 2024.



This means consumers may have one more big spring season left in them for travel, leisure and entertainment, as well as all the other goods and services that are typically in demand, from hot dogs to wedding rings. After this spring, however, consumers are unlikely to feel as flush.Related: Where Will the Economy Go Next? What to Watch For in 2024


2. The balance of spending is still shifting back toward servicesFor decades, consumers have been shifting their spending away from goods and toward services. Prices for goods have come down in relative terms, travel has become more popular, housing has become more expensive and the arrivals of the internet, mobile phones and fiber-optic connections have greatly expanded the services available to consumers.But this long-term trend stunningly reversed during the pandemic. In February 2020, consumers spent about 31% of their dollars on goods. By March 2021, this share had risen to 35%, the highest share since 2006. And now, with prices for goods basically flat, half of the change has disappeared. Over the next few years, it's likely that the long-term trend will resume.3. Consumers will pull back on big purchasesWhen consumers could draw on big pools of savings, it was easier for them to buy expensive goods and services ranging from new smartphones to Taylor Swift tickets. Without this extra liquidity, the big-ticket items will not be as accessible. Consumers will be more likely to smooth out their spending via smaller purchases.The change will be especially notable for items that are harder to finance, like cars where dealers insist on downpayments in cash. With time, interest rates on credit cards, car loans and the like will come down in parallel with the Fed's cuts. Yet this process is likely to take many months, and consumers may postpone big purchases in anticipation.


4. There won't be a big boost to spending when the Federal Reserve cuts ratesFor months, executives and investors have been waiting for the Fed to cut short-term interest rates — and many have assumed that there will be six or seven quarter-point cuts this year. But Fed officials have maintained their intention to cut three times, and recent data on inflation could make them even more cautious.Stock prices aren't likely to rise much higher when cuts begin, so there won't be a lot of newfound wealth to propel spending. Wall Street bonuses, which can drive markets for luxury goods and services, were also disappointing this year. If anything, uncertainty about the elections in November is likely to keep the markets — and investors' exuberance — on hold.Related: Interest Rates Are Going to Drop This Year. Here Are 6 Ways Businesses Can Take Advantage When the Time Comes.5. Caution in the labor market could also be a drag on spendingWith the unemployment rate still below 4% and a high level of economic uncertainty, companies have become reluctant to make all but the most essential hires. Raises are also likely to be small alongside slowing inflation. This could restrain income growth, which will in turn affect spending.


Businesses that do need labor — like the stadiums that will fill in the spring — are relying increasingly on temporary workers. And even companies that might have been looking for permanent employees are turning instead to flexible workers on long-term assignments. They're easier to find and hire, and they don't require the same level of commitment. To the extent that full-time jobs are replaced by these fractional jobs as a result of economic uncertainty, consumers' spending may be lower.In the short term, we may see one more bonanza for consumer-facing businesses, especially in the service sector — and we expect them to hire proportionally. In the second half of the year, the picture becomes cloudier. But unlike the forces unleashed by the pandemic, none of the other trends is entirely unprecedented. So the best course of action for business leaders is to consider how trends like these have affected revenue in the past, and then project what they might do to revenue in the future.

55,Why Successful People Never Second-Guess Themselves — and 5 Strategies to Help You Get Rid of Indecision,"Feb 28, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-successful-people-never-second-guess-themselves-and/469042,"
Indecision is a problem for many of us. Some of us spend far too long deliberating our decisions, even ones that aren't that significant. Usually, it stems from fear. Sometimes, we become so paralyzed by fear of making the wrong decision that we don't make any decision at all.Most of us can remember a time when we stood still for too long. Time runs out, doors close on us and opportunities pass us by. However, not all of us struggle with indecision. Our history is rich with examples of business, political and military leaders who made incredibly complex decisions of extreme importance — and did it while under immense pressure. How were they able to do it? Often, it's because they believe in following these five principles.More from the author: 6 H.A.B.I.T.S. of Powerful People

56,A Skin Cancer Scare Led Lois Robbins on an Entrepreneurial Journey. Here Are Her 3 Best Success Tips.,"Feb 26, 2024",Robert Tuchman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/a-skin-cancer-scare-led-lois-robbins-to-entrepreneurship/470192,"
Last week on How Success Happens, I spoke with accomplished actor, producer and entrepreneur Lois Robbins to discuss her UPF 50+ protective clothing brand, Watskin. The company has grown exponentially since its launch last year, and I wanted to sit down with Robbins to find out how it all happened.You can listen to our entire conversation above, and I've pulled out three keytakeaways.Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.



1. Necessity is the mother of invention""I never thought of myself as an entrepreneur, but they say necessity is the mother of invention,"" Robbins says. ""About five or six years ago, I had a squamous cell on my face, and my dermatologist told me I had to have Mohs surgery, so you can imagine as an actor how terrifying that was. He told me, 'You must stay out of the sun.' I spend a lot of time outdoors. I love exercising outside, being on the water and hiking. One night, I bolted up in bed and thought, I'm gonna make myself a catsuit with a matching skirt. I went downtown, found this great fabric store and bought about six different patterns that I thought were fun. I called a friend of mine who was a tailor and asked her to make me a catsuit. She made me five or six outfits, and I started wearing them everywhere. I was stopped on the street countless times and told [by people] that they'd never seen anything like this and that I had to make these pieces for others. The rest was history. When you have a real need for something, a business is born.""Timestamp — 11:15Related: This Fashion Founder's Company Will Take Back Any Piece of Clothing at Any Time for Any Reason. Here's Why.2. Use passion and persistence as your guide""Two summers ago, we had an unbelievable launch party where we sold a ton of our first collection out east. Then, there was a period of slowness — it was the end of summer when we launched,"" Robbins says. ""I thought back then, this was maybe not the most timely thing to do. But that's where the persistence comes in, and that's where the belief in myself and what I had created had to take hold. It was a nail-biter, but we've been moving forward ever since with even greater success than I even imagined. I don't want to jinx myself, but I think that those days of worry are over. We've learned so much about what works, what doesn't work, what our customer wants and what they don't want. We've created new styles for four collections now, and the brand keeps growing. I have the Shopify app on my phone. The sale buzzer goes off many times a day, but I get excited each time. As an actress, I've always had to be persistent and creative in my approach; it's really helped me with the business. I just keep coming up with more ideas, and we just keep moving forward, and that's how we've grown.""Timestamp — 26:05Related: Kim Kardashian's Skims Is Making Underwear for Men — But the $4 Billion Brand Could Soon Announce Even Bigger News


3. Never accept ""no""""When thinking about all that came into the creation of Watskin, what stands out is how I told myself, I'm gonna do this, and I just didn't accept the nos,"" Robbins says. ""I'm somebody who will forge straight ahead and say yes to life, and this has been a key to my success.

57,"With This LinkedIn Algorithm Change, Your Best Posts Could Reach New Readers for Months","Feb 26, 2024",Jason Feifer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/with-this-linkedin-algorithm-change-your-best-posts-could/470219,"
Your best LinkedIn posts could soon get a lot more reach.That's because LinkedIn is developing a new way for posts to show up on other people's feeds. It's called a ""suggested post"" — an ambitious, new way of distributing content, where your best posts will be shown to targeted users for months or even years.""Right now, content lives and dies on the newsfeed very quickly,"" says Tim Jurka, a senior director of engineering at LinkedIn. ""We're trying to collect the sum total of professional knowledge on our platform, and make sure it surfaces whenever you need it.""



It's the latest in a series of changes for LinkedIn, as the platform actively seeks to reward what it calls ""knowledge and advice"" instead of virality. In June 2023, I reported on LinkedIn's initial algorithm shifts — recognizing when posts are based on the writer's core expertise, amplifying posts that drive meaningful conversations in the comments, and more.So what's next? In a recent conversation with Jurka and his colleague, LinkedIn editor in chief Dan Roth, we discussed many subjects relevant for anyone looking to boost their LinkedIn engagement:


The development of suggested postsOther new tools to help LinkedIn users growThe impact of the algorithm changes, and some users' complaints that their reach has gone downLinkedIn's move away from the term ""creator""Why LinkedIn says you shouldn't trust reports about how to optimize your postsYou can hear our full conversation on my Entrepreneur podcast, Problem Solvers, or read more below.How the new 'suggested posts' workSocial media feeds generally optimize for timeliness, showing you the most recent posts from your connections or new posts you're likely to enjoy. But timeliness can be a problem, Jurka says, because not everyone needs the same information at the same time.LinkedIn isn't doing away with timeliness, but it wants to be a more active content matchmaker — recognizing what individual users are interested in, and then surfacing relevant posts regardless of when they were created. ""We really try to match content to them when a certain insight would be super valuable to them in that moment,"" Jurka says.


Here's what that would look like.Let's say you went to LinkedIn and posted a detailed lesson about beverage marketing. Typically, that post would disappear from people's feeds within a few days or more.Now LinkedIn is thinking differently. It might identify your post as uniquely useful — and whenever other users show an interest in beverage marketing, it might display your post in their feed as a special ""suggested post."" This means your content could actively live on for months or even years, reaching a hyper-targeted audience.If this works, Jurka acknowledges, it creates an incentive for users to post more useful content. The feature is being tested right now, and you may see a version of it on your feed. Jurka says he spends about 75% of his time on suggested posts right now, and that the project is in ""very early days.""


New tools to help user growthLinkedIn is rolling out a series of new tools on the platform, with the aim of helping users connect more effectively. These include:Custom button. Premium members can now create a ""custom button"" — a small hyperlink that appears in their profile and above all their posts. Right now, the button can only say a small number of phrases such as ""Visit my website"" and ""Book an appointment."" Roth says more phrases are coming, including something along the lines of ""Subscribe to my newsletter.""The verified badge. Users can now verify their identity on LinkedIn through a variety of methods. Once verified, users get a small badge on their profile. Jurka called it a ""trust-builder"" that helps you connect with others — but no, your posts don't get more visibility if you're verified.Thought leadership ads. Companies can now spend money to boost someone else's post — for example, a post by someone praising its product. This is only available to organizations with a company page.


Newsletters. LinkedIn has been developing a newsletter product for years, and says it now has 550 million professionals who have subscribed to 156,000 newsletters. The product still lacks a lot of the data and features found on newsletter platforms like ConvertKit and Substack, but Roth says that LinkedIn plans to expand the product and compete directly against other platforms in the space.Creator mode. For a while now, LinkedIn users have been able to turn on a setting called creator mode. It activates audience-building tools such as LinkedIn Live, audio events, and deeper post analytics. In the coming months, the company tells me, it will open those tools up to everyone, regardless of whether they turned on creator mode or not — and it will also be ""investing in the tools we've heard in feedback that work best for sharing and building an audience."" (This wasn't discussed on the podcast, but the company told me about it after.)Has the algorithm hurt reach?Since the algorithm changes began rolling out last year, many LinkedIn creators say their posts reach fewer people. One report, based on an evaluation of 1 million posts, said that reach dropped by 66% in October 2023, compared to October 2022.Is it true? It certainly seems that way. I post on LinkedIn daily, and feel that it's harder to gain impressions and new followers. When I polled my followers on LinkedIn about this recently, they largely felt the same:


Dan Roth, LinkedIn's editor in chief, says he didn't want to be ""dismissive"" of these concerns — but he doesn't share them.""Tim [Jurka] and I have been working on this together for, what is it, a decade now?"" Roth says. ""I can't think of a time when someone didn't say it was getting harder to get reach on LinkedIn.""Instead, Roth said, LinkedIn takes a very different view on the value of ""reach."" The company's goal is to ""connect the world's professionals to economic opportunity,"" but in their eyes, that doesn't usually mean reaching the largest number of other professionals. Instead, they want to help users connect to the few people in their industry who can make a meaningful difference.


By way of example, he told a story of a nurse who recently started posting on LinkedIn — which caught the attention of their employer, who recruited that person for a larger role. ""That was economic success for this person,"" Roth says. ""The only people that he needed to reach with this post were people who worked in this hospital.""Yes, he acknowledged, some content creators on LinkedIn (myself included) aim to reach large audiences. But that's a ""small subset"" of users. LinkedIn's priority, he says, is building products that help the majority of its users — and those people benefit from targeted reach, not mass reach, he says.Why LinkedIn is moving away from the term 'creator'LinkedIn spent the past few years courting ""creators"" — and actively using that term. It hosted programs to help creators, and Roth even wrote a newsletter called Creator Weekly.But the word ""creator"" has been disappearing from the platform. Roth even shut down his newsletter and replaced it with one called The Insider.Why? It's simple, Roth says: ""Our members told us that it was not something they identified with.""""This is on me,"" he continues. ""I had a team focused on using the word creator. We were approaching people and the feedback we kept getting was, 'I'm a lawyer. Why do you keep using this word creator?' It put them off.""That's not to say LinkedIn is abandoning people who identify as ""creators,"" Roth says. But those people are only a subset of the company's much larger user base.Don't take optimization hacks seriously, LinkedIn saysIf you're interested in growing your reach on LinkedIn, you've probably seen people posting reports about how to hack the platform's algorithm.


These reports usually analyze large swaths of LinkedIn posts, and then draw granular conclusions — about the optimal time of day to post, optimal length of a post, how to include hyperlinks without dampening reach, and more.Roth doesn't mince words: ""That understanding is often incorrect.""The problem is twofold, he says. First, LinkedIn is constantly adjusting its algorithms, so signals from yesterday might not reflect the product today. But the larger issue is this: ""It's a lot of causality, but not really understanding how things work.""He offers an example. Years ago, experts claimed that LinkedIn loved a certain style of longform writing. As a result, lots of people started writing in that long style.


But was LinkedIn actually rewarding posts in that style? No, Roth says.""There was a button that said 'read more,' and when people clicked it, we were like, Well, this is a sign that people are getting knowledge out of this,"" Roth says. But as LinkedIn would learn, that wasn't true: The ""read more"" button just signaled that readers were curious about what came next — which didn't necessarily mean that the post itself was valuable to them. ""As soon as we realized what people were doing, and that we had incorrectly attributed the 'read more' button as a signal that people were getting some value out of [a post], we just stopped using that as a signal.""Of course, the authors of these reports might beg to differ — arguing that their reports are a well-sourced snapshot of trends on the platform. But for people who want to optimize their posts, Roth offers this advice: Don't chase trends. ""If you can just share knowledge into the world, I guarantee you things are going to work out,"" he says. ""They won't always work out for every single post, but over the length of your posting, it is going to work out for you.""

58,"As a Black Woman CEO, I Built a Remote Company Not Just to Save Money — But to Mirror My Commitment to Diversity. Here's How.","Feb 23, 2024",Catherine Mandungu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/as-a-black-woman-ceo-i-built-a-remote-company-not-just-to/469043,"
In the tech industry, global diversity is more than a buzzword phrase — it is the engine of innovation and leadership. Launching my startup was a new beginning. It was fueled by my journey as a Black woman entrepreneur. I chose to be a remote operation not just to save money. It was also to craft a work culture that showcases my core values and the complexity of our global community. This decision was less about following trends and more about purposefully nurturing a diverse and connected environment.Diverse teams have an advantage in decision-making, task execution and innovation. This advantage is becoming increasingly logical. Diverse teams outperform groups that are not diverse. Robust data supports this. The benefits of diversity go beyond theory. They boost a team's innovation and finances. In 2023, about 16% of companies had gone fully remote and about 28% had gone hybrid. The importance of remote work and diversity is clearer than ever. These trends show that remote work is possible. They also highlight the key role of diversity in modern business success.Related: How to Build Team Culture in a Remote-Work World



Building a diverse and global teamOur strategy for building a diverse team is rooted in a deep dedication to diversity. It is a guiding principle and a daily practice. We've created a thorough remote onboarding process. It helps new team members join our culture and rhythms. The system has virtual meet-and-greets, in-depth project orientations and ongoing mentorship. It has been pivotal in building a unified team spirit. This spirit is undeterred by the lack of physical closeness.We tackle the challenges of distance. We do this by doing regular virtual team-building exercises. They are designed to build community and improve team dynamics. Twice-a-year in-person meetings at key locations have strengthened our team, as well.


Our global team is from the United Kingdom, France, Bulgaria, the Philippines and India. It brings together a rich mix of perspectives. These enrich our work and foster an environment ripe for innovation. It's a diversity of thought and culture. It doesn't just encourage creative problem-solving — it also bonds us as a team. It shows that distance is no barrier to building a strong, cohesive unit.Harnessing geographical diversityThe diversity of our team is among our most significant assets. We show commitment to being sensitive and inclusive. This is seen in our communication practices and in our scheduling and observance of local traditions. This respect for each team member's heritage enhances our output and experience. It embodies the essence of a globally connected team.We use our geographical diversity to be available to clients around the clock. We offer solutions based on a deep understanding of their unique needs and challenges. Using time zone differences well guarantees our responsiveness. It also brings rich ideas and views to our projects. This sparks innovation and a global approach to problem-solving.Diversity comes in many forms. It ranges from location to culture and language. It helps us handle challenges with many strategies. This boosts our problem-solving abilities a lot. Our ability to view issues from many angles has been key, helping us to secure pivotal clients. It lets us showcase the real benefits and value of our diverse views. This not only reaffirms the importance of cultural diversity, but also highlights it as an important driver of superior business performance.


Related: How Cultural Understanding and Adaptation Drives Business SuccessFostering innovation with global insightsCreating a diverse remote team has been a game-changer. It sparked unmatched innovation and a deep understanding of global markets. The array of perspectives in our team empowers us. It lets us address challenges with new solutions and creative thinking, improving our problem-solving abilities. Our global footprint provides insights into varied market dynamics. It includes consumer behaviors and business practices. This allows us to craft cutting-edge solutions with global relevance.Empowering transparency and developmentAt the heart of any thriving team is effective project management. By adopting online tools, we achieve transparency in every task and project, ensuring all team members are informed of their roles and responsibilities. This method promotes a culture of accountability and cooperation. Alongside this, we prioritize the continuous professional growth of our team. We provide access to online courses, webinars and virtual workshops. Tailored to our team's expertise. They equip our team to lead in industry innovations and practices. We focus on clarity in operations and on nurturing our team's development. This focus boosts our efficiency and drives our ongoing innovation and progress.Personal growthBuilding a remote team has been transformative. It has offered me substantial personal growth and the freedom to immerse myself in different cultures in Asia and Europe. Enriching my personal life on a day-to-day basis. It has also broadened my leadership in a multicultural setting. Learning from different cultures and business practices has been eye-opening; it's shown me the key role of diversity in success.


This change reflects a wider trend among remote workers. In particular, millennials show more engagement in workplaces that champion inclusivity. They highly value cognitive diversity and see the importance of solving business challenges through teamwork. For this generation, inclusion goes beyond representation. It's about fostering an environment where every voice is heard. All perspectives contribute to better business solutions.Related: Diverse Workplaces Generate 19% More Revenue Than Less Diverse CompetitorsConclusionBuilding a diverse remote team is a journey. It requires continual learning and flexibility. This initiative has many benefits. It will spur innovation, promote inclusivity and expand our global outlook. These benefits are immense. They far outweigh any obstacles we encounter. This approach drives groups to better achievements and creates a more inclusive and interconnected global work environment by embracing diversity in all its forms. This paves the way for a richer and more collaborative future in business and beyond.

59,How to Transform Your Car Into an Alternative Workspace,"Feb 23, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-transform-your-car-into-a-productive-office-space/468759,"
Now that my children are getting older, I find myself meeting their needs less at home and more outside the home — more specifically, instead of braiding their hair, helping them with their homework or making them a snack, they're now looking to me to drive them to their activities and chauffeur them and their friends around town. As much as I love being a full-time mom, this has created a bit of a conundrum for me as a full-time business owner: How can I remain as involved in my kids' lives as I've always been while still getting in my required daily allotment of work?Enter the newest trend in American professional culture: mobile work time. And by ""mobile,"" I mean literally taking some work on the road with me in my automobile.Granted, using your car as an alternate workspace isn't conducive to certain duties and functions. When you need to hunker down and attend to serious tasks that require serious attention, there's no replacement for the permanent office space where you keep all the many tools of your trade. But as for a lot of the ""filler tasks"" that fill your days? You might be surprised at just how many you can accomplish from your car!



Related: Working Remote? These Are the Biggest Dos and Don'ts of Video ConferencingThe rules of the roadTo be clear, I'm not talking here about conversion to digital nomad life, the kind of roaming remote occupations made possible by vehicles like Nissan's e-NV200 WORKSPACe, launched in 2016.


Nor will I cover the spate of new products designed to keep us working efficiently wherever we are. There are numerous sources you can access that will point you to all the mobile equipment and technology you could ever need.Rather, for those of us who are still mostly office-bound, I'm just talking about squeezing more juice out of the fruits of our labors by taking advantage of the benefits of working on the go, including:It makes productive use of what would otherwise be dead time.It expands the boundaries of when, where and how you can be more efficient and time-effective.It gives you a break from the office, a change of scenery, without necessarily having to break from work.It provides time limits on tasks you want to limit (like phone calls you want to keep brief).Adobe agrees that certain tasks lend themselves particularly well to working out of your car: marketing and social media management, virtual assistance, writing and content creation, and sales and business development. No wonder I'm such a fan — as the CEO of my PR firm, that's what I do most of the time.Examples of prime opportunities to work out of your carHere are some recent instances when I was able to convert in-vehicle time to high-performance spans of work output.


Waiting in the cell phone lot at the airport. Over the holidays, I went to pick up family flying in. When their delay turned from 20 minutes to 40 to an hour, I happily found time to check and return all the phone messages that were awaiting me.Parked in the lot of an athletic field. One of my kids has an hour-long soccer practice two days a week. It hardly makes sense for me to drop her off and turn right around to pick her up, so I now stay parked beside the field, where I can not only keep an eye on her but also get a solid hour of uninterrupted work done. I now dedicate this ""wait time"" to going through my email box and paring it down. (I do the same thing when the kids want to hang out in the mall for a while.) It's made a significant difference in my inbox management.Breaking at highway rest stops. When you have to take longish drives, the breaks advised to stretch your legs and rest your back are an opportune time to multitask. Walking in circles around the lot, getting some steps in, I dictated half a dozen voice memos to myself on things to follow up on when I got back to the office, then several more to my staff, which I texted to them on the spot for timely implementation.Intentional turnoffs between client visits. On my last trip to Nashville to visit a handful of clients in person, I used the rental car as my ""think tank."" While driving to my different appointments, I turned off the radio, looked straight ahead and let my mind do its creative thing: PR campaign ideas, pitch themes, content creation. By the time I purposely pulled over before reaching my next meeting, I had several good brainstorming thoughts to jot down about my last meeting.Stealing away in the driveway or garage. Over winter break, the house just got too loud with all the kids home from school. I wanted to make a good first impression on a potential new client, so I grabbed my laptop, headed out to the garage and attached the portable organizer I store in my car for just such purposes to the back of my front seat. I conducted the call in peace, totally calm, without distractions, and landed the client. Granted, it was winter in upstate New York, so I warmed up the garage first with our space heater!Related: 21 Productive Things to Do on Your CommuteThe end of the roadLastly, a few tips I've learned from experience:For safety, I suggest backing into parking spaces so you can keep a better eye on your surroundings.Move to the passenger seat or back seat for room and comfort.Email yourself documents ahead of time that you know you'll need quick access to.Pre-plan to have a reliable hot spot where you're going to ""park it"" as well.Consider carrying along a collapsible file folder in your car to keep notes and paperwork organized per client when you're away from your desktop file system.You should never, ever attempt work duties that will distract you from driving when you're actually behind the wheel, motoring from point A to point B. Safety is obviously the paramount concern. But when you're not in transit, it's worth exploring how much you can get done on the road!

60,How Learning to Take Care of Myself Helps Me Take Care of My Business,"Feb 23, 2024",Nellie Akalp,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-learning-to-take-care-of-myself-helps-me-take-care-of/468820,"
In the constant bustle of entrepreneurial life, the idea of self-care too often takes a back seat. That happened to me. However, I realized that self-care was crucial for my personal well-being and the success of my business.I've now learned to embrace self-care because it calms, refreshes and energizes me, ultimately making me more focused and productive. Here are some tips that helped me.Related: Self-Care Isn't Selfish — It's Essential for Sustaining High Performance. Here's How to Avoid Burning Out.



The consequences of self-neglectNeglecting self-care can lead to burnout, a common issue among entrepreneurs. Many business owners don't like to admit having felt burnt out — but I will.Our business was steadily growing when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. As it continued, my typically upbeat attitude began to erode. I felt so isolated being confined to home. I got sad when Covid-19 prevented my kids from having their regular high school graduation.


Many people experienced something similar. But entrepreneurs are used to being in control, and Covid-19 took that away from us. The impact was profound. Losing control made me feel even worse, and I started feeling burnt out and experiencing daily severe highs and lows.Burnout can impact entrepreneurs even without a once-in-a-lifetime trigger like a global pandemic. The key is recognizing when you're burning out before your flame extinguishes. Do you know the signs? According to the Young Leaders Of The Americas Initiative (YLAI), here's what to look for:Lack of creativityFatigueReduced productivityAnxietyDifficulty concentratingHeadachesChange in appetite or weightNegative attitudes toward employees or familyDifficulty sleepingAre you stressed or anxious?You cannot solve the problem unless you uncover the root cause. As our business started to suffer, it was crucial to stop the spiral. Like most of America, we were working from home. I finally realized that although my husband and I had run two successful companies together since college, we could not work in the same room.I was beyond stressed — I felt anxious. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), it's essential to know the difference between stress and anxiety.


Stress is ""generally a response to an external cause, and goes away once the situation is resolved."" Anxiety is a ""persistent feeling of apprehension or dread that doesn't go away and interferes with how you live your life.""The symptoms of stress and anxiety mimic those of burnout. If you identify with the above signs, act now by taking back control of your life.Related: 8 Self-Care Tips From Wildly Successful EntrepreneursTaking control with self-careI realized I had to stop ceding my power and seize control of what I could. First, my husband and I started working in separate rooms in the house. That helped alleviate one source of my anxiety, but I turned to self-care to eliminate the rest.


Self-care is vital for all business owners, but especially for women who often juggle professional and personal responsibilities. Too often, we think of self-care as ignoring others. But self-care is not self-indulgence. Once you accept that it's about making a strategic investment in your success, you can start on the road to recovery.I needed a plan and sprang into action. Food had become one of my coping mechanisms, so I created a daily exercise plan and committed myself to healthy living. I also needed to restore my balance and found meditation was the answer. I now meditate twice a day for about 30 minutes.There are many misconceptions about meditation. Let me try to dispel them:You can meditate whenever you have time. Even three minutes will work.Sitting like a pretzel is not required. Just find a comfortable position.You don't need a mantra or a goal. Just let your mind go.You can use guided meditation or do it on your own.Meditating worked to eliminate my anxiety, sharpen my focus, and boost my productivity. Meditation is so effective at stress reduction that we incorporated it into our workplace and added 10-minute meditation sessions to our team-building activities. This helps enhance collective focus and morale and fosters a culture of wellness.


There are other options for exploring self-care:Rediscover the joy of playfulness: Return to a forgotten hobby, buy an adult coloring book, tackle a jigsaw puzzle or play with Legos. Reconnect with the simple pleasures that ignite your spirit.The sounds of silence: This is particularly hard for entrepreneurs, but set aside time to unplug and disconnect from social media and technology. Savor the peace and clarity that silence can bring.Challenge your comfort zone: Learn a new skill or language. Take dancing or cooking classes. Embracing the discomfort of learning something new can restore your confidence and expand your capabilities.


Practice random acts of kindness: Volunteer at a local charity. Get your staff involved. Become a SCORE mentor. Anonymously pay for someone's coffee. Helping others can get you out of your head.Related: Worried That You Don't Have Time for Self-Care? Here's How to Fit It Into Any ScheduleYou may also need to revisit your stressors. Are you overworked? Feeling isolated? Try:Surrounding yourself with mentors, peers and friends who understand the entrepreneurial journey can offer perspective and alleviate your isolation.Setting realistic goals for your business and personal life. Break larger goals into manageable steps.Learning to say ""no"" is one of the hardest things for entrepreneurs to do. But turning down business when you're overwhelmed allows you to better serve existing customers.Delegating gives you time to tackle crucial work tasks and invest in self-care.While there's lots of advice for self-care all over the internet, remember you're an entrepreneur and should redefine it to fit your needs. Self-care is not a one-time activity, but an ongoing journey of exploration and discovery.

61,Beware the Temptation of Dishonesty — How One Lie Could Sink Your Business,"Feb 22, 2024",Zamir Shukho,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-one-lie-could-destroy-your-business/469466,"
Many promising entrepreneurs and business owners seek investment, making it tough to convince someone to invest in their idea/startup. As a result, some individuals tend to exaggerate the quality of their ideas or products. If the venture succeeds and generates substantial profits, investors are usually satisfied. However, dissatisfaction may arise if things don't go as planned — and they do a lot of times!Fundraising is a long process that may take months before making any decision. Why months? Because every responsible fund conducts due diligence, delving deep into the startup and analyzing every aspect of it takes time. Some funds also attract external experts – we use this practice in Vibranium.VC.Related: The Importance Of Honesty And Integrity In Business



Why dishonesty is so temptingThe deceptive temptation to take shortcuts is often based on a desire to present the startup in the best light possible, attracting investors and customers with an idealized version of reality. However, this slippery slope can lead to potential pitfalls, where one small untruth snowballs into a catastrophic downfall for a startup.Back in fall 2023, we were considering one startup for potential investment, conducted analysis, and held interviews — standard procedures for every potential investment we make. The company was making about $2M in annual revenues, growing and positive. But we felt that there was something off; every time we asked for DEMO access to the platform, the founder would throw a fit, not wanting to cooperate. Even though, during our calls, the founder would operate a demonstration showing how the platform creates value for its customers.


So, we decided to conduct additional technical due diligence with two different expert teams. It turned out that we were shown an excellent Figma design all this time without an actual platform behind it. This project was a classic ""fake it till you make it,"" and it was a deal breaker for us. We can understand that sometimes MVP is still in the process of making, but a deliberate lie that the revenues generated in the company come from nonexisting platforms was a no-go for us.Entrepreneurs may underestimate the consequences of dishonesty, believing that the ends justify the means. Yet, the truth has a way of revealing itself, and when it does, the repercussions can be severe, from ruined reputations to legal consequences. Giving in to the temptation to be deceptive can seriously harm the foundation of a startup.Related: Stop Lying to Your Team — And Yourself. Try Radical Honesty Instead.Turn the truth into your strategic assetStatistics indicate that, on average, the partnership between an investor and a startup lasts longer in the USA than a marriage – more people divorce faster than investors and startups part ways, achieving exit.


Based on my experience, honesty emerges as a powerful strategic asset for entrepreneurs. Successful businesses have thrived on transparency and building trust with customers, investors, and employees. Honesty is not just a moral imperative but a smart business move fostering long-term relationships.Several examples in the business world showcase the impact of truth as a strategic asset. Even when the news is not entirely positive, companies that openly communicate their challenges and successes often gain respect and loyalty from their stakeholders. By being forthright about shortcomings or setbacks, entrepreneurs can build a foundation of trust that withstands the test of time.When an investor has to decide in complex startup situations, for example, to support the startup or not for the second or third time, if there is no trust, the investor is likely not to support the startup because they will already feel deceived. Therefore, it is very important to embed these relationships from the very beginning on the principles of transparency, openness, and honesty. These basic things are important because they form the foundation for future years of relationships and communication between the investor and the startup. There have been cases where some of our startups needed bridge rounds, and we were ready to support them because they were honest about their situations and what they needed.Related: 3 Ways to Build a Culture of Radical Honesty (and How It Can Transform Your Business)


Navigating the gray areasIn the complex entrepreneurship landscape, ethical dilemmas often arise in grey areas. A gray area is an area or situation in which it is difficult to judge what is right and wrong. Entrepreneurs face tough decisions that test their commitment to honesty. Real-world scenarios illustrate the importance of choosing the path of transparency, showcasing positive outcomes resulting from these decisions.Navigating the grey areas requires a commitment to ethical decision-making. Entrepreneurs must weigh short-term gains against long-term consequences, recognizing that honesty, even when uncomfortable, ultimately builds a more robust and resilient business foundation.Related: Science Has Confirmed That Honesty Really Is the Best Policy in the WorkplaceCulture of honestyBeing honest in the world of entrepreneurship can be challenging, especially when money is involved – that might be a real test for a startup. Just like when we build relationships with our life partner or spouse, if these relationships start with lies, even if they're seemingly innocent lies, they can start to erode and create cracks in the future.


Entrepreneurs can actively cultivate a culture of honesty within their startups. Open communication, trust-building, and accountability are crucial in fostering a workplace environment where honesty thrives. Successful companies prioritizing honesty as a core value often experience heightened employee loyalty and increased customer satisfaction.By setting the tone from the top down, entrepreneurs can create a culture where team members feel empowered to be transparent about challenges and uncertainties. This culture promotes ethical behavior and enhances collaboration and innovation within the startup.In the competitive entrepreneurship landscape, the stakes are high, and the journey to success is filled with challenges. The deceptive temptation may seem like a shortcut, but it will lead to a dead-end sooner or later, trust me. Embracing honesty, not just as a moral code but as a strategic advantage, can be the key differentiator between thriving and falling.

""No matter what's been going on, no matter what the mind's been stressed with right now, no matter how the body feels, just for a moment, [let] go of all that. Just [focus] on the space around you,"" a pleasant voice with a British accent instructed. I was listening to a guided meditation about relieving stress. Even if I don't always stick to a daily meditation routine, the occasional session can do wonders during stressful times.Afterward, I started thinking about the voice on the other side of that app — Andy Puddicombe, a former Buddhist monk who co-founded a company valued at an estimated $3 billion (as of August 2021, after merging with Ginger Health). It made me wonder if any of the habits that Puddicombe picked up in the monastery have served him as an entrepreneur. The more I learned about monastic practices, the more inspired I was to apply them (or modified versions of them) in my role as CEO of Jotform. And I'm not alone — just check out the monk mode challenge on TikTok.Here are some of the monastery mantras that I've found most helpful as an entrepreneur, in terms of boosting creativity and productivity.

63,5 Ways to Network Your Way to Business Growth and Wealth,"Feb 21, 2024",James Malinchak,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-ways-to-network-your-way-to-business-growth-and-wealth/467864,"
Why is networking important for creating business success and wealth? The answer is simple. It's not a coincidence that hundreds, even thousands, of people are hired for positions over individuals who are more qualified and more experienced merely because they have cultivated relationships with key centers of influence. It's not a coincidence when one politician is elected into office over another because he has cultivated relationships with more individual voters than the opposition.Through networking, you will receive opportunities that will expand your current knowledge base, business and wealth creation. Through networking, you will be put in positions to expand your current skills and learn to communicate at many levels. Networking is communicating with others to create mutually beneficial relationships.People often confuse networking with ""quantity of contracts."" However, the purpose of networking is simply to enhance your cause. Think of networking as the opening of doors to the unknown. You might be tempted to believe the more doors you have, the greater the odds you will make the right kinds of connections, but that is incorrect.



Networking is intentional by design. By placing yourself in situations that attract others with whom mutually beneficial relationships can be established, you increase the potential payoffs. Therefore, one of the greatest traits of the networking leader is the ability to actively identify which doors to open.Related: 4 Reasons Why Networking Is a Must for All Successful Entrepreneurs


5 Ways to network your way to business growth and wealth1. Do your homeworkThis might sound self-explanatory, but you'll be surprised how many entrepreneurs overlook this part. Planning is a component of networking, and you will need to make lists and seek out resources that can answer basic questions about the person or organization you will be meeting. For instance, who knows the person you are trying to meet? Who else works with this person? Where do they live? I'm not suggesting you stalk your potential pool of networking targets; rather, sit down and list the information that might help increase the quality of your potential interactions.I learned the importance of doing your homework when I had the opportunity to have dinner with author Mary Higgins Clark. Despite the many possible ways of learning more about my famous upcoming dinner host, time required that I select only a few. Step one was a trip to my local bookstore — a place of great networking resources. I asked the person working behind the counter if she had ever heard of Mary Higgins Clark. ""Oh yes,"" she replied, as she pointed to a display holding more than 10 of her books. Now I felt anxious; despite my desire to read what appeared to be stacks upon stacks of her best-selling novels, I purchased only three to read on the plane. As I left the bookstore, I found myself less anxious and more excited about my upcoming encounter.2. Take the initiative and introduce yourselfWhen meeting someone of notoriety, it is natural to be nervous about making a bad first impression, regardless of your own level of success. Even the most charismatic individuals say the wrong things out of nervousness or excitement. I think it's always wise to rely on politeness. This seems like an obvious suggestion until you mistakenly call someone by her first name after a two-minute introduction. Whether the person you are approaching is famous or not, it's always acceptable to ask, ""How would you like to be addressed?"" after introducing yourself. I also like to have a few questions in mind that begin with the phrase, ""Tell me about…,"" followed by a reference to something I know about the person. Because most people like to talk about themselves, the more the conversation places emphasis on your new acquaintance — not why they should be thrilled to meet you — the more likely will be another encounter.Fortunately, I didn't have to make any decisions about how to approach my dinner host since Mary Higgins Clark greeted me as I approached her home. Still, outside, Mary and I talked about a host of topics, from our families and hobbies to the stock market. She was very interested in the market. She asked questions that, frankly, were rather complicated to answer. Instead of trying to impress her (a mistake often made when trying to make a good impression), I responded to her questions with simple, easy-to-understand answers.


Related: The 10 Commandments of Networking You Must Know to Build Authentic Connections3. Make it about themYou never want to make yourself sound better, smarter or more knowledgeable than your partners in conversation. When you do this, you appear condescending and, despite your desire to build a foundation for additional interaction, you may have just closed the door. In fact, it should be your goal to ask more questions than you answer. Keep the other person engaged in the conversation by having them share information about themselves. Find a common interest. Last, do what is needed to make yourself appear approachable. Offering your business card is just one way to ensure this happens.Much to my delight, my use of effective networking skills with Mary Higgins Clark was immediately rewarded. For example, as I was leaving after a wonderful evening of conversation over a New England dinner, Mary asked if she could talk to me for a minute. I walked with her to the corner of the room, where she said, ""I really like you and how easily you explained the answers to my questions. I'm looking to open an investment account with another company, and I'd like to open the account with you.""4. Stay in frequent contact Why did this happen? Simply because I took the initiative to stay in contact. There are many ways you can do this. Writing thank you cards, sending articles of interest with a note or remembering events of significance with flowers are all examples of frequent contact. Sending an e-mail message — although impersonal when compared to a letter — also keeps your name and contact information out there. Call certain contacts periodically and, if you happen to be in their area, take them to lunch or give them a quick call to say hello.


5. Look for ways to offer praiseMaking others feel good is essential for walking through doors once they have been opened. Congratulating someone for accomplishments or thanking them for taking the time to speak with you are ways to praise. This does not mean you should act like a crazed fan; instead, think about what you could say that would make the other person feel good about themselves. Praising your own accomplishments can lead to a competitive tone in your conversations. Having a calm sense of self while praising others makes you appear self-confident and much more worthy of additional contacts.Final wordsNo successful entrepreneur achieves business or financial goals without the assistance of others. It doesn't matter how knowledgeable, qualified or experienced you are: Without the assistance of others, you will probably fail to excel. Push yourself to stretch outside your immediate comfort zone, seek different ideas and discover a world of potential opportunities for yourself and your business.Mastering the art of networking will enhance your abilities and opportunities to create the business growth and wealth you desire.

64,Why Saying 'I Don't Know' Makes You a Better Leader,"Feb 21, 2024",Joanna Swash,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-saying-i-dont-know-makes-you-a-better-leader/468335,"
No one knows everything. There's no need to pretend that we do. A great leader is honest about their limitations and strengths. Accept that you will fail. Being honest and open about failure is not a weakness.A great leader is not defined by having all the answers but by a willingness to grow and learn, a curiosity that leads to finding the required answers. It is about stopping, refueling, and being the best version of yourself.Think about it. Do you want a team that comes to you for the answers? That has no mind of its own? No creativity? We all know the answer to that. Command and control is a thing of the past and won't cut the muster in today's ever-evolving business landscape, not if you want to be a business of tomorrow.

65,This is the Real Secret to Success — How to Lead Even When You Are Losing,"Feb 21, 2024",Kristopher Tait,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-find-success-in-failure-and-loss/468964,"
Recently, my team and I lost a client — a large client. And it hurt a lot. We don't like losing; call it our competitive nature or just the fact that we pour everything we have into these client engagements, our ideas, and our time.In just over a decade, we have landed in New York and grown from a team of under ten to an organization with more than 500 people globally. We've won incredible clients — driving their businesses forward and delivering upon ambitious growth plans.We've done a lot of winning. So, losing naturally stung. But that sting quickly morphs into something far more powerful: motivation to learn and grow.Related: 8 Tips to Help Entrepreneurs Find Success After FailureOn the pitchThe challenge with always winning is that you will feel like you are succeeding. As if you've earned the title ""best in the business."" But in reality, that feeling is somewhat of a falsity because you're actually not really learning. Yes, you're winning. But you're not growing.



This is why I'm here to remind ourselves that the real secret to success is learning how to lose. To lose with grace but also fire. To lose with conviction and a promise to learn, grow and continuously do better.Don't believe me? Just ask David Beckham and Sir Alex Ferguson.Close your eyes and reflect on the 1998 World Cup in France. England faced their old enemy, Argentina, in the first knockout rounds. David Beckham started for England in midfield. At this moment in time, he was a young man with the world at his feet. He was a fast-emerging superstar. He was dating a superstar. And he was playing for England and Manchester United.Life was looking good for Becks. Until, with the game tied at 2-2, Argentina's notoriously tenacious midfielder Diego Simeone committed a cynical foul on Beckham. After Beckham hit the floor, Simeone antagonized Beckham by ruffling the back of his hair.


And in that moment, Beckham's life would change forever.Beckham lost control of his emotions. He instinctively kicked out his leg at Simeone— leading the referee to swiftly brandish a red card and send Beckham off the pitch. England lost the game. And chaos ensued.Beckham went from the golden boy to the most hated man in Britain in a flash. The media turned on him. He received death threats from fans, bullets in the mail, and a Beckham effigy was even hanged outside a pub in London.Related: Why Failure Is Your Best TeacherEveryone turned on him. Except his manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.Sir Alex put his arms around him. He protected him — and made sure his teammates did, too. He created an ""us versus the world"" mentality within Beckham and the club. And together, they fought on and pushed forward.And it worked. Within a year, Beckham and Manchester United would win an iconic treble. Tides would shift. He was back to his place as beloved the world over.Pivoting back to the world in which we thrive — the world of business—this ""us versus the world"" mentality can be incredibly powerful when deployed well and with intention. By having instilled the right mindset, our best work has been done when we've lost a few things in a row.


Why? Because it forces you to reassess your position in the market, develop new tools and capabilities and refine your sense of direction. Lastly, always remember that feedback is a gift, take as much as you can and learn from it. Embrace it. We call that having a growth mentality.Related: 7 Lessons on Failure You Can Learn From Top AthletesLosses and lessonsLosing hurts. It will always hurt. But there is no shame in losing — so cast that thought aside. There is only regret if you fail to learn.Sir Alex Ferguson turned a crisis into an opportunity by leading with a people-first mindset and putting the collective well-being of his team first. He stood by his team, and the world witnessed that.


Businesses work in the same way. Leaders need to create a sense of togetherness. When you lose out on a pitch, people will worry about the security of their jobs. As I am learning again, an ""us against the world"" mentality can be a transformational asset in these moments.If you spoke to David Beckham in the aftermath of that game versus Argentina, he would likely give anything to turn back time and change his actions. But that loss, that mistake, was likely worth more than he could realize.A loss is not always for the worse. Sometimes, it is the best thing that can happen for a person or a business. It's a chance to refocus. To reevaluate your processes and your priorities.We are all going to face challenging moments in 2024. Everyone will lose at some point. But not everyone will learn. And that, more than their percentage of wins against losses, is what separates successful leaders and businesses from the rest.

66,Why You Should Stop Surrounding Yourself With (Only) Likeminded People,"Feb 19, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/your-peers-shouldnt-only-think-like-you-heres-why/468741,"
One of my sons has a colossal book of bedtime stories. Each night, we try to tackle a couple of them. I'm always amazed at how the takeaways of those children's tales remain relevant for grown-ups, including entrepreneurs.Take The Emperor's New Clothes — the classic cautionary tale about the perils of groupthink. The adults are so eager to please the emperor that they stifle their opinions, even when the plain truth is as clear as day. It falls to an innocent child to offer a different, honest perspective.I've seen similar situations in boardrooms, between colleagues and leaders. That's why with my company, Jotform, one of my goals is to continually foster diverse ways of thinking. Working with people who have different cognitive styles is key to boosting performance. But, as research shows, we tend to do the opposite. Instead, we team up with likeminded professionals.

I was born in Singapore and grew up in New York. After high school, I was required to go back and serve in Singapore's military. I did that for about three years. I was very fearful, but it turned out to be one of the best experiences I've had in terms of formulating who I am. After that, I had the opportunity to study industrial engineering at Georgia Tech. Part of this journey helped me realize that I didn't think a specialized field was something that I wanted to do.

68,4 Success Lessons From the Brothers Who Made Chickpea Pasta Mainstream,"Feb 16, 2024",Robert Tuchman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/banza-co-founders-share-their-biggest-success-tips/469822,"
This week on How Success Happens, I spoke with Brian and Scott Rudolph, brothers and co-founders of Banza. The business was born out of a gluten sensitivity, and 10 years later, it's expanded from chickpea pasta to foods including pizza, mac and cheese and more.You can listen to my whole conversation with Brian and Scott above, and I've pulled out four key takeaways.Related: 7 Challenges Successful People Overcome



It's more fun to build a business if you're passionate about the missionBefore Banza, Brian considered starting a tech company. He floated the idea by a friend, who asked him a simple question: ""If you knew you had to work on it for the next 10 years, would you still do it?""This made him realize he wasn't super passionate about it. Around the same time, Brian learned he had gluten sensitivity and was determined to make pasta that he could eat. He soon discovered a pasta made from chickpeas didn't exist. People were excited about the idea, but his personal need and passion for the product helped it evolve into a business idea he was excited about. He soon convinced his brother, Scott, to leave his job in finance to help him launch Banza. Ten years later, it's expanded into other comfort food categories like pizza, mac and cheese and waffles.

Invest time in building a reliable network of people you admire and trustBrian and Scott spent a lot of time networking in the early days. They wanted to learn from brands they admired, like Chobani, and they weren't afraid to send cold emails to academics who had written research papers on legume pasta. Their goal was to gain as much knowledge as they could and build strong relationships along the way.

69,What Your Brand Needs to Unlock The Power of Thought Leadership,"Feb 16, 2024",Yogesh Shah,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-your-brand-needs-to-unlock-the-power-of-thought/463082,"
Establishing your brand as a leader in your industry is more crucial than ever. Around two-thirds of marketers — about 66% — recognize thought leadership as a ""top priority"" for their marketing organizations, but only some know what steps they need to take to become a thought leader. This is where a well-researched thought leadership program comes in, as it increases your brand's credibility, engages your audience and increases your business opportunities.But what exactly is a thought leadership program, and how can entrepreneurs prioritize it in their marketing strategy to grow their business?This article reveals what you need to develop a thought leadership program, how you can leverage social media listening and data science for content relevance and the role of writers in communicating core insights. It offers a roadmap for businesses to position themselves as industry leaders through effective thought leadership.



Related: How to Enhance Your Brand Through Thought LeadershipWhat is a thought leadership program?To establish a thought leadership program, you require research and insights to create impactful content that engages audiences and builds brand authority. A thought leadership program is a strategic initiative that involves sharing insightful and thought-provoking perspectives with your audience. One of the critical ingredients of a thought leadership program is ""insights,"" which you can use to write stories through various forms of content, such as reports, whitepapers, blog posts, videos, webinars, podcasts and speaking engagements. The main goal is to establish your brand as an authority in your industry by showcasing your unique viewpoint. Your brand can benefit from an improved reputation and credibility, higher brand engagement rates, and, ultimately, more business opportunities.


Why are insights crucial for a thought leadership program?According to Google, an insight creates a whole new way of thinking. Insights supported by research are essential for thought leadership. These can be obtained through primary research, social media listening, peer review, data analytics and AI. Insights can provide new perspectives, solve problems and uncover opportunities while avoiding potential issues.Understanding the needs of consumers is crucial for any business to succeed. Conducting research and utilizing the insights gained from it can help you better understand the consumer's pulse. Using these insights to craft a compelling story in your thought leadership program can establish your position as a thought leader in your industry.The impact of your thought leadership program relies significantly on its ability to challenge the status quo or offer a unique perspective. When your content confronts prevailing industry norms or introduces novel viewpoints, it captures attention and stimulates thought, creating a stronger brand reputation with your audience. This approach demonstrates deep industry understanding and positions you as a forward-thinking leader.How can insights help you identify topics for thought leadership?Identifying the right topic for your thought leadership program can be a game-changer. Analyzing the insights from your research can help you spot the trends that are more relevant to your audience and align with your brand's vision. This information can serve as a guide for selecting the most suitable topics and perspectives to develop a more effective thought leadership program for your brand.


How can you strengthen your thought leadership program with primary research and insights?Primary research and data science insights can help shape the thought leadership study's narrative by looking into what people respond to and are actively engaging with and also by extracting the most helpful information to use in marketing efforts.Apart from primary research, brands should also consider using social media listening to gain a deeper understanding of their target customers' trends, preferences and sentiments. This can help them tailor their thought leadership programs to better resonate with their audience and establish themselves as authorities in their industry. That could mean creating content about a certain current event, a trend or a social cause that many people care about.Customer insights can help with data dissemination because you'll know which insights customers care most about. That's why it's worth gathering all of this data. Without it, you're marketing blind, which is a big no-no. You need to know what your target customers are saying online and where they're doing it if you want to join the conversation naturally.Competitor insights can help find and fill gaps to help you reach your target audience with the right messages at the right times (because they've already done the work). Some entrepreneurs even recommend following the competition on social media and seeing what they're doing that works. You can also join their email lists and see what content they deliver to their subscribers/customers.


By knowing what your customers want (and what your competitors are doing), you can sift through the data you already have and make better sense of it to authentically connect and engage with your audience. You can also learn to collect data more intelligently (and know what kind of data will be most beneficial to you moving forward).But insights can reach much further into social listening. Talking to industry experts, company experts and CXO people can offer even more insights on the topics or themes you've chosen for your thought leadership program. By getting inside information straight from the source, you can be sure it's real, accurate and valuable.So, use every resource available to get the most accurate, up-to-date information out there.Related: 5 Effective Ways to Establish Yourself as a Thought Leader


Piecing it all togetherOnce you have the necessary data, you can hire expert writers, who could also be within your company, to write insightful reports. While hiring skilled writers can help effectively communicate your insights, the essence of thought leadership lies in your organization's original ideas and expertise. Subject matter experts who are writers are instrumental in shaping these ideas into compelling content that resonates with your audience, using the data obtained from these listening tools and research and creating different content formats, such as blog posts, eBooks, case studies, etc.By using all of the tools mentioned above and resources, you'll be able to create a more robust thought leadership program that does what it's supposed to do — help you bring awareness to your brand, boost engagement, and drive sales.Ready to create your own thought leadership program?Creating a thought leadership program can help amplify your current efforts when it comes to sales and marketing. By leveraging digital, mobile, and social media channels to engage potential buyers, you can increase online engagement with your brand and, in turn, boost sales. That's why so many companies are beginning to use thought leadership to help them reach their goals.

70,4 Honest Truths That Will Make You a Better Boss,"Feb 16, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-simple-truths-that-will-make-you-a-great-boss/468756,"
At lunch with a potential client recently, he said something interesting: ""Every mistake that is made in my company is ultimately my fault, and yet every win is accredited to me too. It's a weird dynamic, because neither side of this equation is accurate and yet both sides — at least in the public eye — are true."" As the CEO of a team of 15+ team members, I immediately got what he was saying and realized it's part of my daily role.Think about it: The ground-shattering advancements of Apple have historically been attributed to just Steve Jobs. When Tesla stock goes down, it's all Elon Musk's fault. And when people think ""Amazon,"" they think ""Jeff Bezos"" — no other name at all except Bezos. The space heater that didn't arrive the day it was supposed to? Bezos better get on that!But of course, none of this is the case, is it? No single business owner, whether they have a team of 15, 1,500 or 15,000, can possibly be responsible for every single thing that goes on in the company, and they sure as heck aren't responsible for all the things that go right. And yet they're routinely assigned this burden. That's an awful lot of weight on the shoulders of leaders. How you carry it is up to you.



Some truths about being the bossIn my 15 years of running my own PR firm, I've been on both sides of this seesaw. I've sat on the side of a client singing my praises to the skies for a fundraiser that exceeded expectations, and I've also been harshly reprimanded by a client who was sorely disappointed by the lackluster results of their press release pickup. In the first instance, it was my events coordinator who chose the venue, the date, the band, everything; in the second, there's only so much you can do if the media is simply not at all interested in your widget.In both cases, I've had to assess what is real and true for me, and I've come to some conclusions about being responsible for the whole shebang. Interestingly, most of what rings true is about the value of my team, not me.


Related: Don't Let Your Biggest Client Become Your Biggest Nightmare — You Should Fire Them Instead. Here's Why.Truth #1: You can't manage effectively without delegatingEven bosses of small teams know that they can't do every task themselves and have their whole hand in every pie. I'm not advising bird's-eye management, but micromanaging isn't the answer either. You'll limit your vision of the big picture by concentrating too much on the pixels, and you'll stymie your staff to the point of building hostility and resentment.I field about 2,000 emails a day. It just isn't realistic or sustainable for me to have to follow through on each and every one of those emails. I have to forward most of them on for implementation; I have to delegate to manage the workload so my company can succeed and thrive. Delegation means getting things done better and faster than I could ever pull off alone. Delegation makes sense, and it affords room for growth. But when you don't see every single document produced and every single assignment completed, it also means that something can go awry at any time.Truth #2: Some mistakes are not your ownOver the summer, my bags were hugely delayed after a flight. I was livid with the airlines, and when I got home, I sent a strongly worded letter to the head honcho expressing my discontent. The fact of the matter was that it was the contracted baggage handling company at the airport that was at fault, but that didn't matter to me in my anger. I threatened the airline to never fly them again if they didn't shape up.


The same will happen to you. Embarrassing typos that get published. Misstatements by others you wish could be retracted. An employee having a public meltdown one day under extreme stress. You weren't a direct part of any of this — you did not take these missteps. Doesn't matter. Does. Not. Matter. You're in charge, and when a team member makes a mistake (as humans are wont to do), you have to own the mistake as yours. Your staff will not only love you for it, they'll remain loyal. It's not just the right thing to do, it's the only thing to do to maintain morale and support the people who propel your business forward.Related: 7 Mistakes That Make or Break Small BusinessesTruth #3: None of the glory is your ownBosses can easily get a big head when they win a nifty award, slay it at the board meeting or see record profits. Did you earn all this yourself? Do you deserve the credit for all this? No, you absolutely did not and do not.I can't think of one fellow entrepreneur I know who got where they are now just on their own coattails. If we're honest with ourselves, we all know that we simply couldn't proceed and progress without Amanda's diligence, Ty's way with numbers, and Steph's IT prowess. I don't care how proud or excited you are about a worthy accomplishment; you should not only share the laurels but plant them firmly in your team's camp, never your own office. Sometimes, you didn't make the mistake that got you into some hot water for a time. All the time, I'd be willing to bet, you alone didn't bring about the achievement you're celebrating. The celebration belongs to the team that made it happen for your company.


Truth #4: The buck IS yours; take itAll of this is to say that the buck does stop with you. So grab it and put it in your pocket, no one else's. Do not encumber your staff with an affliction they did not mean to create or an onus that is not theirs to bear. Being the boss means holding tight to the reins of leadership when the ride is smooth and when the ride is bumpy.This all comes with time and practice. Accepting the blame and deflecting the credit aren't always easy shifts to make in your mindset — at first, it's natural to get defensive when something goes amiss on your watch that you weren't aware of, and it's equally natural to want to rejoice in your triumphs. But ultimately, it's empowering to train your brain to adjust to this aspect of strong leadership and to overcome initial impulses in lieu of the greater good for your company.A president is a presidentThere are some striking similarities between being the president of an enterprise and being the president of the United States. When things are going swimmingly, the person in charge is lauded for establishing the sunny climate, and when things are floundering, the commander is denounced for the stormy weather. But you can't throw your people under the bus for poor results any more than a sitting president can finger-point at members of his cabinet during a State of the Union address. Both types of presidents need to assume the mantle they have accepted, and that mantle is called accountability.It might just be a mental game you play with yourself — to get comfortable taking responsibility for the bad and not taking responsibility for the good — but it's a game with fair rules. It's a game that protects your players and allows them to shine at the same time. It's a game you can win, and it's a game that every good boss needs to learn to master if they want to become a great leader.

71,How Asynchronous Work Can Help Battle and Eliminate Burnout,"Feb 16, 2024",Tom Medema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-asynchronous-work-can-help-battle-burnout/469374,"
The overall change in workplace dynamics has been widely covered in recent years and for obvious reasons. Due to my professional focus, I have had my fair share of this coverage, but my perspective has mostly been on the positive end of the spectrum. I understand that the generally inquisitive nature of humankind can sometimes lead to heavy questioning and, thus, a naturally slow and tentative adoption of rapid change, but that is why I see it as crucial to highlight benefits that I believe can be massive and that largely arise from this adoption.My professional focus as the founder and CEO of Bubbles revolves around workplace dynamics, and more specifically, asynchronous work environments and the need for optimization of meeting calls that are deemed essential. It represents a quest to adopt revolutionary changes in both general working patterns and behavior, and the improving technology that facilitates it.Now, many view the continued stronghold of remote, asynchronous work negatively, but I am of the opinion that the majority of those holding this view have not fully considered the extent of the benefits. One of them is the impact of asynchronous work environments on burnout and how changing work patterns have impacted our perception and management of workplace stress. To clarify, burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged exposure to stress. Burnout is something that has been of growing concern in work settings, both traditional and (to some extent) modern. Nevertheless, we should all want to reduce or even eliminate burnout. I just specified that the lack of full extent for modern burnout is a concern because of the positive impact of asynchronous work habits.



Nevertheless, there remains a long way to go. To put some numbers to this claim, a 2022 study by Asana that quizzed over 10,000 knowledge workers across seven countries found that around 70% of respondents experienced burnout in the previous year. This is a crazy number, but as I mentioned, if we can all collaborate to increase our expertise and awareness of burnout, I know we can find ways to reduce it, improving our work individually and when working as a team. Let's now explore how this is possible by first gaining more of an understanding of the problem itself.Related: 6 Ways to Avoid Burnout While Working Remote


Understanding burnoutPer the World Health Organization, burnout is a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. Symptoms include energy depletion and increased mental distancing from the job at hand, which all combine to reduce the worker's efficiency. The roots of burnout can be vast but generally encompass excessive work, especially with a lack of control and a subsequent lack of fairness and conflict in values. Burnout can itself be a root of more serious health issues, such as depression, anxiety and cardiovascular issues. A Gallup study found that employees with regular feelings of burnout are 63% more susceptible to sick days and are 2.6 times more likely to be on the new job hunt.Of course, there are a variety of burnout types, from being overloaded to being under-challenged, and technological burnout is also more than possible in the digital age. Still, part of this journey is to recognize that entirely eradicating is unrealistic. Instead, we should see these startling health statistics as a trigger to reduce the prevalence of burnout as much as possible, which is what async working, in my view, has been doing.Related: 5 Tips to Build Mental Fitness Within Your TeamsThe rise of asynchronous workAsynchronous work is a flexible working style where tasks are completed without the need for real-time interaction, and it has gained popularity recently due to the desire to optimize remote working. Flexibility brings control, directly counteracting a root cause of burnout, but also retains or even increases the effectiveness of collaboration, as the async approach allows more deliberation time to communicate those thoughts effectively. Any team member succeeding in achieving this is bound to feel like they are constantly improving their teamwork and team success, which will increase morale and work-life balance, which is pivotal to reducing stress and preventing burnout.


Furthermore, these success stories are becoming ever more common with the rise in async adoption. Speaking from a position of experience with Bubbles, which is partially an asynchronous communication platform, I have heard that my own team, who all pioneer this technology, feel far more comfortable and happy in their collaborative efforts due to the reduced pressure of immediate responses, and flexibility to manage personal responsibilities.From my perspective, implementing asynchronous communication in your team can appeal to every member. Those who are shy and reserved in their input feel less stressed by everyday meetings and conversations, and those who are more boisterous can continue to be so but also have that added flexibility to communicate on their own time. In these instances, the former experiences less stress and, therefore, usually less burnout, and the latter feels less pinned down and restricted to tight timings, potentially, for example, meaning they can attend a gathering or meet with a friend while still ensuring they complete their work. The effect here is a boost in work-life balance and happiness, which hopefully has a mirrored effect.Related: Avoid These 3 Key Mistakes for Team Success in 2024To conclude, asynchronous work environments hold significant potential for reducing workplace burnout through revolutionary shifts in everyday communicative and collaborative patterns. This is not to say that async is a panacea, and the success of these environments in reducing burnout largely hinges on their implementation and management. Nevertheless, the risk of adoption and testing is minimal compared to the reward of unblocking your team from burnout and ensuring a healthy, productive work environment. Therefore, my final words are to move with the trends and explore how beneficial this can be for you and your team.

72,The No. 1 Priority for Small Businesses This Year Is to Increase Revenue — Here Are 4 Ways to Do Just That.,"Feb 16, 2024",Rich Rao,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-for-small-businesses-to-increase-revenue-in-2024/468815,"
As 2024 begins, goals and resolutions are top of mind. According to a recent report by Intuit QuickBooks, the top priority among business owners is to increase revenue, above getting financing or launching new products or services.Increasing revenue is no easy feat, but entrepreneurs can employ a variety of strategies to help achieve growth in 2024. Even if some macroeconomic pressures like inflation and interest rates may ease this year, they are likely a continued concern for businesses. By looking for new ways to modernize and improve business processes, entrepreneurs can be better positioned to power momentum in 2024 and beyond, even in ever-changing economic conditions.Related: 4 Secrets to Turbocharging Revenue Growth Every Executive Must Know



Hire skilled workersHaving good employees is key to business growth, and in 2024 business owners say it's a top priority, even ahead of cash flow. Entrepreneurs believe hiring skilled employees will help them meet increased customer demand, and most employers (89%) want to hire more employees or contractors this year. But hiring can also be costly and according to one study, the average cost per hire was almost $4,700 when you take into account onboarding, training and the ramp up to productivity.Expanding the workforce is especially top of mind for younger entrepreneurs, with more than three-quarters (76%) of Gen Z small business owners and 80% of millennial small business owners saying they want to hire employees this year. Compare this to just 34% of baby boomer-owned small businesses. In terms of how to hire qualified workers, I recommend business owners be very specific when developing job descriptions, zeroing in on the problems and challenges you're trying to solve with the role. And by offering employee benefits like health care and paid vacation, small businesses will be better positioned to compete with larger enterprises in attracting top talent.


Optimize inventory management to enhance omnichannel salesAs business owners embrace omnichannel sales, selling across multiple online and in-person channels can maximize revenue but can also add new complexities to running your business. Have you ever ordered a product from a business, big or small, only to find out it's actually sold out? Optimizing inventory management so you can deliver the best customer experience is key for success and continued consumer loyalty.Take for example Matt Paggi of Barred Woods Maple, a QuickBooks customer who shared with our team just how crucial a positive first-time shopping experience is — especially during the busy holiday season. The holidays are typically when they do almost a third of their annual business, and each year they see returning customers who've made gifting their maple products a tradition. To help ensure they can manage increased inventory needs they've expanded their presence across various channels to capture both new and returning customers, ramped up production ahead of time and brought on seasonal employees.For business owners like Matt, my number one piece of advice is to use the power of data analytics to optimize inventory management and sales strategies. This includes looking at your sales history to identify the most popular products and impactful channels to drive strategic decision-making and maintain a real-time understanding of stock levels to avoid over and understocking. Additionally, data trends around the cost of raw materials can also help business owners know when they need to buy in bulk or scale back on production.The data shows improving and expanding omnichannel sales is particularly important for Gen Z entrepreneurs, with 88% of Gen Z small business owners looking to expand ecommerce or physical locations to boost revenue in 2024 compared to 66% of Gen X and baby boomers.


Related: These 4 Quick Wins Can Boost Your Customer Count and RevenueDynamic management of cash flow and credit card debtTo make money, you have to have money on hand. Access to cash and maintaining healthy cash flow is essential to small business survival. Whether it's earmarking enough cash to cover overhead costs if payments are late to paying for unexpected expenses and emergencies, business owners have to be ready for the inevitable curveball that will come their way.There are a few simple ways business owners can build a cash flow cushion. First, know your fixed and variable costs and monitor cash flow projections regularly to spot potential problems before they arise. Digital tools can be incredibly valuable in providing you with real-time insights that can help you plan ahead and react quickly. I also recommend treating cash flow savings as a fixed expense and setting firm guidelines for when you'll tap cash reserves.Entrepreneurs also should be mindful of how they use and manage credit cards. Recent data has pointed to the increased reliance small businesses have on credit cards to manage cash flow — 83% of business owners have relied on a credit card to manage their business finances, and 59% of business owners who use credit cards said it was ""an emergency or temporary source of funding.""


What's more, almost 24% of small businesses don't believe they will be able to pay off their credit card balances in 2024 without paying interest. It's important to have a strategy when using credit cards to manage cash flow — and to ensure you stay on top of managing your interest rates on the cards you use — otherwise, this could be a costly expense in the future.Related: 6 Strategies for Optimizing Cash Management When Starting a BusinessSet your financial goalsWhether it is setting an intention for the day or creating a workback timeline to hit a big business milestone, goals are an important part of a business owner's journey.As we kick off 2024, business owners should evaluate what financial goals will make them feel successful. These financial goals can help provide a clear sense of direction, serve as a benchmark for progress and success or unearth areas that need improvement. They can also serve as a road map of your longer-term mission or vision for the business and can ultimately help fuel overall growth.


Success can be measured differently by different people, but regardless of how you view success, setting a goal and understanding revenue targets for your business can help in planning for and achieving a fruitful year ahead.

73,Why Most Founders and Investors Are Wrong About Disruption,"Feb 15, 2024",Dustin Lemick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-most-founders-are-wrong-about-disruption/469194,"
There's something that every leader needs to understand about disruption: It is always happening.It is always taking place. It can be easy to believe that disruption is limited to once-in-a-lifetime occurrences, where the world is forever changed. Or that it is always mass scale. In reality, everything is always in a state of business change. It can come in many different sizes and forms. It can also happen at any time and anywhere.Yet, disruption is commonly misunderstood. It can be difficult to recognize. A lot of people overlook it or can't see it. There is an overuse of the term. Many believe or claim they're disrupting a market or industry when they are not — or the disruption isn't large or significant enough to make a major impact. Some assume that disruption automatically means technology. It isn't always the case. Innovation typically plays a role, but it can come in many forms.



Your company, market or industry can be disrupted, or a combination of the three. Larger macro issues also take place globally that can spark major changes: economic conditions, geopolitical issues, weather, conflict, currencies, and other factors. It then trickles down to everyone. The only real truism about disruption is that it constantly occurs everywhere. In today's market climate, leaders can gain an in-depth understanding of disruption, when to recognize it, and how to create opportunities when it happens.Related: How to Bounce Back and Succeed During Times of Disruption


Real disruption changes the normal course of an activity, process, or behavior on a mass scale. Airbnb and Uber are great examples. Consumers once predominantly relied on hotels and motels for lodging when traveling. Airbnb changed this; today, consumers are as likely to opt for Airbnb as another option. With Uber, people began to use gig economy drivers instead of taxis or other traditional means. It significantly impacted the transportation business. These two case studies illustrate major changes that challenged an industry's fundamentals. The COVID-19 lockdown was a large global issue that incited a giant fundamental shift. Companies had to change how they operated dramatically — what they offered, how they served customers, led employees and generated revenue. It forged entirely new ways of doing business. In all these scenarios, genuine disruption was at play.What are the tell-tale signs of disruption? Are there ways to detect when disruption is occurring? How can you tell if your business or idea is truly disruptive? An excellent general rule is to look at your market leader/incumbent. If the market leader is copying your offering or that of another disruptor, it can be a clear sign – i.e., replicating tactics, products, services, etc.It is likely a signal that the market leader is losing position. Challenging market leaders can be a place to identify where disruption is needed or likely to occur – i.e., what isn't working, what could be done better or differently, what is outdated, etc. Additionally, disruption is a new technology, tool, or process that your industry is adapting to. Shifts in outputs can also be a form. These are just a few examples of what can indicate disruptive change is underway or on the horizon.It's also important to determine if the disruption you're witnessing is large or small and whether it can make an impact. This is particularly relevant if you're an investor or looking for investment capital. Investors typically want to disrupt big things to get big rewards. They want big problems and solutions. Is something disruptive creating or solving a problem, and if so, how big is it? Investors want to know whether disruption will be valuable at an appropriate scale.


Recognizing disruption requires an open mind. In many instances, people can't believe or see something is disruptive at first. They think the idea is foolish or won't work. Disruption is usually caused by something that hasn't existed before or something new. Airbnb is a great example here as well. Its founders are said to have gone to every venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and were famously laughed out of meetings. People couldn't see what they saw — it hadn't been invented yet. Even the most seasoned business leaders can misunderstand and mistake disruption or fail to recognize it.Related: 3 Mindset Shifts Every Disruptor Must HaveDisruption doesn't always mean extinction. History has proven this for countless companies, processes, products, services, and ideas. Organizations can collapse after big changes. They did not or could not adapt. But something new or different tends to fill in the gap. It's often better, and the cycle continues. I have been on both sides of disruption at my company, BriteCo. We are one of the jewelry industry's disruptors – we were the first to move jewelry consumers to 100% paperless processes with technology and the internet. We also provide our customers with different ways to buy our coverage, unique to BriteCo, versus an outdated analog process at the retail point of sale. Yet, we still face disruption by the latest emerging technologies and innovations — ChatGPT and GenAI are good examples.Your ability to adapt to disruption begins first with recognizing it and determining its size and scale. Then, you must gauge its potential impact on you and your business. This can enable you to adapt more effectively and better decide if you need to take action. And, most importantly, help you navigate and succeed despite whatever change comes.

74,"In the Age of Instant, Here's Why Leaders Must Learn the Art of Patience","Feb 15, 2024",Hanif Lalani,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-leaders-must-learn-the-art-of-patience/469302,"
In my exploration of yogic philosophy, I have found particular resonance in the concept known as pratyahara. Its translation from Sanskrit is ""the conscious withdrawal of energy from the senses"" — broken down to its most simple interpretation; it is the practice of redirecting our awareness from the external world to the inner experiences.Today, our culture prioritizes immediacy and constant engagement, and as a result, pausing for reflection is increasingly becoming a lost art. Although pratyahara's origins can be traced back thousands of years, its importance has only grown as sensory overload becomes more common. Instant results have become the norm throughout many aspects of society, and our ability to practice patience is waning.I have found that leaders often grapple with impatience more than most. The inherent traits that make us effective in business — decisiveness, ambition and a drive for results — can also create a breeding ground for a heightened sense of urgency and restlessness. We are under considerable pressure to meet the high-paced demands of the modern business landscape, and there is an expectation for instant solutions, accelerated growth, and immediate responses.



Additionally, the pervasive influence of technology and the era of instant communication have created an environment where waiting has become a rarity. With the ability to send messages across the globe in seconds and access information at the touch of a button, impatience has become a byproduct of this culture of immediacy, and leaders often feel the weight of these expectations more intensely than most.Now more than ever, we as leaders need the ability to navigate uncertainties and make thoughtful decisions. Cultivating patience gives us the mental space to pause and reflect before making choices. It encourages a careful consideration of options and potential consequences. This allows us to differentiate between decisive actions stemming from a thoughtful evaluation of the situation and impulsive reactions driven by the moment's urgency.


Related: Harness the Power of Patience to be a Better LeaderDeveloping mindfulnessAs with most things, the first step to developing patience is becoming mindful of the feeling itself. We often attribute our impatience to external factors beyond our control: someone is taking too long in front of you at the grocery store or getting stuck in bad traffic.While it may seem natural to attribute impatience to external events, our emotional responses, thought patterns and mindset play a large role in how we experience and express impatience. When you understand that your reaction is still within your control, you can be empowered to reshape your internal responses to them.Beginning to cultivate patience starts with setting an intention to identify when impatience arises within you and what situations most commonly bring it forward. Even before starting this exercise, you can probably already think of a few scenarios that trigger those feelings of frustration and restlessness such as being placed on hold or having to listen to someone take what seems to be an interminably long time to explain something.


Related: Why Mindfulness Matters for EntrepreneursExpectations vs. realityImpatience often occurs when reality isn't conforming to our expectations. We expect that project timelines will not be delayed, meetings will start promptly, and deliveries will be on schedule. We expect people to behave as we want them to, promptly responding to emails, meeting deadlines as promised, and actively contributing to meetings. The dissonance between these expectations and the unpredictability of real-world situations is where impatience can grow.Related: The 5 Most Important Cognitive Biases Holding You BackMind-body connectionAfter pinpointing the sources that trigger your impatience, you can then explore how impatience manifests in both your mind and body. Simply suppressing impatient feelings will only exacerbate the problem; instead, work on becoming familiar with the physical sensations that accompany them. Is your stomach in knots, or are your shoulders suddenly tensed all the way up next to your ears? Have you clenched your fists or tightened your jaw?


The physical expressions of emotions serve evolutionary purposes, preparing the body to respond to challenges. However, in modern life, these physiological responses can sometimes be disproportionate or misaligned with the actual circumstances. Understanding the mind-body connection is an important factor in developing strategies to manage our emotional and physical responses to impatience.Shifting attentionOne of the most practical tools available to develop patience is to shift one's attention. You are not your emotions, which means that you have the power to control how you are reacting in a given scenario. Impatience is unarguably unpleasant, so consider what you would rather feel instead. While calm is often seen as the opposite of impatience, achieving this shift can be challenging. Instead, explore alternative emotions such as curiosity or compassion. Curiosity allows you to engage with the present moment, finding interest in the details of your situation. In contrast, compassion towards yourself and others creates understanding that can soften the edge of impatience.Rediscovering presenceSo much of our lives have become automated. Technology has allowed us to streamline tasks that once required concentration and time to complete, and while this has certainly created new efficiencies, it is important not to allow ourselves to also run on autopilot. Understandably, when we become used to distractions, the idea of being present in the moment without external stimuli can seem unappealing. Our culture values constant activity and busyness, and slowing down and dedicating time to mindfulness inevitably clashes with that.However, mindfulness can be a valuable tool for cultivating and strengthening patience. It does not have to involve taking up a yogic practice or dedicating extensive hours to meditation. At its core, mindfulness is simply the conscious choice to observe your thoughts, sensations and surroundings without judgment, allowing for a heightened awareness of the present moment. Leaders today must resist the urge to fall in with the age of instant gratification, choosing instead to practice the dying art of patience through their actions and decisions.

76,I Went Into Business With My Husband and Quadrupled Our Revenue. Here Are 4 Lessons I Learned So You Don't Have To.,"Feb 14, 2024",Beth Newton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/i-went-into-business-with-my-husband-and-quadrupled-our/466556,"
From Beyonce and Jay Z to Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, there are dozens of high-profile entrepreneurs in pop culture, each successful in their own right, who partnered up in life, becoming famous power couples. But what if you and your significant other are early-stage entrepreneurs, like Nina and Tim Zagat, who started their entrepreneurial dreams together? Can you run a business together by day and be in a loving relationship by night?I quit my job to work for myself full-time on August 1, 2013. Two weeks later, I met my future husband and business partner. After ten years of working together, launching and running two businesses, marrying and combining our families, we've learned through trial and error how to keep not only our businesses but our relationship thriving.Do you and your significant other have power couple potential? These four lessons my partner and I learned over the past ten years can help you decide.



Power couple lesson #1: Evaluate compatibility and shared goalsNowhere is the phrase ""opposites attract"" more relevant than in the power couple dynamic. While Aaron and I enjoy many of the same hobbies and interests, we are pretty different when it comes to work styles and habits. I'm a bit of a workaholic, working through lunches and late into the night. Aaron takes a walk every day at lunch and ends his work day at a normal hour, whether he's having a slow day or is crazy busy. I enjoy managing finances — he doesn't. We each have strengths and weaknesses that complement each other.Aaron and I both worked in restaurants when we were young, so we understand the importance of customer service and have exceptionally high standards for our clients. Our values, work ethics, and long-term visions are well-aligned. We balance each other well, and that makes both of us more well-rounded professionals.


If you can effectively collaborate and resolve disagreement and effectively separate personal and professional matters, you have power couple potential.Power couple lesson #2: Define roles and responsibilitiesIt's important to draw lines around who owns what aspects of your organization, but you also should be willing and able to color outside the lines (a little). As a woman executive, I'm sensitive about taking on gender-specific roles in any business, much less an equal partnership. I've been in positions where I was asked to take notes as the only woman at the table.In our businesses, I manage the financials; my husband manages the production. I am copy and strategy; he is design and ideas. He's also anything offline, so he's our guy whether we're printing signage or building crates for in-store displays. I rely on Aaron for all creative for our agency and our clients, but I'm not void of creativity. In fact, I know great creative when I see it and not-so-great creative, too. I have ideas about design; I just can't execute them, and I'm not always great at explaining my vision.If you can clearly outline and communicate your specific job responsibilities and expectations and avoid biased roles, you have power couple potential.Related: 8 Traits That Make a Successful EntrepreneurPower couple lesson #3: Phone a friendEvery couple must navigate arguments, especially for those who work together. It's not a question of if you disagree — but when. It's imperative to have a system in place for getting through those challenges. One of the most crucial business lessons my partner and I learned is to bring in a third party for tie-breakers.At one point, Aaron tried to convince me to add another segment of the business that would be ideal for scaling. I was 100% against it and didn't think it would work. Instead of shutting him down (which I wanted to do), I agreed to ""phone-a-friend"" and sought a second opinion from my business coach. She agreed with him. That sealed the deal for me. It also increased our revenue by a wide margin. He was 100% right. (Yep, I said it.) A trusted source you can turn to for tie-breakers is a must in every power couple partnership.If you can be open to ideas, or at the least, agree to bring in a trusted tie-breaker who can settle a debate, you have power couple potential.


Power couple lesson #4: There are no (hard and fast) rulesIn our first year of business together, I wanted to talk constantly about work. It's all I thought about. At work, after work, on weekends, and even on vacation. I drove my partner crazy, which wasn't conducive to a healthy relationship or for our mental health. But that passion is also part of what makes me so good at what I do. It's what has helped us increase our revenue four-fold over the past seven years. We've learned not to put rules or limits around what we talk about and when. Sometimes, we talk about work after hours or on weekends, and sometimes, we talk about personal things during the day. Nothing is off limits, and there is no set time for either. It's what keeps us thinking creatively and being connected.I've read articles advising that each partner needs to bring 100% every day. Let's face it: we don't always have 100% to give every day of the week. Brene Brown once said that successful relationships aren't 100/100 or even 50/50. The percentage each person brings to the relationship will naturally change, depending on the day and what each has in their ""tank"" to give. And it's our job to communicate that to each other. If I'm feeling burnt out, it's my job to tell Aaron that I only have 30% that day; that way, he knows and is prepared to come with the other 70%. No different from our life at home. Our personal relationship is the most important to both of us, and if we had to choose, we'd drop the ""power"" from our couple title without hesitation.If you believe rules are made to be broken and change as you evolve as individuals and as partners, you have power couple potential.If you've been thinking about going into business with your partner, use these lessons we learned the hard way to start crafting your own power couple story today.

77,Zoning Out During Your Commute and Other 'In-Between' Times Is Actually Making You Less Happy,"Feb 12, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-maximize-your-commute-for-a-productive-day/468152,"
I used to think of my commute as an opportunity to fully disconnect — to do anything but work. I'd listen to music or podcasts or get my daily social media fix. I'd look out the window and daydream. Then, upon arriving at the office, I'd put on my productive work hat. The trouble was that there was no easy transition between the two mindscapes.We often think of commuting and other ""in-between"" hours as dead zones that we can fill with leisurely activity, but, according to 2019 Harvard Business School research, doing purely pleasurable things on the way to the office actually makes it harder to transition into work mode and may ultimately leave you feeling gloomy about your job — and even more likely to quit!In my role as CEO of Jotform, I've taken this data to heart, and come up with something of a life hack. Today, I treat those buffer zones as, at least ideally, akin to easing into a hot bath rather than plunging into a cold pool and have been witness to resulting differences in motivation and productivity.

78,Stop Wasting Your Grind — Why Having a Growth Mindset is the Answer to Hustle Culture,"Feb 9, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-a-growth-mindset-is-the-solution-to-hustle-culture/468899,"
Every entrepreneur has experienced the hustle culture — the idea that every waking moment must be focused on building and bettering your business. When riding solo, it's easy to blur the boundaries between work and life, a habit that can quickly lead to burnout. However, post-pandemic people are reprioritizing their work and finding ways to feel and be productive.Reevaluating the grindThe rise of Silicon Valley tech companies in the last part of the 1990s and into the early 2000s have been named as largely responsible for romanticizing ""the grind."" Pulling all-nighters and being constantly connected was a way to show how into the work you were.Though entrepreneurs are known for being passionate about their work and dedicated to maximizing their time, the pandemic slowed everything down. The forced halt gave everyone time to reevaluate how they wanted to approach their work going forward.



Many surveys highlight employees' willingness to cut pay in exchange for a better work-life balance. Flexible schedules, remote working and other customized perks and benefits all have become part of the mainstream. This type of freedom is a world entrepreneurs know all too well but may have forgotten during their company's growth phases.It's nice to remember that a schedule doesn't have to be filled up to achieve goals. And growth doesn't necessarily mean a slowdown. It's an intentional look at what does and doesn't work to optimize time. As entrepreneurs and the workforce as a whole continue to evolve past the hustle culture and appreciate what it feels like to have more balance, here are some ways to transition into this growth phase and still feel you are making strides.

How much is assigned toward administrative work? How much is reserved for meetings? And more importantly, where are areas that can be freed up?By closely examining where your time goes, it makes it easier to pinpoint places that need improvement. For instance, an entrepreneur in growth mode may be ready for a virtual assistant or professional services to ease their load. Hiring someone who can take care of emails, keep track of projects, and help with content management and social media can take your business to the next level.Start small by outsourcing a few assigned weekly hours and add to it as needed. Relinquishing control is a big step as an entrepreneur, but to grow, it's best to get help where you can. Delegating specific responsibilities gives you more time to focus on strategy and the next steps so you don't remain stagnant in the same work patterns.

Prioritize your healthAs an entrepreneur, taking a sick day is practically unheard of since there's no one else to fill in when you're out. That's why it's crucial to take care of your everyday health.The hustle culture made us believe that work came before sleep, eating and exercise. Using caffeine and adrenaline to fuel the system is not a method that will work long-term. Practicing the basics of self-care, like daily exercise, quality sleep, and good nutrition and hydration, like drinking water, doesn't seem as exciting, but they are the difference makers.These healthy habits will help you think more clearly and function more effectively. So often, these are the first things to go in place of work. When, in reality, they are the things most needed to get the work done.


In growth mode, you have to move beyond a scarcity mindset that requires around-the-clock working. Instead, focus on long-term goals, in addition to short-term wins, which involve taking care of your health first and foremost. Put it on the schedule and consider it an investment in your work life.Related: 3 Daily Habits Tp Protect Your Mental Health3. Find new ways to expandEven in today's instant gratification world, faster isn't always better. However, in some ways, the grind can be necessary… but not a forever approach. It can help you focus and build a good foundation, but the next step is to create processes that allow things to flow more easily.As you grow and scale your business, some tasks should become automated. Look into virtual and in-person assistance, digital tools, and resources to make your life easier. Email, social media, and e-commerce platforms are all part of what creates better workflows.


The hustle is not as popular as it once was because we have the technology to do things differently — which works best for you and allows you to expand creatively and make more authentic audience connections.Entrepreneurial life is about adapting. But now, the focus is more on adapting to what works more favorably for you. Not subscribing to hustle culture doesn't mean you're behind the competition; the approach is simply different. As a whole, society is entering a phase where quality, personalization, and intention matter - so it's important to recognize where you need and want to grow.

79,How Can a Working Mother Be Successful These Days? 6 Strategies for Success as an Entrepreneur and Parent,"Feb 9, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/6-strategies-for-success-as-a-parent-entrepreneur/467810,"
Like most things in life, being both an entrepreneur and a parent is a delicate balancing act. It would be wonderful if the demands of business and family life could coexist harmoniously, but they collide more often than I'd like.I used to think ""success"" in business meant a swanky office that would impress clients, stress-free multiyear contracts, a fat bank account and year-over-year growth. I had similar naive notions of what it meant to be a successful parent: reliable naptimes, lunch boxes packed with healthy, homemade treats, show-off-worthy report cards and always-happy kids.But now that I've been juggling both roles for well over a decade, I've come to accept the realities of my real life, not an imagined, inaccessible existence in which I can always give 100% of myself to both my family and my PR firm. In the process, my concept of success has changed according to a new set of standards.



""Success"" is a big word, laden with myriad expectations. But after much trial and error and careful consideration, I've come up with manageable and achievable goals that keep me on the road to success. See if these strategies work for you, too, in both entrepreneurship and parenthood.Success Goal #1 — Acknowledge and validate your feelings.First, you must identify your feelings about how your life is going — stressed? contentment? dissatisfaction? overwhelmed? confident? — and then simply accept that those are your true feelings at this time. When you allow yourself the thoughts and feelings you have instead of trying to tamp them down or deny them, you permit yourself to be a fully feeling, multifaceted human being. You validate who you are and what you're trying to accomplish, even amid all the hurdles you're facing and the flaws you inevitably possess.


This first, basic step alone — which amounts to practicing self-compassion: just letting yourself feel what you feel and not making yourself ""wrong"" for it — creates space to breathe more freely and perform your duties more effectively.Success Goal #2 — Replace 'parental guilt' with 'parental responsibility.'""Mommy, you work too much.""It tugs at the heartstrings and can trigger a wave of guilt that unsettles even the most driven of business owners. I've experienced a lot of parental guilt over the years, and so I had to find a way to deal with it without sweeping it under the rug, where I'd just trip on it on my way to a successful business.In my case, I have five kids ranging in age from 4 to 15. They have a lot of needs — and that's exactly what I use to turn my parental guilt into parental responsibility. At different times, under various circumstances, I've explained to them that just like they have needs and wants, so do I.


I use age-appropriate analogies for my younger ones: ""You know how you have to do your homework to get through third grade so you can graduate to fourth? Well, I have homework I have to do in my office right now, too, so I can get through my day and then come join you for dinner and game night."" Or ""You know how you have to clean up your room to earn your allowance this week? I need to clean up my inbox so I can make it to your track meet this afternoon.""For my older ones, I'm not above admitting that I take advantage of their consumer desires. The new phone they covet, the summer camp they want to attend, cash for Friday night with their friends, the designer kicks they just have to have … They're old enough to understand that money is what supplies all that, so they're remarkably forgiving when I have to go make a living to provide the quality of life they want.Basically, there is now an understanding in my household that what I'm doing when I'm away from my kids is securing the life we want as a family through dedication to a profession I relish. I am responsible for creating the family I want; thus, I have every right to be fully present and committed to the work that makes our lifestyle possible.Success Goal #3 — Recognize the shared, common struggle of working parents.Navigating the intersection of entrepreneurship and parenthood is a continuous journey marked by challenges and triumphs. It's hard. It's demanding. It's also incredibly rewarding when you manage to pull off a win-win.


But you often have to make difficult decisions, either/or choices you'd prefer to avoid. It's the same for all of us. We're all doing the best we can to cope with competing tensions. Personally, I take great comfort in knowing I'm not alone in this, in recognizing that virtually every working parent the world over is grappling with this dichotomy. You are not alone. Learn from other parents and share with other parents.Success Goal #4 — Reevaluate priorities.Another step I took in redefining success for myself was taking inventory of what I value most. I came up with priorities like quality time over quantity of time with family, keeping my client list vibrant and interesting to me (not just growth for growth's sake) and earning a certain amount each year to enable future life goals (college tuition, annual vacations, retirement, etc.).Here's what I recommend to devise your own list of priorities to help you define your own version of success:Reflect on personal and professional goals; write them down and rank them in order of importance.Identify nonnegotiable family commitments; incorporate them into your schedule, no exceptions.Set realistic expectations for both work and parenting based on steps 1 and 2. When you meet those expectations, celebrate yourself!Success Goal #5 — Establish boundaries.You'll likely need to draw some hard lines in the sand to stick to your identified priorities, demarcating clear work hours versus family time. That means delegating whatever you can to your staff and time-blocking your daily tasks. It also means communicating your boundaries to clients, colleagues, friends and family. They can't get on board if they don't know the game's new rules.


Remember what I said about discovering the value of quality over quantity time with my children? Being in the same space with them for six hours while I ignore them on my laptop is not better than spending one solid hour with them baking cupcakes. They've told me that, and I've learned that. So set boundaries and stick to them — it will keep your lanes to success in line.Success Goal #6 — Embrace flexibility.Lastly, take the wiggle room when you unexpectedly encounter some, and create some when necessary for your mental well-being. Yes, we all have an online schedule, a daily to-do list, reminders and notifications constantly buzzing on our screens. But meetings and calls are delayed all the time, soccer practices get rained out.Take advantage of the things that can bend. Use found time wisely. Push things that can wait and let go of things that were never necessary in the first place. A successful day for me is when I ticked off all I had to do and yet still found time to squeeze in something I wanted, like completing a jigsaw puzzle on the floor with my kid.These are some ways I maneuver the complexities of motherhood and business ownership. Make them your own as you work to find an integrated, sustainable balance that allows you to pursue your professional ambitions without sacrificing precious moments with your children. It doesn't have to be a perfect balance; it's just about finding a rhythm that beats in time with your family. As we muscle through our multiple roles each day, the composite of our lives can become more prosperous and more fulfilling as we continue to grow stronger and more resilient in the effort.

80,What the Ivy League is Looking For in the Next Generation of Entrepreneurs,"Feb 9, 2024",Mary Banks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/what-the-ivy-leagues-looks-for-in-the-next-generation-of/468585,"
Many students today are keen to chart their entrepreneurial paths even before setting foot on a college campus. In fact, according to an EY Ripples and JA Worldwide survey, approximately 53% of people born between 1997 and 2007 desire to start their own businesses. Colleges and universities also recognize this preference shift and offer an environment to help students take off their entrepreneurial ventures either during or after college.Among these institutions, the Ivy Leagues emerge as a coveted option for students as a result of their attractive networking environments, access to resources and challenging courses. However, these educational powerhouses are extremely competitive, admitting only a fraction of the aspiring entrepreneurs. What sets apart those who make the cut? What characteristics of would-be entrepreneurs catch the eye of Ivy League admissions officers?As a former Columbia University admissions member, I can confidently say that the answer lies in a distinct set of qualities that transcends academic excellence. Here are the three traits actively sought by Ivy League schools in future entrepreneurs.



Related: 5 Books That Paved My Path to Entrepreneurial Success1. Ephemeral and genuine leadershipBeing an entrepreneur requires you to be a leader. In fact, leadership is a criterion most colleges want to see in their applicants, and most students will weave it one way or the other into their college essays. However, colleges can recognize when leadership is genuine.


Getting accepted into an elite school shouldn't be the sole driver behind your desire to be a leader because admissions officers will see through that. Instead, leadership should be a vital part of your identity and narrative. You must understand that true leadership requires dedication and consistency; it's a demanding endeavor that may not even be suited to everyone.Ivy League enthusiasts should start thinking early on about what they admire in leaders and how they can imbibe those traits through their unique actions. Embracing the role of a leader in everyday life — whether that is through community service, starting a club in school with a purpose or leading a research project — will make it easier to join the dots in your application.Remember, true leadership is an arduous journey; it compels us to push creative boundaries, step outside our comfort zone and question ourselves objectively while embracing diverse perspectives and making tough calls. Think of real-life examples when you consistently demonstrate that and talk about them genuinely.2. A commitment to othersBeyond the allure of substantial profits and lucrative careers, Ivy League education is profoundly shifting towards championing change. The spotlight is now on sustainability and positive impact, with these esteemed institutions anticipating a new breed of entrepreneurs driven not merely by financial gain but by a desire to effect meaningful change.


Ivy League schools now seek more than just promises of change through new businesses; they demand a demonstrated commitment that precedes the exceptional resources they can provide. It's about showcasing your dedication to impact, substantiated by tangible evidence of your proactive efforts even before your Ivy League journey begins. Whether through internships at similar businesses, starting and leading initiatives or engaging in relevant extracurricular activities, applicants are expected to embody a true commitment to effecting real-world change.So, the expectation is clear: demonstrate a track record of initiating change. While an Ivy League education can amplify your impact, it cannot instill the desire for change; that fire must already be within you. Ivy League applicants have long been promising to make real change in the world but are now holding our students accountable to these promises and asking how they've already begun to uphold them.Related: 4 Traits Every Leadership Team Should Invest In3. Diversity, equity and inclusionStudents hoping to join Ivy League business programs such as an MBA should be ready to lead in a new cultural environment with a genuine focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Despite facing some criticism, DEI is widely acknowledged as a crucial element of a thriving business, a principle strongly emphasized by esteemed MBA programs. Harvard Business School (HBS) educators assert that DEI is so integral to business success that they instruct students on ""how to negotiate the difference"" when organizations fall short in this regard. This commitment to DEI extends across all disciplines at HBS, including entrepreneurship, underscoring the importance of fostering more effective leadership through collaboration around diverse perspectives and experiences.


Similarly, Wharton is actively incorporating a focus on DEI and ESG, recognizing their significance across all business levels. Deputy Dean Nancy Rothbard proudly announced two new courses, DEI and ESG, at the undergrad and MBA levels in response to a student challenge to ""do more."" The new MBA mantra centers on preparing leaders for creating diverse, equitable and inclusive organizations. Stanford has always had a vibrant MBA focused on entrepreneurship and is at the forefront of implementing the DEI, socially responsible business model, including having dedicated centers for Black and Hispanic businesses. Columbia Business School, through the Eugene M. Lang Entrepreneurship Center, is adopting a green approach, encouraging students to explore the ""interface between business and society."" A new Climate Change and Business Program also reflects CBS' growing humanistic value.Suffice it to say, change is on the horizon, regardless of a small segment of society opposing the emphasis on DEI and socially responsible businesses in collegiate and corporate settings. The success of businesses and entrepreneurship hinges on aligning with the demographic makeup of their surroundings. Consequently, aspiring Ivy League MBA students must showcase their dedication to DEI, convey enthusiasm and articulate strategies for fostering inclusivity in their future enterprises.Final thoughtsAn Ivy League education can catapult your entrepreneurial journey to unprecedented heights. But gaining entry into these esteemed institutions demands more than mere lofty sentiments and ""someday"" assurances. Admissions officers expect to see authentic leadership and a demonstrated commitment to change, sustainability and DEI in the new generation of entrepreneurs. Ensure you genuinely embody these traits before stepping into the fiercely competitive league of the Ivies.

81,"If You Delay, You Will Be Defeated. Why Waiting Too Long to Design Your Strategy Will Lead to Failure","Feb 8, 2024",Clate Mask,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/entrepreneurs-dont-delay-heres-why-you-need-a-company/468772,"
If you're an entrepreneur, you probably understand all too well why many businesses fail to create a company strategy in the early days of their business. In that period, every day can feel like chaos. With hardly enough time to complete the bare minimum, how can business owners justify taking the time to kick around strategy ideas? Others fail to set a strategy out of fear, believing they might choose the wrong one or somehow box themselves in for years to come.After leading a business for 20+ years and working with countless entrepreneurs, I can empathize with the reasoning in both scenarios. But, if you're nodding your head to either, it's time we talk. Your delay in developing a strategic direction is already costing you and will cost you more as time goes by.Related: Why Combining Company Culture with Strategy is Necessary for Lasting Business Success



You need a company strategy — nowYour company strategy defines how you focus your resources to create a competitive advantage and win in the market. It's never too early to set your strategy, and as we just covered, many — if not most — entrepreneurs wait way too long to form this crucial foundation of the business.Here's the good news: when your company is young, your strategy can be rough and flexible. In fact, it should be. Everything is fluid in the first few years of business, and if you're too rigid, you'll struggle to adapt when things change. By defining your strategy and then adjusting it as the market and other elements demand it, you'll begin narrowing in on your niche.


Getting to your niche is essential to your success, and many entrepreneurs are surprised to learn it often takes around three years to nail it down. The best way to do so is by setting, revising and updating your strategy. It's also critical to share that strategy (and perhaps co-create it) with your team so they can understand and execute your vision.Related: The 5 Essentials for Aligning Your Budget With Your Business StrategySay no with clarityAnother part of getting to your niche as quickly as possible is saying no to the business you used to say yes to. Put another way, you need to be clear about who your ideal customers are and why you're serving them. Anyone who doesn't fit this criteria shouldn't become a customer.I understand the need to keep the lights on and meet payroll, so it's not lost on me why entrepreneurs often take any and every client they can get. But this ultimately does your business a disservice. Not only does it detract from your mission, but it also likely means you're working outside your area of expertise, so you won't do your best work, which means you won't get as many referrals… and on and on. The opportunity cost that comes with serving the wrong customer is high.


In my experience, working with a target client is ten times more valuable than working with somebody else. So, if you agree to take business that doesn't fit your ideal clientele, recognize you'll get a dime for every dollar you could get.Related: How to Establish a Sustainable Corporate Strategy That's Good for BusinessWho and whyIf you're unsure who your target customer is and are feeling a bit wrong-footed as you read this, you especially need a company strategy. Creating it will help you align internally and determine who you serve best. Even more importantly? It will help you hone in on why you're serving that customer.You should take your time and be thoughtful about setting your strategy. Here are three main steps I recommend as you begin the process.Step 1 - Establish the foundation of the company by articulating your company vision, which includes your:Purpose. A 5-15 word statement of why the company exists.Values. Comprise 3-7 prized characteristics that govern how your employees work.Mission. What the company will accomplish over the next three years — You can state this as ""we will achieve 95% customer retention within three years,"" followed by the quantitative success criteria you expect within the same timeframe.Step 2 - Establish your Company Strategy by articulating your:Target Market, Positioning and Brand Promise — who you're for and what you deliver.Competitive differentiation. The top three things that make you different and desirable.Core Competencies. The top 3-5 strengths you will focus on and leverage.Critical Issues. The top 3-5 issues you must solve to accomplish your mission.Goals. 3-year and annual goals, which you break down into quarters and months)Step 3 - Establish your daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual operating rhythm in terms of meetings to help you execute the strategy and avoid wandering off course. This might include a cadence like this:Daily. Quick team check-in to remove obstacles and maintain momentum.Weekly. Team meeting to cover one or two big topics and check in on goal progress.Monthly. Half-day team meeting, cover big topics, check progress, course correct.Quarterly. One-day offsite, check annual progress, set quarterly goals and priorities.Annual. Two days offsite, check Mission progress, set yearly goals, and align everyone.If you put off creating your company strategy, you'll lack cohesion internally, say yes to the wrong customers, fail to give your team members a compass to guide them and, ultimately, fail. The repercussions of operating without a strategy are that drastic. So, even if you think you can't carve out the time to lay this foundation, you must. It's one of the most important things you can do for your business, team and yourself.

82,"The Hidden Cost of Distractions, and How to Short-Circuit Them","Feb 8, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-cost-of-distractions-and-how-to-short-circuit-them/467840,"
On a Saturday afternoon in December, I was working on a puzzle with one of my sons. Every so often, he would get up, walk to the kitchen, open the cabinet and come back with a handful of pretzels. Upon returning, it would take him a few minutes to remember which section he was working on and which type of piece he was hunting for. Eventually, I poured some snacks into a bowl and brought them over.That puzzle got me thinking about attention and its effect on productivity. We can likely all agree that work happens better and more efficiently when our focus is concentrated on one task and isn't hampered by distractions. Intuitively, that makes sense, but in today's increasingly digital world, most of us tend to work like my hungry son — letting our minds wander whenever we're ""hungry,"" and not realizing the cognitive cost of task switching. What we need in response is a kind of life hack.As CEO of Jotform, I'm no stranger to the incessant buzz of notifications (whether emails, social media platform messages or other prompts), and I have learned that it requires more than a New Year's resolution to quiet them: it takes a concerted effort, and only truly works when done in conjunction with my team members. Happily, that process has produced strategies that I'm convinced can help others, but it's worthwhile, first, to take a closer look at what we lose every time we change what we're doing.



Related: 6 Common Reasons You Can't Get Anything Done at Work — And How to Change ThatThe costs of task-switchingAs intelligent as we think we are, our minds are simply not designed to follow multiple trains of thought simultaneously. Professor Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explained to The Guardian in 2022 that humans, in fact, are very single-minded, and with somewhat limited cognitive capacity. In reality, the human brain can only produce one or two thoughts at a time.


Put simply, multitasking (aka ""task switching"") — rapidly jumping from one endeavor to the next — comes at a cost. Computer scientist and author Cal Newport perhaps put it best when he observed that, ""Even negligible context shifts (switching focus from the task at hand to a different [one]) are productivity poison.""Time is the most obvious casualty, and you might be losing more than you realize. Gloria Mark, of the University of California, Irvine, detailed in a 2006 Gallup article that the average amount of time people spent on any single event before being interrupted or before switching was about three minutes. More shocking still was the revelation that it required an average of 23 minutes to return to the original task. (It's worth noting, too, that this research is more than 15 years old, and that digital tools and their inherent distractions have since become even more ingrained in our lives.)Related: Are You Wasting Your Time? The Multi-Venture Entrepreneur's Guide to Time ManagementBut even if a distraction doesn't cost you time — if you're somehow able to get back on track after reading that email or glancing at the DM — you'll likely work with greater stress and frustration. That's what Mark found in an empirical study of university students, conducted in conjunction with Berlin's Humboldt University Institute of Psychology.


Yet another cost of task-switching is performance, or as one Carnegie Mellon researcher memorably (if bluntly) put it, ""the distraction of an interruption [instant message while performing a cognitive test], combined with the brain drain of preparing for that interruption, made our test takers 20 percent dumber.""Adding an interesting twist to the research was that participants who were warned of a looming interruption, even one that never came, improved their performance by 43%. So, preparing for distractions and training to work through them can make the mind sharper.Related: 5 New Products That Help You Avoid Distractions at WorkTechniques for staying focusedShutting off notifications and putting away devices seems like an obvious and effective start advice, but it also runs counter to the collaborative nature of work today.


As Newport told the New York Times in 2023: ""I can't… log off the New York Times Slack channel and make myself more productive, because everyone else is using that as the way for coordinating work, and so we're all stuck there. The only way to get out of that suboptimal equilibrium is to completely change the way the organization collaborates.""Managers and execs, therefore, must make a coordinated effort to implement practices that allow for disconnection when people want to work without distraction, and they can do their part by setting an example. At Jotform, my team knows that I'm unavailable outside of regular office hours except for emergencies. They can email me at any hour, but with the knowledge that I likely won't read it until the morning. You could say that we practice an informal version of France's 2016 right to disconnect legislation (with versions passed in Spain, Italy, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the Philippines since then), which states in part that no one is prohibited from contacting colleagues outside of normal work hours, but no one will be sanctioned for not replying either.The takeaway here is that office hours are a great idea, and you don't have to be a college professor to implement them. Just as I schedule time for uninterrupted, creative work, I carve out an hour or so each day for calls and last-minute meetings. Colleagues can check my calendar and send requests during this designated time. In the morning, when I map out the day, I try to group busy work (like reviewing invoices, replying to emails and scheduling meetings) and tackle it during office hours.Related: 5 Ways to Decrease Interruptions and Increase Productivity


Getting sidetracked by distractions is almost unavoidable now: Algorithms are continually improving and designed to both steal attention and keep it. But take heart: even if you lose focus, it's possible to get back on track. That effort can even help boost productivity, albeit with a bit more stress. The key is preparing yourself for interruptions and minimizing them to the extent possible. By grouping the work that requires short spans of focus, we can leave larger swaths of time for more meaningful work — tasks that fill you up in terms of purpose and pride.

83,Tough Feedback Can Really Sting. Here's How to Take It With Grace and Turn It Into Power.,"Feb 8, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-take-tough-feedback-with-grace-and-turn-it-into-power/468431,"
It's performance appraisal season, and that means many of us will soon be getting essential feedback. While much advice exists about how to give tough feedback, there seems to be less instruction on how to receive it. Yet receiving critical feedback gracefully (then figuring out how to learn from it or apply it) is a hallmark of successful professionals.Relationships flourish and thrive when participants can both deliver and accept critical feedback, so this is a crucial skill to develop. Receiving tough feedback well isn't just about ""taking it,"" either. Successful professionals carefully navigate these conversations with poise and master these moments. Here's how I've seen them do it.Related: If Your Leadership Style Is Ever Judged By Others, Here's 8 Things You Should Do



1. Start by recognizing that feedback is a gift and express gratitudeMany of us have had a boss who gave us little (or no) feedback. If we're getting any feedback, even negative feedback, we're already better off than those who get none. It takes time and can be hard work for others to give us feedback, so if we're receiving it, there's a good chance the feedback provider cares about us and wants to help us develop and grow.Giving critical feedback can be uncomfortable; many people worry about how it will be received. So, take time to say ""thank you"" and express how much you appreciate the candor and honesty. This ensures your audience will give you feedback again and that means you'll always know where you stand with them. As tough as it might be to hear negative things about yourself, you can't grow or evolve without that kind of information, so remember that being able to absorb this kind of information sets you up for future success.


2. Ask for more informationWe must understand the feedback we're getting. If you're being coached on some aspect of your behavior, it's helpful to get specific examples of it, because then you'll know exactly what to change. You can ask for more information in an inviting and friendly way. You can start by saying that your goal is to grow and develop, so you'd like to learn more about your behavior and how it comes across to others.Having specific examples allows you to think back on the moments in question and make self-discoveries. Perhaps you were viewed as curt or rude on a day you fought with your spouse before coming to work. Perhaps you were viewed as short or abrupt in a meeting that coincided with a major deadline on another project. Getting specific details allows you to make sense of the feedback as you digest it. Perhaps you've got blind spots, but it's also possible others are missing information, too.Related: Why You Should Ditch the Sandwich Method When You Give Feedback3. Sit on itOftentimes, the decisions we regret most are the ones we make in the heat of the moment. Almost always, we choose better when we allow ourselves some space to think about how we want to respond. Before you jump to conclusions and decide the feedback you've received is unfair, take some time to process what you heard. Ask yourself: ""Is it possible there's any truth to this?""


Also, recognize that people are allowed to interpret and experience you differently than you experience yourself. Sort through what parts of the feedback, if any, really do feel unfair to you and what parts could be valid. Expect and understand that new and unexpected feedback can sometimes hurt. Remember it's okay to feel hurt by someone else's words.As part of your reflection, consider the source and intent behind the feedback. If you decide the feedback is coming from someone who routinely mistreats, disrespects or verbally abuses you, you'll probably decide to ignore it or pull back from the relationship. But, if you feel that the feedback came from someone who has your best interests at heart and cares for you, it might be worthwhile to pause and absorb it, even when it stings. If the feedback is coming from your boss, remember that their wisdom and years of experience might put them in a position to see things you can't yet (but will someday).4. Prepare for a follow-up conversationOnce you've had time to process your initial reactions, it can make sense to go back and continue the conversation, especially if this is a relationship you want to continue (or must continue) and you feel confused or misunderstood. Perhaps you feel portions of the feedback are incorrect or unfair. Getting a chance to say so (respectfully) will give you psychological oxygen. You can start by saying, ""I've spent some time thinking about what you said, and I hope it's okay I share what my intentions were and/or what my perspective is now.""It's critical to be respectful and kind as you share what you've thought about the feedback and see things differently. Sharing that you wanted to speak up because it felt important to be honest and truthful about your viewpoints can help your audience not feel attacked or dismissed.


Related: The Simple Question Great Leaders Ask People Every Day5. Come to an agreement on next stepsEspecially if you see the feedback differently, you must work to come to an agreement on what should happen next. You might ask, ""What would you like me to do differently so we're not in this situation again?"" or ""What can I/we do to resolve this?"" If you care about the relationship, others need to know that you value their opinions and are open to change. As part of this process, you might also have a few asks of your own. Perhaps you ask your friend to be more patient when you're a few minutes late or ask your boss to give you more notice when assigning last-minute projects.Getting critical feedback isn't often fun, but if you practice these five steps, you'll find it doesn't have to be a terrible experience and you don't need to walk away licking your wounds.

84,Terminating an Employee? These Are the Legal Ins and Outs You Need to Know,"Feb 7, 2024",Mital Makadia,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/terminating-an-employee-dont-make-these-legal-mistakes/468746,"
Insubordination. IP disclosure. Misconduct. Breach of restrictive covenant.All of these are legitimate reasons to fire someone, but what do HR managers and business owners need to know about the legal technicalities surrounding employment termination?Components of a legal terminationTo avoid legal issues post-termination, it's important to understand the main components of a lawful employment termination.



Make sure you identify any required paperwork to provide to the employee under state or local law. For example, in California, employees must be provided a certain form of Notice of Change in Employment Relationship as well as a pamphlet about unemployment benefits at the time of termination.Check your state's termination paycheck rules. You might have to pay your employee on the date of termination or within a certain time thereafter, despite your normal payroll cycle.Identify any legal risks in connection with the termination. For example, is the employee a member of a protected class? Have they been a whistleblower?If the termination is for performance or other ""cause"" termination, have you documented the performance issues? Has there been progressive discipline of some sort, or will this be a surprise to the employee? These are important questions because firings for performance should not be a surprise to the employee; an employee should be on notice of the performance issues and be given a chance to improve. This protects the company if the employee alleges wrongful termination. It also helps with morale; employees won't want to stay if they think they may be terminated out of the blue.Always have a witness in a termination meeting, which may benefit the company in the event of litigation. In most cases, the witness should not be a lawyer. This is to prevent that lawyer from becoming a witness in the lawsuit, which could present an issue for attorney-client privilege reasons.Related: How to Fire an Employee: 4 Ways to Make the Process KinderWhat not to say during a terminationWhile there's no guidebook for all of the things to say — and not to say — during a termination, there are some guidelines that an HR manager or business owner should heed.


Termination discussions should be short. Less is more in this case.Don't ramble on about the reasons for the termination. Don't talk about other employees; if the termination is a layoff, don't explain whose employment status is safe or why. Don't get into an argument or long exchange. Be respectful but firm.The gray areas of legal terminationA broader, more objective viewHR and legal professionals can have a broader, more objective view of terminations that are important to the company, which can help to mitigate risk. For example, a hiring manager might opt for layoffs or otherwise terminate some employees because those employees are having a harder time adapting to new software. However, this can often end up in terminating mostly older employees. It's important to think about whether there's an age discrimination issue. It's also worth considering whether the manager needs to be counseled on how to better train these employees.


High-risk termination situationsIt behooves HR managers and business owners to protect themselves from getting into high-risk termination situations. Therefore, it's important to have policies in place for documenting employment issues and progressive discipline; this can serve as a written record to support termination. This is especially helpful in situations where an employee in a protected class or situation is to be terminated. For example, you need to terminate an employee who is going on maternity leave. If their performance issues are documented, and if there was a process of progressive discipline, a company will be better prepared for an employment claim.Effective and legal use of severance agreementsSeverance agreements can be invaluable in terms of mitigating the risk of lawsuits, but the law around them changes rapidly. Don't reuse forms, and do be sure to work with a lawyer who knows current employment law at both the state and federal levels.


Related: 11 Tips for Firing an EmployeeRepercussions of unlawful terminationFailure to comply with final paycheck laws can lead to wage claims and penalties.Failure to comply with proper paperwork required by state and local law can lead to fines.Failure to document employment performance issues and engage in progressive discipline can make the company vulnerable to wrongful termination lawsuits. For example, if someone who just asked for a disability accommodation has been terminated, but the HR manager claims it's for performance reasons, a jury is unlikely to believe the manager if those performance problems weren't previously documented.


Failure to identify whether there are risks to termination can lead to making nonoptimal termination decisions. If you see that there is a high chance of an employee bringing a wrongful termination claim, you can better prepare in terms of offering severance or perhaps delaying termination while establishing a better documentation process.The bottom lineAs a business owner or HR manager, it's inevitable that you will have to terminate employees. Keeping these considerations in mind can help to protect you and your company in the long run.

86,"Crisis at 30,000 Feet: Grading the CEO Responses to Boeing's Mid-Flight Blowout","Feb 7, 2024",Christopher Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/crisis-management-lessons-from-boeings-mid-flight-blowout/469305,"
On January 5th, 2024, an alarming incident involving an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 necessitated an emergency landing due to a cabin blowout. This placed Boeing and its airline partners United Airlines and Alaska Airlines under intense scrutiny. Company CEOs Dave Calhoun, Scott Kirby, and Ben Minicucci each navigated their companies through challenging times with distinct approaches, focusing on safety, quality, and strategic adaptation. In the following analysis, Miguel Aponte and I explore the actions taken in response to the crisis, highlighting their leadership in addressing immediate concerns while eyeing long-term objectives.Related: 10 Strategies for Businesses to Navigate and Thrive in Times of CrisisDave Calhoun, CEO of BoeingActions Taken:Engagement with U.S. Senators: Met with senators to discuss the 737 MAX 9 grounding and address regulatory concerns.Quality Assurance Stand-Down: Implemented a temporary pause in production to focus on quality checks and employee training.Public Commitment to Quality Improvements: Announced initiatives to enhance quality control processes at Boeing.Communication with Customers: Proactive outreach to airline customers to discuss issues and reassure them of Boeing's commitment to resolving problems.Internal Review and Employee Engagement: Solicited ideas from employees for quality improvements and initiated an internal review process. Sent a letter to staff saying, ""[he was] deeply sorry for the significant disruption and frustration for our customers.""Motivations and Impact:Calhoun's actions are geared towards damage control, restoring confidence in Boeing's aircraft, and addressing safety concerns from regulators, customers, and the public. The engagement with senators and quality assurance initiatives are aimed at demonstrating Boeing's proactive approach to resolving the issues. However, these actions have led to production delays and financial impacts but are crucial for long-term trust and reliability.Related: 4 Smart Strategies for Safeguarding Your Business and Brand Reputation in a CrisisScott Kirby, CEO of United AirlinesActions Taken:Public Criticism of Boeing: Voiced disappointment in Boeing's handling of the situation.Exploring Alternative Fleet Plans: Indicated openness to considering other manufacturers for future fleet needs.Internal Fleet Planning Adjustments: Removed Boeing MAX 10 jets from internal planning, indicating a shift in fleet strategy.Direct Communication with Boeing: Held discussions with Boeing's CEO to express frustration and seek solutions.Motivations and Impact:Kirby's primary goal is to ensure United Airlines' operational reliability and financial stability. His public criticism and consideration of alternatives signal a strategic shift and put pressure on Boeing to address the issues more effectively. These actions also safeguard United's interests, offering flexibility in fleet management and potentially leveraging better terms with Boeing or alternatives with competitors like Airbus.Ben Minicucci, CEO of Alaska AirlinesActions Taken:Blaming Boeing for Financial Losses: Publicly held Boeing responsible for the $150 million loss due to the grounding.Expressing Anger and Frustration: Voiced strong emotions about the blowout incident on Alaska Airlines flight.Future Fleet Planning Considerations: Suggested the possibility of reevaluating the airline's relationship with Boeing.Demanding Higher Quality Aircraft: Called for Boeing to produce better planes and address manufacturing challenges.Motivations and Impact:Minicucci is focused on mitigating financial losses and operational disruptions for Alaska Airlines. By publicly blaming Boeing, he seeks to hold the manufacturer accountable and potentially negotiate compensation or better terms. His actions also reflect a commitment to safety and operational excellence, signaling to both the public and Boeing the airline's priorities and expectations.Evaluating the ResponsesIn this intricate scenario, each CEO's actions reflect a strategic response to protect and advance their company's interests amid Boeing's 737 MAX 9 crisis. Dave Calhoun's focus is on restoring Boeing's reputation and ensuring long-term viability through quality improvements and regulatory compliance. Scott Kirby and Ben Minicucci are primarily concerned with maintaining operational stability, financial health, and safety standards, demonstrating a willingness to adapt their strategies, including considering alternatives to Boeing if necessary. These actions collectively underscore the intricate dynamics within the aviation industry, where safety, reliability, financial considerations, and strategic relationships play crucial roles in decision-making processes at the highest levels.Related: A Guide to Effective Crisis Leadership — Key Steps to Lead Your Team Through Turbulent TimesWhat Leaders Can LearnAll CEOs involved have shown commendable leadership amidst challenges. CEOs need to be publicly vocal and demonstrate they care about the companies and businesses they represent. That being said, there is room for improvement on every party's end. Dave Calhoun needs to focus on increasing transparency to rebuild trust more effectively. Prioritizing safety and proactive future planning could secure Boeing's competitive edge in the long term. Within the last two decades, Boeing has been in the spotlight for tragedies involving MAX 8 planes. Dave must ensure they build planes that are up to standard. Scott Kirby has shown a willingness to adapt to crises showing his interests are what is best for United. To build upon this, improving communication with customers about safety measures could further strengthen brand loyalty for customers. Additionally, diversifying United's fleet would mitigate any dependency on Boeing. Ben Minicucci too has shown adaptation in the crisis and was critical of Boeing. Continuing the conversation of building safer, better planes will lead to safer flying throughout the aviation industry. Re-evaluating the choice of planes for Alaska Airline's fleet is an important decision that can lead to more growth opportunities in the future.

87,Fear Can Hold Us Back – But It Can Also Drive Us Forward. Here's How to Turn Fear Into Fuel.,"Feb 6, 2024",Mohammad Farraj,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/fear-can-hold-us-back-but-it-can-also-drive-us-forward/468284,"
Fear is one of the most natural emotions. In fact, according to Medical News Today, ""The fear response has kept us alive. It is primal, and we should respect it. At the same time, it can be unpleasant and interfere with people's day-to-day functioning.""It often holds entrepreneurs back from pursuing their dreams and ambitions — according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 75% of all ventures fail within their first decade. However, fear should not be the reason that any business fails. Fear can be rooted in a combination of stress and anxiety, which can become a serious mental health issue.To overcome the stress of fears and find success, detach emotions from decision-making. Be rational and focused when choosing a business and planning for success. Though challenging, my experience in starting a business offers insights. Confidence in tasks eases stress. As a new restaurateur, immersing myself in business tasks boosted my confidence and expanded my skills — and it can help you, too.



Related: 11 Fears Every Entrepreneur Must OvercomeHow I balance work and lifeI recall hearing a folk song from the '60s that said, ""Our life is more than our work, and our work is more than our job."" That is exponentially true for me, as the co-founder of a restaurant franchise, as a physician and as a husband and father.


It is important to separate all of our several ""selves,"" compartmentalize them and give each of them the attention they deserve, while attending to the needs and desires of those we care about: our spouses, children, colleagues and in my case, the co-founder of my business.Here are three ways I compartmentalize:When you are at work, be focused on work — request that family and friends only communicate when there's an emergency during work time. The new iPhone voicemail screening feature can help you avoid distracting interruptions.When you are at home, be present with your family — that might mean no devices at the dinner table.When you are out with friends, be a friend — listen, share and enjoy their company.One of the most challenging periods of my entrepreneurial journey was in the early days of launching my food truck, while simultaneously pursuing my degree in dental school and caring for my family.The truck had just begun gaining some traction in the local community. Juggling truck responsibilities, dental exams and family life was challenging. Balancing fresh ingredients, academic deadlines and family time felt like a daily tightrope walk. Despite the difficulty in compartmentalizing tasks, focusing on achieving balance allowed me to succeed. It's normal to feel you could have done more, no matter how hard you try to fulfill all duties.

Technology Is Sucking Your Time Away from Your Success Putting the ""I"" in teamChances are, if you started a business, you began by identifying your personal strengths and weaknesses and assigned yourself a role in the organization chart for your new business that you had confidence you can master. Setting myself up for success as much as possible, I chose to delve deeper into the marketing aspect of the business while allowing my partner to focus on his strength in operations.Discovering oneself in the business realm involves:Self-reflection: Entrepreneurs benefit from deep self-reflection to identify strengths, values and passions. Crafting a bio for our website forced me to delve into my core.Self-care: Entrepreneurs often neglect self-care, but it's crucial to take mental and physical breaks when under pressure. A brief walk around the block helps manage stress effectively.Self-scheduling: Act as your own best boss by scheduling dedicated ""me time"" daily. Harvard Business Review emphasizes the importance of giving yourself permission for self-care. I use this time for creative tasks, forming a great creative team with me, myself and I.Related: 8 Self-Care Tips from Wildly Successful Entrepreneurs


Getting help when fear of failure becomes anxietyThe three fears all new entrepreneurs share are:Fear of financial lossFear of failureFear of the unknownIn launching my franchise restaurant, I conquered financial fear by investing only what I could afford to lose. Despite the daunting prospect of using my personal credit card amid student loan pressures, clear vision and strategic planning allowed me to decide confidently. Alternatively, you can explore options like applying for a small business loan, providing a lump sum to be repaid over time.There are three basic ways to combat the generic fear of failure all entrepreneurs face:Get real: Confronting failure as a very real possibility is the way to avoid it. What we did was identify all possible causes that could lead failure, then reverse-engineered them — that means do what needs to be done by understanding exactly what not to do.Make a plan: A comprehensive, well-structured plan can instill confidence and help mitigate fears by outlining strategies and contingencies. For example, my goals as chief marketing officer included innovating our social media and furthering its growth to increase our audience reach. I looked to improve our Google metrics.Ask around: Seek guidance from mentors, advisors or experienced entrepreneurs. Start with your current network first. While I had brothers and a father who have started and ran successful business, I would never hesitate to ask for advice and help. Reach out to the local chapters of SCORE, the SBA or your chamber of commerce. Related: Getting Over the Fear of Being an Entrepreneur


The key to overcoming fear in starting a new business is to recognize that while fear can hold us back, it can also drive us forward. Research has shown that fear of failure can also motivate greater striving for success. However, combatting the more serious mental health challenges of entrepreneurial stress requires emotional fortitude and often, professional help.

88,Inside Potbelly's Recipe for Fast Casual Success,"Feb 5, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/inside-potbellys-recipe-for-fast-casual-success/469067,"
Have you had a Potbelly's sandwich? If you live in America, chances are you have. They're in 32 states, have over 400 locations and they're fantastic. On this episode of The CEO Series, I broke bread with Potbelly CEO Bob Wright and got his secret recipe for this national powerhouse franchise's success.Below are some highlights of that conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. Watch the full video above.On being a CEO""I've had a lot of jobs in my career, and I think the best part about being a CEO is bringing all of that experience together, but still focused on the same exact thing. One of my mentors warned me that being the CEO can be lonely, and in fact, he gave me good advice to find others in similar positions who you can connect with and turn to. I trust the leaders on my team. I love engaging with my senior leadership team. They're the smartest and the best in the business. But everyone is looking to the CEO to have a leadership position and to have a thought about the vision, the strategy, or the decisions of the day.""



Related: Avoid These 3 Key Mistakes for Team Success in 2024On his business beginnings""The summer after my freshman year in college, I wanted a job that summer that would pay me not only a wage but give a chance to earn tips. And I must not have been cut it waiting tables because I tried for almost a month. I walked into a Domino's in Houston and asked if they were hiring. The guy asked me if I had blue pants. So I think that was my interview! I told him I did (which was a lie actually) and he said, 'All right, see you back here at four o'clock.' So I went to the mall and bought blue pants and started working at Domino's and I was there for 12 years. I didn't realize that taking opportunities that were presented to you could be as valuable as they could be if you were just willing to take the chance.""


The secret of Potbelly's success""We sit right in the sweet spot of the fast-casual consumer with this amazing differentiated menu of sandwiches that are hot and toasted at 500 degrees, as well as soups and salads made fresh when you order them. Our cookies are the best on the planet. Our sugar cookie is better than anyone I've ever had in my life. I've been a fan of this brand for 20 years and have always thought that it had great potential. It's got great heritage, too.""Related: With Over $120 Million in Sales, Dude Wipes Is No Joke. Here's How the Company's Chief Executive Dude Keeps Things Fun and Profitable.On trends in fast casual dining""I'd say some of it has its roots in the pandemic, but fast casual is clearly where the consumer is going. Higher quality, more value for the money, and more flexibility and opportunity to use that brand in the way that fits your life. Sure, people are going out, sitting down around a table, getting waiter service and so on. But fast casual is where all the massive growth is because that's where the consumer is.""On learning""I love to read biographies of people that have been accomplished, have been great leaders, have been founders of our country. I thought David McCullough was a fascinating writer — Truman, 1776, those were, those were awesome books. I think you learn more from watching than from being told. And biographies are a way for us to watch what other people have done.""

89,How to Streamline Your Digital Ecosystem and Make Workdays Easier,"Feb 3, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-streamline-your-digital-ecosystem/467685,"
I vividly remember when Microsoft rolled out Windows 95. Designed to actually look like a desktop, with icons for the Recycle Bin, Briefcase, Inbox and other functions, it felt revolutionary, a boon for productivity as well as operations and logistics, and above all, user-friendly. And that innovation was market-proven: Microsoft product designer at the time, Juliette Weiss, noted in a 2017 article for Medium, ""It was the most heavily user-tested product in [the company's] history.""In those days, it made sense to treat a computer workspace more or less like your home or office desktop — to regularly clean and organize it just as you would its physical facsimile. But today, with cloud computing and an endless number of automated tools and apps, the digital/physical workspace analogy doesn't quite hold up. Organizing your 21st-century ecosystem isn't just a matter of implementing a smart filing system, but about choosing the right tools and building intuitive systems, then continually refining and updating them. Harvard Business Review summed it up well in an article published more than a decade ago: ""Our job today and tomorrow,"" it read in part, ""isn't to organize ourselves better; it's to get the right technologies that respond to our personal productivity needs.""At Jotform, my team and I rely on a multitude of tools and platforms for personal work and collaboration and streamlining them has helped us to reduce friction, increase output and both grow and scale without a dime of outside funding.

90,Meta Warns Investors That Mark Zuckerberg's Love of Extreme Sports Could Kill Him,"Feb 2, 2024",Peter Kafka,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/investors-warned-of-mark-zuckerbergs-love-of-extreme-sports/469224,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. After a rough couple of years, Meta is flying: Revenue is growing again, profits are way up after some painful belt-tightening, and its stock is at a record high.What could possibly go wrong?Well, maybe Mark Zuckerberg, its CEO, could get hurt, or worse, in a cage match?That's what Meta is suggesting in a new Securities and Exchange Commission filing out this week. In the company's newest annual report, it told investors that Zuckerberg routinely did risky stuff for fun — and that it would be a real problem for the company if he got injured doing that.



From Meta's 10-K, filed under ""risk factors"":We currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg. Mr. Zuckerberg and certain other members of management participate in various high-risk activities, such as combat sports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of serious injury and death.Meta is presumably referring to Zuckerberg's well-documented embrace of all kinds of brotastic fun, including mixed martial arts, hydrofoiling, and CrossFit. He has also been training to get his pilot license, The Information reported.And he has gotten banged up along the way: Last year, he tore his ACL in a training fight.


Zuckerberg certainly isn't the only tech mogul who likes this stuff. His rival Elon Musk, for instance, flies himself around all the time, and he famously challenged Zuckerberg to a cage match (which some people insisted was going to be a real thing but never panned out).But he may be the only Big Tech CEO who's spelled that out as a problem for investors.Musk's Tesla, for instance, simply points out that the company is ""highly dependent"" on his services and doesn't mention the prospect of him crashing one of his Gulfstreams. (It does, however, say that Musk ""does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla"" because he's also running SpaceX, X, and other ventures.)Peers such as Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon either say that their CEOs are important or don't even mention them.Meta reps did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Zuckerberg basically did, by responding to a post about the 10-K filing on Threads:  Post by @zuckView on ThreadsIt's worth pointing out that while the ""risk factor"" section of any public company can be useful to scan, since it lays out all kinds of problems that could arise, it usually is not the kind of thing most investors care about. The point is to insulate the company from liability in case something does go wrong: ""See? We told you this could happen. Now tell your lawyers to stop bothering us.""So while Meta does take Zuckerberg's well-being very seriously — in 2022, it spent $15 million on personal security for him and his family — it's unlikely it thinks he's going to get really, really hurt. But they're letting us it could happen, just in case.

91,"You Work, You Work (and You Work), Yet You're Still Not Getting Everything Done — Here's 6 Ways to Handle Your Overwhelming Workload","Feb 2, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/6-ways-to-handle-an-overwhelming-workload/468526,"
The world of entrepreneurship is more fast-paced than ever. In my case, I spearhead my own PR agency, run a household of five kids and serve on several boards in addition to some volunteer and pro bono work. Between the narrow and infrequent slits in my schedule, I try to squeeze in time for my own interests and hobbies just to keep myself sane.As much as I relish being a girl boss, it's a constant juggling act of managing multiple responsibilities — overseeing operations, nurturing client relationships and staying ahead of industry trends — and the workload can quickly become beyond daunting. As a result, work-life balance becomes a distant dream, and burnout looms large on the horizon.A few months ago, I collapsed on the couch at 11 p.m. and told my husband, ""I can't handle the load right now."" So we talked about what I could do — change or reframe — to make the unmanageable manageable.



Here are six tactics to control time and work demands that are spinning out of control.Related: 5 Signs That You're Overworking Your Employees


1. Know your clockIt would be great if we were all programmed to rise at dawn, peacefully meditate for 15 minutes, work straight through at an incredible pace for five hours until lunch and then return to the desk after a 30-minute break for another amazingly productive run until five o'clock sharp. Is that what your day looks like? I didn't think so.Over the years, I couldn't help but learn my own ""work efficiency clock"" — the hours I'm most tuned in and prone to productivity (not to mention relatively free of household duties). For me, these spans are 8 to 11:30 a.m., 1 to 4 p.m., then 7 to 10 p.m. What are your ""kickass hours"" when you feel ready to conquer the world (or at least your inbox)? When you structure your tasks around your own biological rhythm and daily routine instead of the other way around, your natural energy level will better fuel you and your mental acuity will better drive you.2. Set an intention for the dayI know, I know, you have a dozen or more goals each day. I do too. But I discovered that if I notate in my planner the one thing that must get done the following day, the one task that will free my mind and my desk the most, the rest of my day feels remarkably fulfilling, and I lay my head on the pillow that night with a sigh of contentment.Examples to get you thinking: One day, I pledged to make at least three outreach calls on leads I got for new clients. I hit my mark by 11 a.m. and almost danced to the kitchen to make a salad. Another day, I promised myself I'd finally clean out and reorganize the files in Google Drive. Needless to say, when I accomplished this in one day, I felt driven!


I implore you to try this. It's unbelievably liberating to know you met your intention for your workday — everything after that is just gravy!3. Follow the two-minute ruleDavid Allen's proposal in his book Getting Things Done has become a universally adopted tactic because it works. And my guess is it works because it's simple. All you have to do is knock out any two-minute-or-under task right when you're thinking about it, which eradicates procrastination and elevates productivity. Send the Zoom invite, sign and return the contract and make the appointment with your tax accountant. Done, done, done.Yes, there are various interpretations of how to apply this rule, but the bottom line is really all that matters. If you can check something off your to-do list in two minutes flat, crank out a few items 1, 2, 3 … and then see how quickly and happily you move on to the more time-consuming 4, 5 and 6.Related: 8 Ways Successful People Beat Procrastination


4. Cluster tasksIn the field of education, ""clustering"" entails grouping specific and similar topics and skills into time-based units to enhance learning acquisition and absorption. Here, I'm applying the term to tackling like activities together, which carries such advantages as using the same tools/apps for a series of related tasks, having the minimum number of windows open on your screen at the same time and staying in the same cognitive lane for a stretch, which improves focus.For example, instead of dedicating time to one client at a time, I've transitioned to dedicating a chunk of time to one job function for all my clients at a time. The quarterly Statements of Work I prepare — they're now all done in one fell swoop while the template is open on my desktop. Employee reviews — I do three or four in one sitting while my mind is in ""staff mode"" to keep my thoughts aligned and set in one pattern.5. Never go to bed antsyNo, that's not a typo for ""angry."" Instead of your parents' advice for a good marriage, this is my advice to have a good day. To implement this advice, let's return to your to-do list. At some point in the day (or, for a lot of us, at night), you simply have to let the day be done. You have to accept that you accomplished all you could, that you're not a superhero who's able to check off every single item, every single day.Put the desktop to sleep, turn out the office light, close the laptop and silence the phone. You don't have to ""let it go""; you just have to ""let it be."" Except in the case of a real emergency, there's hardly anything that can't wait until tomorrow. Tucking the kids into bed is more important than pumping out one more email.


Related: 7 Productivity Hacks for 20246. Experiment with time blocking and time boxingSimilar though different, these two time management techniques are all the rage — probably to stanch the flow of people raging about how little time they have! In any case, the basic concept is to organize your schedule around which tasks to complete in a block and exactly how long to spend on that block.At my firm, this not only means assigning content creation for Client A, Client B and Client C for 1.5 hours each in consecutive order, but it also means breaking my week into designated days for different teams. I've recently decided to devote Monday and Friday to my staff duties and Tuesday through Thursday exclusively to my clients. Not only that, but I'm now scheduling weekly 10-minute one-on-one sessions with each team member on those ""bookend"" days, always at the same with each employee, for maximum consistency and reliable structuring.In a sense, all the strategies above are about allocating your time and energy into chunks in ways that will work best for your particular workflow, obligations and lifestyle. So experiment with different configurations by setting a timer to see how long certain tasks normatively take to establish a launching-off point and consider allocating particular tasks to particular days of the week. It's working for me — I hope it'll work for you too!

92,3 Tips to Actually Stick to Your New Year's Resolutions in 2024,"Feb 2, 2024",Rob Volpe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-tips-to-actually-stick-to-your-new-years-resolutions-in/468228,"
There are plenty of articles out there telling us that we aren't going to make it when it comes to New Year's resolutions; that the data is against us. Just like nearly half of all small businesses exit before five years, most of us won't be able to keep our resolutions for more than one month and only 9% of Americans who make resolutions actually complete them. It's enough to make us wonder, ""Why bother?""This is not one of those articles.What if this year were different? What if, in 2024, we were able to stick to a resolution to create a positive change in our business? What would that feel like once we achieved it?



First, let's get the negative stuff out of the way. It's true that the further away we get from the holiday cheer, the harder it is to maintain our resolutions for the new year. Often, we've set a BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) that's misaligned with reality and it would require us to be a different person, team or company to succeed.Since ""comparison is the thief of joy,"" let's stop trying to be something we're not and instead take a different approach where we set intentions based on our understanding of who we are and what's realistic.


Related: Why Your New Year's Resolutions Won't Work Unless You Stop Doing These 4 ThingsSet intentions, not resolutionsIf I were able to keep my resolutions, I'd have been a billionaire 20 years ago. Not because I set a resolution to get rich — that'd be a real BHAG — but if the resolutions I made were achieved and had the desired effect, it would have paid dividends many times over. But the world doesn't work that way.The etymology of the word ""resolution"" starts with breaking something down to a finite point — to resolve a puzzle, for example. There's a firmness and finality to it. Once a puzzle is solved, that's it. There's no room for interpretation or external forces. If a piece of a jigsaw puzzle goes missing because the dog ate it, we're unable to complete the puzzle. We've failed.""Intention"" comes from Latin words meaning ""to stretch"" and ""aim,"" ""design,"" ""will"" and ""wish."" The malleability inherent in these words seems more fitting. It provides space for adaptation to the external forces impeding our progress.


What got in the way of making my first billion dollars? Plenty of things. First, the inability to effectively change my habits because I had set a BHAG. Second was external forces beyond my control. Clients change priorities, economies recede and uncertainty in markets exists because of current events. In fall of 2001, I was living in New York City and running a small consultancy practice. All my new business leads dried up after 9/11. Businesses didn't know what to do next. The shock of the attacks was beyond disruptive and traumatic. Burning through my savings, it came time for me to ""return to the warm embrace of a large corporation,"" which I did, joining what was then Kraft Foods for a couple of years while the world righted itself.If I had kept a fixed mindset instead of being flexible through intention, I would be facing the feeling of failure. A negative result is hard enough without negative self-talk from resolutions unmet. An intention can morph and adapt based on the external. Shifting from a fixed mindset of resolutions to a growth mindset of intention will be beneficial in many ways, especially in the chaotic business environment of 2024. High interest rates, two wars, societal queasiness from culture wars and upcoming elections have created uncertainty. No matter what we resolve to do to drive growth, manage spending or make smart investments, there's little to do other than buckle our seat belts. Intentions give us the adaptability to thrive in uncertain times.Related: 8 New Year's Business Resolutions That Will Keep You EnergizedUnderstand the cause of the behavior you seek to changeToo often, we focus on the fix instead of the root cause. While that might get us out of a jam, it won't prevent it from repeating in the future. Many people resolve to do something differently while ignoring the ""muscle memory"" and neural pathways established from having done it the old way a million times in the past.


What's required is a combination of self-awareness and then self-empathy. Self-awareness is recognition of the behavior we seek to change while self-empathy goes a layer deeper and helps us decode the cause behind the behavior. Understanding what has led to the behavior will ultimately help us adjust it.For example, when I was in a business development role, I once set an intention to increase the sales that I generated. Instead of willing myself to make more calls, take more meetings and let that drive the sales, I took a step back to examine my past patterns and what needed to change. Doing that, I realized I tended to reach out to the clients that I was friendliest with, rather than the ones I hadn't talked to in a while. I wasn't casting a net as wide as I could.Going a little deeper to understand that behavior, it didn't take long to realize that I was staying in a comfort zone instead of applying a more strategic approach to who I connected with and when. Once I had that self-empathy, the behavior was easier to change as I was able to shift my perspective to self-motivate and talk myself through my discomfort.As we move into self-empathy, keep these five steps in mind — dismantle judgment, including negative self-talk; ask good questions of yourself; actively listen to what's coming up; integrate into understanding, what we discover doesn't make us weird or wrong, it provides more information to work with; use solution imagination to identify how to create the behavior change that will last.


Related: How to Get Back on Track With Your New Year's Resolutions (It's Not Too Late!)Have grace with yourself and othersContrary to some managers' beliefs and models of productivity, we're not robots. That means that we won't make progress in a straight line, nor will we be perfect every time we execute the behavior we intend to change.It's okay. We are human. Making mistakes is how we learn and grow. Make space for that growth.Even if it is a few weeks into a new intention and it's feeling tenuous or there's been a slip, avoid the self-flagellation. Instead of getting down or giving up, turn it around and consider what adjustments can be made to revive the intention, pick it back up or start afresh and keep going. After all, there are 52 weeks in a year and we're just at the beginning.

        Troy Rohrbaugh joined JPMorgan in 2005 and helped turn around the bank's foreign-exchange business.

One industry recruiter said Troy Rohrbaugh's background as a risk manager could make him a strong C-Suite contender.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. A longtime JPMorgan executive who has kept a low public profile while cultivating a reputation as a successful trader with a talent for managing risk is emerging as a contender to succeed Jamie Dimon as chief executive.Dimon, the longest-tenured Wall Street CEO, has not revealed plans to retire, though the financial industry has speculated on his succession planning and the people most likely to replace him for more than a decade.



Troy Rohrbaugh was named co-CEO of JPMorgan's commercial and investment bank, known as the CIB, as part of an internal executive reshuffle JPMorgan announced last week. CIB is a sprawling group encompassing global investment banking, commercial banking, and other core businesses. Rohrbaugh will run the CIB together with Jennifer Piepszak, a longtime executive who industry insiders have for years floated as a possible Dimon successor.Wall Street already knows Piepszak, who had most recently been co-chief executive of consumer and community banking and was the firm's finance chief from 2019 until 2021. Analysts and investors are also very familiar with Marianne Lake, another long-tenured key executive who was elevated in the reorganization announced last week and is most frequently rumored to take over from Dimon when he eventually retires.


Rohrbaugh, 53, is lesser known to Wall Street than these colleagues. His new position through the internal shuffle has vaulted him more publicly and prominently into the most closely watched succession race on Wall Street.Now, the industry will watch how Rohrbaugh will guide the CIB as JPMorgan performs above analysts' expectations even in a slumped deal market. Business Insider has tracked Rohrbaugh's trajectory from his college days to his most recent role as cohead of markets and securities services.One industry recruiter noted that Rohrbaugh's background as a risk manager could make him a powerful C-Suite contender.Indeed, Dimon is known for boasting about JPMorgan's ""fortress balance sheet,"" or its ability to protect against financial shocks while giving its employees the flexibility to test money-making ideas. ""They take prolific risk and manage it well,"" this person said.


'Fortunes began to change'Rohrbaugh arrived at JPMorgan in 2005, the year JPMorgan announced it would name Dimon, who had been president and chief operating officer, as CEO. Rohrbaugh joined the firm from Goldman Sachs, where he managed the foreign-exchange options business for North America.His first post at JPMorgan was global head of forex derivatives. After years of troubles in JPMorgan's forex business, ""the bank's fortunes began to change"" after Rohrbaugh joined in 2005, Euromoney wrote in 2017. He had been a ""source of stability not just for JPMorgan but also for the broader FX industry during its most turbulent years,"" the publication wrote. The bank then became the first to introduce the ability to trade from a mobile device, the article said.Rohrbaugh and longtime executive Eddie Wen, who had also joined JPMorgan from Goldman around the same time as Rohrbaugh, both had a hand in bringing quants and technologists ""into the front office so that the business could take ownership of its system development rather than relying on a separate IT department,"" Euromoney reported in 2017.JPMorgan executive David Hudson told the publication that he returned to JPMorgan after working at Nomura in 2010 ""to work for Troy."" He saw how the business had ""matured after five years. It was clearly much more aggressive and capable, and there was a big focus on electronic distribution as well as on risk management.""


Though his profile is less familiar to outside observers, Rohrbaugh's name is well-known across JPMorgan and in forex industry and advocacy groups. He had been chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's foreign-exchange committee and the chair of the Global Financial Markets Association's foreign-exchange group. He's also familiar with regulators, appearing on Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler's calendar of meetings with other top JPMorgan executives in 2022 and 2023.Rohrbaugh's other stops at JPMorgan have been head of global markets and head of macro markets. Before he worked at Goldman, Rohrbaugh ran the Asian foreign exchange options business for the Canadian bank Banque Nationale and started his career trading options for CooperNeff at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.Rohrbaugh's career spans the dot-com bust, the global financial crisis, and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, that devastated so many on Wall Street who worked in lower Manhattan.While Rohrbaugh was at Goldman, his firm was close to the World Trade Center, and he experienced loss during the attacks. According to the New York Daily News, he was one of the last people to speak with the Cantor Fitzgerald broker Tim Soulas, who was killed. Cantor lost 658 employees in the attacks that day.


Rohrbaugh before Wall StreetThe Baltimore native's earliest workplace experience, though, was not in a trading pit.""I was 16, and I was a security guard at a condominium at the Seaside,"" he said as part of a series of interviews JPMorgan published in 2015 about executives' first jobs. ""I worked in my father's business for about 40 hours during the week, and then I worked another 36 to 38 hours from Friday night 'til early Sunday morning.""Rohrbaugh remains involved in his Maryland alma maters. He is on the board of trustees of Gilman School, an all-boys preparatory school that Rohrbaugh graduated from in 1988.In 1992 he graduated from Johns Hopkins University, where he studied political science, played football, and is now a member of an advisory board there. In a video addressing the university's football team last year, he said ""pride and poise,"" a slogan the football team uses, are two traits that helped him as a player and in his career.


He said that along with being prepared while under pressure, ""you need to be calm and thoughtful and ready for when things aren't working out.""He was the president of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity while attending Johns Hopkins, where his frat brothers embraced a special tradition of throwing dozens of shoes out the window and onto a tree outside the frat house east of the college campus, the Baltimore Sun reported in 1992.Students would leave the house, forget something, and yell at their roommates about throwing their items out the window, Rohrbaugh explained to the paper. Once, that item was a pair of shoes, and it got tangled in the tree. ""From then on, any time you wore out a pair of shoes, or your roommate had really smelly feet with a tendency to leave his shoes lReturn-to-office tensionsIn the yearslong push and pull between what Wall Street firms' management and wider workforces want with remote work during the pandemic, Rohrbaugh has been chronicled as a vocal supporter of in-person work. That rubbed some employees the wrong way earlier in the pandemic, according to reports.


He is one of many finance executives who spoke publicly about their desire to have more employees working in person rather than at home.Bloomberg reported that in March 2020, while New York was in a state-mandated lockdown, a JPMorgan employee wrote in a note to colleagues about Rohrbaugh continuing to ""want to push everyone to get back into the office,"" which JPMorgan disputed at the time.A senior JPMorgan executive who works with Rohrbaugh recalled that time during the pandemic. This person said on Wednesday that he had managed trading operations well during Covid and took ""tremendous"" precautions for staff.Kaja Whitehouse and Alex Morrell contributed reporting.ying around, they'd end up on the tree,"" he said.""You get a technique after you've been here,"" Rohrbaugh said. ""You can always tell a freshman or sophomore because he'll miss the tree three or four times, and when he finally hits it, it won't wrap around.""

94,5 Vital Lessons I Learned By Taking a Mini Break From the Entrepreneurship Grind,"Feb 1, 2024",Meghan Gaffney,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-lessons-i-learned-by-taking-a-mini-break-and-getting-away/468109,"
Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a retreat for successful female entrepreneurs. I had 100 reasons not to go.My company was onboarding a large client. Regulatory policies impacting our industry were being debated in Washington, DC. We just wrapped up a major trade show. Things were busy at home. I was tired. I didn't have time.As much as I wanted to decline, I went — and it was one of the best decisions I've made all year.



As founders and leaders, if we just keep our heads down and focus solely on getting tasks done, we miss critical opportunities for big thinking. The kind of thinking that leads to growth and transformation. The kind of thinking that can impact the trajectory of a young company. And to be honest, the kind of thinking that is necessary of leaders and founders and those of us responsible for the vision of our companies.Here's what I learned when I took the time to step away from the day-to-day for this retreat.Related: 5 Priceless Lessons For First-Time Entrepreneurs1. Lessons from outside your industry are invaluableAs startups, we are often able to bring an important outside perspective to the industries we operate in. We're disruptors who think differently and aren't constrained by legacy norms that can slow down innovation.But then we grow and there is a shift that happens. Instead of bringing the outside perspective, we sometimes find ourselves needing an outside perspective. That's why it's critical to spend time developing important relationships with peers outside of our sector.Other innovators will look at a problem (and solution) with fresh eyes and help ground us in the innovator role we built our company on. We can learn from the experiences they've had, even if we serve different industries.


And, when called upon, we should return the favor when peers from different industries come to us to help get them unstuck.2. Curiosity is contagious (and beneficial)At Veda, we have always strived to create a culture of curiosity — but in the day-to-day, it's sometimes challenging to stop and ask questions, listen to others and honestly just take time to learn.One of the gifts of the retreat I was on was that it reminded me how important learning is. Yes, I learned a lot while I was there, but more importantly, I learned how much I need to learn.Since returning, I've already doubled down on our culture of learning and have committed to regular lunch-and-learns in the office and ensuring that the whole team has time to experiment with new technologies — true learning for the sake of learning. I am confident it will be time well spent and the team and company will benefit as a result.

Open peer-to-peer exchange is especially important for female foundersFemale founders often face gender-based stereotypes and biases that can impact their entrepreneurial journey.Sometimes this manifests itself in our male counterparts responding to our ideas from a place of bias — maybe intentional, maybe not. But there is a filter through which our ideas are considered that can impact their adoption.The opportunity to engage with other female founders provides the opportunity to kick the tires on ideas that aren't seen through a gendered lens.


4. When your head's down, you miss what's on the horizonWhen we're not looking up, we end up simply iterating in the same space that we already occupy instead of opening up to broader, bigger thinking.My co-founder likes to say that those incremental ideas are simply ""putting more horses on the same wagon when what we need to build is a train."" We need to be thinking multiple steps ahead of where we are today and that comes from opening our minds and imagination to conceive of what's next.5. When you're too busy doing, you're not leadingAs founders, it's critical that we inspire confidence, build trust and foster collaboration. With teams, boards, investors and customers. To do that we need to take time for self-reflection and big thinking. This introspection contributes to the development of a strong, authentic leadership presence that resonates with colleagues, peers and other stakeholders.An effective leader recognizes strategic thinking isn't done for three days a year at an offsite leadership meeting. Strategic thinking is an ongoing process that we need to make time for throughout the year. This is as true for senior leaders of major corporations as it is for entrepreneurs eyeing their next fundraising round or bringing a product to market.

It means figuring out what tasks I should be delegating or even ceasing altogether. I'm also committed to building, fostering and leveraging my network of peers for accountability.Like you, I have big goals for my company and know that getting lost in the minutiae won't get me there. Taking time away for personal and professional development ensures that I remember to look up.

95,The Ultimate 7-Step CEO Guide to Visionary Leadership,"Feb 1, 2024",Derek Lusk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/7-traits-leaders-need-to-attain-to-visionary-leadership/468711,"
Thomas Jefferson had a bold vision as the United States broke away from British rule. Consider his letter to John Adams in 1823, when he said, ""I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past."" Jefferson was contemplative and progressive in emphasizing his dream of a different America. He was a visionary.Many others have failed in dogmatic pragmatism. George H. W. Bush had several leadership qualities, such as humility and integrity, but Bush scholars universally agree that he lacked vision. His perspective on the United States was similar to Blockbuster and Kodak: let's double down on our history and what's worked in the past.Bush is even known for saying that he doesn't understand ""that vision thing."" In his inaugural address, he said there's no need for the country to ""invent a system by which to live."" All we need to do is ""act on what we know.""



There's utility in traditional thinking, but it becomes a strength overused when you can't do the other side of the coin — vision. Bush was a one-term president, losing to a relatively unknown Bill Clinton because he lacked an inspirational message.So, how can CEOs create a vision so powerful that it ignites organizational transformation?Related: Are You a Visionary Leader? Here are 12 Ways to Cultivate and Enhance Your Leadership Vision1. Vision from the heartIn Nietzsche's words, ""Only as an aesthetic phenomenon are life and the world justified eternally."" A vision should only affect us in the way art can, revitalizing the spirit and the selves' experience, as opposed to the task-oriented and linear nature of day-to-day goals. The executive's vision is an aesthetic, imaginative idealization that gives meaning to the organization, like an artist moving from a blank canvas to what could be.2. Align with the organization's valuesUnlike strategic objectives, which are rationally derived, visions are values-laden. They give meaning through an ideological goal. Since they are about what should be, they are, by definition, an expression of values and corporate identity.Thus, effective CEOs keep the vision malleable in relation to the business landscape but never change the values underneath. Not only that, but their personal values align with the organization and its vision — one reason for doing a values assessment in CEO succession.


Related: How Great Leaders Communicate Their Vision3. Create the vision with othersThe best CEOs have a clear vision that's tied to their values. It isn't a fully democratic process because the CEO must believe passionately in it. However, it's essential that the vision is not unilaterally imposed but rather distilled from the contributions of leaders throughout the organization. The first reason is buy-in from everyone else. The entire company needs to feel it in the heart, too. The second reason is that the organization existed before the CEO and will after the CEO, so the vision must align with the entire organization for continuity.Related: How to Engage Employees Through Your Company Vision Statement4. Make it valuable to all stakeholdersSome of the most catastrophic events in history have been the result of a psychopath's vision. Visions can be powerful, influential and morally corrupt — all at the same time. Conversely, real leaders create a vision that benefits the entire ecosystem, where the rising tide lifts all boats and makes the world a better place. Robert House, from the University of Pennsylvania, defined a greater good vision as ""an unconscious motive to use social influence, or to satisfy the power need, in socially desirable ways, for the betterment of the collective rather than for personal self-interest."" This is using the will to power for the betterment of humanity, to shape the future, rather than as a source of ruthless evildoing.


5. Use the vision to galvanize changeIn academia, there's a close relationship between visionary and charismatic leadership. Consider House's Theory of Charismatic Leadership, Bass' Transformational Leadership Theory, Conger and Kanungo's Theory of Charismatic Leadership, and Sashkin's Visionary Leadership Theory. They all emphasize how the most effective visions challenge the status quo and inspire evolution. The CEO evaluates the organization and its context, such as its core competencies and competitors, and through vivid mental imagery, paints a picture of the future.Since vision is related to influence and change, it's easy to understand how Kay Whitmore from Kodak and George H. W. Bush had ineffective visions. They were preventative instead of future-oriented and, therefore, neglected to become bigger, faster, stronger, and even something brand new. They were demotivating instead of galvanizing and failed to energize the organization.Related: What Is Transactional Leadership and How Does It Work?6. Ensure it's believableVisionary leaders are often bold and risk-taking, as well as imaginative. Like a psychic in Vegas, they're bold enough to think they can see the future and inventive enough to dream up a new reality that challenges today. With this psychology, the strength overused is that visionary CEOs are often alienated from reality. Conversely, the most effective CEOs are versatile enough to, as inherent in Marshall Sashkin's theory, balance vision with operational actions. Their visions are inventive, aesthetic, imaginative, bold, and innovative but believable and achievable.


7. Use the vision for strategic decisionsAnother benefit of vision, besides influence, is that it frames consequential strategic decisions. At Netflix, Reed Hastings could have charged ahead with being the number one DVD-by-mail company in the United States. But, as explained in the book CEO Excellence, the new direction was supported by a vision of transformation. ""The big strategic moves that followed made sense in ways they would never have otherwise: moving into video streaming, betting on the cloud, creating Netflix originals, driving exponential globalization, and so on."" The vision justified a series of innovations, decisions, and where the company should focus its limited time and resources.In all, the CEO's highest duty is breathing life into the organization, giving it meaning and harnessing the social forces toward a worthwhile future. Only as an aesthetic phenomenon, not one of logic, power, and control, is an organization's existence authentic and fully realized. Art reflects life, not just beauty, and an organization's vision reflects its identity and fulfills its purpose, without which it is lifeless.

96,Why Hope is the Overlooked Leadership Trait that Makes Organizations Thrive,"Jan 31, 2024",Megan J. Shen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-hope-matters-for-leadership-success/468659,"
A common question among leaders and organizations is, ""What type of leader is the most effective at helping organizations thrive?"" Often, the focus is on clear leadership traits, such as emotional resilience, courage and patience. These traits are critical to the success of a leader, but there is one overlooked trait that can help propel good leaders to becoming great leaders. A trait that can help organizations thrive, especially in the current climate of rapid change and uncertainty, is hope.One of the best and clearest definitions of hope, from the Cambridge dictionary, is ""to want something to happen or to be true, and usually have a good reason to think that it might.""That second part, having good reason to believe that something good can happen, is what sets hopeful leaders apart from optimistic ones. It's obvious that pessimist leaders are demotivating to the individuals they lead because they focus on challenges, not solutions. What is less obvious, however, is that optimists are also ineffective leaders. Optimists focus on the positive but tend to overlook or de-emphasize the reality of the challenges they and their teams face. Surprisingly, like pessimists, optimists fail to focus on solutions because they believe everything will work out without focusing on how they will make that happen.



Related: Great Business Leaders Have These 8 TraitsHopeful leaders, as this definition implies, acknowledge the challenges they face and those they lead, but they are motivated and hopeful that they can collaboratively find a solution. Leading with hope allows leaders, and thus their teams, to imagine a better future. This positive but realistic outlook creates energy that can push the team towards finding solutions to their problems and reimagining how work can be done more efficiently, effectively, and enjoyably.


Scientific research backs the claim that hope is a valuable leadership trait. Research by Arizona State University scholars notes that hope merely reflects ""wishful thinking."" Rather, it is a positive psychological trait that contains both willpower (or agency) and way-power (or finding pathways to success). Their research demonstrates that high-hope leaders, compared to low-hope, had more profitable work units and better satisfaction and retention rates among their subordinates.Individuals with high levels of hope have more goal-oriented strategies than those with low levels of hope. They are also more motivated to achieve those goals. Across multiple job levels and industries, employees with high levels of hope had higher levels of job performance, even after controlling for their self-efficacy and cognitive abilities. Another research study found that management executives with high hopes produced solutions to work-related problems that were both of better quality and more frequent.Related: Ignore the Cynics, Hope Is Your Greatest AssetEmployee retention and satisfaction are among companies' biggest and most expensive challenges today. A recent Harvard Business Review article noted that employee retention is expected to be 50-75% higher than companies have experienced previously, and it now takes 18% longer to fill those vacant roles than it did pre-pandemic. Gartner, a company focused on supporting executives, found that 65% of employees say the pandemic has made them rethink the place work should take in their lives.


Whereas an optimistic leader might think: ""We can keep hiring, and it will work itself out!"" in response to retention issues, the hopeful leader can reimagine how to motivate and retain employees. They can fully remodel the house rather than keep repairing the leaks. This ability is precisely because they can imagine an entirely different and better future and then set goals and implement strategies to get there. Their talents extend beyond employee retention and apply to the rapidly changing business market we find ourselves in due to rising inflation, unpredictable customer preferences, and AI/digital disruption.Related: What Makes a Great Leader?So, how do you become a more hopeful leader? Here are six quick tips:Name the problem or obstacle. As a hopeful leader, you must first acknowledge a problem to be fixed or an obstacle to overcome.Create a viewpoint of possibility or hope. Next, you must bring a spirit of ""possibility"" that you and your team can figure the problem out. The key to ensuring this viewpoint is hopeful, and not just optimistic, is to clearly articulate that you may need to iterate to find solutions and state why the solution is likely to work. It's essential that those being led feel confident that a solution is indeed possible.Set clear goals and action items to execute that vision. After making it clear, a solution can be found, and clear goals and action items on how that problem will be addressed or that obstacle will be overcome can be set. Making these SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) is best.Implement those goals/action items. Next, you must implement the solutions. Make it clear that this is the first attempt or iteration on the path to success, of which there may need to be many.Keep trying until the problem is solved or improved (make multiple iterations). If the first set of goals doesn't work, it's important to call it quits when needed and then move on to the next solution. A hopeful leader is very good at taking alternate paths when the way forward isn't working and clarifying that there is still a way forward, even if it requires a bit of trying.Celebrate successes. Of course, you should celebrate achieving the larger goal, overcoming the significant barrier or obstacle, and finding the ultimate solution. But also celebrate the small successes along the way to keep the team motivated to keep iterating to find solutions.Remember the power of being a hopeful leader and moving forward with a clear vision that you can make your team's and company's future better and have some ideas on how to do it.

97,How to Understand Limiting vs. Productive Attitudes Among Day Traders,"Jan 31, 2024",Ross Cameron,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-understand-limiting-vs-productive-attitudes-among/468701,"
The requirements for day traders are straightforward:You need knowledge of the profession. There's indeed a lot to learn, but it's not mystical. If you put in the hours, you can acquire a solid foundation of knowledge over some months.You'll need basic computer gear. When I was a day trader cub, I thought it was cool to have ten monitors and a powerful computer tower. I discovered it was overload. Now, I use a standard laptop and just three monitors.You need a day trading brokerage account. U.S. accounts require a minimum of $25,000 to be maintained in the account, but you can open a foreign one with $500.This brings us to the last requirement: the right applied attitude.When I say ""applied attitude,"" I mean you can have the best attitude, but if you don't take actions consistent with that attitude, you'll fail. For example, if your attitude tells you that you need to be done with trading for the day because of the mistakes you just made — but you decide to take just one more trade — you will soon be toast.



What are examples of trading attitudes that harm or help? Here are four:1. Fear as a brake vs. fear as a motivatorMy inspiration for working hard to become a successful day trader had nothing to do with seeing myself driving a Lamborghini. It had to do with seeing myself homeless if I didn't find a solution, pronto.


I lived in a modest house in Vermont with my dog. My trading account was down to the $25k minimum, and I had $30k in credit card debt. I was also down to the last few things I could sell on Craigslist to raise cash.Fortunately, I had kept a trading journal. As a last gasp before taking up some other profession, I analyzed my winning and losing trades and found certain patterns. Long story short, I turned my trading around. If that fear had led to inaction, it would have ended my trading career.Related: Want to Make Enough Money to Live A Great Life? Start By Setting Your ""Freedom Number""2. Scarcity vs. abundanceA close cousin to a fear mindset is a scarcity one. The first saying I ever learned was: ""A penny saved is a dollar earned."" Money was always tight, as we were continually reminded.


I learned about my great-grandfather, who was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929 on the day of the crash. He lost everything. That trauma rippled down through the generations to me. I had the feeling not only of scarcity but that you couldn't depend on others for job security. That was reinforced by what happened to my mother: After four decades of working at a hospital, she was laid off.Years later, I learned about my great-grandfather's brother-in-law. He started an investment company following the Great Depression, and he made millions.Here we have a member of my extended family, in the same enveloping Great Depression, who engineered a vastly different outcome. I was intrigued by how this branch of my family did not have a scarcity mindset. It opened the door in my mind to the possibility of thinking differently.Let's jump to today. Not only have I turned $583 into more than $10 million by day trading, but I've had the privilege of working with thousands of other people on their own day trading journeys. I see two other attitudes at work in some of them.

In Walden, Henry David Thoreau observed that ""We can never have enough of nature,"" and one of the things I love about working at Jotform's San Francisco headquarters is how accessible nature is. I can take a quick bike ride to a handful of beaches, as well as a pier crowded with sea lions. If I feel like hiking, tall peaks beckon in just about every direction. If I drive about a half-hour north, I can reach Muir Woods National Park, which is more than 550 acres of dense forest. That last spot, in particular, is perfect for what's termed ""forest bathing,"" which, along with morning sweat sessions and power napping, helps me play a longer, happier, more productive and healthier game as an entrepreneur.First term-conceptualized in Japan in the 1980s, forest bathing (shinrin-yoku) was the product of a government campaign to encourage people to find respite from then-rampant tech-boom burnout by taking advantage of the country's extensive protected forests. The idea was, and is, to immerse oneself in the woods and absorb its surroundings using all five senses — to see the trees and take in their colossal magnitude, as well as smell the leaves, listen to the natural sounds, feel the fresh air and taste foraged goods (with an appropriate eye on safety).Related: 7 Reasons the CEO Should Get Outside to Exercise

Billionaire Richard Branson knows a thing or two about building a strong team and brand — he's founded around 60 various businesses under the Virgin Enterprises umbrella, including Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Hotels, and Virgin Voyages, and made friendships with fellow billionaire entrepreneurs, such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates.Earlier this month, Entrepreneur attended the relaunch of RM72, a program of panel discussions for budding business owners, where Branson shared advice on several topics from keeping ownership of your brand name to not getting caught up in the financials.When asked what mistakes budding entrepreneurs make early on, Branson said there are a few key things entrepreneurs need to figure out early in their founding: their weaknesses, limits, and the value of delegating tasks.

      Key Takeaways    



        Walmart store managers are set to receive annual stock grants ranging from $10,000 to $20,000.
      


        The amount of the grant will depend on the size of the store, from hometown stores to Supercenters.
      


        The move follows significant increases in salary and bonuses that kick in on February 1.

This article originally appeared on Business Insider. It's a good year to be a store manager at Walmart.Fresh off the announcement earlier this month of substantial pay and bonus increases, the company said Monday that it is adding annual stock grants of up to $20,000 to the store managers' compensation packages.



""A Walmart store manager is running a multi-million dollar business and managing hundreds of people, and it's a far more complex job today then when I managed a store,"" said John Furner, President and CEO for Walmart's U.S. division, in a video posted on LinkedIn as the company kicks off an annual meeting in Houston, Texas.""We ask our managers to own their roles and act like owners,"" he added. ""Now, they'll literally be owners.""


The amount of the grant will depend on the size of the store, with $10,000 for Hometown store managers, $15,000 for Neighborhood Market or Division 1 store managers, and $20,000 for Supercenter managers. Furner said the grants will start in April.Walmart operates more than 4,600 retail locations across the US and employs 1.6 million people here.These grants are on top of a new salary and bonus structure that will kick in on Thursday, February 1, bringing the average base salary for US store managers to $128,000, up from $117,000.Under the plan announced on January 18, the maximum bonus increased from 1.5x annual salary to 2x annual salary — and will focus more on store profitability in addition to top-line sales.


This means a Supercenter manager with a top-end base salary of $170,000 could earn a total of $530,000 after receiving the maximum bonus and stock grant, while the average U.S. store manager could see roughly $400,000 in compensation this year.Roughly three-quarters of Walmart store managers started off in hourly roles, and the company does not require a college degree to be considered for the job.

CEOs carry a lot of weight. They manage businesses, people, expectations of stakeholders, and so much more. What makes these people tick and what does it take to be successful in this role? That's what I'm on a mission to find out with The CEO Series. I'm heading to the workplaces of inspiring business leaders to learn their personal stories and gain insights into their methods for getting the best out of their employees and themselves.Related: Avoid These 3 Key Mistakes for Team Success in 2024On this episode, I visited Sean Riley, CEO of Dude Wipes. It's a really fun brand that has outrageous marketing, but they are no joke. They're projecting to do over $120 million in sales, and they are disrupting the entire toilet paper industry. Here are some key takeaways from that conversation. Watch the video above to hear everything Sean had to say about the dynamic growth of the powerhouse company.



On stepping into the role of a CEO""Well, the first thing I did was change my title. I call myself the Chief Executive Dude because that's more fun and that's more who I am. And that's what Dude Wipes is supposed to be. Just because you're a CEO doesn't mean you can't be yourself.""The surprising truth you learn as a CEO""You have to kind of transition to doing less and being there more for people in a supportive way. You have to learn to let things go when you become a CEO, which maybe people don't realize. They think, 'Oh, the CEO does it all the stuff. Things keep piling up on their desk and they've got to do this, this and that.' But that's not what you want to do as the CEO. You want to have great people around you and have them grow and inspire them to do well. Think of Phil Jackson's journey. You're not taking the last shot on the court anymore. You're not the star player. You're stepping off the court trying to be the Zen Master. You're trying to make sure that all of the things in all of the different parts of your business work well together.""


Origin story""Our origin story is a fun and authentic one that I think a lot of people can relate to. It was me and my buddies sitting around, wanting to come up with a great business idea. And I put these baby wipes in the apartment and everyone started getting hooked on them. They were so much better than toilet paper and we started to wonder Why doesn't something like this exist? From there it was all about figuring out how to build a brand that represented who we were at the time. Guys sitting on a couch, eating burritos, drinking beers, Googling everything. making phone calls. Who can make these wipes? How do I incorporate a company? It was just about knocking out one thing after another.""On the key to success""We made $150,000 our first year, which kind of blew our minds. But it was the emotional reactions we saw from people very early on that gave us more confidence than probably the revenue. When Dude Wipes got into people's hands, they laughed or they passed them to other people. Making people laugh, and getting them talking was a high that kept pushing us. That belief that this will connect with people is everything. You have to believe day one this will be big. If you don't, you won't make it to some of these breakout moments like when we got on Shark Tank. We saw that customers liked it, so we believed we could do all these insane things and disrupt a huge toilet paper industry.""Hear more from Sean about running a company with a truly unique culture in the above video.

102,These Invisible Energy-Draining Habits Are Making You — And Your Team — Less Productive,"Jan 29, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/these-invisible-energy-draining-habits-are-making-you-less/465812,"
The pandemic brought about sweeping changes in the workplace. One of the most counterintuitive findings was that for many companies, productivity soared. But in 2022, some of those companies were equally stumped when productivity plunged. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022 saw the sharpest decline in productivity since 1947.While the reason for the drop wasn't obvious, one thing's for sure: For leaders, assigning personal blame isn't the best approach. It causes panic and kills morale. It certainly doesn't motivate employees to get working. A better approach is to roll up your sleeves, identify the obstacles, and figure out how to overcome them together.As CEO of Jotform, I've learned that the most significant productivity drains aren't coffee breaks or social media scrolling. They're often the habits that go unseen. Here are some ways that I navigate invisible energy drains with my team.

103,How Mindful Eating Can Supercharge Dynamic Thinking,"Jan 27, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-mindful-eating-can-supercharge-dynamic-thinking/467506,"
Entrepreneurs are ever in search of ways of reducing the number of decisions they make, in part to save brain space for the ""big stuff."" Some thought leaders pare down their wardrobe to a standard look (à la Steve Jobs), for example, while others optimize (and not necessarily healthfully) by eating the same thing every day.A novel take on this efficiency principle came in the form of a Bay Area company that marketed a product called Soylent in 2013. Tired of wasting money and energy on food, one of its founders, Rob Rhinehart, invented a ""super sludge"" intended to supply the body's essential nutrients — a mixture of maltodextrin, amino acids, fiber, olive oil and other ingredients. According to a journalist from Wired, that original formula looked like pancake mix and tasted like chalk.After reading that article, I could grasp why the concept could be regarded as potentially dystopian (its name inspiration, after all, a 1973 movie in which humans are forced to consume reprocessed human corpses), but Soylent is still going strong. The company, now based in Los Angeles, continues to grow and innovate (now offering tastier options like chocolate and strawberry). Its success supports the notion that busy professionals will spring for convenience when it comes to their appetites.



I'm a big proponent of simplifying as many tasks as possible. And while no stranger to the occasional lunch-replacement smoothie, I'm not sold on outsourcing meals entirely. Luckily, for food-loving entrepreneurs, there are creative benefits to thinking more about and diversifying what and how we eat.Related: 7 Tips for Startup Food Entrepreneurs


Ingredients for creativityAs something of a counterpoint to Rhinehart-esque food practicality, a 2021 literature review written by a team of researchers and academicians offered evidence to suggest that people with a view of food as simply fuel miss out on the creative benefits of eating more mindfully. Engaging multiple senses during a meal (taste, smell, tactile qualities, etc.), they wrote, can boost creative thinking in various ways, and offered the experience of wine as an example: Those who enjoy it think about taste, smell, color and mouthfeel, and might come up with descriptive metaphors for each. Creative wheels start turning. It follows that engaging with food by paying attention to analogous qualities (and any metaphorical associations) may likewise boost inventiveness.The authors also made a case for eating foods that result in genuine enjoyment. Creativity is enhanced, they suggest, when people feel happy, including being relaxed or moderately excited. So, to borrow a phrase from author Marie Kondo, consider foods that spark joy when you eat them. Maybe it's your partner's famous lasagna (which gets even better the next day as leftovers), a burrito from a favorite food truck or a big, colorful salad.Eating something delicious and taking the time to appreciate it can prime the brain for exploration. Better yet, certain foods can actually boost the brain's power.Related: Your Poor Eating Habits Are Hurting Business


Nutrition that sharpens the mindThe first rule of thumb for choosing meals that give rise to sharp thinking is to think about them beforehand: to make choices before you're ravenous. Various studies make plain that humans are far better at resisting salt, calories and fat in the future than in the present.Glucose, a type of sugar, is the main energy source for the body's cells, and it's worth keeping in mind that brain cells use the most energy. But when it comes to glucose, not all foods are created equal: Some release theirs quickly, leading to a sudden spike in energy (and an equally fast plummet). Members of this ""simple carbohydrates"" family include pizza, pasta, bread and sugary drinks. Others, termed ""slow carb foods,"" release glucose gradually, among them starchy vegetables (sweet potato, squashes, beets), whole grains, beans and legumes.Other foods are linked with memory and cognition. Research published in a 2014 edition of the Journal of Psychiatric Research revealed that the amino acid tyrosine (the precursor of the ""feel good"" hormone, dopamine) enhances cognitive performance, particularly in short-term stressful or cognitively demanding situations. So, load up on seaweed, bananas and almonds. Other research has found that the plant-based omega-3 fat, alpha-linolenic acid, which is abundant in walnuts and flaxseed, likewise improves memory and cognition, as do the antioxidants in berries. Foods high in choline and folate, like eggs, are linked to improved cognitive performance and memory. A 2014 study published in the British Journal for Health Psychiatry found that young adults who ate more fruits and vegetables reported boosted well-being, more intense feelings of curiosity and greater creativity.The bad news is that, in the real world, we don't always have time to prepare balanced meals, but it's actually a cinch to supplement whatever you're eating with nutrient-packed options. If I have pizza for lunch, for example, I'll add a handful of almonds for a snack. If there's a bagel for breakfast, some olive oil seaweed chips will be added later in the morning. The goal is balance. I also automate snack selection by programming delivery orders ahead of time. That way, when my stomach rumbles, I reach for brain-boosting dried fruits rather than a bag of M&Ms.


Related: Fueling Your Body is Key to Fueling Your BusinessAs CEO of Jotform, and the author of a book on automation, I understand the inclination to optimize as many tasks as possible. If I want to carve out time for important creative work (aka ""the big stuff"") and reserve more hours to spend with my family, something has to hit the chopping block. But I also believe in the tangible and intangible benefits of being thoughtful about what I eat — I would rather invest time in identifying and automating busywork than skipping a lunch with colleagues or friends. If you are what you eat, after all, then wouldn't it simply be wise to make that food high-quality, enjoyable and creative?

104,Your Reputation is Your Currency. How Are You Investing in Yourself?,"Jan 26, 2024",Maha Abouelenein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-ways-to-build-trust-through-content/468575,"
In today's business landscape, your reputation is your most valuable asset.With more than 30 years of experience in the communications industry, I've learned that your reputation is your currency. It's how people see and think about you. Big brands like Nike or Apple invest substantially in building their brand names because that drives their business — they have to maintain a specific image and reputation.The control over your reputation lies in how you behave and what you say, offline and online. Taking care of your reputation isn't just about image; it's an act of self-reliance and accountability. Your name is yours to own and protect, and no one will care about it as much as you do.



Imagine your reputation as money — what is its value? How do you make it grow and safeguard it? A strong reputation means more opportunities, business growth, success, and relationships. Understanding the importance of your reputation is the first step toward thriving in a world where it's your currency.Even if you have a great personality, business, or product, it doesn't matter if people don't trust you. Think about famous people or brands that lost everything because they didn't protect their reputation. The lesson here is that nothing is more important than your reputation. You must take deliberate steps to build, protect, and treat it like an asset.


Related: Adopt These 9 Habits and You'll Be Unrecognizable By the End of 2024Authenticity and transparency are imperativeAuthenticity and transparency are key to building a solid reputation. People crave genuine connections because they are bombarded with carefully curated images and messages. Authenticity in individuals and brands establishes trust, a vital component in any relationship. As the saying goes, ""Trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair"" - a fact in the digital landscape, where misinformation and scandals can spread like wildfire. It is essential to prioritize authenticity in your actions and communications. Instead of projecting an image of perfection, embrace your flaws, share your journey, and let people see the real you. Faking it won't work.Transparency goes hand in hand with authenticity. People demand transparency from the brands they support and the individuals they follow. Whether it's an entrepreneur sharing the behind-the-scenes of their business or a company addressing challenges, transparency builds trust.I recently read a statement from a company, Passion Planner, addressing fulfillment issues during the holiday rush. The CEO was transparent; she took ownership, apologized and shared an action plan with customers — resulting in massive trust in the brand. Individuals can build transparency, too, by openly communicating their values, motivations and decision-making processes. The more transparent you are on wins and challenges, the more your audience trusts you.


Commit to delivering on promisesPromises are like contracts in terms of reputation. Whether it's a personal commitment or a brand promise, failing to deliver can have severe consequences. Information travels at the speed of light and breaking promises can lead to a tarnished reputation. You must prioritize setting realistic goals and only making promises you can keep.Similarly, brands need to be cautious about the claims they make in their marketing and advertising. Delivering on promises is not just about meeting expectations; it's about exceeding them. Consistently surpassing expectations builds your reputation for reliability and dependability, essential traits when audiences have numerous options at their fingertips.Related: The Dangers of Overpromising and Under-DeliveringEmbrace the power of effective storytellingStorytelling is a powerful tool for building trust and shaping reputations. Whether you're an individual looking to connect with your audience or a brand trying to differentiate yourself, effective storytelling allows you to convey your values and mission compellingly. Storytelling involves sharing your personal experiences, challenges overcome, and lessons learned. This vulnerability helps you connect with the audience, making you relatable and authentic. On the other hand, brands can use storytelling to humanize their image, showcasing the people behind the company or their commitment to the communities they serve. Sharing success stories, customer testimonials, and the brand's journey creates an emotional bond with consumers.


Create content to build your reputationContent is king. Whether it's blog posts, videos, podcasts or social media updates, the content you create shapes your perception. You must adopt a strategic content creation approach to enhance and protect your reputation.Consistency is key in content creation - regularly sharing valuable and relevant content keeps you on your audience's radar. Moreover, the content should align with your values and mission, reinforcing the authenticity and transparency you aim to project.Engagement is another crucial aspect of content creation. Responding to comments, addressing concerns, and actively participating in conversations with your audience builds a community around you. This engagement strengthens your reputation and allows for real-time feedback, helping you adapt and evolve.5 tips for building trust through content:Know Your Audience: Tailor your content to resonate with your target audience — understand their needs, preferences, and pain points to create content that genuinely speaks to them and is still authentic to you.Be Consistent: Whether it's the tone of your writing, the visual style of your videos, or the messaging on social media, consistency builds recognition. A consistent brand image fosters trust.Showcase Your Values: Use your content to highlight the values that matter to you. Whether it's social responsibility, sustainability, or innovation, aligning your content with your values reinforces your reputation. Have a guiding principle. Mine is ""helping people communicate better."" Everything I do is in service of that mission.Embrace Authenticity: Share behind-the-scenes glimpses, acknowledge mistakes, and celebrate successes. Authenticity in your content strengthens the connection with your audience.Invite Engagement: Encourage your audience to share their thoughts, ask questions, and participate in discussions. Building a community around your content enhances trust and loyalty.Your reputation is not a passive byproduct; it's a proactive investment. You can safeguard your reputation and boost its 'value' by investing in your brand. Personal branding is not about self promotion saying, ""Look at me, I know stuff!"" - it's about idea promotion. Building your personal brand is about leadership, reputation management, and building authority. It is an essential tool to reflect what you stand for and enhance your influence.

A vibrant, customer-focused online presence can be created with virtual try-ons, live chat support and personalized product suggestions.


Successful use of this method requires a thorough website assessment. User-friendliness and rapid loading times let visitors relax and enjoy themselves. Explore incorporating AR and VR to give clients an engaging and personalized online purchasing experience.

Customers must trust you with their money while buying online. Any complete website review should prioritize security and usability. In this digital age, your company's legitimacy depends on internet trust.Elevating digital marketing beyond the basicsDigital marketing goes beyond raising brand recognition; it's all about creating audience-specific campaigns that connect. Oberlo predicts that digital advertising expenditure in the U.S. will reach $325 billion by 2025. This points to the growing significance of digital advertising in reaching consumers.Companies should look into influencer partnerships, interactive content and community-building projects in addition to the usual social media postings. These initiatives foster awareness and lay the foundation for a loyal customer base.


Firms should make a detailed content schedule with several formats to keep the material interesting and up-to-date, including blog posts, infographics and videos. To create a genuine connection with the audience, collaborate with influencers aligning with the company's values. In addition, make campaigns that customers can participate in through interactive polls and quizzes and promote user-generated material.For entrepreneurs, digital marketing is not just about promotion; it's an educational journey. Educate consumers about the advantages of digital financial solutions while advertising your services with engaging content.

It's about uncovering insights that can aid individuals in making decisions. Companies should consider investing in predictive analytics to understand customer preferences, anticipate market changes and automate routine tasks to free up time for analysis and decision-making. Regular training on understanding and using data analysis results is essential if your teams want to make the most of data-driven decision-making.


When it comes to the digital world, data is king. Investing in predictive analytics from a strategic standpoint will help you remain ahead of market trends. However, fostering an environment where your staff recognizes the value of data insights is equally important. Your whole company can benefit from consistent data interpretation training.Improving mobile experienceOptimizing websites for mobile devices has become a requirement rather than a luxury. However, more than simply relying on design is required. To truly enhance consumer engagement, organizations should consider developing their mobile apps. Offering discounts for mobile app users can significantly increase the likelihood of customers downloading and actively using these apps. Statista's data shows that in the first quarter of 2023, mobile devices generated almost 60% of web traffic worldwide.This emphasizes mobile optimization. Your clients utilize mobile devices for shopping, browsing and more besides communication. Usability testing on many mobile devices can assist organizations in guaranteeing this strategy works and customers like it. Assessing the viability of a customer-focused mobile app is vital. Use mobile-exclusive discounts or loyalty programs to encourage app-based customer interactions for a simple and customized experience.Recognize that mobile financial transactions are growing. Mobile optimization should be strategic, not just convenient. Create a mobile app to reach users directly. Users expect seamless mobile device experiences. Recognize that smartphones are an extension of your users' financial lives and adopt a mobile-first approach.

As per the estimates by Cybersecurity Ventures, cybercrime is projected to grow 15% year over year, incurring $10.5 trillion in economic losses by 2025.This number illustrates the risks of online commerce. Beyond conventional safeguards, firms should communicate their cybersecurity commitment through transparent policies and security updates.Businesses should train employees on cybersecurity threats regularly. To protect sensitive data, use encryption and multi-factor authentication. Newsletters and social media posts regarding cybersecurity processes soothe clients and build trust.


Trust is crucial to cybersecurity beyond technology. Communicate your cybersecurity commitment as an entrepreneur. Understand that one security violation can ruin trust. Train your personnel on cybersecurity as a precaution and part of your company's culture. Trust is cash, and cybersecurity is its vault.

      Key Takeaways    



        Kyle Kazmer creatively converts his large yard into a lucrative dog-friendly retreat through Sniffspot.
      


        Sniffspot offers Kazmer a turn-key solution for passive income; he's made over $40,000 since spring 2023, averaging up to $7,000 monthly in the summer.

I first listed on Sniffspot in spring 2023. Sniffspot is used by dog trainers and dog owners wanting a space for their dogs to run outside and play without having to go to a public dog park, and I thought it sounded interesting since we have a large yard that we just don't have enough time to fully enjoy. I also wanted to teach my young children to be entrepreneurial, and the value of work, and this is something they could be a part of. (Fun fact: They are enjoying it so fully that my youngest son named our new puppy ""Sniffspot!"")Sniffspot was incredibly turn-key: Just upload some photos of your yard, set a price per hour and include some details about your spot, and it does the rest, allowing users to look up nearby spaces to rent by the hour.

It is very rewarding to consistently have very thankful people telling us their stories and that bringing their furry friends to a Sniffspot was the best experience they've ever had with their dog: whether it is watching their dog swim for the first time, seeing an anxious dog be stress-free and playful, a family having the opportunity to have a stress-free hike with their dog letting them run wild without a leash — we even had a man propose to his girlfriend here with their dogs! And sadly, last week someone brought their dog the day before they would put him down to have one last sweet time together. It is truly rewarding, and I never imagined the stories we would hear from opening up our yard for dogs.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground? There are many gig economy options out there, but a lot require significant time and ongoing maintenance. We created our profile with tons of photos, and then it just exploded. Word-of-mouth has been the biggest driver, especially among dog trainers, but our reviews and user images really took our spot to the next level.Were there any challenges that came with running your side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? 


The biggest concern was safety with having strangers on our property and worrying if they would treat our backyard and property with respect. We've all heard horror stories about other short-term rental options — but dog owners must be of a different breed because that concern was completely unfounded for Sniffspot users. Everyone is overwhelmingly considerate, respectful, caring and overall professional. Sniffspot has an insurance policy that brought us some peace of mind as well, and the support staff is also incredibly helpful and responsive, which makes hosting a breeze.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? The first partial month we made $1,500 on our spot. The second month we generated $3,700. But really, the highlight for me is the truly passive nature of Sniffspot with no cost to set up and minimal upkeep. Many will just unlock their side gate and let the dogs, and money, roll in.How much average monthly revenue do you earn now? How much total revenue have you earned to date? An average month is between $4,000-$5,000 on Sniffspot. Summer months range from $6,000-$7,000 for us in the sunny Southern California area. Since last spring, we've made over $40,000 on Sniffspot.


What sets Sniffspot apart from other gig platforms? The users are friendly, caring and respectful. We've had over 700 guests, and I can count maybe one or two times someone did not clean up after their dog. The platform is automated, so it is completely passive as a host. Bookings are immediately accepted, and the only task required by hosts is to have your calendar up to date and the property accessible.Related: This Arizona Teacher Started a Side Hustle That Immediately Earned More Than Her Full-Time Job: 'Much Better Than $40,000'What do you enjoy most about your side hustle? 


The revenue stream is great, but what I love most is how appreciative everyone is and the opportunity to share our beautiful property. We fell in love with it, and it makes us so happy to share it. We are truly motivated by the love of dogs and the owners who know what a difference it makes for their best friend. We are filling a need in the community of dog-lovers.Our guests tell us they absolutely love being able to have their dog off leash and play or train and that they are truly creating memories with their dogs. We consistently get guests driving two-plus hours each way for their dog to come visit our Sniffspot. Someone even recently drove more than six hours to make a trip out of it.We've heard stories of proposals happening here, dates between dog lovers, dog birthday parties, dogs learning to swim, anxious dogs coming alive for the first time, etc. — the stories keep us on Sniffspot, and it's truly so rewarding.Related: She Started Her Side Hustle to Solve a Serious Problem With Outdoor Furniture. It Blew Past Her Full-Time Job's Income — to $66,000 a Month.Do you have any advice for others interested in this gig? What should they know before they get started?If they're considering the gig economy or passive income for their space, Sniffspot is the best platform out there. It is consistent, reliable, automatic and has the best users. Because you can choose your own price point per hour, play around with what works. Do your research with other comparable spaces near you. You don't want to price too much beyond other spots in your area, but don't undercut yourself. Be sure to provide great experiences and be client-obsessed. Some may choose to offer dog toys, blow-up pools, etc. We have paddle boards, kayaks, homegrown fruit that guests can pick and buy, a petting zoo and even working fire trucks. Be sure to have decent photos of your space with details on what guests can expect. And feel free to ask for reviews in any follow-ups. Word-of-mouth is a powerful tool.

109,Forget Everything You've Heard About Multitasking. Here's How to Juggle a Busy Day and Still Make Time for Meaningful Work.,"Jan 24, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-juggle-tasks-while-making-time-for-meaningful-work/466104,"
The morning I decided to write this article, I sat at my desk at Jotform and opened a Google document in one browser, then used another to queue up an email for later that day. While I waited for the latter to schedule (there's usually a short lag), I popped into a calendar app and blocked out a couple of hours to focus on writing, and also updated an appointment with my trainer. Then, still riding an early morning motivational high, I silenced my devices and got to work.It's fitting, I thought at the time, that I was multitasking to prepare myself to write an article about that very thing. Today, the act of undertaking and balancing a variety of tasks simultaneously is increasingly considered to actually be bad for productivity, but I think the truth is more nuanced. After all, it's entirely natural to focus on two things at once. Animals — from fish and octopuses to monkeys and pigeons — are multitaskers. Research from Ruhr-Universitaet-Bochum in Germany has found, in fact, that pigeons do it even better than humans.There may be a fine line between accomplishing several things simultaneously and being overcome by distractions, but in my experience, it's possible to embrace both the benefits of multitasking and the importance of dedicating undivided attention to meaningful work — what I like to term ""the big stuff.""
