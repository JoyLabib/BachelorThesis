0,We've Normalized Testing Our Employees. But Why Don't We Test Our Leaders?,"Apr 24, 2024",Greg Waisman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-leaders-should-be-tested-just-as-much-as-employees/472793,"
You might be surprised to hear this, but 82% of bosses tend to come into leadership positions without any management training or qualifications.This has resulted in a major decline in high-quality leaders in various industries across the world. An outcome of this is that we face a decline in levels of trust towards managers among regular workers and a high level of employee turnover.So, to avoid this, shouldn't company founders and top management also undergo growth and improve their skills, especially in the current market conditions when everything is changing every day? Well, let's take a look, shall we? Here's my take on how leaders can undergo self-development and why it's important.



Related: How Leaders Can Cultivate Happiness in the WorkplaceAdopt the mindset of changeAs a business leader, I have long learned that the finance industry is constantly shifting and evolving. This means that my fellow founders and I must constantly monitor these changes if our business is to stay relevant.


Lewis Carroll once said, ""My dear, here we must run as fast as we can just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere, you must run twice as fast as that."" These words perfectly describe how founders should feel when gathering and analyzing new information.And it's not just about the right knowledge. The roles you have to fulfill in the company also change depending on what stage of development you're at. When you first launch a startup, the focus is primarily on building your team and researching the market for possible product niches that you can fill. But as your company grows, the situation changes. And so do the tasks that you, as a founder, have to tackle.For example, all our teams have been formed these days, so I find myself dealing with such matters less. Instead, most of my attention goes to more strategic matters, such as planning the company's course and prospects for the next two to three years.And that's how I think it should be. Founders must be able to switch gears, gradually moving away from dealing with operational matters and towards strategic ones. To this end, adopting a particular mindset and preparing a management team that will allow your business to function without your direct intervention in day-to-day matters is important.

You will know that you've arrived at that stage when you start feeling that your competencies are no longer enough to continue fulfilling your responsibilities efficiently. This means that it's time to take a step back and hire people better suited to take over some of your tasks.Being able to do so requires a certain measure of character that allows you to look at things objectively and acknowledge that others would be better suited than you for some of the company's positions. In fact, the larger your business gets, the less suited you are likely to be for many roles that need to be filled. And there is nothing wrong with that.I would say that it's a perfectly healthy situation for a company to be in. A time may come when things will be handled by other people who are better at direct management than you. Meanwhile, you and your fellow founders can form the board of directors without a need to get deeply involved in regular processes.


It's up to you to decide when the moment is right for this transition to take place.Related: 4 Ways Exceptional Leaders Can Provide Stability TodayWhat tactics can you use?It is natural for both founders and employees to grow with the company and its needs. Set specific goals that you wish to achieve and select the kinds of training that would better help you achieve them. Here are some options that I believe would be of great use in boosting the skills you need to better command a business.Leadership coaching: Coaching sessions create a space for reflection, where you can improve self-awareness and explore your aspirations. Get a clearer idea of where you are and where you want to be to achieve sustainable growth for the company. Evidence shows that 70% of leaders who receive coaching benefit from improved workplace performance. Personally, I can say that coaching often allows me to reflect on existing business issues while also learning how to do better based on real cases that we've handled in the past. This has proven very helpful over the years.


Industry analysis: I mentioned before that working in finance means operating under constantly changing conditions. That's why constant market assessment is paramount here. It helps us understand the state of things and the needs that market participants face. This, in turn, enables us to make projections about the demand and supply for our products and possible financial returns. If you want your business to be successful, you can never stop deepening your awareness of the market in which you operate.Collecting feedback: in my company, we don't really have a unified benchmark against which we measure all our people and try to make them fit. There wouldn't be much point to that. Fintech is a very innovative field, so the most desired traits here are the ability and the courage to think creatively, not 'adhere to standards', as it were. As such, we prefer to measure the success of our training initiatives through the feedback given by our management and employees according to the Kirkpatrick model. Whether they are managing to apply new skills and knowledge in their work and whether the training has benefited their levels of self-confidence and motivation. That's how we assess our progress.

1,How to Align Business and Customer Interests for Long-Term Success,"Apr 22, 2024","Simin Cai, Ph.D.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-align-business-and-customer-interests-for-long-term/472729,"
It may be hard to hear for young entrepreneurs and small businesses with ambitious plans to scale, but not everyone is your customer. Differentiation starts with finding your expertise and your market, and then driving home the value you offer. In this sense, standing out is a matter of bringing more of your authentic self and your company to the table — not less in a bid to be all things to all people.The danger of the latter approach is getting lost in the crowd. The moment a company's product or service is benchmarked by the market, it has already become a commodity, which means you can only compete on price.Even established companies need to know when to pivot if their expertise is no longer aligned with their customers. Adobe shifted from a very successful business model providing its suite of graphic-design apps to a subscription-based model. It was part of a broader strategy to adjust to emerging customer behavior patterns in a cloud-based environment. After a torrent of early criticism, the subsequent numbers are impressive: Adobe posted record revenue of $19.41 billion in the 2023 financial year and now has over 33 million subscribers.



While Adobe's move may have originally been seen as risky, identifying the right customer for your business or remaining agile enough to move with customer preferences is the best way to build and maintain a sustainable business model.Related: You Can't Be Everything for Everybody, So Stop Trying


Know your expertise to deliver valueFake it til you make it is poor advice to new business leaders. Self-awareness is needed to understand your unique value proposition and align it with what the customer actually needs. This allows you to then focus on maximizing that value. Promising expertise you are yet to possess usually happens when entrepreneurs are chasing the wrong customer — but the right customer need not be elusive.Remember, it is one thing to invest resources in reaching out to customers who can afford your offering, but another to make sure they will actually pay for it. While that ought to be obvious, the next part is critical. Those same customers must see value in your product or service. The notion of value can be subjective, but that is exactly the point: The right customer is one who values what you can provide because you have differentiated it from the competition and met a tangible need or desire.Compare that to the temptation to chase big-name accounts in B2B marketing — it can become blinding. Of course, it is still true that we must appeal to customers' needs, arguably more than ever in a world that expects speed and convenience. But as CEO, when I visit a customer, I try to understand how we are going to align our interests to deliver value to them and gain benefit for ourselves. Aligning interests is a win-win for both parties.How to invest in sustainabilityWhen there is a natural affinity between what a business provides and what the customer needs, there is no sacrifice — only mutual benefit. Having a clear understanding of your own expertise gives you the confidence to say, ""I don't know,"" when asked to go beyond its limits. That can save you a lot of needless persuasion. A simple rule of thumb is if you have to chase or convince customers, they are probably not the customers for you.


Once you have aligned interests, reputation can become a business's own form of marketing, and staying true to the core values and expertise that got you there is branding. Apple, for instance, is renowned for turning its customers into evangelists. The tech giant avoids aggressively pursuing customers by constantly adapting to their needs and in some cases, becoming self-disruptors. They have built an identity out of challenging the status quo.So, don't allow the unique part of your value proposition to get lost the moment potential sales figures are flashed around. Stick to what you do well, and trust it can be iterated or evolved once a solid foundation has been laid. Instead of telling customers what you think they want to hear, stay true to your authentic self and values in order to build credibility over the long haul.Related: Not All Clients Are Good for Business. Here's How to Find the Ones Who Are.Align, refine, and double downWhen Amazon launched its first Kindle back in 2007, it sold out within hours. Its genesis was Jeff Bezos identifying books as one of five product categories with the most ecommerce potential. The online retail giant opened its popular bookstore in 1995, so by the time it had developed an e-reader, it had already established an eager market.


The first Kindle was clunky-looking compared to the devices of the time but Amazon has never wavered from its primary purpose: to serve people who love reading. Now, the new-generation Kindles come with the X-ray feature, which allows readers to learn more about a character, topic, event, place or any other term. Other functions like vocabulary-building flashcards show how Amazon has kept innovating to create the best reader experience.In other words, play to your strengths but don't overplay your hand. The founder of the outdoor apparel brand Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard, says the 50-year-old company has thrived for so long because it does not pursue endless growth and is aware of the expectations of its customer base to model corporate responsibility. ""Building the best product while causing the least harm is at the heart of what we do,"" he says.Stop chasing, start buildingPatagonia's ""conscious capitalism"" is a great example of how to keep customer and business interests aligned for sustainability over the long term. It is not enough just to have a unique value proposition — you also have to be aligned with customer needs and expectations.Instead of seeing this relationship as one of pursuing customers to drive endless growth, businesses need to take a more collaborative approach. When interests are truly aligned, there is both deep satisfaction and profitability in providing an offering that is authentically yours and genuinely needed.

2,You Won't Be a Successful Entrepreneur Until You Adopt These 3 Habits,"Apr 22, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/you-wont-be-successful-until-you-adopt-these-3-habits/472615,"
Contrary to popular belief, reaching professional goals doesn't always have to equate to revenue. Although money makes a difference when growing your brand and solidifying your place as a successful entrepreneur, make sure you're investing in yourself in other ways as part of a long-term strategy.Sometimes, that means creating (and sticking to) healthy daily habits. In other instances, it may mean a small monetary investment for a bigger payoff down the road. Wherever you are in your entrepreneurial journey, there are ways to step out of a scarcity mindset and seek affordable ways to push yourself to the next level.Investing in yourself doesn't have to be expensive. You may soon find that all the ways you invest in yourself help you reach your revenue goals faster than you think. Here are a few ways to get started.

Establish a routineEvery entrepreneur has habits and tricks they swear by that have helped them get to where they are. Some promise being an early riser is what has made all the difference. Others make sure to schedule time for mediation. Regardless of what appeals to you, remember that everyone is on their path. What may work for some people may be a deterrent for you.


A good way to find a routine you can stick with is by dividing your day's schedule into categories, such as projects, administrative work/meetings, health and wellness, and fun. Each of these areas is important. Prioritizing wellness and fun is just as important as focusing on work; otherwise, expect burnout as a consequence.Once you've created your own categories, place them into time blocks. For example, if you like to exercise first thing in the morning, set aside time on your calendar that reflects that commitment to your health and wellness routine. Then, fill in the time slots with your other priorities for the day and repeat through the week.It matters less when you wake up and more when you pay attention to your day.Related: Best New Shows For Entrepreneurs Streaming Free Now


2. Level up your knowledgeThe internet has made it easy to get free information. Whether you want to master social media marketing or learn new software, online tutorials and classes help you get where you want to be.Many cities also have free classes or networking groups that allow you to add to your skill set. Stay curious and expand your mind in areas that will help you grow your business. Everything from project management to accounting to scaling your business can help you streamline processes and give you more time to focus on strategy.Once you find an online channel or in-person mentor you like, you can decide if investing in a paid course or book is beneficial. However, start with the free knowledge available online and at your local library to understand what's possible.Add learning to your schedule as a set appointment for yourself. Otherwise, it can be easy to de-prioritize this important investment, which allows you to stay current within your industry and pushes you to connect to a higher level of growth.


Related: You Won't Have a Strong Leadership Presence Until You Master These 5 Attributes3. Cut expensesAnother valuable way to invest in yourself is to eliminate what you don't need. This includes monetary costs and people or projects that are draining your energy.Since time is money, it's important to examine where yours is being used and make adjustments as needed. When it comes to actual monthly expenses, look at your bank account.What subscriptions do you have that you no longer use? Which platforms are not working for you? Alternatively, which platforms are working well that you'd benefit from investing in a higher tier?


Furthermore, if you have a newsletter or paid ads to promote your business, how closely are you reviewing monthly reports? Are you making changes based on analytics? Even if you have a small ad spend, ensure it's giving you the return you want. Otherwise, that cost can be distributed elsewhere.Cutting costly connections and projects without a return on investment is equally valuable. Limit or eliminate the areas which aren't fulfilling your needs. This can take longer to establish as there are likely more personal attachments, but being an entrepreneur means preserving your energy, not giving it away for free.Essentially, evaluate all places you're spending time and money and decide if it still makes sense for where you are in your business.Related: 12 Cost-Cutting Strategies to Help You Thrive in a Slow Economy


Being an entrepreneur is a marathon, not a sprintAs with any other job, entrepreneurs have good days and bad. Since you are in charge of your own success (and failures), constantly reflecting on what is and isn't working is necessary. It helps you change direction before going down the wrong path for too long. It also enables you to move out of your comfort zone when you get too comfortable.Investing in yourself will always pay off. Though you may not see immediate results, its steadiness propels growth and ensures you are equipped to carry on for the long run.

3,This Leadership Technique is the Secret to Optimal Team Performance,"Apr 18, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/this-leadership-technique-is-the-secret-to-team-performance/472396,"
As a business owner, you may be focused on profit and loss. Just as important as marketing the company and knowing the numbers that drive margins is the company's foundation: motivating your team. Why? A McKinsey survey found that employee disengagement and attrition cost mid-sized businesses between $228 million and $335 million annually. In other words, even on a smaller scale, your company is losing money and inhibiting business growth by not properly motivating your employees.Leadership and motivation go hand-in-hand. As a leader, your job is to push people forward to achieve the company's goal. How you do that depends on various factors. As the CEO of Carbliss, I've never considered myself an inspiring leader. At least not in the way I have it pictured in my head — a Tony Robbins-esque figure standing on a stage, giving a long speech and firing up the crowd, that's not me. And you know what? That's okay. We all have our different strengths and weaknesses. Our different ways to approach leadership. Below are the key differentiators we use to maintain team engagement while also driving our margins.Related: You Won't Have a Strong Leadership Presence Until You Master These 5 Attributes The secret to leadership through motivationMany business owners spend years navigating leadership styles to find what works for them. Some become harsh bosses, dictating rules. That doesn't work. Others become too close to employees, and they end up losing respect for them as the company's leaders. Others look the other way and pretend they don't see the problem. That doesn't work, either.



Through my experience in business, I've found one particular leadership technique that works better than others. Using this approach has led me in the best direction – even though I'm not a charismatic type of leader. If I had to summarize my approach to leadership, it's this:Understand who someone is and use that knowledge to move them. Instead of a bold speech, help people move toward what they desire most in life. It's subtle but profound. By recognizing and helping individuals achieve their aspirations within the team, we create an environment where personal and professional growth go hand in hand. In a way, I'm just there to remind them of their goals so they can hold themselves accountable.Related: How to Motivate Your Unmotivated EmployeesLeading by example matters to company cultureOf course, this culture of accountability starts at the top. Transparency has always been a cornerstone of my leadership style. I'm honest and upfront, and I will call you on your stuff if it's necessary.


This honesty isn't intended to be harsh. It truly comes from a place of caring. My team knows that I genuinely care about them and the goals we're aiming to achieve. My commitment to openness extends to all aspects of our business, even during challenging times.For example, in the early days at Carbliss, we lost significant amounts of money. I decided right away that I didn't want to hide it. We laid it all out for the team, explaining that we had anticipated this phase and had a plan. By sharing this openly, we kept the team informed and helped them understand that the plan was to burn cash and that is simply another part of our journey, not a reason to panic.This transparency built trust and reinforced the idea that we're all in it together. It also created a culture of resilience, a trait that leads to another critical aspect of leadership: guiding teams proactively rather than reactively.Driving a team to the next levelMotivation isn't a one-time push. It's an ongoing driving engine that propels people constantly. When the time comes for the engine to rev up, leaders need to be able to find what it takes to push their team forward.


To be an effective leader, you must ensure that everyone's ""cup is full"" — that they have the resources, guidance, and motivation they need. You must be the one showing the way to success, not shoving them towards it. When a team knows their leader is invested in their success and well-being, their motivation and performance naturally rise.Related: How to Improve Employee Motivation to Increases Your ProfitsHire the best leaders from the startThe most effective way to lead a team to success is to hire people who are already leaders themselves – individuals who resonate with your vision and values. As a business, every person you hire is an investment in your company in some way. It costs you money if you are not pushing your company forward with that hire.We prioritize hiring hungry, humble, and smart people. These self-motivated individuals often require less external inspiration because their own goals and ambitions drive them.


Leadership still occasionally recalibrates direction. That's expected. When you have a team that mirrors your ethics, leading becomes less about rah-rah motivation and more about guiding self-driven individuals toward a shared vision.Effective leadership doesn't have to be the kind of speech-making drama we see in movies or TV. There are other ways to motivate and inspire people. You don't need to be an inspirational leader to still be effective. Find your confidence and succeed in a leadership style that suits your goals and objectives.

4,The Simple Thing That the Owners of This Pizza Spot Do Every Day That Put Them on Yelp's Top 100 List Three Years in a Row,"Apr 18, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-secret-sauce-of-this-pizza-spots-success/472903,"
When the Farrugio family opened il Canale in Washington, D.C. in 2010, their goal was to make the best pizza in the world.Giuseppe Farrugio, who's known as Joe, immigrated to the United States in the 1970s and has been working in the pizza business ever since. Having owned and worked at several Italian-American spots, he saw il Canale as his opportunity to provide a more authentic, Neapolitan-style experience to D.C. diners while working alongside his son, Alessandro. Listen to the Behind the Review episode below to hear directly from Alessandro and Sydney and learn their recipe for success.The Secret SauceThe Farrugio family knew a key part of achieving their goal was sourcing quality ingredients. Il Canale's flour, tomato sauce, and mozzarella are all organic and imported directly from Italy.



Beyond good food, the restaurant offers a warm environment and quick service, making for a high-quality dining experience. Despite serving thousands of people each week, the Farrugio family and their staff make sure to personally greet and check in on their diners throughout the meal. This is part of what makes the il Canale experience so special for Yelp Elite and Community Manager Sydney G.""There's always a member of the family to greet you,"" she said. ""I've been for dinner, lunch, and happy hour, so I feel like I've gotten a really good experience across the board of the different service options. They do a great job of walking you through the menu.""


Related: The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers Not to Be QuietManaging a team of hundreds of employees isn't easy. Co-owner and general manager Alessandro has found success by focusing on thorough training, thoughtful hiring, and achieving work-life balance. He makes sure to not only support his staff with key resources while they're on the clock but also to hire enough people to give both himself and his team the time off they need to recharge.""We just try to [be] a family. We try to be supportive. The biggest challenge is having such a large team and having every single person follow your vision, follow your path, follow the requests that you make. But it's just [about] providing the tools, providing the resources.""Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront


Another one of Alessandro's strengths as a business owner is that he's always willing to try new things. When he noticed some diners weren't just looking for a pizza place but for a full-service Italian restaurant, he added new items, including gluten-free pastas and premium Italian wines, to the menu. This has allowed the restaurant to attract a wider clientele that includes locals and tourists alike.""It's nice when you have a big table. A few guests are gluten free, a few guests are not, maybe [some are] vegetarian or vegan, and everybody looks on their menu and they find something that they like,"" he said.Il Canale is also not afraid to find new ways of connecting with customers. Sydney admires the restaurant's eagerness to use a variety of marketing tools, including Yelp products and resources, social media campaigns, and conversations with as many guests as they can.""One of the ways you stay successful is to just never stop innovating and trying new things,"" Sydney said. ""If it doesn't work, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try something else, because you never know what is going to reach somebody.""


Along with using paid features like Yelp Connect to share custom posts and photos with his customers, Alessandro uses Yelp reviews to keep a pulse on his business. With the Yelp for Business app on his phone, he receives a stream of notifications that alert him to any issues and give him a confidence boost when he gets positive feedback.Reviews paint the most accurate and current picture of a business, helping both owners and future customers make informed decisions. Even when you're visiting a restaurant like il Canale, which has thousands of reviews, adding your voice to the conversation is a valuable way to contribute to the Yelp community.""Things change over the years,"" Sydney said. ""Businesses evolve, menu items change, service turns over, especially how things work pre-pandemic to now. So you really want to make sure that you're giving people the most up-to-date information based on your experience.""Although Alessandro enjoys getting an overview of his restaurant's performance through reviews, he also makes an effort to check in with diners during their experience to make sure everything is to their liking.


For the customer's part, Sydney recommends diners speak up while they're in the restaurant so staff can address issues right away. Mix-ups are not uncommon in the restaurant world, and providing in-the-moment feedback can be incredibly rewarding for both the diner and the restaurant. For example, Sydney mentioned in her review that she received the wrong dessert. While she didn't bring this up to il Canale staff because it didn't have a huge impact on her experience, she wishes she had.""They take service so seriously. I know they would have rectified it and made it right with us. I kind of robbed them of that opportunity by not saying something. People are human and there [are] plenty of ways to bring it up without being rude and give them the opportunity to fix it so that everybody walks away having a positive experience.""Related: The Owners of This Texas Farmers Market Took a Big Gamble. Here's How It Paid Off Bigger Than They Dreamed.By focusing on quality food, service, and marketing, il Canale has earned a spot on three Yelp Top 100 lists over the last three years. Most recently, the restaurant achieved #14 on the Top Pizza Spots list, which is voted on by Yelp Elites. These accolades encourage Alessandro to keep thinking about how he can elevate his offerings.


""It sets our bar higher because we know the next year we need to do something better. Il Canale five years ago, six years ago, seven years ago is not the il Canale today. We're continuously evolving, continuously getting better, continuously increasing our standards.""In addition to investing in quality food and service, il Canale believes in:Staying on top of customer trends and requests.

5,How New Businesses Can Create a Content Marketing Strategy,"Apr 18, 2024",Daria Gonzalez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/8-things-tech-startups-must-do-before-creating-a-content/463170,"
Wherever you are in your business journey, you'll need a content strategy to communicate with external and internal audiences — whether they're potential customers, new employees or other industry experts. As your business grows, your content strategy will naturally evolve. Using the tips below — which range from launching a content strategy plan to optimizing for audience growth — you can prepare for that evolution.Getting Started1. Build your strategy from the ground upInvesting in content creation might not feel like a priority when you're just starting out, but the impact of a well-executed strategy can be immense. If you have a limited marketing budget, content is a cost-effective way to reach your target audience compared to paid advertising.Moreover, it can showcase traction with potential customers. If you're courting investors, the success of your content can be used as proof of the popularity of your product. You will also benefit from early audience discovery by monitoring how your customers respond to your messaging, thus gaining a better understanding of what resonates with them.



2. Avoid shortcutsIf you fail to create a strategy from scratch, you'll risk producing inconsistent messaging. Instead of a haphazard approach, start with a concept the whole company can buy into. Don't assume you know your audience intimately; gather data to build a comprehensive understanding of who you're aiming to reach so you can create content that resonates. As you grow, monitor which methods are working or failing. Then, you can make informed decisions about your strategy based on performance.3. Understand your audienceThere are two approaches to use when defining your target audience. The problem-solving approach considers your customers' pain points and how your brand's solution is different from your competitors. The customer-persona approach is about creating a hypothetical representation of your brand's ideal customer based on research and data. By understanding your customers' motivations and needs, you can tailor your messaging and offerings to better meet those needs and stand out from the competition.Related: How Buyer Personas Can Transform Your Marketing and Get Results4. Look inward, not outwardA robust content strategy begins with looking at your own brand, not at your competitors'. Make sure you're answering these questions when building out your strategy:What's your business vision and mission? This relates to your company's values, culture and purpose.How would you describe your brand's personality? This pertains to the human characteristics attributed to your brand.How would you define your brand's voice? This is about how your brand sounds to customers.Being able to definitively answer these questions will help you express your brand value to external audiences.5. Know your value proposition and unique sales propositionsOnly after you've studied your company's internal characteristics is it time to look outward and see how you compare to competitors. Your value proposition and unique sales propositions (USPs) will help form the basis of your content strategy. Your value proposition is based on information about what your competitors are offering. It's important to understand their strengths and weaknesses so you can articulate why your brand offers a better solution. Your unique sales propositions augment the value proposition by defining the specific features and benefits that make your products stand out.


6. Establish realistic and measurable goalsYour business goals will inform the goals of your content strategy. To help set strategic goals, start with a realistic planning time frame. For example, six months gives you enough time to gain momentum, test out different hypotheses and track performance. A long-term approach helps you focus on building a solid foundation instead of looking for quick results. Content can take a while to ramp up, but if you approach it with a long-term perspective, you'll eventually reap the benefits.7. Transition from content strategy to content planWhen executing your plan, one of the first steps is identifying your priority marketing channels — which will be determined by what your research has told you about your audience. These channels may include your website, email, various social media platforms or even mailers. Then, it's time to map your content-posting schedule to an editorial calendar, keeping in mind the themes that most resonate with your audience. By creating a content calendar, you can ensure that your content is consistent, relevant and serves your overall goals.8. Measure, track and optimize contentA data-driven approach is essential. By tracking your strategy's performance, you can see trends and tweak accordingly to improve the traction of your content. Depending on your goals, you'll need to measure key performance indicators (KPIs), including website traffic, social engagement, conversion rates and lead generation. Here's the case for data-driven content marketing success:With data, you can make more informed decisions about your content and improve how you're targeting your audience.Data helps you better understand your customer's journey and develop more personalized content that speaks to their specific needs.By understanding what's working and what's not, you can avoid spending time and money on content that doesn't perform well.Data helps you optimize your content distribution strategy to reach your target audience with the right message at the right time.Data can help you track progress over time and see how your content marketing efforts impact the bottom line.Related: 7 Crucial Metrics to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Your Marketing CampaignsTypes of ContentThe difference between content and content marketingOn the internet, content is anything that expresses thoughts, information or experiences through written, visual or audio media. The photos uploaded to Instagram are content. The videos uploaded to YouTube are content. This article is content.Content marketing, on the other hand, is a strategic approach to marketing that emphasizes the creation and delivery of valuable information or ideas to attract, retain and convert a clearly defined audience.Content marketing can take many forms — email, social media, case studies and blogs — but it's differentiated from mere content by strategically providing solutions to your audience's problems — with the goal of raising the profile of your company and its products or solutions. If you're putting your audience first, addressing pain points and producing exceptional content, then you'll grow your brand while also cultivating authority and trust. That's content marketing.The difference between thought leadership and content marketingThought leadership garners a lot of attention among entrepreneurs and those aiming to pick up more traction and increase brand recognition. Content marketing serves a similar purpose, but many people are unsure what the differences between the two are. The four primary factors that differentiate them are as follows:


Content marketing is top-down. Typically, content marketers are businesses talking to potential customers or clients. Thought leadership, on the other hand, is peer-to-peer. The objective of content marketing strategies is ultimately to sell a product or service. With thought leadership, the primary goal is not to sell but rather to create a business relationship.Big ideas matter. Although content marketing aims to provide value to readers, thought leaders must offer something groundbreaking. If you call yourself a thought leader, you must present deeper insights than your competitors.Thought leadership is higher in the sales funnel. Thought leadership is often deployed by large organizations selling high-ticket items in a complex and long-lasting sales process. When thought leadership is deployed, the central objective is to make an impression that presents the author and their company as experts.Content marketing is published on your platforms. Thought leadership is often published in industry publications, which means the writing style tends to be less promotional.What is premium content?Premium content is any content format meant to be higher quality, more in-depth or more valuable than what you typically produce. Some of the most common examples of premium content include ebooks, white papers, original research and online courses. This is the type of content your audience might pay for while they could read a blog post for free. Producing these valuable content types might help you generate leads, as people are more willing to volunteer their information if they gain access to high-quality content like a white paper.What is snackable content?Snackable content is uncomplicated and short-form content that can be digested quickly — like a snack. Its origins stem from social media, where infographics, memes, GIFs and reels now dominate user feeds. It doesn't require effort from users to read or engage with, but it also can provide awareness of your business.Because of its ability to capture users' attention, snackable content on your website — maybe via an infographic, listicle or fun quiz — can drive users to your website and keep them there. Snackable content is also mobile-friendly, which can draw larger audiences. It can even improve your search engine optimization (SEO) strategy, helping more people find you in the first place.Driving EngagementWhat is quality content?Quality should always be your top content priority. Search engines like Google reward helpful, reliable, people-first content, but even more importantly, quality content significantly affects your readers and customers. Content should be original and easy to read with no spelling or grammatical issues. It should also be relevant and timeless. When it comes to SEO, consider these critical factors:Traits of quality contentLength: In general, blog posts and articles should be 1,000 to 3,000 words. Landing pages or description pages perform better at 300 to 500 words.Structure: Format your content using title (H1) and subheader (H2 and greater) tags. This semantic structure boosts your SEO score.Links: Linking to internal and authoritative external webpages increases traffic and performance.Keywords (and keyword density): Using keywords relevant to your topic is critical. But be careful. A keyword density that is too high can lower your SEO ranking (experts generally recommend a density between 1% and 2%).Usefulness: Create content that features original research with comprehensive insights that go beyond what else will appear in search results.Meta title and description: A catchy meta title and description that includes your primary keyword or phrase will attract readers.How to optimize quality controlBe sure to review each piece of content before it's published. This takes time, but it's essential to consistently produce quality work. Follow these guidelines for each piece of published content:Organize your workflow: Use tools that allow you to manage content formats and run it through a pipeline of drafting, editing, revising and publishing. Involve other team members in the workflow to ensure enough people see each piece of content.Avoid plagiarism: Plagiarism isn't just an ethical or quality concern; search engine algorithms downgrade pilfered content. Use plagiarism checkers to ensure your content is unique.Eliminate spelling and grammar mistakes: Ideally, you should hire an editor to proofread your content and catch typos, syntax, diction and grammatical errors. If you don't have an editor, take advantage of online tools. Many products can help you clean up your writing.How to create viral contentMany brands want their content to go viral, but whether this happens or not is out of their control. There's no switch you can flip that will create a viral moment, but these seven factors will give your content better odds of taking off:High emotions: According to a study from the Journal of Marketing Research, content that leaves readers awe-inspired, excited, angry or amused is more likely to be shared than low-arousal content that evokes contentment or sadness.Practicality: Useful and educational content is also more likely to go viral, as people enjoy sharing this type of content for altruistic reasons. This is part of the reason that ""how-to"" lists perform so well.Readability: Your content might contain groundbreaking information, but it's useless if it's too dense. Run your work through a readability test and aim for a reading comprehension level of an eighth grader.Power words: Inserting power words with emotional triggers into your title and introduction will help hook your audience and get them to share the content. Here's a list with more than 800 examples.Trustworthiness: People share credible content. You can build trust in your content by quoting experts in your field and citing statistics and sources.Visual appeal: As with readability, layout matters. Readers typically want easy-to-navigate websites with clean designs and consistent visual elements.Timeliness: When you post is as important as what you post. Research your audience's behavior and site traffic so you can deliver and promote valuable content during peak hours.Content promotion tipsReaching a large audience requires you to devote resources to promoting your work — on social media channels, through email and elsewhere. Although the content itself is the bedrock of your marketing strategy, promotion is also paramount.The case for content promotion:Good content is useless in a vacuum. If you've just launched a blog, people won't find it unless you spend at least some time and money on promotion. Because of this, early-stage content promotion is essential.Promotion is (arguably) less expensive than creation. When you pay for content creation, you're taking a bit of a gamble because there's no guarantee that your content will function as intended. But when you pay on a per-click basis for advertising, you practically guarantee a stream of visitors to your website.Promotion can maximize your creation investment. Even if you have only a few pieces of content, continued adaptation and promotional investment can help you reap more value from your content creation over time.Keys to being successful in content marketing:Start with a strong foundation. If your blog is empty or if its content is hard to understand, no promotional strategy in the world will be able to salvage it. At a minimum, you should have at least a few strong resources on your website that people perceive as authoritative and trustworthy.Promote strategically. You don't need to spend large amounts of money to see results as long as you're strategic. Focus on platforms where you've traditionally seen strong engagement, or exclusively promote content that is already well-received by your followers.Learn and adapt. Perhaps most importantly, you must study your content marketing metrics to learn which of your investments is paying off. Is your content creation investment seeing a better return than your promotional investment? If you can answer this question, you can make better content marketing decisions.Refining Your ApproachAs your marketing strategy evolves, it's important to implement tools and strategies that will make content production more efficient and, ultimately, more lucrative. You don't need to have every tool and strategy in place on day one, but it's important to refine your operation as you grow.


Content marketing toolsThere are countless tools and software products for marketers — some of which are more essential than others. To help you determine what you actually need, here are nine of the most important types of content marketing tools:Content management system (CMS): WordPress is perhaps the most well-known CMS, but many platforms allow you to manage online content and give access to contributors. A good CMS lets content teams create content without needing to be a coding expert.Customer relationship management system (CRM): A CRM is used to manage a company's relationships and ultimately close more business. Several companies offer CRMs, including Salesforce, HubSpot and Marketo, but you'll need to do significant research before selecting the right option.Email marketing platform: It's essential to be able to reach your customers with email — via a regular newsletter or one-off updates. A good email marketing platform will offer CRM integration, allow you to manage customer and prospect information and track key metrics, such as click-through and open rates.Marketing automation system: Several aspects of marketing, including social media posts, email and lead generation, can be automated with the right software. Ideally, it should also be easy to use and integrate with your CRM and other tools.Key performance indicator tracker: KPIs are the most important metrics that your business strategy is being measured against, like revenue, contact form submissions, inbound leads and more. You can create your own with a spreadsheet or use a pre-made tracker.Project management software: Project management software is used for project planning, content workflow scheduling and allocating resources. Asana, Monday and Trello are some options, but you can also create your own system.Design software: Creative work often requires some sort of graphic design, and using software such as Canva or Adobe will be key. With the right design tools, you can ensure your visual content captures your audience's attention.Analytics software: You'll need an analytics tool to report how your content channels perform and how your campaigns influence revenue. Without one, you won't have data to track your KPIs. Google Analytics is perhaps the most well-known tool, but there are plenty of others to choose from.Social media management software: A social media management platform provides an efficient way to create and schedule posts across a variety of social channels. HubSpot, Hootsuite and Buffer are a few of the more well-known tools, but there are many others.How to write compelling content that convertsOnline readers are bombarded with information and selective about the content they consume. The way you write has a major impact on if you'll attract an audience. Your content should provide valuable information and answers to consumers and needs to strike a tone that connects with them.To accomplish this, follow these two pillars of great website content:Use a conversational tone: Focusing on conversational content throughout your website copy can help you open an ongoing dialogue with your followers, improve brand awareness and encourage engagement. This is why you see businesses incorporating user-generated content like customer feedback, testimonials and snippets from reviews on their websites — it backs up the claims they make about their product or service.Incorporate storytelling: Every aspect of online marketing goes back to storytelling. People love good stories. You can have an excellent product, service and team, but if you're not able to tell a good story about your company, you'll lose out on your audience. This might include your origin story, a testimonial from an employee or an example of how your product changed someone's life.Content monetization strategiesAlthough content marketing efforts can build awareness and ultimately lead to sales, they can also be a revenue driver on their own. If you're writing blog posts, recording a podcast or live streaming on a regular basis, you can use most of these strategies to make money:Direct advertising: If you're producing enough content, you'll likely be able to sell ads. It's a simple strategy, but be careful: Your audience might not appreciate being inundated with ads.Sponsorships/affiliate links: With sponsorships, you'll make money by talking about specific products or featuring someone else's content for free. With affiliate links in your content, you'll generate revenue as a percentage of the sales you influence.Donations: Platforms like Patreon make it easy for content creators to accept donations for their continued work, and platforms like Twitch have a built-in donation option.Premium content: You can also make money with optional premium content that's more in-depth or exclusive than your typical work. Bloggers often provide premium content in the form of an ebook or collection.Subscriptions: Depending on the nature of your content, readers might be interested in an ad-free experience via a paid subscription. A subscription could also grant your audience access to an entirely different content feed.Merchandise: If you have a large following, selling products like shirts, hats or mugs with your branding can generate revenue and give you a platform for free advertising.Exclusive rights: If your content gains a big enough audience, a platform might pay you to use its platform exclusively, preventing its competition from capitalizing. These deals are rare but lucrative.Now that you understand the basics of creating — and implementing — a content marketing program, it's time to produce and promote your work. Conduct research to understand your audience, use analytics to measure your goals and use the tools and strategies in this guide to help you along the way. Soon, your content strategy will be firing on all cylinders.

6,Successful Brands Use These 4 Radical Practices to Attract Loyal Customers,"Apr 17, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-successful-brands-should-embrace-radical-transparency/472395,"
In today's marketplace, consumer trust has become paramount for businesses seeking lasting success. A study by Edelman found that 81% of buyers cite brand trust as a deciding factor in their loyalties and purchasing behaviors. With the proliferation of information sources, companies can no longer maintain opaque practices obscuring key details. They must operate in full transparency to earn customer confidence and allegiance.As the CEO of Carbliss, an alcoholic beverage brand, I've witnessed firsthand how radical transparency around all production and business operations drives powerful consumer loyalty and business growth. From our earliest days, we committed to an unwavering open-book approach that has helped cement valuable, long-lasting relationships with our customer base. Below are the four criteria and best practices we prioritize to maintain transparency and customer loyalty.1. Hands-on customer dialogueToday's empowered consumers can easily see right through that disingenuous smokescreen. What they crave from the brands they embrace is true candor about every key aspect, including the ingredients, sourcing practices, pricing rationale, regulatory challenges, and more underpinning the products they consume.



One key way I nurture this culture of authenticity is by being directly involved with a huge volume of customer inquiries myself. This past year alone, I answered around 8,000 emails from Carbliss distributors, retailers, consumers and fans.Ongoing candid dialogue is critical for comprehensively understanding how customers perceive our brand identity, product qualities, and customer service experiences in an unfiltered way.


Through raw, unapologetic honesty in these interactions, even when the facts may be unfavorable or unpleasant for the customer to accept, we actively cultivate invaluable trust. The simple truth is that you cannot build enduring customer loyalty through automated and impersonal responses or convoluted corporate jargon.Related: Don't Talk to Another Customer Until You Learn This Simple Customer Service Secret2. Shining light on complexitiesEmbracing this level of radical transparency means being prepared sometimes to face intense scrutiny from confused, perhaps deflated customers seeking simpler truths. We've found that the payoff is an extraordinarily powerful brand reputation anchored in truth that ultimately breeds sacred trust and loyalty.At my company, we willingly spotlight the very details that other brands may conceal or try to downplay, like our need to use ""artificially colored"" labels on cans despite the colors being derived from natural sources, like the brilliant blue of butterfly pea flowers.


We take every opportunity to explain the nuances of regulatory complexities that result in obligatory technical labeling jargon. We balance that by reaffirming our core principles of prioritizing high-quality ingredients that we legitimately consume ourselves and provide to friends and family without hesitation.3. A culture of authenticityAs you grow and scale, it's important to maintain transparency throughout your team. This can be in the form of understanding the intricacies of the product, the runway to profitability, or the purpose of their unique role in the overall strategy. Our employees, regardless of role, deeply understand the ingredients, sourcing, and production methods behind our products so they can convey that knowledge accurately and credibly in their customer-interactions activities.Our detailed FAQ content clarifies common misconceptions, from our avoidance of artificial colors to our premium pricing rationale based on operational costs and premium product positioning. While some buyers may be dismayed at certain realities we present, we insist on honesty because we've learned it's the only path to fostering long-term customer understanding, respect and allegiance.Related: How to Lead With Authenticity and Build a Thriving Workplace


4. Transparent best practicesFor companies in any industry aspiring to foster powerful brand loyalty by operating in total transparency, below are my personal principles:Be unconditionally open about all business practices by prioritizing clear, forthright communication with customers at every opportunityHave customer-interaction teams be prepared to personally respond to every inquiry with unvarnished candor, excluding no unpleasant truthsThoroughly educate and train all employees on the paramount importance of authenticity in all their customer-interaction words and actions.Embrace both positive and negative customer feedback as a welcome opportunity to demonstrate a real commitment to constant improvement.Ensure all marketing content and messaging accurately reflects the true nature of your products, services, and practices without ambiguity.Be unafraid to openly discuss your company's genuine challenges, as this humanizes the brand relationship.Related: 5 Examples of Companies Succeeding Through TransparencyWeathering backlash to cultivate loyaltyCertainly, this radical embrace of transparency sometimes means facing backlash from those who are displeased with newly revealed information that clashes with their expectations. Cultivated ironclad trust and loyalty far outweigh any short-term friction. When you deal truthfully and withhold nothing from your customers, you attract buyers aligned with your values who appreciate your courage and unwavering integrity.If you're ready to foster true customer loyalty and propel sustainable growth, it's time to embrace radical transparency across your organization. Don't complicate realities; shine a light on every aspect of your products, operations, and business practices. Deal in truth relentlessly, even when facing scrutiny. Your authentic soul and unwavering integrity will attract devoted brand advocates aligned with your values.

8,Jon Bon Jovi and His Son Jesse Want You to Play 'Pink Pong' With Their Top-Rated Rosé This Summer. You Game?,"Apr 15, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-jon-bon-jovi-and-his-son-jesses-rose-is-built-for-fun/472478,"
This week The CEO Series brought us to New York City where I got to play a heated game of ""pink pong"" against Jesse Bongiovi, the co-founder of Hampton Water, the highest-rated French rosé in America. Jesse started this company with his dad, Jon Bon Jovi, who you may know as the world-famous musician, back in 2018 and since its launch, the brand has won a ton of accolades and has stocked a ton of wine fridges — it's currently the country's third best-selling French rosé.Watch the video above to learn all about the launch and explosive growth of this company, and to find out which of us was crowned the pink pong champ!Origin of the company""I came up with the concept back in 2016. My family had a place out in East Hampton, on the east end of Long Island, for basically my whole life. And the running joke out there was that people drank more rosé than they drank water. My family was no different. And once I turned 21, I started to realize that my friends were showing up with bottles of rosé at bonfires and pool parties. But they were not buying the high-end, classic stuff. They were too intimidated, and it was too expensive. But the liquid was nowhere near as quality as these high-end French rosés, so I started to form this idea that you could create a lifestyle brand, and bridge the gap between high-quality wines and brands like White Girl Rosé and Babe Rosé. So I designed the label, designed the bottle, and came up with this concept of the Hampton Life. We partnered with Gerard Bertrand in 2018 to make the liquid. It is a French Provence style rosé, grown in the Languedoc region.""Related: A Look Inside the Company That Is Making $500 Million a Year Serving Italian Beef Sandwiches Made Famous by 'The Bear'A family passion""For us, this is not a celebrity brand. It's a family business. And the important thing about our storytelling as a brand has always been the father-son story. Our message has always been that we're a French rosé that speaks to you in a way that no other French rosé does. We have incredible ratings. We have a unique-looking name and label. And oh, by the way, this is the guy that brought it to you. And so that's always been the cherry on top. It's never been what we lead with. Now, does it help that my father is who he is? I'm not too proud to say that it's not a great way to get our foot in the door. But what we realized right away is that all the press and attention is great, but in the end, it needs to taste great and that's what has people coming back to buy another bottle.""



Thinking outside the bottle""This brand is about fun. Playing pink pong and things like that. No other rosé brand is doing this kind of stuff. For me, it's all about inspiring you to have a good time while you're drinking this. Are you creating great memories? Are you spending time with those that you love? We want to break down that barrier of entry to make it so that it's approachable, to make it so that it's fun, to make it so that a 23-year-old who has never bought a high-quality 90-point-rated wine wants to give it a try.""Check out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

9,Strong Leaders Use These 4 Strategies to Build Trust in Their Workplace,"Apr 11, 2024",Max Azarov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/good-leaders-use-these-four-strategies-to-build-trust/472051,"
More people are working remotely these days, and there are many tools that business owners can use to help their teams stay on track with their workloads, no matter where they are based. But the secret sauce to making a remote or hybrid team work well together isn't technology; it's trust.According to a 2023 study by WFH Research, approximately 13% of people employed full-time work from home 100% of the time, and 28% of this group of people split their time between home and the office. This remote work trend is huge in tech, finance and administrative office-based jobs.There's still some debate about whether everyone should return to the office, but most people agree that a mix of home and office work will probably become the norm. Why? Companies are seeing proof that amending their policies to allow people to work remotely can boost productivity and profits while keeping employees happy and balanced. It's a win-win!



Trust, not micromanagement, is the key to successBuilding trust is crucial for peak performance, whether your company goes fully remote, hybrid or follows another model. Research backs this up loud and clear.Studies by Paul J. Zak, a Harvard-trained neuro-economist, show that employees in high-trust workplaces are more productive, collaborative and loyal. They're also happier and less stressed, leading to even better results. This ""trust over surveillance"" approach is echoed by leaders like Dropbox CEO Drew Houston, whose company thrives with a 90% remote workforce.


Novakid, a fully remote international company, has achieved success by implementing specific strategies that foster trust between managers and remote staff. The following tactics can be used by any business leader who is establishing a thriving remote team.Related: 5 Ways To Establish Trust In a Remote Workplace1. Building trust is the secret weaponStudies show a clear link between trust (think of it as social glue) and strong economies – and that applies to companies too. But for trust to take root, leaders need to genuinely believe in it themselves. You can't build a trusting company culture (remote, hybrid or in-office) if you're constantly second-guessing your team.The key is finding the right balance. Trust your employees to be responsible, and empower them with the tools they need to do their jobs well (think project management software and clear communication channels). But don't be naive – some monitoring is essential to identify any performance issues.


Create a system where everyone feels accountable. It should be easy to flag unresponsive colleagues or missed deadlines. This can be done via workforce productivity and workflow management tools. Most importantly, this can be done by fostering a culture where everyone feels comfortable speaking up about concerns.2. Hiring for trust and autonomyJob interviews are a way to find great people who fit your company culture, especially people who thrive with the freedom that comes from trust.Sharpen your HR processes and interviewing skills. Learn to ask questions that tell the real story – can they handle a challenge, how do they deal with mistakes, are they team players? Look for both their skills and their personality – watch body language and see if their answers align with your values of trust and honesty.Once you find the right fit, onboarding should be smooth. Don't overwhelm new hires on the first day – explain their role, set expectations, provide all relevant materials they will need for their job and then step back. Trust them to get up to speed. They'll appreciate the freedom and responsibility, and it sets the stage for a trusting work style.


Related: 6 Ways to Encourage Autonomy With Your Employees3. Keeping everyone on the same pageBuilding a team that holds itself accountable is key, no matter your work style. Here's how:Set clear expectations: Make sure everyone knows what's expected of them.Open communication: Keep the door open – your team needs to feel comfortable talking to you.Regular feedback: Give regular check-ins to identify any roadblocks. Be honest and clear if something needs improvement.Accountability can be difficult to implement and manage within fully remote teams. The key is finding the balance: empower your team with autonomy, but don't be afraid to address performance issues. You don't want to micromanage, but some oversight is necessary. The bottom line is that if someone consistently underperforms, it's important to take action, up to and including firing them. This shows everyone that you take accountability seriously.4. Focus on results, not busyworkForget about micromanaging with time trackers or spy software. The best way to gauge performance remotely is to set clear job duties, deadlines and expected outputs.


Remote teams already use project management and workflow tools. These can show you if someone's falling behind, but constant monitoring isn't the answer.Tracking software can creep into employees' personal lives, and that's a big no-no. Trust your team to get their work done – let them figure out how to be most productive. Maybe that means working in bursts or outside typical hours. Micromanaging with monitoring tools just makes people unhappy and unproductive, and according to a Deloitte report, is fueling the ""quiet quitting"" trend.

10,AI-Generated Images or Stock Photography? Here's How Entrepreneurs Can Navigate the Dynamic Photography Industry,"Apr 10, 2024",Serban Enache,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-entrepreneurs-can-leverage-ai-for-gains-in-stock/469400,"
As an entrepreneur, you are familiar with the quest to build something that works financially, preferably in the long term. Stock photography, a market evaluated at $4 billion in 2023, has been a reliable passive income source for years. But with AI-generated content emerging, should you trade off your camera for a photoshop-like algorithm?The established powerhouse of stock photographyStock photography is a proven way to monetize your artistic vision. Platforms connect you to a vast marketplace of millions of potential buyers. You upload your work once and earn from it repeatedly and indefinitely. One image alone can earn you hundreds or thousands of dollars from royalty-free sales.Moreover, stock photo platforms provide licensing agreements, indemnification and a clear legal framework for your business, reducing subsequent legal risks for all parties involved.



Related: How Modern Entrepreneurs Can Capitalize on Image and Video SearchesThe legal and ethical considerations of AIAI-generated content is the new kid on the block, bringing opportunities and challenges. Many companies have started selling generative AI while needing to learn more about stock photography requirements.


As such, this new exciting frontier is not without its legal difficulties, particularly concerning copyright ownership, the risk of infringing on intellectual property rights and the necessity for consent from people or models — issues that traditionally created content doesn't raise.AI tools have been trained and are still mostly training on existing images, raising questions about authors' permissions. Without clear transparency and compensation mechanisms, most artists have not and still do not green-light their work for AI training or usage, on the contrary. So, how do you know how much or to what extent your AI-prompted image is derivative of another artist's intellectual property? And what, if any, are the liabilities for you? Can you safely and legally generate images of people? Any unauthorized commercial and even editorial use of an individual's likeness could have significant legal consequences for you and your clients.Furthermore, who does the copyright belong to: the AI developers, you, or someone else? A recent ruling says you can't copyright AI work, so creators using such tools are mere… tools. When using AI to generate content, you may find yourself in a less clear legal position: image prompter versus indisputable copyright owner.Real vs. GeneratedFor image entrepreneurs, success lies in creating distinctive visuals. Established industry names have signature styles perfected over the years. The AI mainly replicates techniques and styles in a hyper-realistic way, with results that dilute artistic trademark, perhaps to exhaustion, eventually failing to produce authentic, diverse imagery. The critical question arises: what becomes of creativity when the marketplace is flooded with too-similar-looking images due to the widespread use of AI? Market saturation affects sales, so taking a unique approach to your work becomes a matter of artistic integrity and a necessity for your commercial success.


AI could work for abstract concepts for image shoppers, but conveying authenticity through AI remains difficult. Audiences crave authenticity, and they need relatable visuals. Genuine authenticity comes from the nuanced perspectives of individuals who can understand and capture the broader context. Audiences can not only spot the real versus the fabricated but relying on AI-generated images can backfire heavily on brands or services.Many customers buy visuals with high SEO results in mind. Original photos with reliable metadata are a big win, and using natural-looking photos will boost user engagement. Because AI-generated content may lead to content removal, original stock photos save your clients from serious SEO headaches.AI-generated visuals often create ethical dilemmas about deception, misrepresentation and fake news in fields like journalism or historical documentation. Enhancing or modifying reality undermines credibility and authority and can harm your service.Related: I Tried 3 AI Headshot Generators, 1 Might Work for LinkedIn


Why you should work with ethical partners in visual storytellingWhether you are buying or selling imagery, stock photo platforms remain the most secure and reliable venue for high-quality and ethically sourced content. Stock photography is multifaceted, and AI has just started participating in this landscape.Explore different platforms, review their content acceptance policies and AI content approaches, and find the one that aligns with your goals and audience. Platforms usually prioritize ethical and legal content, ensure all uploaded images are original and copyright-protected, and review every photo before publication. You can be confident that you are licensing high-quality and ethically sound content.Moreover, these generative AI platforms are at the forefront of ethical discussions regarding content creation, especially in compensating copyright holders. By incorporating such content under clear ethical guidelines, they set a precedent for using AI and AI-generated content. Creators might be limited to using AI tools that provide full rights or be required to label AI visuals distinctively.Related: Deepfakes Are Lurking in 2024. Here's How to Navigate the Ever-growing AI Threat Landscape


The bigger pictureAI technology is about progress, and stock photography is ready to accept it, provided it benefits both creative communities and image shoppers. The industry's common understanding is that AI is a helping tool meant to enhance and enrich users' needs, whether in creating artwork or enhancing specific designs. AI is great for filling any voids left by photographed imagery, such as futuristic concepts, utopian landscapes, or envisioning hypothetical situations.However, the lack of an official regulatory system means image entrepreneurs, platforms and content users are still sailing uncharted waters. Before using AI for picture-perfect results, consider their benefits or drawbacks. Like content creation, content generation must be conducted responsibly, with informed judgment, and supported by legal foundations.Related: What's Stopping You From Using Generative AI in Your Business?Turn your passion into a thriving portfolioSo, is stock photography still relevant for entrepreneurial creators?

11,What Big Brands Can Learn From Mom & Pop Shops to Connect With Their Customers,"Apr 3, 2024",Ben Crudo,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/what-big-brands-can-learn-from-mom-and-pop-stores-to/470830,"
For online retailers, the pandemic sales surge is officially ancient history.Direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are filing for bankruptcy. Luxury retailers that raced online, like Louis Vuitton and Chanel, are licking their wounds. Globally, digital retail's share of total sales has flatlined at around 20%. If you're a big brand, the prognosis can look pretty grim unless, that is, you start thinking small. Online brands that are surviving and thriving are increasingly taking a page out of the playbook of much smaller retailers — especially when it comes to tech.As the founder of an agency that helps brands with ecommerce strategy, I've seen how smaller players are driven by the need to act fast and do more with less. That means adopting new and cost-effective tech before their larger peers. Resourceful and creative, retail small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are also intimately involved with their customers online. And unlike large companies, they don't have internal silos blocking their digital progress.



All of those strengths hold valuable lessons for big and growing retailers. Here's what they can learn from smaller brands when it comes to harnessing retail tech.Related: 4 Ways to Understand the Rise and Fall of DTC Brands


For your ecommerce platform, think speed and convenienceBecause they have to move fast, small retailers typically opt for an ecommerce platform that's robust, nimble and adaptable. The quicker they can stand up a site, and the less technical expertise required to sustain it, the better.Legacy enterprise platforms — costly, clunky and hard-to-customize — have long been the go-to for big brands. In the past, these were the only tools capable of reliably handling the volume of sales and SKUs of a major retailer. But that situation has changed.When the clothing retailer Banana Republic launched its furniture and home decor wing late last year, it went with an ecommerce platform originally known for serving small creators and entrepreneurs, Shopify.Why? At this point, every up-to-date platform has lots of bells and whistles. What actually matters isn't individual features as much as usability and flexibility. Does the platform have low barriers to launching a retail site? Does it have a robust app ecosystem that's integrated with its services? (Delivering on that front is Shopify, which has a marketplace of roughly 3,000 apps.) When it comes time to customize your site, does the platform have a host of agency and technology partners who can help get the job done?Think of choosing a platform like buying a car. You want something reliable, safe and easy to service — even if you may not know exactly how everything works under the hood.Outsource tech setup and customizationUnlike many other big retailers, Banana Republic also knew better than to build its own online platform. Major brands often fall into that trap, hiring huge engineering teams tasked with keeping ecommerce in-house.


News flash: Retailers aren't technology companies. They wouldn't rely on their in-house counsel to handle sensitive legal matters. So how is it any different for retail tech, a point of direct contact with customers?Retail SMBs are big fans of brand-new technology, with two-thirds saying they're open to embracing it. But startups know that the highest value comes from time spent on strategy, not getting in the weeds of implementation. That's why it's often better to outsource tech setup to an ecommerce agency.Because such firms typically deal with many different businesses, they have no shortage of tips and tricks to offer clients. They can also select the right platform, find the smart people a brand needs to compete online and play a key role in site customization.Related: 4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win Hearts


Invest in a direct line to customersSmaller online retailers also understand the power of using tech to connect directly with customers. This, after all, was the original promise of DTC commerce. Instead of sending your customers to a big box store or other middleman, you could cultivate a direct, personal relationship — providing better service and building lifetime loyalty in the process.To make the most of this pipeline, small retailers have long embraced tools that facilitate conversational commerce, i.e., one-on-one digital conversations with consumers. Way back in 2016, online clothing retailer Spring created its own live messaging and personal shopping service.Today, this trend continues. Because video, generative AI and other newer technologies for connecting with shoppers are affordable and accessible, smaller retailers have been first out of the gate with them, too. For example, energy drink startup EBoost is using shopper data to create ""digital twins"" of customers, then harnessing generative AI to chat with them, gaining insights into shoppers' future behavior.Small brands also excel at personalizing customer experiences and using technology to take this to the next level. This can take the form of everything from virtual appointments with in-store salespeople to fully personalized product recommendations based on customer history and preferences.Besides shrinking customer acquisition costs by as much as 50%, personalization can boost revenue by 5 to 15% and marketing ROI by 10 to 30%. Seven out of 10 consumers expect companies to offer personalized interactions, and three-quarters get frustrated when they don't deliver.Big brands are increasingly taking a page from this playbook. Through Nike By You, for instance, shoppers can create custom shoes by using a 3D model to choose colors and materials, plus their own ID.


Break down walls that hinder sales strategyBesides knowing their customers, small retailers have a clear, detailed picture of their ecommerce business itself — another strength that bigger players should strive to emulate.That's because their IT, customer service, merchandising and other departments are all — by necessity — in constant communication. So it's easier to see that the higher cost of drawing site traffic is hurting sales margins, for example, or that long shipping times are driving customers away. Smaller retailers can pounce on such problems and fix them.Big brands? Not so much. All of those business functions tend to be siloed, creating roadblocks that frustrate growth. In a recent survey by customer relationship management company Zendesk, only about one in five business leaders said their teams share data well.Here, too, choosing the right tools can help. Look for an ecommerce platform that gathers all of the crucial metrics — sales, conversion rate, visitor sessions — together in one place. It should also let retailers dig into and visualize that data with ease and then share it easily across the company.


For retail brands, technology is ultimately a means to an end: connecting with and serving customers. In a tough market, making smart tech choices can go a long way toward closing that gap.

12,Long Work Hours Lead to Burnout — Not Productivity. Learn When to Step Back From Certain Tasks — And When to Step Up,"Apr 3, 2024",Evgeny Kireev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/know-when-to-take-a-step-back-from-certain-tasks-and/470248,"
As an investor and entrepreneur with a number of business activities, I love what I do, but sometimes I wonder if I'm working too much. Entrepreneurs don't work office hours with guaranteed weekend downtime to relax and recharge with family and friends.Entrepreneurial fatigue is a reality for many of us, even if we don't recognize it or are reluctant to admit it, and being passionate about what you do as an entrepreneur means you never really switch off from work mode. But sometimes less really means more. So why should we learn to let go of the so-called work ""hustle culture,"" and what steps should we take to prevent it? Here are some lessons and strategies I have learned while navigating this harmful lifestyle.Related: How to Disrupt Hustle Culture and Build a Business That Supports Your Wellness



Doing too much gets in the way of your long-term growthA company that tries to do too much by way of products or services usually ends up doing none of them with excellence. Resources are spread too thin, goals become confused, and the results are often mediocre rather than outstanding.This holds true not only at a company level but also as an individual. Culturally, we have standardized the idea that being busy equates to being successful, and a jam-packed daily schedule creates the perception that our work must be important and that our time has great market value.


This emphasis on quantity over quality really has nothing to do with the actual work done or our engagement in it. In fact, the more commitments we have, the less we engage and the more stressed we become, with negative consequences at work and at home. Being busy doesn't mean being productive – truthfully, it can have the opposite effect.Why you need balanceAs entrepreneurs, we often find it difficult to maintain a good work-life balance, dedicating the appropriate time and space to our own emotional and spiritual well-being. Business owners with commitments to investors, clients and teams frequently fear that everything they have set in motion will simply grind to a halt without their constant input.You really can't do everything, and it's essential to learn to let go – hard as it may be. Ask yourself some critical questions and find honest answers about what you can let go, what you can delegate, and who can assist so that you are not overstretched.It's easy to convince yourself that you don't have time for hobbies, rest and self-care when, in fact, the truth is you haven't made them a priority. Do regular exercise, eat well and get adequate quality sleep — these will all reduce stress levels, improve creativity and ultimately benefit your business activities. It's okay to prioritize your health; it's essential for your long-term success.


Set up a routine that prioritizes ""me-time"" as much as other people's needs and to-do lists. Establish boundaries with partners, clients, and teams—let them know, and then stick to those limits without feeling guilty. Remember that experiences bring more happiness than possessions, so set goals of quality time and memorable moments with family and friends alongside your professional goals for your business.While I am passionate about game-changing, industry-disrupting, innovative enterprises, there may be such a thing as too much entrepreneurship. After all, anything in excess becomes a poison, and the startup phenomenon has certainly reached a fever pitch.Related: Hustle Culture Is Dying — And It Should Be. Here's How to Start Working Less.Prioritize important tasks based on their level of urgency and importanceThe hustle and the grind are modern concepts that promise success in return for hard work, long hours, and unwavering determination in a society that is more brutally competitive and intense than ever before. While there may be a million things to do in a new startup, many of them are unnecessary and fundamentally a waste of time.


If you want to win the game as an entrepreneur, you need to focus on the few activities that are truly essential—the ones that actually grow and prosper your business—while finding other solutions for administrative tasks, unnecessary calls and meetings, and ""busywork"" activities.Don't lose sight of your most important assetSurveys have shown that business owners spend, on average, 40% of their working time on activities that don't actually contribute to making their business grow bigger and better. If you want to be an effective entrepreneur, differentiate between spending time on your business and spending time in it. Focus on the former, the strategic work that actually builds your business, and get someone else to do the rest.Many entrepreneurs, particularly first-timers, also make the huge mistake of spending too much time chasing funding. Remember that your business is your customers, not your investors, so don't let fundraising take priority over developing and selling products and building relationships with customers. As an investor myself, I look for people who are good at selling a product or service — not good at selling me a business idea.Do what you do best and do what you love, because excellence in your areas of expertise generates what psychologists call ""achievement motivation"", and this is a predictor of success in business. Focus on what empowers you and avoid what discourages you. Don't listen to everyone — this can be tiring and confusing — but always listen to your customers. They are one of your most valuable business assets, they've experienced what you offer, and they know an aspect of your business that you need to understand as fully as possible.


Your vision is your destination, and strategy is the adaptable route that will get you there. Be flexible and change your strategy as you acquire new information, but keep your vision firm and don't let it be altered by distractions along the way.Silence the noise to achieve successWhile there are huge benefits to being able to work anywhere and anytime, it can also mean we unintentionally end up working everywhere, and all the time with a plate that's so full we risk burnout. Focus is a core factor of success, so focus on what aligns with your goals while learning to say ""no"" to things that aren't critical to achieving those goals.This is not being negative; it's being strategic.

Spencer Rascoff has some advice on that — because he's seen it from all sides.As a founder, he first cofounded the travel-booking site Hotwire, which he sold to Expedia. He then cofounded Zillow, which helped reshape nothing smaller than the real-estate market, and served as its CEO for nearly a decade.

      Key Takeaways    



        When I think about the most successful entrepreneurs I know, I realized they say ""no"" to many opportunities.
      


        While it feels counterintuitive, the most crucial question to ask is: ""What won't we do?"" 
      


        Gather your team and make a thorough ""Won't Do"" list. Be thoughtful about it and commit to the result. 
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""We've said no to Fortune 500 companies,"" said Tim Bergler of Percipio Group Consulting during an expert panel session with 50 entrepreneurs in the room. Bergler was sharing the one piece of advice he would give new entrepreneurs in Portland, Oregon's EO Accelerator program. ""Don't be afraid to say no if you can't nail the work for your customer,"" he continued. His answer rang a bell for me.Recognize the power of noAs I thought about the most successful entrepreneurs I know, I realized they say no to most ""opportunities."" When I reflected on my companies, I noted that our greatest successes occurred after we got really clear on what we would not do.The overarching issue is that most people say yes too much. When you start a business, you mostly think about what you will do — which is pretty much anything to grow the company. So, you say yes to everything and focus on getting more sales however you can. And while that might work in the short term while you are smaller, it doesn't work long-term, and may even keep you smaller.



That's because as a growing company, resources are finite and can easily be wasted. Saying no is critical because it empowers you to focus your limited resources — people, time, money — on the core elements that drive success best.Related: Stop Overworking Yourself Because You Say 'Yes' Too Often — Here's How to Harness the Power of a Simple 'No'


Devise your ""Won't Do"" listWhile it feels counterintuitive, the most crucial question to ask is: ""What won't we do?"" Gather your team and make a thorough ""Won't Do"" list. Be thoughtful about it and commit to the result. Watch how this exercise focuses and propels your company.Businesses with a narrow focus on delivering only what they can nail for the customer — a product or service not readily found elsewhere — are the successful ones. Think about all the businesses you love. Are they doing everything for everybody, or just one thing exceptionally well?Take the grocery business. Standard grocery stores sell an astonishing range of food items in a super-competitive segment with low profit margins. Compare that with Costco or Trader Joe's, which are high-profit and focused on what will or won't sell. They only stock value-added items that customers can't find elsewhere. The top fast-food businesses — McDonald's, Starbucks, Dunkin', Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell — all have strong ""Won't Do"" lists.A recent headline referenced ""the most important stock on planet Earth,"" which rose from obscurity to a $2 trillion valuation because of its ""Won't Do"" list. That company, Nvidia, creates technology that enables AI. Nothing else.


Related: Focusing as an Entrepreneur Is All About Choosing Opportunities WiselyThe impact of strategic omissionI failed to create a ""Won't Do"" list for my first company, a commodity business that wasn't particularly successful.The second time around, my self-storage business was way more focused. We shopped our largest competitors — Public Storage, Extra Space Storage and CubeSmart. Then, we thought deeply about what we could provide that they did not, as a way to differentiate ourselves.We made a comprehensive list detailing what we did not like about those companies. That list informed our ""Won't Do"" list, which includes:


Change our prices every dayUpsell or push extra products/servicesSave hidden costs for move-inRoute calls through a call centerAct like our customer is bothering usMandate insuranceBe a national companyPut a customer in a space that isn't right for themThat list is simple but magical. It does four remarkable things:Determines what you will do. Deciding what you don't like and won't do is a hack to identify what you will do, which is basically the opposite. Establishing a ""Won't Do"" list creates a clear, inspiring answer for what you will be to your customer.Becomes the ultimate time-saver. By eliminating what you won't do, you create space to focus on what you will do — and enhance that offering.Simplifies decision-making. Decisions are either on-brand or off-brand; the list makes it quite obvious.Clarifies your brand in a way you otherwise couldn't. When you nail what you will do, your company will be more successful and profitable. You offer something unique that is not a commodity.Your ""Won't Do"" list is an essential business tool. It doesn't only limit business scope — it can also help shape how you operate; your business practices, pricing structure and how you will treat your customers. A plumbing company might opt out of electrical work but also exclude practices such as overcharging, pushing upgrades or setting half-day-long appointment windows. Ultimately, a ""Won't Do"" list streamlines your focus and helps narrow your niche.Related: How to Say 'No' More Often: Why Every Entrepreneur Needs a 'To-Don't' ListFocus your business with boundariesBack to Bergler, who ran a management consulting company with a narrowly defined space where they could add significant value. He was as selective about the quality of people on his team as he was with the type of business they would do. The resulting quality of work put them in high demand. Eventually, incoming work opportunities exceeded capacity. He turned a lot of business away and even referred clients to competitors when he felt his company could not truly nail it.


As a result, clients started to approach Bergler first because they had so many misses with sub-par competitors. It made Bergler the preferred provider for their best clients. When he chose to sell the business, multiple buyers were confident in the company's durable income because of its 20 years of consistent performance and sky-high customer satisfaction.With our self-storage company, we enjoyed a lot of success quickly. Our differentiated brand made us a customer favorite, earning us higher marks than the big-box companies and ultimately making us a great acquisition candidate when we chose to sell.When we started a new company focusing on vehicle storage, one of the first things we did was shop our competitors and brainstorm our ""Won't Do"" list.As I think of the many businesses I know through 20 years in the Entrepreneurs' Organization, I can tell you there is a robust correlation between success and abiding by a strong ""Won't Do"" list. Do yourself a favor: Make your ""Won't Do"" list today.

16,How An Unmarked Dive Bar in Vegas Became One of America's Must-See Destinations — Within 3 Years of Opening,"Apr 2, 2024",Kristen Bayrakdarian,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-an-unmarked-dive-bar-in-vegas-became-one-of-americas/471448,"
You might not guess that in Las Vegas — a place known for luxury resorts, opulent casinos, and just about any amenity imaginable — one of the city's most beloved establishments is in a single-story building a six-minute drive from the Strip.There's a sole neon sign in the window that says, simply, ""Open."" But inside is a bit of magic: a bar, called The Silver Stamp, that makes just about everyone feel like they're back home, no matter where they're from. And in a city like Las Vegas, that's a high-wire act. ""It's a transient city,"" says Andrew Smith, one of The Silver Stamp's co-owners. ""We have so many different people coming here."" And not just locals. Tourists seek the bar out in almost equal measure.The Silver Stamp has become so beloved that when Entrepreneur held a vote to select America's favorite mom-and-pop shop™ (out of 150 of the most popular small businesses in the country, selected in partnership with Yelp), the divef bar won first place.



Related: These Are America's Favorite 150 Mom & Pop Shops™, According to Yelp and EntrepreneurThis is all the more impressive given that Smith and his co-owner and life partner, Rose Signor, only opened the business three years ago, in February 2021. In that short time, they've paid off their two small investors, the business has averaged 23% revenue growth year over year, and by popular demand, extended their hours from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m.So what is the Silver Stamp getting right?""A lot of people say, 'I don't know what it is, but I just feel so comfortable in your space,'"" Signor says.Comfort — it's no small thing. It's possibly the most important feeling a mom-and-pop shop can evoke. But it's also mysterious. You can't simply buy comfort. You can't follow a checklist to create it. You have to understand, deeply, what it means to you.


Image Credit: Mike BellemeSignor and Smith met in 2017, when she hired him to work at Atomic Liquors, the oldest freestanding bar in Las Vegas. ""It was an instant connection,"" Smith says. They'd both been in the service industry for years — Smith had managed a nearby bar before coming to Atomic Liquors — and they both shared an interest in the craft beer industry. Smith had planned to move to the Northwest at some point, but when he met Signor, he had a good reason to stay. And Signor had actually moved from Las Vegas to Seattle back in 2011 — only to move back a year later. She missed Las Vegas and the desert, and was inspired to infuse Sin City with some of the wholesome beer culture she loved.But Signor and Smith's connection went deeper than a love of pilsners and IPAs. They'd grown up in small towns on opposite sides of the country — Peru, New York, and Yuma, Arizona, respectively — that instilled in them a strong sense of community and, perhaps more importantly, empathy. ""I remember seeing situations [growing up] where I felt truly bad for people getting treated poorly and embarrassed because they didn't have enough money,"" says Signor.Related: A Small Business Owner's Guide to Managing Funds and InvestmentsWhen Signor and Smith discovered that they had both, individually, been saving to open their own bars, joining forces was a no-brainer. ""We knew we wanted to do something together,"" Smith says. They started dreaming about the bar they'd open, and even collecting decorations. A vintage clock here, a disco ball there. A wooden toucan to hang from the ceiling, sock monkeys to dress in funny, seasonal outfits. Their nostalgic, oddball, something-for- everyone aesthetic was representative of their mission for the business. ""We'd been to so many establishments that have not made us feel welcome, or have made us and others feel like outcasts,"" Signor says. ""We wanted everyone to feel included.""In May 2018, they took the leap. They quit their jobs together and backpacked for nine months through Europe and the U.S. to learn more about the history of beer. When their former boss at Atomic Liquors, Lance Johns, reached out and told them he had bought a few buildings in the downtown area, and he would lease one to them, the couple jumped at the chance. They had a vision, and they were ready.  Image Credit: Mike BellemeConstruction on the Silver Stamp began at the end of 2019. A few months later, we all know what happened: The pandemic hit.Smith and Signor had planned to hold other jobs as they built out the space, but the shock to the service industry left them unemployed. They had already sunk $60K of their savings into gutting the space, buying materials and paying contractors, so they pressed ahead. But there were mistakes and setbacks during construction, and the funds dried up way before the bar was finished.

""I remember stepping outside and thinking, We don't really have any money left.""At some point, the couple assessed their situation. Nothing was going to plan, sure, and the money was gone. But they had their own two hands, and a community of friends who were willing to help.They began spending long nights repurposing old, torn-out wood, running electrical lines, and laying plumbing themselves, to cut costs. They sought out any help they could get. ""One of the biggest things I learned during this process,"" Signor says, ""and this is even after we've opened — is to not be afraid to ask as many questions and to reach out to as many people as you can. Sometimes you think you're bothering people, but in that dire moment, I remember panicking and hitting everybody up, asking for suggestions, and looking to people that have a little bit more experience with the situation. There were some really surprising people that came forward to help us just by mentioning what our situation was."" People coached them through different processes, gave them a discount on their services, or lent them materials and machinery. They turned to others for counsel or attempted to replicate, through trial and error, what seemed to have worked for other successful establishments.One person they leaned on a lot was Lance Johns, who knew how hard they worked from when he was their boss. ""Lance is somebody that will give back to people who give to him,"" says Signor. ""Having a mentor saved us a lot of time not having to second-guess ourselves.""One thing they never doubted was how they wanted their bar to feel: inclusive and, of course, comforting.Related: Experts Say This Is the Key to Marketing a Mom and Pop BusinessThey poured those values into every detail and decision. Christmas lights strung across the ceiling help keep the ambience neither too dark nor too bright. Bar stools are repurposed gaming chairs, designed for people to sit in one place for an extended period of time. The collection of cozy nooks and small seating areas encourages intimate conversations, and the music is kept at a low enough decibel that you can hear your neighbor talk. There are only two screens, an anomaly in otherwise tech-saturated Las Vegas. And this low-tech ethos extends to printing physical menus, even though the bar has served over 1,700 different beers in three years — averaging out to nearly two new beers a day. Finally, there's the diversity of decorations and memorabilia — a bubbling lava lamp, vintage beer posters, kooky seasonal decorations, scavenged beer-can art installations — that Signor and Smith had collected over two years before the bar's opening. They're now strewn across the wood-panel walls and, really, everywhere, so that customers have something fun and different to look at in each corner. Customers have even begun adding their own contributions to the decor.


""We have been to enough bars in our life to know what makes us feel comfortable,"" Signor says, ""So how we created the bar was based on our own preferences."" By trusting their own well-defined feelings, they built something universally relatable.Image Credit: Mike BellemeBut creating an environment that is comfortable and relatable is about more than just creative decisions. It's also about financial decisions, and from the start, Signor and Smith were determined to keep costs down. ""We have low overhead because our decisions weren't fueled by [trying to make] money,"" Signor says. ""We intentionally made choices like a cheaper building off the beaten path and being our own managers and cutting out that salary.""Being intimately involved in the day-to-day operations of the space has also helped them foster the spirit of the bar and its employees. ""Our definition of a bartender isn't someone just serving drinks,"" says Signor. ""It's about building a relationship with these guests. When we're hiring, we look for people who genuinely appreciate other people, treat them with respect and kindness, and create a really safe space that people want to come back to."" Their ideal hire is someone who has positive energy, is able to leave their personal life at the door, can laugh and joke with people, and is humble (which they define as ""not intimidating and able to put people at ease"").Related: 50 Amazing Grants, Accelerators, and Free Resources Being Offered to Entrepreneurs by Champions of Small BusinessIt's painful to let people go when they don't live up to those standards, Signor says. But it's also essential. ""When prioritizing what to do next, I always think of the guest sitting in that barstool,"" she explains. ""We tell the staff to pretend we're the guests on the other side. What are they seeing? Really envision it from their perspective.""But, while Signor and Smith want their employees to put themselves in their customers' shoes (or, rather, stools), they also believe that employees have to be happy for customers to enjoy themselves. They offer health benefits — something they say is mostly unheard of in their industry, but something they wanted when they were employed by others. They are also transparent with their employees about finances and business decisions, sharing numbers and providing reasoning for changes. They take their workers' thoughts into consideration, whether it be opinions on events or on shifts in workflow. And they don't ask employees to do anything they wouldn't want to do. (The pair continue to work bar shifts alongside their staff — including cleanup duty.)""Don't be afraid to get feedback,"" says Signor. ""Our staff is so important to us and really we wouldn't be the bar that we are without them. So we lean on them, and they lean on us.""


The same way she encourages her employees to look at things through the customer's eyes, she makes a habit of looking at a situation from the viewpoint of her employees. ""I've learned to always try to put myself in the mindset of the other person,"" she says. ""I roleplay with myself in my head: If I say this to them, what do I think their response will yield? And could I say it differently? I just really try to understand where they're coming from before we approach the situation."" She adds, ""And then if we're frustrated, we sleep on it. That was something that my mentor told me: 'Always take a couple of days to reflect.'""These days, when Smith and Signor reflect on their business journey, it's notable that, in a city known for its fabulous attractions, The Silver Stamp has become its own must-see destination. ""We've become a bar people bring their families to when they're in town because they have to show their parents, their uncle,"" Smith says.Signor adds, ""We've had grown people cry when they first come in here. The space touches them immediately.""People are always looking for comfort, and the Silver Stamp shows that if you devote yourself and your business to that quality above all, people will feel it — and deeply appreciate it. You just need a vision, and a willingness to get your hands dirty. ""Every single aspect of this bar we've had our hands in,"" says Smith. He and Signor think it's funny that one of the bar's quirks that locals and tourists love — the fact that they don't have signage outside their building, giving the bar that local, in-the-know vibe — came about because they couldn't afford the sign they had designed.That's the kind of thing you never could have planned for. So, while Smith and Signor have received offers to franchise the bar, they don't think what they've created can be replicated. They do have other plans in the works. But The Silver Stamp will remain dependably unique — news that is its own kind of comfort.Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big Brands

17,Stop Using the Term 'Cold Calling' — Use These 5 Alternative Names Instead,"Apr 1, 2024",Roxanne Klein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-alternative-terms-for-cold-calling/471600,"
I recently attended a meeting where my managing broker suggested we consider alternative names for cold calling. Although I was initially a little resistant, the idea of renaming a task has grown on me. Since cold calling sounds so cold, this article is meant to share some of the names that were brainstormed to eliminate the word ""cold"" from ""cold calling.""By using a creative title, it is possible that the mindset around cold calling can be changed in a positive manner. Once the task is thought of as positive, its effectiveness will be improved. The mind is extremely powerful. By focusing on the fun elements of your work, there is a high probability that the results will be beneficial.1. Scavenger HuntOne of the first names I thought of to inspire myself regarding cold calling is ""Scavenger Hunt."" When I was little, I loved going to parties where we went on scavenger hunts. The idea of going to a random person's house and asking for a random item was very intriguing to me. Although cold calling in the business world is not as random as a scavenger hunt, there are similarities.



Instead of looking for an object, I am looking for an assignment. The assignment could be a new listing or a new tenant rep account. If you are on the hunt to help your business grow, next time you are about to make business calls, I encourage you to consider adding a scavenger hunt to your calendar.Related: 4 Tips for Mastering Cold-Calling (and How to Not Annoy Leads in the Process)


2. Playing ClueI enjoy playing the Game Clue. It allows you to investigate and solve a mystery. Similar to when you are prospecting, you are looking for clues to help with the overall big picture of gaining business. If you like playing games and enjoy solving puzzles, I recommend you try ""Playing Clue"" instead of cold calling.Related: How to Get Over the Most Challenging Part of Cold Calling3. Friend FindingI thought ""Friend Finding,"" suggested by one of my colleagues, was extremely clever. Like many other sales-related businesses, commercial real estate is about relationships. Relationships are formed when two people like each other and have common interests. By thinking that you are picking up the phone to find a friend, the idea of calling strangers can seem less cumbersome or intimidating.Although I like the name Friend Finding, I recommend being cautious about friendship in business. Since often it can be awkward to hire your friends if you focus too much on friendship and not enough on your business, your original goal of calling to create new accounts might be deterred.


4. Dialing for DollarsIf you are motivated by money, there is the well-known ""Dialing for Dollars."" This name has such a great ring to it and is much more fun than cold calling. Dialing for Dollars has both an action and reward, all in three words. Although it is used often, I prefer this term any day over cold calling.Related: Phone Call or Email? How to Choose the Right Sales Outreach Approach.5. Sailing for SuccessThis name conveys a journey that ends positively. ""Sailing"" is much more entertaining than calling. By sailing instead of calling and success instead of cold, ""Sailing for Success"" might be the perfect name replacement for cold calling.Regardless of the term, the important key here is mindset. I do not think I have ever met someone who told me they love cold calling. Like public speaking, most people put cold calling in the category of items they abhor.


The key is to pick the name that works best for you. Whether it is one I shared in this article or one you come up with on your own, you need to figure out what motivates you. You also need to consider what your goals are for cold calling. Once you figure out your goals and motivation, you will be on your way to sailing for success.After you know your favorite name for cold calling, you need to implement it. I recommend having your colleagues and even family know the name you are using for cold calling. If everyone around you knows the name, you will probably use the name more. Your goal should be to eliminate ""cold calling"" from your vocabulary and replace it with your preferred term. Remember to write your preferred name on your calendar if time blocking works for you. The more you see it, the easier it will be for you to utilize it.

18,I Specialize in Exit Planning — You Need to Make These 5 Moves Before Selling Your Business,"Apr 1, 2024",Mark Kravietz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/you-need-to-make-these-5-moves-before-selling-your-business/470750,"
It's never too early to prepare your company for a sale. The business landscape is evolving rapidly, and entrepreneurs considering selling their businesses must adapt to the changing market dynamics. Strategic planning and timely decision-making can significantly impact the success of selling a business. In this article, we will explore five crucial moves business owners should make in preparation for selling their business in 2025.1. Embrace technology and digital transformationIn the digital age, technology plays a pivotal role in business operations and value proposition. As of 2022, businesses that fully embrace digital transformation are more likely to attract higher valuations when it comes time to sell. According to a study by McKinsey, companies that invest in digital capabilities experience revenue growth rates 2.5 times higher than their counterparts.To position your business for a successful sale in 2025, focus on enhancing your digital infrastructure, adopting advanced technologies and staying ahead of industry trends. Leverage data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to streamline processes, improve efficiency and demonstrate the scalability of your business to potential buyers. Most importantly, help ensure your employees are using this technology responsibly; implement an AI policy to protect your customers and employees.



Related: How Much Time Do I Need to Sell My Business? First, Consider These 7 Factors.2. Strengthen financial performanceA robust financial performance is a key driver in determining the value of a business. Prospective buyers closely scrutinize financial statements, profitability, and cash flow before making acquisition decisions. They also look for growth of earnings. I'm working with a client whose business was off significantly in 2020 and 2021 and just started to come back in 2022. There will be excellent growth from '23 to '25 and he is looking to sell by the end of '25. It was his patience, cost-cutting and streamlining of his products that turned things around. I believe he will have a successful exit.


To help maximize the value of your business, focus on improving profitability, minimizing debt and maintaining a healthy cash flow. Implement cost-cutting measures, optimize operational efficiency and diversify revenue streams. By presenting a solid financial foundation, you will increase the attractiveness of your business to potential acquirers.3. Build a strong and adaptable teamBuyers are not just acquiring a business; they are inheriting a team. Having a skilled and adaptable workforce is crucial for the long-term success of any business. According to Deloitte, organizations with strong leaders are 2.3 times more likely to financially outperform their peers.Invest in training and development programs to upskill your employees and help ensure they are equipped to navigate the evolving business landscape. Provide each employee with an annual budget for continuing education and make sure they use it! Every employee that attends a conference should present their key learnings to the company so everyone can benefit.A skilled and adaptable team adds significant value to your business, making it more appealing to potential buyers who are looking for a seamless transition.


4. Enhance customer relationships and brand equityCustomer relationships and brand equity are intangible assets that greatly influence the perceived value of a business. Additionally, a strong brand can command premium prices and create a competitive advantage.Invest in customer satisfaction initiatives, gather feedback and address any issues promptly. This is not a one-time thing, but something that must be done on a regular basis. Cultivate a positive brand image through effective marketing and public relations strategies. These initiatives take time and funds to implement, so start early and make sure to budget accordingly to keep the momentum going. By enhancing customer relationships and brand equity, you not only improve your business's market position but also make it more attractive to potential buyers who seek a reputable and customer-centric acquisition.Related: You Sold Your Business. Now What? Embracing a New Chapter with Care and Purpose5. Engage professional advisors earlyNavigating the complex process of selling a business requires knowledge and experience. Engaging professional advisors early in the process can significantly impact the outcome of the sale. In an Exit Planning Institute NY Chapter's State of Owner Readiness Survey, 78% of business owners indicated that they had a formal transition team. This shows the importance of creating a team of professionals.


Seek the assistance of financial advisors, legal professionals, merger and acquisition specialists and investment bankers. Make sure your financial advisor has experience with exit planning; the Certified Exit Planning Advisor (CEPA®) has proficiency in helping business owners sell their businesses. Their insights, negotiation skills, and market knowledge can be invaluable in maximizing the value of your business and ensuring a smooth transaction.Selling a business in 2025 requires strategic foresight and proactive measures. By embracing technology, strengthening financial performance, building a strong team, enhancing customer relationships and engaging professional advisors early, business owners can position themselves for a successful and lucrative sale. The statistics and industry insights mentioned in this article underscore the importance of these moves in the context of the evolving business landscape. As you prepare to sell your business, remember that early preparation and strategic decision-making can make all the difference in achieving a favorable outcome in the competitive market of 2025.

19,Beware the Duplicity of OpenAI — 4 Strategies to Safeguard Your Brand in the Age of AI,"Apr 1, 2024",Jaxon Parrott,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/how-to-safeguard-your-brand-in-the-age-of-openai/471583,"
It's ironic that OpenAI would be the victim of its own success, as a recent piece of investigative journalism produced by TechCrunch found the company's ChatGPT store, which allows users to create and share custom chatbots, found the platform riddled with unethical and potentially illegal applications.Among the custom ChatGPT apps discovered among the three million on offer in the store were some that obviously violate copyrights, others designed for students to avoid plagiarism detection and still others that impersonate people or organizations without proper consent or legal rights.Out of curiosity, I submitted a prompt to ChatGPT to ""write an article about the best practices for avoiding both copyright infringement and irresponsible or unethical uses of generative AI tools."" In response, the AI whipped off a piece that contained the following caution: ""These tools can produce original content based on input data, but they can also inadvertently replicate existing copyrighted material.""



My second prompt, ""Write an article about why human supervision of AI tools is essential,"" produced the following statement from ChatGPT: ""Human supervision is essential for ensuring that AI tools operate within the bounds of existing legal frameworks, especially concerning data protection, privacy laws, and copyright.""Related: What We Can Learn From the OpenAI Governance Crisis


Do As I SayIn a response to TechCrunch's inquiry about the company's methods for preventing chatbot apps that violate its terms of use, an OpenAI spokesperson said the following: ""We use a combination of automated systems, human review and user reports to find and assess GPTs that potentially violate our policies.""Apparently, OpenAI hasn't taken ChatGPT's advice about the critical importance of human supervision in the case of its own wildly successful AI. Instead, it most likely relies on some automated system (without sufficient human oversight) to monitor the kosherness of custom apps offered on its store.Given the massive number of custom chatbots on the ChatGPT Store, it would be understandable why OpenAI would seek to automate the vetting process to the greatest extent possible in the interest of time and efficiency. Whatever the case, their brand has suffered a hit as a result — not big enough to incur fatal damage, but still a hit.The four keysAs AI becomes more integrated into business processes, the potential for these tools to impact brand reputation — positively or negatively — grows. Missteps in AI implementation can lead to public relations nightmares, customer distrust, and long-term damage to a company's image. Therefore, businesses must approach AI use with strategic oversight to protect and enhance their brand reputation.


Every business's specific policies necessary for proper human oversight are unique, depending on how they integrate AI into their operations. However, I propose the following four key principles to prevent damage to your brand's reputation.Related: AI Is Changing the Way We Look at Job Skills — Here's What You Need to Do to Prepare.1. Be open and transparentParticularly regarding how data is collected, processed, and used, you should provide clear, accessible information about your AI systems to reassure customers and stakeholders of your commitment to ethical practices.At my company Presspool.ai, for example, we leverage AI to identify the ideal target audiences for our customers' B2B advertisements based on secure, first-party data to track key performance indicators such as click-throughs and conversions and to optimize marketing campaigns. This way, our customers are assured the AI-powered, targeted distribution of their ads complies with all relevant data privacy regulations.


2. Prepare for failures and misstepsNo technology is foolproof, and AI is no exception. Businesses must have contingency plans for when AI systems fail or produce unintended consequences. This includes having human oversight in critical decision-making processes and establishing clear channels for customer feedback and complaints regarding AI interactions.Related: 4 Ways Startups Go Wrong When Working With AI3. Engage in continuous improvementSocietal standards for responsible AI use are rapidly evolving. Businesses must commit to continuous learning and improving their AI systems to avoid ethical, legal, and reputational risks. Review and update your AI strategies regularly to reflect new developments and stakeholder expectations.4. Educate your workforceEmployees should be well-informed about the role of AI in your business, including the benefits and potential risks. Providing training on responsible AI use and ethical considerations helps ensure that your workforce can effectively manage AI tools in a way that protects your brand reputation.

21,4 Actions Start-Up Founders Need to Take (But Often Overlook) to Protect Their Business,"Mar 29, 2024",Kalon Gutierrez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/protective-guardrails-start-up-founders-need-to-protect/470694,"
Antitrust can be defined as ""a kind of law or rule that protects fairness and competition in business."" On a company basis, issues concerning antitrust are often brought to the forefront during one-off events, such as a merger, acquisition or public offering. However, violations can also occur over a period of time as a pattern of ongoing behavior.To an early-stage start-up, the subject of antitrust may seem like a far-off topic. The notion of preparing for a legal acquisition or not unfairly infringing upon your competition can appear to be ages away, especially as immediate issues like fundraising, market launch and cash burn take precedence. Survival-related endeavors are naturally prioritized.Yet, the reality is that ignoring antitrust efforts at the start can prove detrimental to growth companies down the road when the stakes are much bigger. And in fact, overlooked antitrust issues often reveal critical gaps in the business plan itself. Future violations have been rooted in decisions that were made (or not made) early on and continued over a period of time. When they do come to the forefront, their preventable consequences can exponentially limit a company's ultimate success.



Related: The Legal Lowdown of Starting a New Business: A Startup Lawyer ExplainsWhile early-stage companies remain capacity-challenged, there are critical and manageable practices that can be undertaken in order to reduce the potential for catastrophic violations down the road. There are four key actions that early-stage founders need to take to address antitrust that both help refine a company's goals and vision while also establishing often overlooked guardrails that protect the business long-term. To illustrate more directly, let's use a case study of an entrepreneur who has built a company that creates and sells ""self-cooking hotdogs"":


Imagine an entrepreneur invented a hot dog that perfectly cooked itself at the precise time the customer wants to eat it. No grill or cooking equipment is required; rather, just one push of the button and three minutes later, it is perfectly cooked. Here are the steps this entrepreneur should consider regarding antitrust:1. Determine your core competitive advantageThis is something that your company can do that very few (or no one else) can easily replicate. For the hot dog entrepreneur, this would be the technology associated with the self-cooking capability, for which the entrepreneur should consider applying for intellectual property (e.g., a patent) before it is in market. Any attempt by an existing hot dog maker to replicate this technology would either prove difficult or could cannibalize their existing ""regular hot dog"" sales.2. Highlight how your competitive advantage helps customersIn antitrust, competitive advantages that result in consumer benefits (e.g., price, convenience, quality) are favored and encouraged by the law. On the other hand, competitive advantages that give a business a leg up over competitors but either do not help or harm consumers are where problems can arise. For our hot dog entrepreneur, the core innovation saves consumers' time, money (on power), and potentially the embarrassment of not knowing how to cook a hot dog. Clearly and consistently articulating these benefits across all aspects of branding can help the entrepreneur on both business/marketing and antitrust fronts.3. Execute a plan to overcome the market leaderOne of the most common pitfalls for startups is that the current leader in their respective space has a reputational or other sustainable advantage that it has built up over time that prevents the entrepreneur from gaining significant traction. For example, customers may be prone to the ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" analogy. For our innovative hot dog, a primary constraint may be that the cooking process itself provides enjoyment for customers, or there is a natural skepticism to buying a new product to eat from a company that no one has heard of before. To overcome these barriers, the hot dog entrepreneur may need to do a ""blind taste test"" campaign or perhaps partner with another company that is known to offer products used for BBQing. Over time, once the new product gains more mainstream acceptance, it will be easier to gain market share (and perhaps funding) at a rapid pace.


Related: 8 Legal Requirements When You Start A Business4. Determine the social benefit associated with successAs a larger proportion of the consuming public is associated with younger generations, a common success tactic has been to convey that your company is not just out to make a buck but rather to improve a global societal issue. The hot dog entrepreneur may focus on the fact that its innovation will reduce expensive and/or harmful forms of heating energy. Or food products can be donated to needy populations who do not have access to heating mechanisms.A focus on antitrust advances all of these efforts, and when successfully implemented, they provide natural and compelling defenses to future issues. Addressing them early on not only guards against future risk, but also better defines a company's competitive advantage today, thereby positioning it more strongly for both short-term and long-term success. While guised as a risk-averted practice, addressing antitrust can actually prove to be a key determinant to paving the roadmap for successful and lasting company growth.

22,My Wife's Nutritionist Gets Better Sales Than You — Here's Why.,"Mar 26, 2024",Ramon Ray,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-win-over-customers-by-listening-and-following-up/471307,"
Recently, my wife hired a nutritionist to help her get healthy and improve her diet. My wife is not easily swayed, and she likes to weigh potential outcomes and consequences before committing to a course of action. So, I asked my wife why she had hired one nutritionist and not the several others she had interviewed.She said there were two main reasons: she felt heard, and the nutritionist followed up.Know what your customer wantsThe nutritionists my wife didn't choose seemed to be selling her something she didn't want. She felt it was like she was going to a painter to help her paint her house, but they kept wanting to do landscaping.



The other nutritionists were nice and pleasant. But my wife had a very special and specific need. She didn't want medicine or Weight Watchers. She wanted a guide and a coach to help her in her daily routine. This nutritionist who got the job actually listened and understood what my wife wanted.Related: Are You Really Listening to Your Customers? Probably Not, But You Should.


Follow up, follow up, follow up!Secondly, the nutritionist who was hired followed up. Often, your next customer will not buy from you the first time you have a conversation with them.Maybe they're not ready quite yet. Maybe they're in the middle of traffic when you speak with them. Maybe there are screaming kids in the car. Maybe it's simply a bad time.Whether you're a nutritionist, lawyer, accountant, web designer or any other type of entrepreneur, these two principles of understanding who your customers are — and what they want — and the power of following up are essential for the growth of your business.Related: How to Write Follow-Up Emails That Get Answered


How to better understand your future customerUnderstanding who your customers are and their problems and concerns is essential for small business owners and entrepreneurs to grasp. My best sales happen when I really listen to and understand the customer. Here are a few tips to help you do this better.1. The importance of questions. Understanding your potential clients is all about asking insightful questions. This practice isn't limited to the queries themselves but extends to how you ask the question. It is crucial to initiate conversations that make your customers feel at ease when expressing their preferences and thoughts.2. Active listening and engagement. Listening actively is as crucial as the questions asked. This involves tuning into not just the words spoken but also gleaning insights from the tone, the pauses and the enthusiasm behind them. Exploring their previous encounters with similar services or products can shed light on their preferences, helping tailor your service or product to better meet their needs. The nutritionist my wife hired did a great job asking the right questions and understanding her needs.3. Understanding customer expectations. Inquiring about your customers' definition of success gives you a clear picture of their goals. This not only aids in aligning your offerings with their expectations but also demonstrates your commitment to fulfilling their unique needs.

CRM platforms can help you consolidate client data, including contact details, preferences, and previous engagements. They also enable personalized follow-ups. They can even help you know when it's time to reach out to clients based on predefined schedules or after specific triggers, ensuring no client feels neglected. Tools such as Hubspot, Keap, Zoho CRM, and Nimble are great for this.2. Task reminders for consistency. Task reminder apps are simpler tools but immensely powerful for keeping follow-ups on track. They can be set to remind you to reach out to your clients at optimal times, making the process more systematic. This approach is particularly effective for individual professionals or small businesses that might not need the full suite of CRM functionalities but still prioritize consistent communication. Tools such as Asana, Google Tasks, Outlook 365 Tasks and many others can help.3. Marketing automation. Marketing automation takes follow-ups to a new level. From sending personalized emails based on client actions to scheduling social media posts that keep your business in the loop, these tools make client engagement continuous and consistent. For instance, after an initial consultation, a nutritionist could set up an automated email sequence to share helpful tips, encouraging messages or gentle reminders to book a follow-up appointment, seamlessly maintaining the client relationship.


Related: 4 Insane Truths About Failing to Follow-upSummaryThis was a straightforward example of how a nutritionist ""beat out"" other nutritionists to ""win the sale."" She got my wife — who is not easily sold (I might add) — to buy a product.Follow up. Keep following up with the customer, especially if you know you're a fit for them and have the solution they need. Don't be annoying — but follow up. Understand who your customer is, their goals and needs, and how you can help them reach their desired outcome.

Do you sometimes sit in a waiting room or at the bar and wonder what to look at?Atmosphere TV was created to get your attention (and entertain you too) in those moments with a curated stream of engaging, audio-free video content.Blake Sabatinelli is the CEO of Atmosphere, the world's largest streaming television platform for businesses. ""It's a pretty simple premise,"" Sabatinelli told Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media. ""We make TV for businesses.""

Their content is shown in places all over the world.""We've done just about everything you can think of,"" said Sabatinelli. ""Frankly, we have a channel for every environment, and we do that because everyone has their own tastes, everyone has their own atmosphere within their businesses, and that is a pun that's intended.""Related: Chef Says This Is the No. 1 Thing That Makes a Restaurant Successful or NotThe fuel behind Atmosphere comes down to one of the most powerful things around these days: engaging content.


Atmosphere teamed up with Red Bull to present the X Games Aspen Live on their platform so venues could air it for their patrons as it was happening, instead of later as clips. ""Red Bull is an amazing partner to us in so many ways. They were one of the first groups to really place a bet on this little company based out of Austin, Texas.""Sabatinelli saw the power of partnerships first-hand when the CEO heard comedian Bert Kreischer tell a story on his popular podcast about watching the X Games live at a California bar that has Atmosphere TV.Bert thought the Red Bull-sponsored extreme sports event looked like so much fun he went out and bought a ticket to the X Games the next day. All because he saw it on Atmosphere.Growing Atmosphere into a global company has required hard work and big decisions. In the face of adversity brought on by the pandemic, Atmosphere pivoted and expanded its reach to find new opportunities in sectors like doctor's offices and auto shops. The places where people have to wait and could use some entertainment.


""We moved our business to not just focus on bars and restaurants,"" he said, ""but bars and restaurants and other locations that have intentionality of viewership and significant dwell time.""This strategic shift underscores Sabatinelli's commitment to adapting to evolving market conditions and meeting the needs of diverse businesses. ""Finding a way to get the people to take a breath and enjoy the experience around them, it's just such a no-brainer and such a huge opportunity for a business like ours.""Building An Advertising PlatformThe Atmosphere platform is also an advertising network in addition to a content publisher.""The ability to light up a campaign — in a way like you do on Google or on Meta now — to drive results for your business is something we spent a lot of time making sure we could do,"" he says.

24,How This Family-Run Company Has Thrived for Five Generations,"Mar 25, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-al-capone-inspired-the-launch-of-a-95-year-old/471438,"
Creating our show The CEO Series has allowed me to sit down with some of the most innovative and inspiring business leaders in the world to get their insights on what it takes to launch, grow and sustain a meaningful business.This episode took us to Ozinga, the concrete and building material powerhouse. They're based in Chicago and if you're in the area, you're surely familiar with their iconic red and white trucks. They have approximately 2,500 employees and I got to have an amazing chat with the guy who oversees it all, Marty Ozinga, the fourth-generation CEO of this 95-year-old company.Below are some highlights of that conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. Watch the full video above.



His approach to leadership""It's not the people are working for you, they're working with you. That's the way I was mentored and taught. We all need each other. We all have different roles and responsibilities, but we're working with each other.""Related: Why Notre Dame's Football Coach Tells His Team to ""Choose Hard""


Ozinga's 95-year history""Our family came from the Netherlands in 1893, the year of the World's Fair here in Chicago. The family was always in the delivery business. Then in 1928, my great-grandfather was working with the Cook County Sheriff's Department during Prohibition and dealing with the hazards of Al Capone and all of that. He had five kids at home and decided, ""You know what? I don't want to fight Al Capone anymore."" So he started a coal delivery business. And then around 1950, ready mix concrete became the era's disruptive technology. Ready mixed means that it is batched for delivery from a central plant instead of being mixed on the job site. And so Ozinga became one of the first ready mix providers in the region.""Related: This Entrepreneur Started Making Short Videos to Share Her Passion for Cooking. Now Her Food Company Is a Global Powerhouse.On their iconic trucks""We've supplied concrete to iconic Chicago landmarks like Soldier Field and Wrigley Field, so it's fun to be connected to places like that. And we're really proud of our trucks' red and white stripes. I think it was a combination of this keen sense of marketing, but also of national pride. But there's also some joke that they were Dutch and very frugal and those were the two paint buckets in the garage. So I like both those stories.""The power of peacefulness""Our dispatch office is the nerve center of the business. It's where all the orders come in from our customers, and then where we dispatch the trucks. It is intentionally very quiet inside. We've tried to get it as quiet and peaceful as possible because historically the dispatch office is a very intense, chaotic, loud and crazy place.""


Building and sustaining a legacy""There's an emotional connection for my family and this company. We've been really fortunate that we get to embed ourselves in communities throughout the Midwest. We're committed to our employees and our customers — we want to be here for the next hundred years and longer. That's our intention. And while change is necessary so you don't get disrupted and die and go out of business, there are certain things that you shouldn't meddle with. Our core principles are the foundation for who we are and why we do what we do — that should never change.""Related: How Personal Passions Fuel Business Success for the CEO of Vivid SeatsCheck out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

25,It's Time to Clean Up Your Act — How to Manage Your Reputation in the Era of AI,"Mar 22, 2024",David Klein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-manage-your-reputation-in-the-era-of-ai/471258,"
The traditional method of reputation management was to create new, positive content to drown out negative news about a company, pushing it back in the search results. Either that or the company's attorney contacted webmasters to get the damaging content removed. But those days are quickly disappearing. Enter the Search Generative Experience (SGE) — the integration of Google's AI into search results. It was gradually rolled out in 2023, and it's about to turn the world of reputation management upside-down.SGE results are designed to help the user make better decisions faster. This means providing deeper context and more balanced information (good and bad) and placing it at the top of the page before organic results (non-paid or non-sponsored results based purely on relevance). With this change to the ground rules of reputational management, brands need to fundamentally shift how they manage their online presence.Related: Why Investing in Reputation Management is Crucial for Your Business Strategy



The SGE shift: Adopting an experience-first approachCompared to the ""old"" Google, SGE results rely more on third-party references than a company's website. Since SGE seeks to highlight more diverse viewpoints and sources, it is more likely to showcase both positive and negative perspectives about a brand. So, gone are the days of being able to bury a bad news day by flooding the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) with better headlines.In this new landscape, reputation management must center on addressing user complaints — and not just at the surface level. Responding to criticism is a start, but SGE is pushing companies to continuously listen to user needs and make an effort to grow and improve as a result. With CX now having more relevance to reputation management than ever before, meeting these expectations requires a three-pronged effort that starts and ends with the user in mind.


1. Stay accountable to your usersGoogle's complex algorithm still strives to cater to the user's needs but will now prioritize content from publishers that do the same. So, a user-centric approach will require brands to:Seek a deeper understanding of user search intent before creating articles and web pages. Only then can brands address users' specific questions comprehensively enough for Google's LLMs to assign value to them.Understand what customers are saying about brands via social listening.Build confidence in readers by offering the most complete and up-to-date information across the company blog and other channels. Verify sources and clearly attribute them (especially AI-generated excerpts), as well as conduct regular audits to identify obsolete or outdated information.Encourage reviews, comments and user-generated content (UGC) on and off your website. This helps user complaints rise to the surface (and, hopefully, get resolved).Related: 5 Ways to Optimize Your Content for Better Google Rankings2. Partner with trusted third partiesSGE prioritizes information from high-quality sources that align with Google's EEAT model, meaning sources that exemplify experience, expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. With third-party voices holding even greater weight, brands need to partner with credible outlets to proactively:Ensure consistency in how the brand and its values are expressed across the web. This starts with demonstrating authority in your own content but extends to publishing clear initiatives and brand guidelines, so it is easier for third parties to represent your company accurately.Prevent misinformation by routinely reviewing content related to the company and contacting outlets to correct errors and provide context.Mitigate negative third-party information by quickly (and diplomatically) addressing critical feedback, whether from a journalist claiming greenwashing or a dissatisfied user.Related: How to Manage (and Monitor) Your Reputation on Social Media


3. Amplify your audience's diverse voicesAs the search experience evolves, brands don't have to wait idly to see how it changes public perception of their company. To continue maintaining and improving your reputation, focus on the user experiences that you can control by:Tailoring content and outreach to specific communities, especially underserved ones. This requires a nuanced understanding of audience demographics, user preferences and pain points that a brand can use to personalize content and the entire user experience.Collaborate and partner with a diverse group of voices. Avoid simply leveraging influencers and thought leaders for promotion and instead, build relationships based on shared values and mutual respect.Experimenting with new tools to improve the UX, like offering interactive content and real-time personalization. Harness data analytics and machine learning to deliver content that best meets each user's needs at the moment. As third-party cookies are phased out, personalization faces new challenges, but emerging tech also means new possibilities.Putting SGE principles into actionWhile the deeper causes of customer complaints will now surface more easily, your newsroom should not be the first responder to reputation challenges. Take the hypothetical case study of an online retailer for strategies likely to have the greatest impact in the SGE landscape:Empowering consumer confidence: When customers complain about inaccurate sizing and product descriptions, the brand responds by creating size guides, fit quizzes and virtual dressing rooms.Responding to customer concerns: Shipping delays and high shipping costs frustrate customers. So, the brand ramps up communications about wait times and offers transparent pricing breakdowns. Plus, they integrate a third-party app to keep customers updated on order status.Strengthening shared values: Journalists report on unsustainable manufacturing practices in the retail industry. In response, the company begins publishing quarterly reports on its ESG commitments and shares stats and stories on social media to improve transparency.Proactively shaping customer experiences: Unresponsive customer service reps and slow order processing fuel dissatisfaction. The brand rolls out social listening and sentiment analysis tools to act on real-time data. They also empower their team to offer fast, concrete resolutions.As SGE becomes deeply integrated into search experiences, reputation management is now a continuous conversation, not a one-time fix. Stay engaged with your audience, listen to their concerns and proactively address issues as they arise. Don't spin or bury negative information. Instead, take responsibility and demonstrate your commitment to improvement. For brands with the right mindset, SGE is not a threat but an opportunity to create better products, services and experiences that resonate with your audience.

26,How to Determine the Right Pricing Strategy for Your Small Business,"Mar 21, 2024",Nicholas Leighton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-choose-the-right-pricing-strategy-for-your-small/471188,"
Since reaching a peak of over 9% in 2022, inflation appears to finally be cooling for the average consumer. Over the last two years, companies across the globe have worked diligently to protect their profit margins by increasing their prices as their costs rose. For small business owners, this creates a number of challenges. Many consumers are still facing the pressures as wages haven't kept pace with inflation rates. As a result, consumers are more cautious than ever about each dollar they spend.To make matters more complicated, AI and other technologies are opening the door to new products and lower barriers to entry in many industries. This advancement is also helping to reduce operating costs as companies shed unnecessary labor and streamline their operations and processes. Now, many companies are realizing that they need to start being more competitive with their pricing to retain their existing customers and attract new ones.For small business owners, defining the right pricing strategy can feel overwhelming. In addition, price wars rarely have winners as each company tries to outdo the other until both are left with little to no profit. Not only are price wars harmful, but entrepreneurs may struggle — especially if they are trying to win on price alone against a major competitor. Here are some tips to help you find the right pricing balance.



Related: Did You Price Your Product Right? How to Know.1. Evaluate the competitionYour competition and the industry can provide a lot of guidance when it comes to pricing strategies. Within each industry, there are typically standard markups or profit margins that are recognized as normal ranges. This can help small business owners understand if their costs are too high or low relative to their sales price.


By evaluating a range of competitors, it's also possible to determine the upper and lower price tolerance for consumers. If the most expensive product in your market is $200, there is a good indication that this is close to the maximum amount consumers will be willing to pay for a similar product.2. Ignore the competitionBefore you assume that I contradicted the first point, it's important that you don't price your product by simply copying your competitors. While your competition's pricing may be a helpful guide to understanding if you are within the acceptable ranges of the market, picking an arbitrary number is a losing strategy.Instead, focus on what value you are bringing to consumers instead of the price alone. Unfortunately, too many entrepreneurs believe they can beat the competition by being the cheapest business in town. This mindset will often lead to underpricing your product or service.Instead, focus on how much consumers might be willing to pay based on the value that your business provides.


3. Consider subscription pricingMaking consistent sales is the key to long-term business success. If you have a product that requires being sold over and over, you might be able to introduce some form of recurring or subscription pricing. This not only helps keep revenue flowing into your business, but it provides long-range visibility into your anticipated revenue. This is helpful for both strategic planning and securing better financing through investors or a bank line of credit.Related: The Price Is Right: How to Price Your Product for Long-Term Success4. Flexible or tiered pricingMost businesses serve a wide range of customers. Offering flexible or tiered pricing can increase your revenue by enabling you to reach a wider range of customers. Tiered pricing also supports a sales strategy known as price anchoring. By offering three or more pricing tiers, you can position your premium and most expensive options as the best value, encouraging more upsells.5. Loss-leader pricingWhile it's not always best to be the cheapest, this can be an effective strategy for entrepreneurs who are looking to generate early buzz in the market or encourage their first clients to try out their services. This strategy is known as loss-leader pricing, where you sell your product just at or slightly below your breakeven point.


It's important to caution that low pricing could backfire if consumers believe you are priced low because you have an inferior product or are desperate to make a sale. To counter this effect, the trick is to tie low pricing to a limited timeframe. This creates a sense of urgency to make a purchase and also lets the consumer know that you believe your product is worth more than the current price.6. Offer transparent pricingConsumers want to work with companies that they believe are trustworthy. Shady pricing and hidden fees are the perfect way to damage a relationship with your customers. It's always best to be upfront and transparent about your product pricing. At the end of the day, if sharing your price scares away customers, it's a good indication that you need to revisit your pricing strategy or do a better job of demonstrating the product's value.Related: An Entrepreneur's Guide to Startup Pricing Strategies

27,How to Combat Payment Fraud and Negative Cash Flow,"Mar 21, 2024",Nick Chandi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/proven-strategies-to-combat-payment-fraud-and-negative-cash/471135,"
Payment fraud poses significant risks for small businesses, often overlooked by the owners. Ignoring this threat can lead to devastating consequences, even business closure. Shockingly, the SEON report of 2021 revealed a staggering 1,862 data breaches and 293 million victims, highlighting the pervasive threat. Business owners must prioritize security and stay vigilant against evolving fraud tactics to safeguard their businesses and customers.Related: How Generative AI Is Fueling the Rise of Fake News and Online FraudProven strategies to combat payment fraudWhen it comes to protecting your business from payment fraud, it's all about making smart choices. One of the first steps is choosing a payment processor that's got your back with exceptional security features. Not all platforms are created equal, so picking one that offers advanced encryption and fraud detection is important. These built-in safeguards are crucial for keeping your transactions safe from any unauthorized access.



Another key aspect is training your team to spot and handle any fishy activity. According to a report, employee tip-offs are the most common method of detecting fraud, emphasizing the pivotal role of staff awareness. Your employees are your first line of defense against fraud, so giving them the right training is essential. By fostering a culture of awareness and accountability, you empower your team to keep your business's finances secure.Keeping an eye on your transactions is also a must. Setting up systems for real-time monitoring and getting alerts for anything unusual can help you catch any fraud attempts early on. Regularly checking your transaction logs adds an extra layer of security so you can stay on top of things.


Traditional passwords might not be enough against sophisticated cyber threats in 2024. That's why it's worth considering multi-factor authentication to increase your security. Research indicates that in 2023, 49% of data breaches involved compromised credentials, highlighting the need for stronger authentication methods. Adding extra verification steps like security questions or biometric data can make it much harder for fraudsters to get in.And if you want some extra peace of mind, teaming up with fraud prevention services could be a wise option. The global average data breach cost in 2023 was USD 4.45 million. Fraud prevention services offer specialized solutions tailored to your business's needs, like real-time monitoring and proactive fraud detection. With their help, you can stay one step ahead of any potential threats and focus on confidently growing your business.Related: Innovation: How Banks and Businesses Can Fight Fraud and Chargebacks Should Regulation FailManaging negative cash flowNegative cash flow can pose significant challenges for small businesses, impacting everything from day-to-day operations to long-term growth prospects. Companies experiencing irregular cash flows are almost twice as likely to exit the market compared to those with consistent cash flows. Understanding its implications and implementing effective management strategies is essential for financial stability and sustainability.


Negative cash flow occurs when a business's expenses exceed its revenue over a specific period. This shortfall can lead to liquidity issues, making it difficult to cover essential expenses such as payroll, inventory, and overhead costs. Left unchecked, negative cash flow can undermine a business's financial health and jeopardize its long-term viability.Several factors can contribute to negative cash flow, including late client payments, excessive overhead expenses, and unexpected emergencies. According to a survey, 61% of small businesses experience cash flow challenges due to late payments from clients. By identifying the root causes of negative cash flow, entrepreneurs can develop targeted strategies to address these issues and improve financial performance.Related: 4 Cash Flow Trends To Know About in 2024 Strategies for improving cash flow managementOne way to start turning things around is by talking to the suppliers and vendors about your payment terms. Sometimes, they're willing to give you more time to clear your bills, which can take some of the pressure off in the short term and help you keep some cash in the bank for emergencies. And offering your clients a little incentive to pay their invoices on time, like discounts or rewards, could also help speed things up on the accounts receivable front.

Maybe there are some areas where you're overspending or doing things in a way that's not as efficient as it could be. By tightening up your processes and trimming the fat, you can free up some cash and make our business more financially sound.Utilizing modern payment solutions can also make a big difference. Online invoicing and instant payment platforms can help you get paid faster and streamline your financial operations, which is always good when you're trying to get your cash flow back in the black.And last but not least, having a rainy day fund is always a good idea. Setting aside monthly money can give you a safety net for those unexpected downturns or emergencies that inevitably crop up when you least expect them. With these strategies in your toolkit, you can take control of your cash flow, strengthen your financial foundation, and set your businesses up for long-term success.

28,How to Provide More Value to Your Customers And Scale Your Company,"Mar 20, 2024",Louis Lombardi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-provide-more-value-to-your-customers-and-scale-your/467784,"
Business-minded entrepreneurs are focused on one path to success: establishing a business and achieving sustainable growth. While the direction is clear and the mission is straightforward, the path is full of challenges and missteps — but more importantly, there are opportunities.More often than not, the path to sustainable growth requires creativity. For example, a fitness studio that sells class passes and memberships will eventually hit a revenue plateau. This happens when growth stabilizes and income from the core service hits a predictable cadence. While there are still opportunities to sell more classes and memberships, the reality is that other revenue streams — specifically, value-add products and services – are what will truly help scale the business.What are value-added products and services?Value-add products and services enhance the customer experience, address pain points and demonstrate the company's commitment to providing exceptional value. These ""perks"" offer customer benefits that go beyond the business's core products or services.



Offering value-added products and services to your existing customer base can create more loyal customers, which in turn can lead to increased revenue, improved customer retention, and a reinforced brand reputation.Related: 3 Easy Ways of Getting Value Addition Right During Entrepreneurship


Here are three value-add products and services that can help your business scale:1. Digital cardsDigital cards are virtual business cards stored in a digital wallet. They can be shared electronically via QR code scans, email, social media or messaging apps.Digital cards provide a convenient, digitized way to share your company's contact information, keep customers updated in real-time, and offer exclusive deals, offers, or other perks. In essence, they help increase a brand's visibility by always being a few taps away. The cars can also improve customer engagement and enhance the customer experience by providing special discounts or notifications exclusive to those who have the digital card.Some platforms can help you create and manage a digital card, and most are affordable and turnkey. The predicted ROI of the investment is tied to awareness and engagement, which, when activated with an accompanying strategy, will boost sales and revenue.To launch a digital card initiative, research digital care platforms and identify the providers that offer solutions aligned with your business goals, needs, and budget.


2. Extended warranties and service plansWhile not always looked at as value-add, extended warranties and service plans provide coverage beyond a standard manufacturer's warranty. These warranties and plans offer peace of mind to customers and can increase their confidence in your products or services.The additional perks and sense of security can increase customer satisfaction. If your company has the capacity and can help resolve customer issues quickly and effectively, these benefits can reduce customer churn, increase customer lifetime value, and enhance the company's reputation and dedication to quality and satisfaction.The investment associated with extended warranties and service plans will vary depending on the product or service and the length of coverage. To determine the viability of this option, create a cost-benefit analysis, which will help determine if this value-added option will be beneficial and worth the investment.If you plan to add extended warranties or service plans to your business, evaluate the demand to ensure your customers will appreciate them. Then, find a reputable partner who can help ensure the new offerings are legally sound, competitive, and will meet your customers' needs.


Related: If You Want Your Clients to Truly Value You, You Need to Be Their Trusted Advisor. Here's How.3. Loyalty programsLoyalty programs are most often focused on rewarding customers for their continued patronage. The programs encourage repeat business and foster brand loyalty by recognizing and rewarding customers based on their behaviors (and the rewarded behaviors can go beyond just the purchase history).Whether the loyalty program is perks-based or offers rewards points associated with discounts and coupons, loyalty programs ultimately incentivize customers to keep coming back. They enhance and trigger engagement and offer opportunities for feedback. In addition, loyalty programs launched with the right intentions and an effective structure can provide valuable first-party customer data that will help you understand your customers' preferences and lead to a higher degree of personalization and targeted offerings.To implement a loyalty program, identify the ""loyal"" audience (demographics, behaviors, etc.) and program goals, and map out the program structure. Then, do some research and contact loyalty program providers that offer a platform and tech stack that complements your existing infrastructure.


Leverage value-add products and services to scaleTo scale a business, you don't have to reinvent the wheel. You can add value and create additional revenue streams by staying true to your business and developing complementary products or services that align with what you offer and what customers want. Adding these digital offerings can make it simpler to scale by boosting profitability and accelerating business growth.

29,How to Avoid These Common Communication Blunders in the Workplace,"Mar 19, 2024",Cynthia Kay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-fix-poor-communication-in-the-workplace/470928,"
As the owner of a media production and communications consulting company, I see terrible communication firsthand. I want to share a few real stories illustrating three common communication problems, and then provide several ways to improve communication within a company.InconsistencyMany are jumping on the bandwagon of employee storytelling to make people feel like they are a part of the organization. A large furniture manufacturer decided to showcase employees' good work in a monthly video communication that my company produced. The manufacturer reached out to employees to have them submit their story or the story of a colleague. The senior vice president thought it would be fun to interview those selected in a talk show format. We produced a few but stopped because the leader could not find time to do the show.Communication programs that start and then fizzle out leave employees frustrated and skeptical. (Note: I warned the company against using this format. It's great if a leader has the time and is committed to this program. I did not feel it would work here. It did not.)



Another client decided to do customer webinars. They started with two a month but soon discovered that gathering the content was time-consuming and quickly fell behind. After making a big splash about the effort, they suspended the effort. They then started again with a scaled-back offering of once a month. While it did not have a disastrous effect on their reputation, it would have been better to start slowly, build an audience and then expand.Related: Correcting Leadership Communication Mishaps


Poor content and messagingGetting the messaging right is critical for communication to be successful. That means getting input from the right people at the right time. For example, one of my customers had to delay a product launch. The product was ready. However, the team working on the various communication assets failed to include key experts early on. When the marketing tools were submitted for approval, they discovered that the messaging was not on target. Print and videos had to be reworked, which increased costs and caused delays in the launch.Communication that fails to exciteSeveral years ago, a friend of mine worked at a major accounting firm. He had been lobbying to have me come in and work with some of their teams to improve their presentations. He was not successful until this happened:An audit team went in to present to a client and renew the contract for the next year. They were informed after the meeting that the business would go to a competitor. When pressed to understand what happened, the client reported that the audit team's presentation was boring. That's right, boring.I know what you are thinking: ""Audits, albeit necessary, are not really exciting to most people."" That's not the point. The client wanted to be engaged, perhaps even wowed. The team failed to communicate their excitement and desire to work with this client, and they lost the business.


Communication barriersOrganizations have great discipline when it comes to areas such as production or finance, but not when it comes to communication. Some don't recognize or prioritize the need for communication programs. They assume that it will happen naturally. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Over the years, many organizations have become siloed. Everyone has an initiative, but departments have no tools to collaborate and share information.Reliance on voicemail, email, and social media increases miscommunication because people are not talking to each other. Instead of helping us, technology becomes a reason not to communicate. While virtual meetings have exploded, few know how to be effective, whether they are leading or participating. People have gotten sloppy about preparation and presentation.These barriers can cause communication to get sidetracked and negatively impact business results, as my examples demonstrate. Much of the answer to overcoming communication barriers starts with senior executives and others in positions of influence who make it a priority.Related: How to Harness the Power of Communication When Facing Challenges


Three steps to get communication on trackThe first step to improving communication is to put a purposeful communication plan in place. One that is clear, consistent and achievable. Remember my storytelling example above? The plan does not need to be complicated. It does need to consider the entire organization — from those on the plant floor or front lines to those in the field and behind the scenes. What do people need to know? What are the best ways to communicate information so everyone can access it? What is the frequency of communication?The second step is to build an organization of good communicators. Numerous studies report that 86% of employees and executives cite ineffective communication and collaboration as the main cause of workplace failures. Communication is not simply the job of human resources, the communication, or the marketing department. Everyone needs to be engaged. Some people are naturally good at this, but most need help. There are learning opportunities that can be accessed from various sources, but be sure that the level and content are appropriate for the team.The third step is to use the right tools to share communication. This can be an internal portal, system of e-blasts, live meetings or live stream events. There are so many tools that it can be overwhelming. A communication consultant can help you navigate them, but the best advice is to use the simplest technology to get the job done. Finally, the results of the communication plan should be monitored. This can be something as simple as a communication survey.Related: How Effective Employee Communication Boosts Productivity

30,Why Being Your Own Influencer Is the Key to Success For Entrepreneurs,"Mar 18, 2024",Sunny Dublick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-being-your-own-influencer-is-the-key-to-success-for/470892,"
I want to tell the tale of two talented sisters: Jessica Simpson and Ashlee Simpson. Jessica started as a singer, and her first two albums earned $4M and $2M worldwide, respectively. Her third album, released on the same day as her MTV reality TV show debut, Newlyweds, grossed a total of $7M worldwide — her highest-selling album to this day.We then look at her sister, Ashlee. Other than her family connection, the general public knew nothing about her. On June 16, 2004, her reality show debuted on MTV. A month later, her debut album releases, and it winds up being 2004's biggest debut by a female artist, selling over $5M copies worldwide.Why am I talking to you about the story of the Simpson sisters in the early 2000s? Because it is a textbook example of the power of people in marketing. Both TV shows allowed the Simpson sisters to show their personalities to a wide audience. We got to laugh with them, go behind the scenes of their lives, and, in the case of Ashlee, see their creative process in making their music. It catapulted sales of their products (albums) because we resonated with the people behind them. We wanted to hear what they had to say because we felt like we were a part of it.



Related: Mark Zuckerberg Is Becoming Meta's Ultimate InfluencerThis principle doesn't just apply to the music industry. Think about some of the biggest people we think about in today's business environment. Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs. Our perception of them as people has influenced how we perceive and buy their products.


The legacy of Steve Jobs is that of the rebel risk-taker who started out of his garage and went on to build the biggest brand in the world. Etched in our minds is the image of his black turtleneck and glasses as he presented the latest Apple products on stage. His legacy had us believing in innovation and risk and that, by proxy, as Apple consumers, we could be those things too.Oprah's stamp of approval means we'll trust her opinions on books, political figures, gifts for our families — you name it — because we believe her to be one of the most credible people alive today. We trust her, and as such, her influence is massive.Related: 11 Oprah-Approved Books Every Entrepreneur Should ReadWhy you should be your own brand influencerIn marketing, we talk a lot about influencers — creators. People you pay to make your brand stand out because they amass such large followings. While that can benefit brand growth, I want to advocate for Entrepreneurs to consider themselves the ultimate influencers for their brands. Why?


Because people buy from people — ones they know, like and trust.What better person to tell that story than you when creating a new offering and bringing your dream alive in this world? To be a great brand, you need your customers to trust you and truly believe in what you are selling. How can we cultivate trust when we're not creating a two-way street? When they're just associating your brand with a pretty logo instead of a person on an amazing mission?When we fail to show ourselves as people in our brand and business, we become commodities. For example, Uber and Lyft use these interchangeably based on price because we have no loyalty. Toothpaste is notoriously the least brand-loyal category in Consumer Packaged Goods. For Legal Services, if you don't know anyone or have a reference, you're likely to go with whoever has the best online presence and reviews. You'll go somewhere else if you don't like your initial interaction.People will betray brands but have a harder time betraying humans with whom they feel connected.


The downside of influencersWhen you pay an influencer to promote your brand, you are paying for them to expose your brand to their audience. The problem is that followers are loyal to them and not you.For example, Kelly Clarkson is a spokesmodel for Wayfair. When that contract ends, her followers are going with her. The draw is associating Kelly as a highly likable person with the brand — which they hope to make highly likable by proxy. While there is efficacy, people recognize that this person is getting paid to say positive things about the brand. It doesn't always feel 100% genuine. So, while your brand is getting more attention, is it getting more loyal customers?Related: A Face Behind the Brand: How to Humanize Your Business for Maximum GrowthInfluence + creationOne of the most powerful mergers we have seen in the business world is the creation of brands by people with massive influence. I'll use the example of the beauty industry, which has been completely shaken up in the past few years by two key trends:


The rise of low-cost/quality ""dupes"" (e.l.f.)The rise of the influencer/creator brands (Rare Beauty, Fenty Beauty, Haus Labs)The first category is based on commodities — getting 'the look' for less. The second is a powerful look at the results that happen when a person of influence creates their own brand. Rare Beauty was projected to do over $300M in sales last year alone. Fenty Beauty is estimated to be worth $2.8B. This is the compound effect of what happens when a person of influence creates a brand of their own.How to become your own brand influencerWe know influence works and why it's important, but we also know we'll never have as many followers as Selena Gomez. That's OK and, actually, preferable. When we talk about influence, we want to think less about width and more about depth. We want to get close to your audience. Focus your 'influence' on making a presence with and impacting the community you have created for your brand.Examples of how to harness that:Talk to your audience. Be curious about your customers and potential customers. Ask them questions about what they like/don't like. Introduce yourself as someone making waves in this space and get their perspectives on the problems they're facing.Find out where your clients are, and meet them there. Are they on TikTok or LinkedIn? How do they like to hear from you? What do they want to hear? If you don't know, ask. See the point above.Share your story and journey. Human beings are hardwired to connect with other human stories. It makes us relate, empathize and ultimately desire what you are selling. This doesn't mean you need to livestream your whole life. Do what feels comfortable to you. Share what feels authentic and good, and take your audience along for the ride. They want to see you win.Make your audience part of your brand. Have a new product drop? Why not invite 30 of your top-selling customers to an event where you get up Steve Jobs-style and present it? Ask them to beta-test your newest offerings before they drop. Find what matters to them most and be part of the solution, whether through your offerings or giving back in a way that impacts your community.Related: 6 Ways Your Company Will Benefit From Better Community Involvement


Bringing it all togetherBeing visible in your brand as an entrepreneur does not mean you become the entirety of your marketing strategy. It means you are seen as someone your customers can associate with your brand, understand/emphasize with and ultimately trust. As entrepreneurs, this is crucial as you grow your brand, especially as so many of us are multi-passionate and create other businesses. People loving your offer is one thing; connecting with your story and trusting your brand is a whole new level of success.

31,What to Look For — And Watch Out For — When Selecting Partners to Fuel Your Brand's Success,"Mar 18, 2024",Dan Rowe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/finding-the-right-partners-to-propel-your-business-vision/471103,"
The right franchisees will make you; the wrong franchisees will sink you. Maybe one of the most daunting aspects of becoming a franchisor is selecting the franchisees who will grow your brand. The right people do the right thing – pick the right locations, hire and motivate the right teams, hold the highest standards and are always investing in growth. The wrong people do the wrong thing — they pick the wrong location, hire the wrong people, motivate their teams the wrong way, cut corners, ignore standards, etc.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now and find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Multi-unit franchiseesThe point of owning a franchise is to get wealthy, and you do that by owning multiple units. The most successful franchisees are large, multi-unit franchisees who make you wealthier because they do it right. They pay you more in fees, they refer other franchisees to you, they even have ideas that can improve everyone's business.It takes a unique mindset to succeed in franchising — just because someone was successful in a prior life doesn't mean they will be successful franchisees. Franchising is ""sort-of"" entrepreneurship — the owners are investing in and taking on the risks of starting a new business, but that business is following someone else's playbook. They have to believe in and want to keep investing in that playbook.



Related: From Coding to Creole Cooking — Here Are 5 Inspiring Success Stories of Black-Owned BusinessesThe PlaybookThat playbook is what is making the franchisor wealthy — you only succeed if the franchisees succeed. Franchisees pre-pay you to come into your system, then continue to pay you to stay and prove your brands in more and different markets. As they grow, economies of scale give you more buying power for more profit. The result is a skyrocketing company value that you can sell someday for life-changing money.In addition to the obvious — honesty, stability, strong finances, etc. — here's what to look for when you're interviewing your ideal franchisee:


Curiosity. Is your interviewee asking you questions about your brand? If they are, that shows a passion for your business that will translate into success.Ambition. Your highest-performing franchisees will want to grow their business to develop generational wealth themselves. They want to succeed and use that success to open more units, which pays you more royalties and makes your business more attractive.Independence (sort of). The ideal franchisee follows the playbook — it's there for a reason and consistency is vital to the brand. But you don't want to spend all your time micromanaging then, either. Find people who will pick up the ball, run with it, and call you once or twice a year (one of which could be your birthday).Collaborative and cooperative. You want a team player who can share their ideas and experiences with you, their staff, and their peers at your other units. You know why Five Guys sells milkshakes? A franchisee suggested it. The Big Mac was invented by a franchisee. Thousands of people got rich.Positivity. You're going to have bad days, weeks, even months. People who remain positive about their business and the brand are critical for their success and your sanity.Accepts and offers feedback. As the franchisor, it's your job to ensure that all of your franchisees are superlative representatives of your brand. You've supplied the services and materials for them to succeed, but you should be available for advice and to check on how the business is going, especially in the early days.Helpful under pressure. You need people who will support each other and come up with ideas during an inevitable rough patch. When Covid hit, Firehouse Subs suspended royalties to help their franchisees. Franchisees worked with their landlords to defer rent. You have to be the person other people want to work with.Related: Want to Become a Franchisee? Run Through This Checklist First.What you don't wantJust as important as finding those exceptional candidates who are committed to following the playbook, being a team player, and adhering to brand standards is avoiding other types of potential franchisees:A single-unit operator. The purpose of franchising is not to buy a job. Someone who is just interested in buying a job should stay in the corporate world. The point of a franchise is to open another and another until you accumulate generational wealth.A tightwad. The adage ""Save a penny, lose a dollar,"" really applies here. A cheaper location may save on rent but will require a lot more marketing costs. Skimp on paying your employees, and the high turnover and lost productivity will cost you more in the long run. It could even destroy your brand. An extreme, but true example: I once interviewed a potential franchisee for Halal Guys who asked if he really had to serve halal chicken instead of the more affordable generic poultry. (Seriously? It's in the name.) Guess who didn't get the franchise?Someone who doesn't listen. You've developed the system that creates a successful business. People who won't accept your feedback not only sap your time and resources, but also your energy and brand value. The only answer is to terminate when you can.A backstabber. As I mentioned above, you're going to go through a rough patch. But positive people pull together to help each other. In another true story, a franchisor client got wind of a private chat channel among some franchisees who were badmouthing corporate, individuals and more. At the next franchise meeting, he called them out publicly — and then bought them out. We all have to pull in the same direction, otherwise we go nowhere.It takes time and research to find the right people, but it's the key to building a business that will not only succeed for you, but for the franchisees, and the people they serve.

32,From $0 to $10 Million — Here's How to Build a Winning Prop Trading Team,"Mar 15, 2024",Blake Olson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-build-a-winning-prop-trading-team/470675,"
Some issues in prop trading are the same as those faced in any niche, but some are unique to this constantly evolving segment. When I look at the structure, staff and technology from 12 months ago, my company is almost unrecognizable.Without the right mindset, keeping a handle on growth can be a bit like juggling chainsaws.The pivotal role of technologyTechnology is the lifeblood of the trading industry. By definition, our business only exists online. The rapid evolution of tools and platforms can dramatically alter the landscape overnight. We've seen this firsthand.



Leaders in this sector must exhibit an exceptional degree of technological savvy and an ""anticipatory"" vision to foresee and adapt to these changes. The adoption of new technologies forces a culture of continuous learning and innovation within the team. There is no such thing as the status quo!Team members who are slow to pursue ongoing education, experiment with new tools and dedicate time to strategic thinking don't last long. The desire to adapt is required for growth and competitive advantage.


Related: Earn Through a Recession by Learning Stock Trading StrategiesHarnessing diversityThe global nature of trading today means teams contain a variety of cultural and professional backgrounds. Our current team is spread over five different countries. This diversity, while a tremendous asset, also presents unique leadership challenges.Effective leaders must promote a cohesive team environment where every member feels valued and understood regardless of background and location. Solutions to lessen the ""artificial isolation"" team members from other parts of the world can experience are essential. This involves using technology to facilitate communication across different time zones, fostering an inclusive culture and seeing it as a strength rather than an obstacle.One example is having occasional video conferences that are not business-specific. They allow time for team members to speak freely about their lives, making a connection that business-only video calls don't allow for. You'd be amazed at the personal details that have come out of these calls. Everyone enjoys these moments. (And yes, everyone's camera must be on!)


Invariably, we see innovation and closer collaboration as a welcome result.Balancing the dynamics of contractors and full-time employeesProp trading is no different than every other company out there. Our team faces the ""contractors and full-time employees"" issue. We all know companies that failed to handle this properly and paid dearly.This mix can enrich the team with flexibility and specialized skills. Still, it also requires careful management to ensure everyone is on the same page and working steadily toward the company's goals.During a growth phase, when certain roles expand while others vanish, it's vital to constantly ask the question, ""Is this best handled internally, or will we outgrow this need in 6 months?""


Leaders must integrate these contributors, ensure clear communication and set firm expectations. Verbalizing clear expectations saves a lot of headaches. This issue mirrors the geographic challenge just mentioned. Promoting an environment where contracts feel ""vested"" in the company vision.There's another concept in play here. The principle of ""fire fast, hire slow"". I don't mean this in a purely ruthless sense. But having the readiness to make tough decisions is a spark for growth.Ensure that every member's presence is not just warranted but beneficial for the collective goal. Again, this philosophy is not rooted in a lack of compassion but in a commitment to excellence and the team's long-term success.Upholding integrity as a core valuesThe temptation for quick gains in the prop industry can lead to ethical quandaries with clients and business entities alike. Integrity is non-negotiable.


Bad actors exist in every niche. Unfortunately, prop trading is not immune from this. This makes it even more important for leaders to adhere to the highest ethical standards themselves and to instill these values in their teams.This involves creating a culture where ethical behavior is recognized and rewarded and where team members feel comfortable voicing concerns. Customer service sees different behaviors from clients than the tech team on the back end.As a rule, whenever cash changes hands or profits are on the line, someone will create a way to skirt the rules. By prioritizing integrity, leaders build a team that not only achieves success but also does so respectfully and legally. And in line with the company's long-term vision.Adapting team composition for future challengesThe skill sets and mindsets that contributed to initial successes may not indicate future success. Leaders must be vigilant in assessing the team's capabilities and ready to make adjustments as needed.


This might involve seeking out new talents with specific expertise or redefining roles within the team to better align with strategic goals. The same talent pool that gets a company $0 to $1 million in annual revenue is unlikely to be the one in place from $10 million to $50 million. Spotting ""talent bottlenecks"" is an acquired skill. But it is very necessary.Related: Learn Candlestick Trading: This E-learning Bundle Is $25 This Week OnlyThe art of leading a trading team to successLeading any team to success is an art that requires a blend of strategic foresight, technological proficiency and evolving interpersonal skills.Short version: If I had to pick a trait that pinpoints someone likely to stick with you through growth and challenge, I'd likely go with a desire for continuous learning.


By embracing these principles, leaders can build resilient, adaptable teams capable of sustained growth and even friendship. The journey is demanding, but I've found the rewards of cultivating a high-performing, ethically grounded team immeasurable.

34,"If You Want to be Successful, Become a Better Speaker — Follow This 7-Step Process for Effective Speaking","Mar 13, 2024",Scott Deming,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-be-an-better-communicator-in-7-steps/470597,"
Back in the late 1980s, when I was in the early stages of establishing my advertising agency, an invitation came my way to speak at a Chamber of Commerce event in Upstate New York. I turned it down. At that moment, the idea of declining might have seemed counterintuitive, especially given my aspirations to grow my business.The reason? I was afraid. Fear held me back from seizing an opportunity that could have propelled my agency forward. Not long after that failed opportunity, a pivotal moment arrived during a staff meeting. A few days after the meeting, my Art Director approached me with feedback that was both unsettling and enlightening. He said that everyone had been confused about a particular topic I had discussed, yet no one felt comfortable confronting me about it.This incident served as a wake-up call, prompting me to confront my fears and recognize the crucial role effective communication plays in business success. It was clear that if I intended to thrive as a businessperson, especially in a leadership role, mastering the art of public speaking was not just an option — it was a necessity.



Fast forward to today, forty years later. I started and ran a very successful advertising agency for nearly twenty years. I have been speaking and training globally for over twenty years. I can say with 100% certainty that focusing on better presentation skills after that feedback from my employee was the most important career decision I've ever made.Related: The Complete, 20-Step Guide to Ace Public Speaking


You don't have to be a professional speaker to speak like a professionalThroughout my career, I've had the distinct privilege of coaching aspiring professional speakers as well as numerous executives, guiding them toward becoming not just better communicators but compelling presenters. Whether it's delivering a critical pitch to board members, leading a staff meeting, or captivating an audience at industry conferences, the power to communicate with both passion and precision is paramount. And by precision, I mean far more than just covering bullet points. It's about hitting those crucial, emotionally charged points that truly connect with your audience.Related: What is a Keynote Speaker and Why Are They Important?Improving presentation skills is an ongoing process that can significantly enhance a leader's effectiveness and ability to achieve organizational objectives. Here are seven steps to becoming a better presenter and a more effective communicator.Understand your audience: Begin by researching and understanding your audience. What are their interests, challenges, and expectations? Tailoring your message to the audience's needs and perspectives increases engagement and impact.Master your content: Know your material inside and out. This doesn't mean memorizing your presentation word for word but being comfortable with the content so you can adapt on the fly, answer questions, and engage in meaningful dialogue.Practice relentlessly: If possible, practice your presentation multiple times in various settings. This can include practicing in front of a mirror, with a trusted friend or colleague, or recording yourself to review your performance. The goal is to become comfortable with your delivery and refine your pacing, tone, and body language.Engage with storytelling: Incorporate storytelling into your presentations. Stories are powerful tools for making complex information understandable and memorable. Use personal anecdotes or hypothetical scenarios that resonate with your audience's experiences.Hone your nonverbal communication: Pay attention to your body language, eye contact, and use of space. Nonverbal cues can reinforce your message or, if not managed well, distract from it. Ensure your posture is confident, your gestures are purposeful, and you maintain eye contact with your audience to build a connection.Manage nervous energy: Learn techniques to manage anxiety and nervous energy. This can include deep breathing exercises, positive visualization, or a pre-presentation routine that helps you center yourself. Recognize that some nervousness is natural and can be channeled into dynamic energy that enhances your presentation.Seek feedback and continuously improve: After each presentation, seek constructive feedback from peers, mentors, or audience members. Reflect on what worked well and what could be improved. Consider working with a coach or joining organizations like Toastmasters International to gain insights and practice in a supportive environment.By following these steps and committing to continuous improvement, you'll become a better speaker or presenter and a more effective communicator, capable of inspiring and leading others with confidence and clarity.

Now, let's delve into the key benefits of mastering presentation skills for any leader.Influence and persuasion: Effective presentation skills enable leaders to influence their audience's attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Persuasive presentations can motivate teams, sway stakeholders, and drive organizational change. A leader who is a compelling presenter can better advocate for their vision, inspire action and garner support for initiatives.Clarity and direction: Leaders often need to communicate complex information, strategies, and visions to a diverse audience.

Clear presentations help demystify complex issues and provide a roadmap for what needs to be done.Credibility and trust: Presentation skills are directly tied to a leader's credibility. Leaders who present confidently and effectively are more likely to be perceived as knowledgeable and competent.

By being a better presenter, a leader can connect with their audience on a personal level, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose. This engagement is crucial for inspiring teams and driving them to embrace challenges and achieve goals.Adaptability and impact: Leaders must be able to tailor presentations to different audiences and situations. Effective presenters can adjust their message, tone, and delivery to suit the situation, whether they're motivating a team, pitching to investors, or speaking at a large conference. This adaptability maximizes the impact of their communication, ensuring that their messages resonate broadly and drive desired outcomes.In conclusion, becoming an exceptional presenter is a personal and professional evolution, marking a leader's commitment to excellence and influence. It's a path that amplifies a leader's effectiveness and elevates the entire organization.

35,You Can Fear It and Still Use It — Why Are So Many American Workers Shy About AI?,"Mar 13, 2024",Artis Rozentals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/you-can-fear-ai-and-still-embrace-it-heres-why/470581,"
Recently, a study followed over 100,000 workers from the USA, Europe, the UK and India, tracking time spent in various AI applications during work hours. The tracked apps include AI apps such as ChatGPT and Perplexity and AI-enabled tools such as Canva and Bing that have added AI features to their apps.Here's how many hours the average worker spent using AI apps by country/region in 2023:USA – 93.6h (~12 eight-hour workdays)UK – 150.1h (~19 workdays)Europe – 175.1h (~22 workdays)India – 241h (~30 workdays)Moreover, generative AI darling ChatGPT was the most used AI app in all regions — except for the USA, where it came in second to the AI-enabled design tool Canva.



The data, corroborated by other studies, also strongly points to the average US worker being an outlier regarding AI adoption, which raises the question — why? And is it something to be worried about?Related: Why People Fear Generative AI — and What to Do About It


Why is it a worrying trend?Much ink has been spilled on how AI is a game-changer for businesses and knowledge workers. For employees specifically, it promises heightened efficiency and productivity across various fields, from content creation and design to business operations and data analysis.The general consensus is that companies and workers who fail to capitalize on these benefits will inevitably have to give way to those who do. Accordingly, there is a real risk of Americans falling behind the curve unless adoption is encouraged.Not just in terms of lost efficiency but also knowledge. We're still in the early stages of the AI revolution, meaning AI will only grow more advanced and capable as time passes. So, understanding the fundamentals of what AI is and how to leverage it can be invaluable in the long term, especially when AI becomes fully ingrained in our way of life and work.A good analogy is GenZ's relationship with technology. Having grown up with smartphones in hand, they're often unfairly expected to be tech-savvy and are even ridiculed when they struggle with some tech tasks that older generations may find self-evident. But this self-evidence comes from having grown up in tandem with the developing technology (What do you mean why is the save button a weird square?!) rather than any innate superior comprehension. Similarly, I expect that being intimately aware of how AI evolves will be advantageous to its users in the future, and early adopters will have the upper hand.


Related: Why You Shouldn't Be Afraid of Artificial IntelligenceOn top of all that, prompt engineering — the action of giving AI the best prompt for the intended results — is a skill, and just like any other skill, it must be honed. AI is a tool that must be learned and explored to get the most out of it, and the earlier you set out on your exploratory journey, the better equipped you will be for future challenges.At this point, one might ask – but what's the point if AI will take our jobs anyway?It's about attitudeUnderstandably, AI's disruptive potential and multifaceted capabilities have many workers worried about being made redundant. The public attitude toward AI is grim — nearly half of Americans believe that AI automation may hurt their job security, and three in four expect AI to negatively affect the job market at large, according to Gallup.


Of course, these worries are by no means exclusive to American workers. A public attitude survey by the UK's Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation found that ""while AI is expected to produce increased day-to-day convenience and improved public services, apprehensions remain about job displacement and human de-skilling."" French companies and employees are also concerned.But there's an outlier – India.While more than half of Indian workers mirror the growing unease about AI's potential impact on jobs, it's paired with optimism about the technology, with 74% excited about the prospect of AI in the workplace. The overwhelming majority view AI as an enabler that can significantly improve efficiency, productivity, quality of work, job satisfaction and overall happiness.I believe this, namely, attitude toward technology, is one major reason why workers in India use AI over two-and-a-half times more than American ones.Related: AI May Not Take Your Job, But Someone Using AI Likely Will — Here's Why.Unsubscribe from the nihilistic narrativeIn the Western public discourse, AI is generally portrayed as an existential threat to our way of life, as a foe coming to take our jobs and upend any shred of normalcy left in these turbulent times.Understandably, the natural response is to resist or to close your eyes and hope the trend will pass. But neither of these is realistic, as AI continues to permeate modern business and work environments.Faced with the fact that AI is here to stay, I believe the only viable avenue is to embrace it. Though its inner workings may be complex, the technology itself is extremely accessible, and any misconceptions can be quickly dispelled by simply trying it. In this regard, business leaders should carry the torch and encourage employees to begin using AI, if for no other reason than at least to alleviate their own daily workloads.


It's okay to be worried about change – everyone is. But don't let that stop you from growing as an entrepreneur or professional.As the freshly minted adage goes, ""AI won't take your job. Workers who use AI will.""

      Key Takeaways    



        As someone who's pitched investors — and been declined — and now a venture capitalist, I have a unique understanding of investors' minds. 
      


        Here are seven common reasons VCs say no to startups and how you can prevent it from happening to you.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""No.""This one little word can be the most excruciating thing to hear for entrepreneurs desperately seeking funding for their dream venture. Unfortunately, most entrepreneurs will hear ""no"" often. According to a study published in Harvard Business Review, only 1% of meetings with potential investors turn into a partnership.While it was challenging to hear investors decline my pitches as an entrepreneur, I find it just as difficult to turn down budding startups now that I'm on the other end of the spectrum. Luckily, my years of experience in both capacities have helped me better understand the minds of investors. That's why I want to share seven reasons investors might reject your business pitch.



Related: Venture Capital 101: A Comprehensive Guide for Startups Seeking Investment1. Your numbers don't line upPart of meeting with potential investors is sharing the raw numbers of your business. For some, this isn't a problem, while others feel some trepidation and may even consider making things sound better than they are. It may have been an honest mistake. Either way, venture capitalists are savvy and will always spot incongruencies, especially when they do their due diligence — which they will.


If they find the numbers you presented aren't accurate, they'll call you on it. Integrity and competency are vital for solid business partnerships, and a failure in either area could put your reputation at stake.2. Poor consumer perceptionThis may seem obvious, but if your target audience isn't buying what you're selling, neither will investors. Even if your sales numbers are considerable, if your customers aren't happy with your product or service or there's a consistent theme of discontent, that's a clear signal to step away from the table.Venture capitalists need to know that you're doing everything possible to ensure customers are satisfied and cared for. Not only are happy consumers more likely to remain loyal to your company if they're happy, there's a higher likelihood they'll share your product or service with others.3. Your company lacks diversityCulture matters. It's what drives good organizations to become better ones. A crucial part of developing a solid culture is embracing and hiring people from different backgrounds with various perspectives. This is how innovation thrives.


A lack of diversity in your company now may tell investors that building a diverse culture will become a problem as the organization grows later. One caveat: Don't make it about meeting some ""quota."" It should come from a genuine desire to expand your horizons and create positive change for your company and industry.Related: Serial Entrepreneur Turned VC Reveals 4 Numbers You Need to Know to Scale Your Company4. You seem difficult to work withEven if they believe in your business, most venture capitalists won't just hand you a check and pat you on the back. No, it's more about forming a lasting partnership to ensure the company's long-term success.That means that while it's the company you built, you're still open to new ideas or suggestions for improving it. Investors know what works and what doesn't and want to pass that on — but only to someone willing to listen. If you come off as an entrepreneur who must have everything done your way, you'll be hard-pressed to find willing suitors.


5. Your business won't stand outYou can have a solid business model with a quality product or service, but your company will blend in with the rest if nothing differentiates you from what's out there already. In a market likely saturated with similar ideas, investors want to see something that will make your idea stand out. How is what you offer innovative from what currently exists? If it's not, they won't be interested.Successful entrepreneurs know their market and customer base inside and out. They have done extensive research on what others are doing so that they can deliver something special.6. You're underpreparedSimply getting a meeting with venture capitalists is a feat in itself. With hundreds of proposals and pitches coming at them, their time is a finite resource. There are no second chances.If a question from an investor catches you off guard or you don't have a satisfactory answer at the ready, you're not likely to gain their confidence and support. I know you're likely putting in 20-hour days just to keep your dream alive, but you can't afford to be off when you have a shot like this.


It's a lot of pressure to be under, but it's also an excellent chance to show investors you can handle it. Despite everything you're going through, coming prepared for every possible scenario or challenge speaks volumes to your ability to lead a successful business.Related: Embrace Change or Miss Out On Money — 5 Trends to Know in Venture Capital This Year7. It's just not a good fitRejection isn't always something wrong with your business. Sometimes, investors say no because your company doesn't fit well with their investment portfolio. Every venture capitalist has a specific investment strategy that they adhere to. It's how they became successful in the first place. They'll occasionally take a chance on a business idea outside their realm, but that's only if they feel confident it's a can't-miss opportunity.For some, it might be less about the industry or market and more about your company's growth stage. Regardless, do your homework on the investors and firms you're meeting with. What's their typical profile? What markets do they usually go for? Do they tend to invest more in Series A funding or other rounds? Like any other interview, you need to know who you're talking to and have your questions ready.


These are just a few examples of why you might not get the support you're hoping for from investors. It can come down to countless factors, some within your control and others not. The best advice I can give you is to use every rejection — every ""no"" — as fuel to improve your business, your product, and yourself until you find that one ""yes"" you're looking for.

39,3 Ways to Achieve Cohesion Across Your Organization's Cybersecurity,"Mar 11, 2024",Jason Oeltjen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-to-create-cohesion-within-your-organizations/470290,"
Data protection and digital privacy have generated significant attention from C-suite leaders, with the Securities and Exchange Commission recently proposing public companies' Board of Directors share the responsibility of IT security supervision, compliance and risk mitigation.As business leaders begin to educate themselves on the fundamentals of cybersecurity, one of the things they cannot overlook is cohesion. With disparate security tools abound, leaders must ensure the IT security stack is working together — rather than creating additional silos.Here's how to achieve optimal cohesion across the security stack.



1. Achieve visibility across all systemsOne of the biggest benefits of a cohesive IT security stack is greater visibility. During a time when cyber threats are more sophisticated than ever before, organizations cannot afford to have blind spots – nor should security teams be chasing false positives. But a common question business leaders face is how to increase visibility without necessarily reinventing the wheel or replacing several security tools in the arsenal.One of the ways to maximize visibility and integration across systems is through a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. SIEMs consolidate data from various systems to provide a centralized view granting users real-time visibility across the entire IT environment. It's one of the first recommendations I typically make to business leaders who want to better understand their organization's security posture without boiling the ocean.


Related: The 'Mother of All Breaches' Just Happened — Here's the Security Implications for Businesses2. Strengthen API securityOnce visibility is established, you must also evaluate the security of the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) through which your systems, tools and applications interact. In simplest terms, APIs work as a backend framework for mobile and web applications — and cybercriminals often take advantage of any API security gaps as a means to gain access to an organization.If APIs aren't properly secured, they can become the next big supply chain attack, with malicious actors introducing malicious code during the attack and wreaking havoc on an organization. In fact, recent research found that cyber attacks targeting APIs increased a whopping 400% from June to December 2022, and since then, they have shown no signs of slowing down.Business leaders must ask themselves: how confident is the organization in its API security? How exactly are these APIs protected? APIs need to have high levels of security; otherwise, they are no safer than a standard password login.


Related: Cyber Threats Are More Prevalent Than Ever — So Don't Leave Your Business Exposed. Here's How to Protect It.3. Ensure flexible integrationsIn addition to gaining visibility and bolstering API security, it's important to strive for flexible integrations across your security systems.To achieve this, first determine:Are you integrating your systems through custom coding? While coding has its benefits, a major drawback is the long-term impact that will arise when engineers leave the company. The U.S. Labor Department estimates that the global shortage of software engineers may reach 85.2 million by 2030, and the position will likely be a revolving door between now and then. How easy will it be for the new engineer to continue working on this custom code? This creates a major barrier to modernizing infrastructure.What happens when you have to swap out one vendor for another, especially to meet compliance requirements or reduce budget? This is where identity orchestration plays a massive role. Traditionally, identity has become a bottleneck in the integration process, but through identity orchestration, enterprises now have the ability to add or remove vendors – spanning applications and services – with speed and ease. It's like an 'easy button' for the tech stack, ensuring simplicity, flexibility and seamlessness across the entire user experience.Are you factoring in all costs of integration, even those that are hidden or come after the fact? I've come across a new vendor being selected due to cost savings, but then organizations forget to consider the runway to integrate the new system into the ecosystem – and the hidden costs that can come with that. Often, these costs can be up to four times the cost of the new system, along with needing 6-12 months to integrate effectively into the organization. Luckily, identity orchestration can help with integration timing as well as long-term ROI.Regardless of the organization's size or sector, businesses are always looking for a more cohesive experience across the tech stack, where speed and security are optimal. This year, when all eyes are on security — including the Board's — is the ideal time to start paving the path towards simpler, seamless security integrations.

40,Don't Leave Money on the Table — How to Find Out If You're Underpricing Your Products (and What to Do About It),"Mar 9, 2024",Itai Sadan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/are-you-underpricing-your-products-heres-how-to-find-out/468841,"
Do your customers know what your products are worth? That may seem like a bizarre question at first, but in reality, many businesses routinely fail to convey the actual value of their products. Unsurprisingly, this miscommunication is seldom in a business's favor.More than 20 years ago, experts at McKinsey & Company found that between 80% and 90% of mispriced products are priced too low — and that remains true today. That's potential revenue lost right out of the gate, and more than you might think. A 1% increase in price without a change in the volume of products sold equates to an 11.1% increase in operating profits, according to this comprehensive study by Harvard Business Review published in 1992 and still widely cited today.Related: 10 Questions to Ask When Pricing Your Product



Where does value go?Your products and services inherently create a certain amount of value for your customers. We'll call this the ""actual value."" In the ideal world, everything you sell would be priced based on the actual value. However, we don't live in the ideal world. Actual value is monstrously difficult to calculate and can fluctuate per customer.Not all of your customers will be able to see, or frankly even benefit from, the total potential of any given product. Smartwatches, for example, can track hundreds of unique exercises, but if all you do is run, then the value of those additional features would be difficult to see. Marketing has an impact as well. Sticking with the smartwatch example, if you fail to effectively communicate a useful feature — leaving your potential customers unaware — then that can have a negative impact on this ""perceived value.""


Now, your customers may agree that your product produces a certain amount of value for them, but that doesn't mean they're willing to pay for it. Dozens of factors can impact how much a particular customer is willing to pay: urgency, income, brand loyalty, advertising, social impact, etc. Finding this number is tricky, yet highly rewarding. If you can identify the maximum amount your customers are willing to pay, you can maximize your profits while capturing as much value as possible.Many companies are unable to determine exactly how much their customers are willing to pay. What that means is that the price your customers typically expect to pay is instead the ""target price."" This is the value that you and your team hopefully determined is as close to the actual willingness-to-pay value as possible.Finally, if you work in a sales-heavy field you may find additional value being lost to concessions and discounts. In this situation, the final price paid would be known as the ""realized price."" How much value was lost between all of these steps? Many think quite a bit. Bain and Company found after interviewing dozens of CEOs, CMOs and other executives at more than 1,700 companies that roughly 85% of those who responded believed they could be doing a better job making pricing decisions.How can I capture more value?Let's begin by trying to understand how much our customers are actually willing to pay for our products or services. We can do this by surveying our customers, assembling focus groups, experimenting with pricing or even hosting an auction.


If we're not happy with how much our customers are willing to pay, we may need to take a step back and instead focus on their perceived value of your product or service. When we help our customers see more value through activities like branding, outreach and communication we directly increase how much they're willing to pay.Alternatively, we can choose to adopt a different pricing structure entirely. More and more service-based businesses are looking towards metric-based pricing to offer an adaptive structure that better aligns with the perceived value of each unique customer. Some examples of metric-based pricing are usage-based like gym punch passes and cellular minutes, or user-based pricing, which is a popular choice in the SaaS realm. There are great examples of metric-based pricing all around us. Mechanics often charge per hour while bowling alleys frequently charge per game. These metrics work because they're reasonable, predictable and fair.Related: How to Get the Price Your Product or Service DeservesDon't miss out on potential profitLet's look at the math together. Imagine with me for a moment that you own a coffee shop selling lattes for $5 each. These lattes cost you $1 to make, earning you $4 in profit. If you sold 100 lattes, unsurprisingly you would make $400 in profit.


However, unbeknownst to you, your customers are willing to pay $7 for that same latte. That's a more generous $6 in profit, netting you an additional $200 per 100 lattes sold — a 150% increase. In fact, even if you wound up selling fewer lattes — let's say 90 instead of 100, that's still a 135% increase in profits.In short, don't leave any money lying on the table. If your customers are willing to pay more, now is the time to find out.

41,Ground Floor to Sky High — The Unmatched Potential of Investing in Emerging Franchises,"Mar 8, 2024",Dan Rowe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-smart-bet-on-emerging-franchises/468890,"
Sam Walton opened the first Walmart store in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas. Today, it's a global behemoth, with more than 10,500 stores around the world. The first McDonald's was opened by the McDonald brothers in 1940 in San Bernardino, California, and its first franchised restaurant by Ray Kroc in 1955 in Des Plaines, Illinois. As of 2023, it has 40,801 restaurants worldwide.Both of these global giants started with just one unit. So can you. In fact, today's technology allows a franchisor — or a franchisee — to grow name recognition and a business faster than Sam or Ray could ever have dreamed of.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Get in on the ground floorAs a potential franchisee, it's undoubtedly tempting to buy into an established chain, and as a company that is helping more mature companies continue to expand, we know that many still have plenty of opportunities to grow. But there's a price: you're paying the franchisor more for that lack of risk, which limits how much you can compound your returns. In addition, your geographical reach could be limited — if your chosen market is already maxed out, you'll have to look elsewhere, which could be far away, both geographically and in terms of your comfort zone.



Think about the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of an emerging chain. It's less known, so it's probably much less expensive. As of 2021, the McDonald's website says it requires a minimum of $500,000 of non-borrowed personal resources to consider someone for a McDonald's franchise. A typical McDonald's can cost the franchisee between $1.5 - $2.5 million and you may be limited as to where you can locate.Then take a look at a still-growing chain like our client Halal Guys, which has fewer than 500 restaurants open and planned. Typical domestic investment costs, including franchise fees, range from $542,025 to $1,459,425. An even newer chain, such as Mexican quick-service eatery Cilantro Taco Grill, needs costs from $378,000 to $831,000.And you a have much better chance of getting the territory you want for much less money, a major benefit to first-time franchisors. Then, as your ROI is higher, you can continue to invest in more units at that still-lower price. Your compounding is much greater than with a mature concept.


Related: Don't Make These 5 Risky Franchise Ownership MistakesSocial media marketingAfraid of working with the little-known? Don't be. It's also much easier than in previous years to create a buzz around a new concept, thanks to social media. Young consumers are always looking for something new, and if they find it and like it, they tell their friends and followers all about it. They, and TikTok/Instagram/whatever, do a lot of your marketing for you. That unknown name won't be unknown for long. And that marketing builds upon itself, as many influencers have followers in other regions. Can someone who liked a fellow franchisor's restaurant in Boise, Idaho, influence your territory in Louisiana? Count on it.With an emerging chain, the odds are also much better that you'll have more personal contact and support from the founders. (I'll bet few individual franchisors are on a first-name basis with McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski, no matter how nice a guy he is.) Meanwhile, early franchisees can access the advice and sometimes even just sympathies of the founding franchisor and their fellow early unit owners. Early Cilantro Taco Grill franchisees, for example, will benefit from the marketing expertise of Armando Christian Perez, an investor who is committed to helping Latino hourly employees become business owners.You may know Perez better as rapper/songwriter/actor Pitbull. We're all excited to be working with him.Related: See the 2024 Franchise 500 rankingsFamily feelingOver time, many early franchisees become almost like a family. And in time, they can turn those experiences into new investments.


Nearly 30 years ago, Donald Bauer, a small Domino's Pizza franchisee, joined Philip Horn to help him run his Papa John's franchised restaurants. Together, they built that then-new chain to more than 60 units, and then built a 24-restaurant Qdoba chain, at the time relatively unknown. They sold that and are now expanding their Jersey Mike's franchises, and opening quick-service chicken and salad restaurants. In fact, they've done so well in dining that they're taking their business expertise to yet another emerging concept — GLO30, a doctor-founded skincare membership concept that Fransmart is assisting.As any investor will tell you, it pays to get in on the ground floor — if you and the concept are smart. For example, someone who purchased and held $10,000 of Amazon stock at its 1997 IPO would have had $16,454,196 in 2022. Of course, no one can predict that kind of return on anything — just think about spectacular collapses in recent years (RIP, Blockbuster). Remember that in those 25 years, Amazon has had its share of truly scary days.But the stock market is a lot more volatile than a successful franchised restaurant or retailer. Franchising can take some of the ""scary"" out of the emerging business equation. You already have a strong concept, the benefit of support from founders and your fellow franchisees, and the ability to grow a business before it becomes too expensive an investment to consider. It really can be a risk worth taking to make life-changing wealth.

42,I've Worked Remotely For Over 20 Years — 5 Common Mistakes Companies Make When It Comes to Remote Operations,"Mar 7, 2024",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-common-mistakes-companies-make-with-remote-sops/467326,"
SOPs, or standard operating procedures, are a must for any company — remote or otherwise. However, when working with an entirely remote team, some special considerations need to be put in place. Directing and working remotely for over 20 years, I have a unique perspective on this that I would like to share.1. Out of sight, out of mindIt is common practice to share standard operating procedures during onboarding with new hires, but past that, most companies never mention operating procedures again — unless, of course, there is a change that needs to be made. It is a good idea to have employees review procedures regularly, even if no edits have been made. I recommend reviewing them quarterly in a meeting, or perhaps you could send a survey out a couple of times each year that requires employees to review standard operating procedures and provide feedback on areas they believe can be improved.I once worked with a team that sent out a survey once a year to employees, and to encourage participation every employee received a $50 gift card for completing the survey. Not only did all the employees fill out the survey, but that team had the best standard operating procedures because they were consistently updated and reviewed. Get your team involved, and don't just put operating procedures out of sight and out of mind after onboarding.



Related: I've Managed Remote Teams For 15 Years — Here Are My 3 Most Important Leadership Lessons.2. Ignoring the need for flexibilityRemote work allows employees to have more control over their schedules and work environments, but many companies still adhere to rigid structures that don't accommodate this flexibility. This lack of flexibility can hinder productivity and creativity, as employees may feel restricted and unable to adapt to their unique circumstances. Common working hours are a good start to establish, but keep in mind this is not meant to be the typical 9 to 5 where an employee is at their desk all day.


In my opinion, it is crucial to include in your operating procedures when you expect someone to work. You can mention a time limit such as a minimum of five hours daily, or you can offer specific hours such as 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. The best way to do this is to outline a set of hours that everyone needs to be working at the same time, regardless of time zone — and be sure to let everyone know what time zone they should be referring to! A default zone should be used for everyone, like central standard time.3. Inadequate communication proceduresWithout clear and efficient communication channels, remote teams can struggle to stay connected and aligned. This can lead to misunderstandings, delays and decreased productivity. It's important for companies to establish effective communication protocols, such as regular check-ins, team meetings and utilizing communication tools like video conferencing or messaging platforms. Additionally, providing guidelines on expected response times and communication etiquette can help remote workers feel supported and connected.Another company I worked with offered incentives for those who responded faster than the required time on a regular basis. This ranged from a special bonus to extra time off, and it applied to both internal and external communications. This was outlined in their operating procedures so everyone knew how long they had to respond to messages for coworkers and customers alike. It created a very collaborative environment where everyone was connected and stayed on top of things. It was highlighted in the procedures that everyone would use a single platform to communicate (which, for this particular company, was Slack).4. Failure to address technical challengesFrom unstable internet connections to outdated software, these issues can severely impact productivity and hinder remote workers from performing their tasks effectively. Failing to address these technical challenges not only frustrates employees but also prevents them from reaching their full potential. A good procedure to have in place is what to do when technology does not work — should employees call someone? Send a text? What steps should be taken to let the rest of the team know when something is not working?


The best way to tackle this issue is to include contact information in your operating procedures. That way if someone's computer crashes before a meeting, they can call/text/email the right person to let them know what is happening and ask for what the next steps should be. Include a grace period too; for example, let your employees know that if they are not able to get their computers up and running 10 minutes before a meeting they should reach out to their manager.Related: Remote Work Is the Great Equalizer in the Workplace. Here's How It Will Make Your Business a Better Place to Work.5. Insufficient training and onboarding proceduresMany remote companies tend to throw their new employees into the metaphorical deep end and hope they learn how to swim on their own. While some personalities can handle this, it is extremely difficult and stressful for any person to try to figure out how to operate within a company like that. It is incredibly important to have standard operating procedures for how to onboard a new member to the team from getting them logins to training them on how to use the software given to them to do their job.Your procedures do not have to be overly detailed here, just a general outline for everyone to follow. For example, step one for remote workers should be getting your new team members all the logins they need. Step two should be training on how to use the systems they will work in daily such as instant messaging software and time tracking software. From there your company can customize the steps as needed.


Standard operating procedures unite employees and give them direction within a company, and when working remotely, it is extra important to keep them up to date and in front of everyone so that your employees know what is expected of them and how to handle problems.

43,This Revenue Hack Can Increase Your Small Business Earnings by up to 30%,"Mar 7, 2024",Adam Povlitz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/expand-your-small-business-income-by-investing-in-this/470329,"
We all know that the rise of the digital age has revolutionized organizations' operations, enabling them to explore new income avenues with minimal investment. This has never been truer for small businesses. For this group, embracing e-commerce platforms and online marketplaces can catapult them into new opportunities. The average revenue increase by investing in marketing for a small business can vary significantly depending on various factors such as the industry, target market, marketing strategies employed, and the effectiveness of the campaigns. However, businesses that invest in strong marketing efforts typically experience an average revenue growth of 30% — some significantly more.Investing more time and resources toward their online presence allows even the smallest businesses to tap into global customer bases that were once out of reach, boosting their revenue potential and keeping operations manageable. One size does not fit all, and strategies depend on your business industry. Here are some to consider.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Service bundlesDeveloping service bundles or packages can be a winning strategy to expand revenue without overextending operations. By combining existing core services with compatible offerings, businesses can provide added value to customers while increasing their revenue streams.



For example, a graphic design agency could bundle branding, website development, and social media management services, offering clients a comprehensive marketing package. This approach attracts new customers and promotes customer loyalty, as clients recognize the convenience and cost-effectiveness of bundled services.Subscription models and strategic partnershipsSubscription-based business models have become more prevalent in recent years, offering steady revenue streams and fostering customer loyalty (think Netflix and Amazon Prime). Small businesses can creatively implement subscription models tailored to their industry to secure recurring income.For instance, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company can offer tiered subscriptions with varying features and benefits, enticing customers to upgrade for additional services. By continually providing added value, brands can maintain a loyal customer base while expanding their revenue opportunities.


Collaborating with strategic partners can be a game-changer for small businesses seeking new revenue streams. By joining forces with like-minded organizations, they can leverage each other's resources, expertise, and customer bases. Partnerships offer a variety of collaborative opportunities, such as co-marketing initiatives, cross-selling promotions, and joint ventures, making them a popular alternative to outright selling (or merging) a business.Related: Want to Become a Franchisee? Run Through This Checklist First.Licensing and franchisingLicensing or franchising can be a viable option to expand revenue streams without spreading operations too thin. This approach allows businesses to generate additional income by granting others the rights to operate under their established brand and proven systems.Franchising provides a low-risk path to expansion, as the franchisees manage their financial and operational responsibilities. This strategy has proven successful in many different industries, from fast food to fitness studios to commercial cleaning.Tailoring strategies to address challengesWhile the principles of forging new revenue streams apply to businesses of all sizes, small businesses, in particular, often face unique challenges. Limited resources, tight budgets, and a smaller market segment necessitate careful planning and creative thinking.These businesses should focus on niche markets, identifying specific unmet customer needs to carve out a competitive edge and attract a loyal customer base.Related: Is Franchising Right For You? Ask Yourself These 9 Questions to Find Out.Five revenue-boosting examples for common business concepts:Consultation Services: A professional services firm, such as a law or accounting firm, can branch out by offering specialized consultation services in niche areas. For instance, a law firm specializing in intellectual property could provide consultation services for startups looking to protect their patents and copyrights.Rental Services: A small retailer can leverage underutilized inventory by offering rental services. For example, a high-end fashion boutique can rent designer dresses for special occasions, creating an additional revenue stream while maximizing the value of their inventory.Customization and Personalization: A small manufacturing company can differentiate itself by offering customized or personalized products. This could include engraving, monogramming, or customizable features that cater to individual customer preferences, allowing them to charge a premium price for customized offerings.Membership Programs: A fitness center or gym can introduce tiered membership programs that offer additional benefits to members. This can include exclusive access to specialized classes, personal training sessions, or discounted rates for affiliated services, generating recurring revenue through membership fees.Value-added Services: A small restaurant can expand its revenue by offering catering services for events and parties. Additionally, they can explore partnering with local businesses to offer bundled services like catering and venue rental, providing a seamless experience for customers and generating additional income streams.Developing additional revenue streams is a key strategy for businesses aiming for sustained growth and relevance in an evolving marketplace. Organizations can unlock new income sources by adopting digital platforms, creating service bundles, implementing subscription models, forming strategic partnerships, or exploring licensing opportunities.For small businesses, it's crucial to prioritize scalability and customer-centric strategies to maintain operational efficiency while pursuing revenue diversification. By pursuing innovative approaches, they can forge new revenue streams and position themselves for long-term success.

As cool as it is being a one-person team at first, there comes a time when growth means getting additional support. But how do you know when that time has arrived? Here are a few signs it may be worth outsourcing some tasks rather than trying to do everything solo:1. You're working long hours — but not being efficientWe've all been there — it's midnight, and you've been glued to your laptop for hours doing social media posts, data entry, or customer service. While dedication is great, constant long days aren't sustainable and may lower your productivity. When you find yourself wasting time redoing work because you're overtired, it's a sign your efforts could be better spent focusing on higher-level tasks.

Tasks are piling upIf you open your to-do list and it feels never-ending, that's a hint you may need to offload some work. Are invoices, emails, orders, or other administrative things starting to stack up because you don't have time to keep up? Outsourcing mundane yet necessary tasks can help you get back on track.


3. You're spending too much time on low-value workAs business owners, our limited hours are best spent on work that drives growth and revenue, such as product design, marketing strategies, partnership deals, etc. But it's easy to get bogged down doing data entry, social media posting, or customer service replies that don't lever your unique talents. VAs allow you to delegate commodity tasks and focus on the work only you can do.Related: Wasted Employee Time Adds Up: Here's How to Fix It4. You're not able to commit fully to new opportunitiesIf a promising partnership or project comes your way, but you have to turn it down due to being too swamped already, that's an issue. Not taking worthwhile chances can limit your growth. By outsourcing mundane work, you free up precious time and mental bandwidth to seize any opportunities that come your way.5. Your work-life balance is sufferingWhile passion for your business is great, constantly working long hours isn't healthy or sustainable long-term. Are you missing out on family time, friend commitments, or hobbies and interests because you're chained to your laptop? Outsourcing gives back some of your personal life so you don't burn out.

You can't take a vacation without panickingIf taking even a few days off causes you anxiety about falling behind, it's evident you need support. Business owners deserve downtime to rest and unwind so they can stay fresh. VA help means you don't have to work alone.So, in summary — if your time is increasingly spent on low-level, repetitive tasks at the expense of strategic work, it's likely a sign your business needs assistance to thrive. The good news is high-quality, cost-effective virtual help from places worldwide has made outsourcing more accessible than ever for solopreneurs and small businesses alike.But how do you know what exactly to outsource and how to find and manage virtual help? Here are a few guidelines:


Assess Your Workflow and Define Outsourceable Tasks — Take a step back to analyze how you currently spend your days. What repetitive jobs could a VA handle, such as data entry, customer service, and social media posting? Make a list of tangible, clearly outlined tasks that don't require your unique expertise.Consider Costs vs Your Hourly Rate — Calculate how much your own time is worth per hour based on your desired salary. VA labor rates are generally far lower, so determine if outsourcing could save you money in the long run.Research VA Companies and Online Marketplaces — Sites like Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn provide profiles of hundreds of VAs worldwide with different specialties, languages, and rates. Read reviews to find out trustworthy freelancers.Be Ultra-Clear in Your Job Description — Whether you post on a marketplace or directly hire, leave no room for confusion by writing out very precisely what's required, including examples, templates, schedules, and style guidelines, if applicable. Clear communication upfront prevents misunderstandings down the line.Try out Candidates on a Small Scale. First — Before committing to an ongoing role, assign small, contained projects to vet candidates and see their skills, work ethic, and communication in action. Pay for these trials so they're treated as real work.Use Project Management Software — Whether it's Trello, Asana, or your own CRM, digitally tracking tasks helps ensure smooth delegation and collaboration. VAs should check in regularly through these tools rather than loose email threads.Maintain Open Communication — As the boss from afar, be available by phone or video call for any questions from VAs. Praise a job done well so they stay motivated while constructively addressing any issues. Maintaining good communication ensures quality control on their end, too.If you feel your business has outgrown solo DIY efforts and you're ready to bring on supportive help, consider signing up FREE for Hana Retail as your retail POS system today. It could be just what you need to gain back valuable time and focus on high-level growth without the hassle of finding and managing outsourced talent on your own.

45,4 Ways Brands Can Educate Their Customers and Win Hearts,"Mar 4, 2024",Bora Celik,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-brands-can-educate-their-customers-and-win-hearts/469937,"
Standing out is a challenge for direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands. But they have a secret weapon in their arsenal: Education.It's about going beyond just selling products and actually teaching customers about the value and benefits of what they're buying. This strategy changes the shopping experience. It turns transactions into relationships.From engaging quizzes to live Q&A sessions, personalized advice, and stories from the founders themselves, these innovative approaches are changing the game. They make every interaction an opportunity for a deeper bond between the brand and the customer.



Let's explore why embracing these educational tactics is becoming essential for DTC brands looking to make a real impact.1. Use quizzes for engaging online contentAdding quizzes to a DTC brand's website grabs customer attention uniquely and interactively. It turns shopping into a fun learning journey. Quizzes engage customers by asking questions to pinpoint their likes, needs, and hurdles. This teaches customers about the right products for them and gives brands insights into consumer habits.


Brands can then fine-tune their products and messages. Quizzes also make the website more engaging and fun, keeping visitors around longer. This can help improve the site's SEO and might even lift sales.By making recommendations more tailored and relevant, quizzes foster trust. They encourage customers to come back. This approach simplifies finding the right product, benefiting both the customer and the brand.Related: Educating vs. Selling — This Unique Marketing Style Will Help You Grow Your Business2. Meet customers through live Q&A sessionsDirect interaction with customers through live Q&A sessions can significantly enhance customer education and trust.


Mary Ruth's Organics demonstrates this by leveraging the knowledge and accessibility of its founder, MaryRuth Ghiyam. Despite the brand's growth, Ghiyam remains actively engaged with her community, answering Instagram messages personally and hosting monthly fireside chats via Zoom.A quick look at their Instagram shows thousands of people attend these chats. These sessions allow customers to ask questions in real-time, providing a platform for direct communication and personalized advice. This approach not only educates customers but also builds a deeper connection between the brand and its consumers.3. Personalize to enhance educationWhen customers get advice or product picks just for them, they tend to dive deeper into the content, remember what they learned, and act on the suggestions. Personalization makes them feel valued, building a closer bond with the brand. People are bombarded with endless options and information. Personalization is a surefire way to stand out.When exploring products, people often sift through loads of information and research. Brands can make a real impact by tailoring their customer education to meet these personal quests for knowledge.


4. Utilize founder tutorialsBrands have increasingly connected with their customers through tutorials led by their founders. This strategy brings a human touch to the brand, highlighting the passion and knowledge behind it. Founders sharing their expertise and stories draw customers in. It builds trust and credibility. These tutorials aren't just product lessons; they're windows into the brand's heart. They show what it stands for.This kind of direct interaction creates a community feeling. These tutorials are gold mines of information for customers, offering insights and tips for smarter choices. In a time when authenticity and openness are highly valued, founder-led tutorials are a smart move for brands aiming to improve their customer experience.For example, Shani Darden, founder of Shani Darden Skin Care, utilizes her Shani's Skin Tips as a platform for founder tutorials, directly engaging with her audience by sharing expert advice and personalized skincare tips. This approach educates customers on effective skincare practices. It also builds a personal connection between the founder and the audience, enhancing trust in her products.Brands can emulate Darden's playbook by leveraging their expertise through similar educational content, providing valuable information that addresses their customers' needs and interests. This strategy positions the brand as an authority in its field and fosters a community of informed and loyal customers.


Through examples like the ones above, it's clear that these education strategies are transforming brand-customer interactions. Whether offering personalized advice or sharing the heartbeat of the brand via founder content, these methods are gold mines for engagement. They educate and help create a vibrant, informed community around the brand.

47,5 Strategies for Dealing with High Employee Turnover,"Mar 1, 2024",Dave Ragosa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-strategies-to-reduce-employee-turnover/469939,"
Do you sometimes feel like your employees are on a fast-moving conveyor belt out the door, and you're on a sluggish treadmill as you try to hire and train their replacements? You're not imagining things, and you're not alone. Aways an unfortunate fact of business life, employee turnover has only gotten worse – as high as 24% above pre-pandemic levels, according to Gartner, Inc. But you can take steps to minimize it or at least lessen the harm it does.The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), citing a study by the Work Institute, says employee turnover adds up to some $680 billion in training costs and lost productivity. High turnover can also lead to decreased morale among remaining staff, inconsistency in service quality and, ultimately, a negative impact on the bottom line.Even more frustrating, SHRM believes three of four workers who quit could have been retained.



As a restaurant, Ford's Garage is certainly not immune to turnover problems. We employ various strategies to retain employees, including offering competitive wages and benefits, fostering a positive work environment, providing opportunities for advancement and skill development, implementing recognition and reward programs and actively soliciting employee feedback to address concerns and make improvements.Related: How Employee Retention is Impacted by Various Leadership StylesHere's what we've learned about the best ways to manage rising resignation rates and try to reduce them:1. Don't ignore itWhile some turnover is inevitable, excessively high turnover rates indicate underlying issues that must be addressed. Take a look at working conditions, compensation, staffing levels and other factors that may be leading team members to head for the door. You may be unable to fix everything, but ignoring the situation cannot be an option.Related: Here's Why So Many Companies Are Losing Employees Shortly After Onboarding2. Take care of your remaining employeesStaff members left behind will have higher workloads, at least temporarily, and may suffer from stress and low morale. It's crucial to prioritize communication, transparency and support for them. Providing opportunities for recognition, professional development and work-life balance can help mitigate the harmful effects of turnover. And don't forget your managers, especially those at mid-level. If you have a seven-day operation, as most retailers and restaurants do, think about rotating local managers so they can take off one or two weekends a month.


3. Remember, it's not always about the moneyPay and benefits undoubtedly play a significant role in employee resignations, but they're not the sole determinants. While competitive pay and benefits are essential for attracting and retaining talent, good working conditions, such as a positive company culture, opportunities for growth and development, and work-life balance, can compensate for slightly lower compensation in some cases. Bear in mind that while flexible work arrangements can be a valuable retention tool for businesses that can offer them, it's essential to balance flexibility with operational needs and ensure clear communication and accountability to maintain productivity and teamwork.4. Foster a culture of continuous improvementHigh-performing team members leave an even bigger hole than most of their colleagues, so they need special attention to keep them motivated. Are you offering them assignments that excite and challenge them? Does their work align with their career goals? Ask them what keeps them returning and how you can help them achieve their goals. They need to be driven and motivated to see the growth and how they contribute to it so they don't leave.Related: Attract Top Talent: Show Them You Have What They Want5. Stay positiveI'm not saying you should ""look on the bright side"" of losing longtime employees, which can have potentially harmful effects on everyone. However, employee turnover can have some positive outcomes. It's an opportunity for workers to step up and show what they can do, revealing talent you never knew your team had. It can also foster innovation and fresh perspectives. Just be careful how you present this attitude to your team; don't give the impression that you think it's great news.


Making work worthwhileIndividuals seek opportunities that align better with their personal and professional aspirations. However, other factors such as job dissatisfaction, lack of growth opportunities and workplace culture play significant roles, so make sure you address all of the above-mentioned to keep your employees motivated and keep them with your company.

48,The Miley Cyrus Approach To Marketing — Why It's a Radically Different Method For Achieving Brand Impact,"Mar 1, 2024",Sunny Dublick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-miley-cyrus-taught-me-about-marketing/469675,"
Miley Cyrus took home her first Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance this year. Shocked and elated, she took the stage to accept the award from none other than Mariah Carey and shared a very heartfelt speech:""And so there's a story I wanna tell that sums up this moment, and I wasn't gonna tell it, but now Mariah's here. So there was a little boy that all he wanted for his birthday was a butterfly. And so his parents gave him a butterfly net, and he was so excited. He just went outside out in the sun and started swinging and swinging. But with no luck, he sat down on the ground, he finally let go, and he surrendered, and he was okay that he wasn't gonna capture this beautiful butterfly. And right when he did is when the butterfly came and landed right on the tip of his nose. And this song 'Flowers' is my butterfly.""So, what does it have to do with marketing? Everything.



Current marketing theory is centered around amplification: more ads, emails and automation. The idea is that the more times we can reach a customer with our message, the better. Push out social posts, text ads, and Spotify spots, and hit them at every path along the buyer journey until they're worn down enough to buy.I liken this to chasing a customer down the street screaming, ""BUY NOW!"" as they frantically run as far away as possible — only we're doing this through screens, so it feels tolerable. Is it really effective, though? Or are we just casting the widest net possible over and over again, hoping to scoop up more (proverbial) butterflies?


I want to advocate for a different way, one that feels far less cringe-worthy. I want brands to stop chasing down business and start attracting it. What does that look like?Related: 7 Marketing Strategies You Need to SucceedStart with your offering(s)You need to have something that is ultimately an attractive offer to your audience. I ask every client what are the brands they aspire to be like. Apple always comes up. The new iPhone comes out, and there is a line around the block. We all want that kind of brand loyalty, right? The real question is: are we willing to do the work to get there?Apple didn't become a brand giant by creating the same products as the rest of the industry. It pushed category conventions every chance it could get. It constantly innovated and became cool because it was always on the cutting edge of new technology. Buying an Apple product was like a promise that you had the new, shiny toy everyone wanted. Their marketing just lets you know it's available, and frankly, they barely need it.


Apple's customers do most of their marketing for them. Think about what it would be like for your business to have an offer that's so good you know there will be a waiting list. Push yourself out of the thinking that 'this is the way things have to be.' What would it look like if you created something so amazing that you didn't have to force the message to convince people to buy? That is how you become an attractive brand. That's how you get your butterflies.Related: How to Bring Connection, Creativity and Results Together in MarketingKeep it realOne of my biggest takeaways from the Grammy speech was the need for surrender. Accepting the reality of where you are right now. That level of honesty and authenticity is crucial in building a great brand. It's the opposite of giving up; rather, it is realizing you have control over certain things, but a lot is out of our hands as businesses.It's letting go of our vice grip on metrics and being fine with letting life and joy become part of our marketing practice. Marketers have become so trained that everything has to have a way to measure ROI — and while I am not advocating wasting money, I am advocating that we allow wiggle room in our budgets and hearts for authentic brand connection. Not the PR stories, not the influencer partnerships. I mean genuine ways to live out your brand's purpose for your customers and employees.


If you created a business, it wasn't only to make money. I am guessing it was created to help people. Sometimes, we get so far away from where we've been and our purpose that the best thing we can do is surrender. Remind ourselves why we started or why we were so excited to work for a company in the first place. How do we get back to being a great brand?Related: How to Create Authentic Relationships and Build Customer TrustBe a good stewardThink about the brands you admire — do they need to convince you to buy? To chase you down? No. What does the boy with the butterfly do once it lands on his nose? Does he hop right up and start chasing it again? Or does he know he doesn't have to? Will he continue to attract great things because he is a magnet for success? I want to encourage you to be this magnet as well, and how you do that is by being a good steward to your customers.That means protecting their data, their interests, and their privacy. That means treating them with the respect they deserve. So often, we treat customers like numbers on a balance sheet. Just bombarding them with information to get their sale. This is not the way to make a great brand. This is being that pushy car salesman that no one feels comfortable around. When in doubt, all you have to do is put yourself in their shoes. Is this how I would want to hear about a brand like mine? Or does it feel weird? Is there a better way? Let empathy towards your community inspire you to do better and become the magnet of great customers.


One thing I feel passionate about as a marketer is that we have to find a better way. What this industry has become is a never-ending spiral of advertising. In essence, marketing should be about connecting with the people you want to help. We're not connecting by shouting messages at them all day, every day — in short, we're not being great partners with our clients.I hope that I can inspire you to new ways of thinking about marketing in a way that lets you attract all of the businesses you can handle without ever having to chase a thing.

49,Women's History Month: 5 Powerful Women Who Paved the Way for Others,"Mar 1, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-powerful-women-who-paved-the-way-for-others/469422,"
March is Women's History Month, which, according to the official website, is about ""commemorating and encouraging the study, observance, and celebration of the vital role of women in American history."" While this deserves attention year-round, it still calls for a highlighted celebration.A rising number of prolific women continue to pave the way for others, including those in the legal field. By setting a precedent cemented in law, they've changed the trajectory of cases for the future and left the door open for other life-changing actions and opportunities to take place.Whether they were first in their profession or ruled on a case that changed history, here is a brief look at how women have emerged in the legal field, where they still face challenges and a few of the many women who have made their mark.



Evolution of female attorneys in the U.S.Between 1950 and 1970, women made up less than 5% of attorneys in the U.S. This percentage began to slowly increase over the following decades, though it wasn't until 1991 that women attorneys reached the 20% mark. But, in 2022, the number of women attorneys was still at 38%.The conversation regarding gender diversity has been a harrowing road for females to compete against their male counterparts for wage and partner equity and appointment to prestigious groups and positions. According to a 2019 ABA study, the following was reported:


48% of women missed out on a desirable assignment compared to 11% of men54% of women were denied a salary increase or bonus compared to 4% of men75% of women experienced demeaning comments, stories, or jokes compared to 8% of men82% of women had been mistaken for a lower-level employee compared to 0% of menThese discrepancies make the perseverance of women in law even more admirable, as they've overcome setbacks hindering them from the beginning. And, as the world changes and more women are being admitted to the bar and finding their way to the top of their field, it's inspiring for others to follow suit.Related: The Biggest Challenges Women Entrepreneurs Face1. Ruth Bader GinsburgRuth Bader Ginsburg is heralded for her fight for women's rights and gender equality. She is famously noted for saying, ""Women belong in all places where decisions are being made."" After attending Harvard Law School, she eventually transferred to Columbia Law School, graduating top of her class in 1959. Following graduation, she taught at Rutgers School of Law before becoming a legal partner with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in two gender equality cases, including Reed v. Reed in 1971.Reed vs. Reed was a landmark decision that found the law's dissimilar treatment of men and women was unconstitutional, and discrimination would not be allowed. Ginsburg became the founding counsel of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project and was appointed to the United States Supreme Court in 1993.


2. Sonia SotomayorNominated in 2009 to the Supreme Court by President Obama, Yale Law School graduate Sonia Sotomayor became the first Latinx and third woman to be appointed. For years before the appointment, she served as the Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office before entering into private practice.One of Sotomayor's most notable cases is Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc. This case involved a disagreement between Major League Baseball (MLB) teams and players over compensation for the loss of ""free agent"" players. Her ruling on the baseball salary cap in 1995 restored the terms of the previous labor agreement and ended the MLB strike by opening day for the 1994-1995 season.Related: 3 Ways to Prevent Imposter Syndrome From Ruining Your Business3. Ketanji Brown JacksonA 1996 graduate of Harvard Law School, Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed as the first Black woman and first former federal public defender of the Supreme Court. Before the appointment, she served as a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.


Further, during her time as a commissioner for the U.S. Sentencing Commission, she was part of retroactively applying the 2020 Fair Sentencing Act, which allows those with extreme sentences for prior drug convictions to seek reduced sentences.4. Charlotte E. RayIn 1872, Charlotte E. Ray became the first Black female attorney in the U.S. She graduated from Howard University and was the first woman to be admitted to the District of Columbia bar. Though she faced inevitable challenges due to her race and gender, she argued a case in the D.C. Supreme Court in the case of Gadley v. Gadley three years after being admitted to the bar. Through her perseverance, she set a precedent for other female lawyers in other states to be admitted to their respective bars.Related: 5 TED Talks by Powerful Women Leaders That Inspire and Motivate5. Anita HillAttorney and professor Anita Hill likely has the highest notoriety from her 1991 testimony. At the time, she spoke in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual harassment she experienced from then-Supreme Court Nominee Clarence Thomas.


In her testimony, she alleged inappropriate conversations and sexual advances by Thomas during her time as his legal advisor. As a result, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which solidified employee protection against workplace discrimination.

""Stay in your lane."" We hear it all the time now — in our professional lives, in our personal lives, in our relationships. It's a turn of phrase that advises us to stick to what we know, guides us to specialize instead of generalize and encourages us to find a niche market and hold on to it. Sounds like good advice, right?I'm not so sure, actually. When I launched my PR business over a decade ago, I did just that: I concentrated on the market segment I knew best and aimed my services at only them. But over the years, I found myself curiously peeking into different industries, wondering how my business would change and how I would evolve personally if I pushed myself to try to enter new business sectors.Business owners have the luxury of trying to keep things fresh and exciting for themselves, and although I certainly have enough challenges in my personal life, it's amazing how I always seem to be inviting new challenges in my professional life. I think it's because it keeps me energized and on my toes. The world is moving so fast, technology is advancing so rapidly that I feel like my business simply has to transform in kind with the climate in which it operates.



That's why this is my new advice to fellow entrepreneurs: Master your lane, yes … but then have a little fun on the road, changing lanes and passing your competition as you enjoy the ride of traversing multiple highways and byways!Related: No Referrals, No Problem: 3 Ways to Win Clients in Highly Competitive Industries


Reasons to expandEntering new markets isn't for everyone, it's not appropriate for all businesses. A specialty cheese shop in Anytown, USA, may wish to stay exactly where they are, doing exactly what they're doing. Sure, the shop may want to add online sales for long-distance purchases, but it's their brand to service a mostly local clientele with an inventory not found anywhere else within a 150-mile driving range.But a candle manufacturer that started out focused solely on the home decor market can indeed consider branching out once home sales have plateaued. A client of mine expanded into the corporate sector, in fact, with a campaign aimed at company retreats and a new line of scented products for in-office relaxation techniques. Her sales increased 17% by the second quarter of entering the corporate space.So before you think about ways to expand, first consider the reasons you may want to expand, including:You've saturated your initial market and are experiencing limited growth potential. I started off in one downtown office in one foodie-friendly town, which worked great for my foundational knowledge base, the food and beverage industry. But after a few years, once I'd pitched to all the local restaurants and establishments I wanted to represent, I hit a bit of an impasse. From there, it was a logical progression to the hotel market in town.The new people you're bringing on have additional areas of expertise. As my business grew, so too did my staff. And they brought with them skill sets and industry know-how beyond my own. One of my copy editors, for example, had deep experience in book publishing. I used her background to break into the book promotion market, and before long, the one author I was representing turned into two, then three.To keep pace with current market trends. Some businesses can afford to stick to one thing only and do it exceptionally well. Others are more vulnerable to the variable winds outside. During the pandemic, when people were hardly dining out or vacationing (my niche markets at the time), they were purchasing goods for at-home consumption and concentrating on their home bases. This proved an opportune time for me to start widening my camera lens to retail brands and the real estate sector.Related: 4 Honest Truths That Will Make You a Better Boss


How to expand in four starter stepsOnce you have the drive and a valid justification to expand into new sectors, coupled with the bandwidth and the human resources to do so, here are some pointers I followed myself to shift my business from a hospitality and tourism-based firm to one that now encompasses the finance, tech, wellness, and nonprofit spheres as well:Step #1: Start by targeting adjacent industries. If, for example, you service the residential real estate market, put feelers out into commercial real estate. If your clients include malls and shopping centers, your experience will translate well to large event venues, like sports arenas. The objective is to bring some of your institutional knowledge to the table while learning the specific ins and outs of related fields.Step #2: Attend industry-specific events and conferences. You don't have to find clients first; a good approach is just to find a group of people in your targeted industry with whom you can network and from whom you can gain a better, deeper understanding of the field. At one national association meeting I attended, I invited a speaker who'd really impressed me with his presentation to lunch and asked if he'd be willing to mentor me. Several months of exchanged emails followed, in which he shared invaluable information and pointed me toward the most productive next steps.Step #3: Don't expand too fast. Pinpoint just one or two new industries at a time, then make it your goal to establish yourself within this realm before trying to cover even more new ground. Like any new terrain, the more you travel it, the more familiar you will become with the territory.


Step #4: In those new industries, limit your services at first. This is the equivalent of dipping your toe in the water to acclimate to the temperature instead of diving into the deep end headfirst. An example from my own transition journey: I do social media; my team knows social media. So when I took on my first financial enterprise, we didn't have to know the details of titles, liens and escrow right out of the gate; we only had to know how to put together an effective social plan for the client that yielded the expected outcomes. Over the course of a few months, we got to know the proper language and vernacular of this sector; the client was more than fine with initially providing us with appropriate jargon and content ideas for posts if only we could take this now-necessary task off their hands.Another example: When I first broke into tech, I felt a little out of water with my boutique lifestyle background. So I didn't offer this particular client my full marketing and PR package. I only pitched media relations to start, and once we'd proven our prowess in this area, our service agreement added publicity and advertising functions. Basically, then, the success of your contracts with minimal offerings will be a good litmus test for the rest of your transactions with the client.Related: 7 Empowering Strategies for Leaders Transitioning to New RolesServicing new industries in the last few years has been challenging and sometimes frustrating, but it's also been invigorating and surprisingly fulfilling. Each time I land a client in an area new to me, I feel a sense of accomplishment I never imagined when I was just starting out and simply hoping for half a dozen clients or so to keep me afloat.


Moral of the story: There's no need to limit yourself. When you feel it's time to reach, reach. You'll never know what you'll grab on to next unless you extend yourself!

Truth #1 - Business ideas are uselessAlright, let's be real. We've all heard someone claim ownership of the next big thing, demanding recognition and compensation. But here's the kicker — brilliant business ideas, on their own, aren't worth much. The real magic lies in transforming those ideas into actionable plans and executing them.To be a rockstar entrepreneur, you've got to master the art of turning your wild ideas into tangible and viable products. In the ever-evolving business world, it's not just about having a lightbulb moment; it's about making that lightbulb shine bright through strategic and effective execution.

The success or failure of your business? Yep, it's on you.It's not the economy's fault.It's not your competition's fault.


You have to own up to it, learn from the hiccups, and steer your ship toward smoother waters. So, if failure comes knocking, don't play the blame game. Consider it an opportunity for some serious self-reflection and learning.Mistakes are part of the entrepreneurial learning curve, but the good news is that a lot of your mistakes most likely come from a lack of experience, and all you need is the proper guidance to get you back on the right track. With the right guidance, you'll not just navigate but surf through those challenges, steering your business towards sunnier shores.Related: 3 Ways Owning Your Mistakes Will Make You PowerfulTruth #3 - The rich get richer, and the poor get poorerWhy do the rich get richer? Because they know how to make money.And why do the poor get poorer? Because they don't.It's not luck; it's a wealth of knowledge – pun intended. The key is understanding how to make money work for you, and the bottom line is that if you're not making enough money, it's because you don't know how.

Truth #4 - NOBODY beats the market consistentlyIn this digital age, you've probably stumbled upon online personas claiming they can outsmart the market consistently. Newsflash – even the big guns like Goldman Sachs and Citibank face hurdles in consistently beating the market.Be wary of promises that sound too good to be true. If the guy on your Instagram feed really did have a crypto platform that earned 1% a day, he would be a multi-trillionaire taking it easy with an early retirement. He certainly wouldn't be running a get-rich-quick scheme on the internet.Investment decisions are crucial, of course, but your best shot at wealth isn't in stock-picking wizardry; it's in running a killer business.Related: Success Isn't About Making One Big Decision, It's About Making a Million Small Decisions

52,Let's Bring Back the Human Element to Paying Bills — Here's 3 Ways to Nurture Vendor Relationships for Business Success,"Feb 26, 2024",Nick Chandi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-ways-to-nurture-your-vendor-relationships-to-fuel/469324,"
Turning a small business into a success involves many factors, but a big part of it is how well you get along with your suppliers. Since businesses rely on vendors for essential supplies, cultivating strong ties ensures a reliable supply chain, minimizing disruptions. Managing these connections can get tricky as businesses grow, but there are ways to make it smoother and more cost-effective.The human element is important in improving vendor relationships. Unlike large corporations, small businesses are more likely to engage in regular personal interactions with vendors through meetings, calls and visits. These personal connections often go beyond simple transactions and are more geared towards developing a symbiotic partnership with effective communication and mutual collaboration. The human touch adds empathy and reliability, transforming vendor relationships into partnerships built on trust and shared goals.How can the personal touch in Accounts Payable (AP) (the part of business where you make sure you pay your bills) help foster positive vendor relationships for the success of your small business? Consider these three approaches to ensure a strong and beneficial partnership.



Related: 3 Secrets to Streamlining Your Accounts Payable Process1. Personalize your communication strategiesTo build strong relationships with vendors, it's important to personalize communication. Understand each vendor's preferences and priorities, whether they prefer emails, phone calls, or in-person meetings. When you talk with them, take notes or write down what you remember about them after the meeting. Before you talk with them next, re-read your notes and ensure you don't ask the same question twice. A good Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) tool can help you keep track of how your clients want to be spoken to.


Successful personalized communication includes regular updates, timely responses, and expressing appreciation. Seeking feedback and addressing concerns promptly is important. Simple gestures like personalized thank-you notes, recognizing partnership milestones, or expressing appreciation for timely payments contribute to a positive and collaborative atmosphere in the vendor relationship.Related: 80% of Businesses Fail Due To a Lack of Cash. Here are 4 Reasons Why Cash Flow Forecasting Is So Important 2. Be transparent in financial transactionsTransparent financial dealings with vendors hold significant importance for several reasons. If you share financial information openly, it helps everyone trust each other and work together smoothly. Openly sharing financial information prevents misunderstandings and sets the stage for fair negotiations, potentially resulting in better terms for both parties.In terms of invoicing, clarity on payment terms is key. By discussing and agreeing upon invoices with clients before sending them out, you can ensure everyone is on the same page. No one likes costly, hidden surprises. Being clear ahead of time prevents misunderstandings and shows your commitment to fair and transparent business practices.


When creating invoices, use straightforward language and specify payment due dates. This expedites the payment process and establishes clear expectations, contributing to your business's streamlined and efficient financial workflow. By prioritizing transparency, you build stronger relationships with vendors and improve the overall efficiency of your financial transactions.Related: 4 Cash Flow Trends To Know About in 2024 3. Streamline processes for efficiencySmall businesses can make things run smoother by simplifying their payment processes. One way is by using software to handle tasks like paying invoices and keeping records automatically. This helps avoid mistakes and speeds up payments. Delayed payments are a common challenge, affecting 93% of companies. Another helpful strategy is setting up a standardized payment approval workflow for invoices, which are reviewed and approved quickly. This ensures that payments happen on time and keeps financial operations running smoothly.Also, adopting digital payments makes transactions faster and more accurate, making it easier for vendors. The total transaction value in the Digital Payments market is set to hit a whopping US $11.55 trillion in 2024! Connecting modern payment solutions with accounting systems is another smart move. This ensures that data is reconciled automatically, reducing the chance of errors and improving overall financial management. And with this, small businesses can save hours a week. Small businesses can make their financial processes more reliable and effective by making these changes.


The impact of streamlined procedures on vendor satisfaction and business success is substantial. Efficient processes mean vendors receive timely payments, fostering trust and reliability. This, in turn, improves the overall vendor experience, leading to stronger relationships.Related: Slow Payment Options Are Costing Your Business — Here's the Alternatives of the Future The success of small businesses hinges on strong vendor relationships built through personalized communication, transparent financial dealings, and streamlined accounts payable processes. Paying bills is not merely a financial transaction but a testament to the trust and reliability underpinning vendor relationships. Businesses uphold integrity and accountability by prioritizing transparent financial transactions, laying the groundwork for enduring partnerships.While technology helps us work more efficiently, the human touch – the personal connections we make – solidifies these relationships. Small businesses should prioritize open communication, mutually beneficial collaboration, and a personal touch to ensure enduring vendor connections, creating a powerful synergy for sustained growth and prosperity.

53,5 AI Hacks You Need to Know About in 2024,"Feb 26, 2024",Hasan Saleem,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-ai-hacks-to-know-about-in-2024/469584,"
In 2024, AI is shaping the business world at an unprecedented scale, promising to boost productivity and take operations to a new level.However, with the proliferation of new tools, it can be hard for entrepreneurs to grasp exactly how AI can benefit their business, especially since recent reports have pointed out multiple pitfalls of these new technologies.Here are five business workflows you can optimize using AI to enhance your efficiency and avoid implementation drawbacks.



1. Meeting and action items documentationTo begin with, one of the most immediate applications of AI systems is natural language processing (NLP), especially voice-to-text transcription. In recent years, enormous advances have been made in the processing of different accents and in the recognition and translation of different languages.Today, AI is capable of furnishing real-time transcripts of conversations and, more importantly, meetings. This eliminates the need to designate a note-taker and allows everyone to focus fully on the objectives of the meeting.


Going further, AI tools can also generate meeting summaries, distilling the most important points and action items.You should, however, still take a few minutes to check over the transcript and summaries before filing them away and sharing them with your team post-meeting.Related: 5 Tips to Help Business Leaders Make Sense of the AI Landscape2. CopywritingNext up, AI can be a boon for your copywriters. Whether it's copy for the latest edition of your newsletter or the next installation of a blog post series, AI can help writers structure and polish their work.


While you should absolutely avoid purely AI-generated, unedited content - and the factual errors and biases it inadvertently propagates - AI writing tools can aid your writing team in many ways.Writers across all genres have come to appreciate the help of bots when it comes to generating title and structure suggestions, proposing edits, and offering first-draft battering rams to break through writer's block.Nevertheless, it's crucial to create policies for the use of AI by your writers. Ultimately, you must ensure that their output is defined by creativity and human sentiment rather than machine-generated pablum.3. Social media content creationAnother workflow that can benefit from an AI efficiency boost is content creation for social media.


In the creator economy, social media has become a cornerstone of any digital marketing policy. Whether you're showcasing your services on Instagram, engaging customers in witty banter on X, or giving your users in-depth product tutorials on YouTube, content is key.However, producing social media content, posting it, and monitoring its performance takes time, skill, and effort. AI can assist your social media experts at multiple points throughout the process.It can monitor social media platforms to make content suggestions based on recent trends and challenges. It can generate caption suggestions and propose appropriate hashtags to maximize exposure. Going further, you can even leverage it to produce explainer videos using AI avatars or to generate graphical elements like YouTube thumbnails.Most importantly, though, AI can also analyze the performance of your content across platforms, unearthing large-scale patterns more effectively than any human.


Related: 5 Ways to Protect Your Company from AI Pitfalls4. Compliance checks in bookkeepingBookkeeping and accounting are not exactly many entrepreneurs' favorite activities. Especially when it comes to routine tasks such as filing expenses and compliance checks. That's exactly where AI can come in.In the bookkeeping business, AI tools are useful for tasks such as categorizing transactions, catching errors such as duplicates, matching data formats, and tracking pricing fluctuations. It can also reconcile accounts and bank statements. Plus, when it comes to ensuring compliance in the expense reports of employees, it can recognize data from scans of receipts and invoices and then cross-reference it with the matching transactions.Overall, these capabilities can help you speed up numerous bookkeeping processes - as long as there are human experts in the loop and assessing flagged errors and routine output.


5. Productivity assessmentsFinally, AI can help you enhance your efficiency by pinpointing exactly what processes need enhancing.Analyzing your business productivity as a whole, as well as the performance of individual agents, is a challenge – especially if you operate on a larger scale. AI, however, is unparalleled at processing large amounts of data and distilling it into actionable conclusions.You can deploy it, for instance, to go through your CRM and help center data and determine which approaches lead to the highest customer satisfaction and which agents are most successful in delivering that satisfaction. Conversely, it will help you spot which team members are lagging and need additional human support.Related: I Tested AI Tools So You Don't Have To. Here's What Worked — and What Didn't.


Overall, AI has immense potential to increase the productivity of your business. Workflows like meeting documentation, copywriting, content creation, bookkeeping, and productivity assessments can all benefit from AI support.However, as in any business area in which AI is applied, it's crucial to keep human oversight and to make sure that it's people, not machines, who make final decisions and shape the final creative output.

In the tech industry, global diversity is more than a buzzword phrase — it is the engine of innovation and leadership. Launching my startup was a new beginning. It was fueled by my journey as a Black woman entrepreneur. I chose to be a remote operation not just to save money. It was also to craft a work culture that showcases my core values and the complexity of our global community. This decision was less about following trends and more about purposefully nurturing a diverse and connected environment.Diverse teams have an advantage in decision-making, task execution and innovation. This advantage is becoming increasingly logical. Diverse teams outperform groups that are not diverse. Robust data supports this. The benefits of diversity go beyond theory. They boost a team's innovation and finances. In 2023, about 16% of companies had gone fully remote and about 28% had gone hybrid. The importance of remote work and diversity is clearer than ever. These trends show that remote work is possible. They also highlight the key role of diversity in modern business success.Related: How to Build Team Culture in a Remote-Work World



Building a diverse and global teamOur strategy for building a diverse team is rooted in a deep dedication to diversity. It is a guiding principle and a daily practice. We've created a thorough remote onboarding process. It helps new team members join our culture and rhythms. The system has virtual meet-and-greets, in-depth project orientations and ongoing mentorship. It has been pivotal in building a unified team spirit. This spirit is undeterred by the lack of physical closeness.We tackle the challenges of distance. We do this by doing regular virtual team-building exercises. They are designed to build community and improve team dynamics. Twice-a-year in-person meetings at key locations have strengthened our team, as well.


Our global team is from the United Kingdom, France, Bulgaria, the Philippines and India. It brings together a rich mix of perspectives. These enrich our work and foster an environment ripe for innovation. It's a diversity of thought and culture. It doesn't just encourage creative problem-solving — it also bonds us as a team. It shows that distance is no barrier to building a strong, cohesive unit.Harnessing geographical diversityThe diversity of our team is among our most significant assets. We show commitment to being sensitive and inclusive. This is seen in our communication practices and in our scheduling and observance of local traditions. This respect for each team member's heritage enhances our output and experience. It embodies the essence of a globally connected team.We use our geographical diversity to be available to clients around the clock. We offer solutions based on a deep understanding of their unique needs and challenges. Using time zone differences well guarantees our responsiveness. It also brings rich ideas and views to our projects. This sparks innovation and a global approach to problem-solving.Diversity comes in many forms. It ranges from location to culture and language. It helps us handle challenges with many strategies. This boosts our problem-solving abilities a lot. Our ability to view issues from many angles has been key, helping us to secure pivotal clients. It lets us showcase the real benefits and value of our diverse views. This not only reaffirms the importance of cultural diversity, but also highlights it as an important driver of superior business performance.

It has also broadened my leadership in a multicultural setting. Learning from different cultures and business practices has been eye-opening; it's shown me the key role of diversity in success.


This change reflects a wider trend among remote workers. In particular, millennials show more engagement in workplaces that champion inclusivity.

55,Why Saying 'I Don't Know' Makes You a Better Leader,"Feb 21, 2024",Joanna Swash,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-saying-i-dont-know-makes-you-a-better-leader/468335,"
No one knows everything. There's no need to pretend that we do. A great leader is honest about their limitations and strengths. Accept that you will fail. Being honest and open about failure is not a weakness.A great leader is not defined by having all the answers but by a willingness to grow and learn, a curiosity that leads to finding the required answers. It is about stopping, refueling, and being the best version of yourself.Think about it. Do you want a team that comes to you for the answers? That has no mind of its own? No creativity? We all know the answer to that. Command and control is a thing of the past and won't cut the muster in today's ever-evolving business landscape, not if you want to be a business of tomorrow.

56,How to Make PR Campaigns Customer-Focused Instead of Company-Focused,"Feb 21, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-make-your-pr-campaigns-customer-focused/468757,"
When I started out as a marketer of both people and places, I'd learn as much as I could about my clients and then create collateral that presented them in their best possible light — relaying how educated and experienced someone was, broadcasting loud and clear how financially successful a business had been, how they dominated their market share.Nowadays, however, the very floor upon which I built my career and my business has been renovated. Nowadays, the public isn't so interested in hearing about what makes a company better than its competitors; their ears and eyes are more attuned to what the company can do to make their own lives better.In other words, instead of a professional culture of ""me, me, me,"" we're now in a culture of ""you, you, you."" Instead of saying, ""Look at how great our internal operations are,"" corporate voices are telling their buying public, ""We see you. We see your needs. You matter. You matter to us."" This has created some interesting developments in how we conduct business.



Related: Secrets Behind the Most Successful PR CampaignsThe age of the customer-centric marketplaceCustomer-centricity is a perspective that focuses on creating a positive experience for the consumer throughout all stages of your interaction with them. It's a mindset, but it's also a business strategy that informs an organization's decision-making by cultivating a deep understanding of customer needs and then designing deliverables to meet those needs.


Though the model is not particularly new, the ways it's being implemented in the marketplace are quite modern and pervasive, infiltrating all that businesses are advised to do. In ads, don't blow your own horn, offer solutions to your market's problems. In website copy, don't tout your own merits, engage with the customer where they are. In sales decks, make it about the audience, not the presenters.Putting the customer at the center of any type of business transaction has become SOP, both for brand reputation purposes and, of course, for earnings potential, with a white paper by Deloitte positing that ""client-centric companies are 60% more profitable compared to companies not focused on the customer.""Related: 4 Reasons Your PR Campaign Isn't Driving Sales — and How to Fix ThemExamples of customer-centric PRHere are a few ways my own business has embraced and leveraged this new normal.


Example #1: A restaurant. Traditionally, dining establishments pretty much always promoted themselves by sharing their menu, featuring photos of their ambiance, and sending invitations for special events. Since all that can easily be found online now, this client has pivoted to offering more immersive culinary experience to would-be diners — bringing the dining to them instead of vice versa. For instance, we're aggressively promoting the award-winning chef of the restaurant on TV and podcast segments, where he openly shares ""secret family recipes"" with viewers. A swanky new food truck can cater events on customers' premises, and private parties are also offered at the customers' chosen location.We also talked them into a punch card: 5 visits get you a free appetizer or dessert the next time you're in. Rewards programs are in — people like to be acknowledged for their repeat patronage and appreciated for their loyalty.Example #2: A cosmetics company. Instead of this year's marketing budget allocated primarily to photo shoots that spotlight the product line in magazines and digital ads, this customer has adopted the idea of turning the spotlight on the customer — one face at a time. Its newest PR campaign starts with an emailed invitation to take an online survey to win a free makeover. The survey is quite individualized, covering skin type, skin tone, daily facial routines, preferred color palette and so on. Based on replies, appointments are set at a local salon the company is partnering with, where the customer receives a complimentary consultation.No unrelatable supermodels promising unattainable results, no expensive glossy brochures, no hard sell of the merchandise. The crux here is truly personalizing the customer experience, which is key with today's savvy and time-pressed consumer.


Example #3: A pet store. Every pet owner needs to buy food and supplies, right regularly? So they either frequent your store or they don't — usually based on convenience of location and pricing. But what if you offered them more than just products to buy? What if you offered them ""A Vet for a Day,"" an event we scheduled on a Saturday from 9 am to 6 pm? The store paid the vet, but the visitors didn't; each got up to 10 minutes with the veterinarian to ask questions, have their pet looked over and seek advice on concerns about their animal.The goodwill this event generated cannot be overstated. Yes, sales increased and brand-new repeat clients were won, but the important thing to note is the absence of a direct sales pitch here. Rather, the essence of this campaign was identifying a customer pain point and offering a means to ease it.Related: How to Meet Customers At Their Pain PointsGuidelines for a customer-focused campaignWhat do all of these projects have in common?


They all started with in-depth market research that zeroed in on learning about each business's customer base. You can't just assume you know what your customers value; you have to conduct surveys, garner direct input, investigate and really listen to what your market is saying on social platforms, and then monitor the outcomes of initiatives.They put people in front of profits. An impactful customer-centric campaign shows that you genuinely care about your customers instead of showcasing your own superiority or excellence. You're allowed to be the best and encouraged to excel, but in today's climate, forming meaningful and lasting bonds is valued more highly than purely transactional relationships.The goal was to improve the customer experience at every point of contact. The more you can make each interaction customer-centric — whether that's a visit to your website, offering a free download or coming into your place of business and encountering something unexpected and delightful — the more you will stand out in the client's memory and thus sway their consumer habits.Closing thoughtsThere's always going to be a time and place for me to herald my clients' considerable qualifications, accomplishments and impacts. People will always want to be assured that they're in good hands and can place trust in reputable establishments.Nevertheless, there's no denying that today's standard of practice is about making an impression on your customers instead of trying to impress them. Give it a shot. Design a customer-focused campaign (or hire a pro to do it for you) and see where it takes you. Chances are, you'll travel farther than you ever have before!

57,Most Business Partnerships Fail — 5 Hacks to Make Sure Yours Stays Intact,"Feb 19, 2024",Greg Smith,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-hacks-to-make-sure-your-business-partnerships-stay-intact/469144,"
I've been thinking about the alchemy of impactful partnerships a lot lately: We've been lucky to have some amazing partnership wins over the last decade — and plenty of failures, too. Over time, my team and I have gotten better at screening for partnerships that will be a big win for all involved. But as exciting and full of promise as they can be, jumping into any kind of business arrangement is not something to take lightly.Whether it was in forging a long-standing relationship with a big tech brand or carving out a relatively new opportunity with a renowned creator and journalist, I've always believed partnerships should be designed to deliver tangible value for all parties, and their success needs to be predicated on a robust process to ensure the best outcomes.While data shows partnerships are a good idea for creators and entrepreneurs looking to expand their reach, boost revenues and build brand equity, they're only beneficial if they're defined and approached effectively. And the reality is, many of them fail due to mismatched expectations.



For creators and entrepreneurs, the question of when, how and who to partner with will inevitably come up at some point in their journey. Here's what to consider if you're looking to set up a business partnership that beats the odds.Be proactive about exploring your optionsThere are many different types of partnerships you can enter into, but before you do, take the time to consider which would best suit your business — whether it's a traditional brand sponsorship, a reciprocal swap or a more collaborative endeavor.


And if you haven't been approached by a brand, there's no need to wait for them to come to you. Being proactive about identifying and pursuing opportunities can also yield incredible results. Sometimes it boils down to the right conditions happening at the right time.Take Coastal Drone Academy, a creator business that saw the chance to expand its reach when drone operators faced new regulations and certification requirements. They partnered with Best Buy to package their intro course with every drone sold. The creator business benefited from the retailer's extensive customer base and its significant brand association. Meanwhile, Best Buy was able to provide a true value-add to its drone sales.Go in with eyes, mind and heart wide openKnowing exactly what you're getting into is important to your partnership's success. But so is keeping an open mind — and heart. I realize that might sound a bit corny, but partnerships, like any relationship, are built on trust above all else. Here are some helpful ways to approach partnership-building with that in mind:First, aim to understand what your potential partner really needs Most entrepreneurs go into partnership pitches by putting their own desires first. I believe this is backward. For partnerships to work, they need to benefit both parties, and the best way to ensure that is to truly understand what your partner needs. Do your research and avoid making assumptions about others' intentions. You can build trust with a potential partner — and a more creative and powerful partnership idea — by going in with an open mind and by considering all the possibilities. You might even uncover an idea you didn't know was possible.Give more than you get Not every partnership has to be 50/50 — or even weighted in your favor. Of course, at some point, you'll want to ensure your needs are met, but that doesn't necessarily have to happen right away. It can be a good idea to give more than you get in a partnership — at least initially — even if you're only getting 20% of the value. Approaching it with generosity can open the door to trust, which can ultimately pay off in the long run.Get to know all the stakeholdersWhile you might be dealing with a marketing or sales team, be sure to find out about all the players involved as the partnership unfolds. This could include tech support people and developers, and especially senior management or department heads who may have final sign-off. Involving all of them in the early negotiations can help everyone get on the same page about the process and expectations. It also gives you other people to reach out to if something goes wrong or you don't hear back from your primary contact.Understand what you can control (and what you can't)Sharing your business with another party opens you up to the unexpected — and to situations you can't always control. Be realistic about your abilities and expectations, and don't be surprised if the process takes longer than planned or even if they walk away. Simply put: Don't bet your whole business on a single partnership. Plan for the best, but know that it might not work out that way.Bake in measurement and evaluationSo many creators get into partnerships that don't ever deliver. Quantifying your expectations upfront gives you the ability to measure success and to check in regularly on progress. If the needle isn't moving at all, then you can decide how best to act. Better yet, put a clause in your contract that makes partnership reviews automatic and renewals contingent upon hitting certain milestones.Bonus consideration:


Is the risk asymmetrical?Take a hint from Jeff Bezos on how you evaluate risk. Is it asymmetrical — meaning is either the potential return or potential downside risk significantly greater than the other? For example, an amazing potential return with limited losses, if it fails, should be an easier partnership to commit to than one where the downside could be far worse than any potential gain. Sometimes you can mitigate risks in the partnership agreement too, but it starts with understanding both the best and worst-case scenarios. Avoid the natural bias to look only at the upside and ignore the downside.Regardless of how you structure and approach your partnership, the benefits will go beyond the metrics you set for exposure and sales. A collab can become a forcing factor around time and motivation, kicking you into high gear with deadlines and deliverables that might feel less urgent when you're working solo.But keep in mind, while it might be tempting to jump into the first partnership offer that comes your way, I'd caution against it — even if it matches your core business values or content. My biggest advice is to do a gut check before you sign on the dotted line. Or ideally much earlier in the process. Does the partnership feel right to you? Are you inclined to give as much (or more) as you'll receive? Do the benefits outweigh the risks? Depending on the answers to these questions, remember there's no obligation to proceed. Just like choosing a life partner, finding the right business partner can take time. Being rigorous right upfront can be a great way to get your feet wet before jumping into the deep end.

58,Why Blockchain Technology Hasn't Dominated the Supply Chain... Yet,"Feb 19, 2024",Asim Rais Siddiqui,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-blockchain-hasnt-dominated-the-supply-chain-yet/469395,"
Blockchain technology has garnered constant debate ever since its inception, and the interest does not look like it will die out anytime soon. A piece of technology that holds the power to revolutionize existing systems, with experts back in 2017 predicting that the transformative powers of blockchain will be the perfect fit for supply chain management.However, as we look at the supply chain landscape over the past couple of years, the results are very different from what was anticipated, and the question lingers — why hasn't blockchain taken over the supply chain yet?Let's go over why this is the case.Related: Disrupting Supply Chain With BlockchainThe promise of blockchain in supply chainImagine a supply chain where every step is recorded in a ledger that can't be altered and is accessible to all authorized parties. With this kind of transparency, businesses can expect to see a great reduction in fraud, improved efficiency, and streamlined operations.



With 2.8% of the world's population already on blockchain, the technology holds great potential for revolutionizing supply chains. Blockchain is a favorite among experts due to some of its core attributes. These include:DecentralizationA major reason for blockchain's popularity is its decentralized nature, a breath of fresh air from traditional hierarchical structures. Since the launch of Bitcoin, the world has been moving towards decentralization, and it could mean big things for the supply chain realm.Let's think about a network where all participants, from suppliers to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, share equal authority, and no single entity holds disproportionate power. This balance of power may help cultivate trust among stakeholders, as each party can keep track of all transactions.Related: Decentralization Can Be Your Friend


TransparencyThe transparency that comes with blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize supply-chain networks. It ensures that every authorized party has access to the same real-time data, eradicating any data asymmetry.This may especially be crucial in industries where accountability is important, like the pharmaceutical industry, where drugs can be life-saving or life-threatening. Knowing the authenticity of medication and keeping track of its expiration can help hold the right people accountable in case something goes wrong. Not to mention that it also increases customer confidence in the product.UnchangeabilityAccording to the KPMG Global Fraud Survey, more than half of the frauds committed were aided by the business' own technology, with 24% of the frauds having used these technologies to create false or misleading information in accounting records.One of the biggest advantages blockchain brings to supply chains is the inability to alter or erase any data that has been recorded on the network. This means that records of transactions, shipments and certifications are permanently etched into the digital ledger, which brings a new level of integrity to the supply chain.


SecurityWith supply chain cyberattacks in the United States affecting 1743 entities in 2022 alone, security breaches and data leaks have been rampant in supply chains for years and are only on the rise. The security mechanisms of blockchain offer a potential solution to this extremely troubling problem.Within a blockchain, transactions are secured using cryptography, and once validated, they are linked to the previous transaction, creating an unbroken chain. This makes altering old records an extremely difficult task. Apart from that, the business data will be spread across the network instead of being stored in a single location, making any centralized data breaches futile.Related: How to Mitigate Cybersecurity Risks Associated With Supply Chain Partners and VendorsChallenges faced by blockchain in supply chainWhile blockchain technology in the supply chain shows incredible promise, the path to seamless integration is treacherous and fraught with Herculean challenges. Let's look at some of the challenges you might encounter:


1. Unfamiliarity with the chain. Understanding and successfully implementing blockchain is not everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're a supply chain professional accustomed to traditional systems. Blockchain consists of several technical intricacies, like consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and cryptographic hashing, which require time and patience to learn. The learning curve can also be steep and often requires specialized training and expertise.2. Scalability issues. The lack of scalability is one of the biggest hurdles facing blockchains today. This is mainly due to the blockchain's consensus mechanism, which requires all participants in the network to agree on which transactions are valid. So the bigger the supply chain, the more difficult it will be to scale it with blockchain because, as transactions increase, the network's performance can degrade, leading to delays and congestion.3. Regulations and legal hurdles. The regulations and legalities that come with integrating blockchain can be daunting to many. There are many intricacies when it comes to data privacy and cross-border transactions in particular. The lack of knowledge available regarding these makes many business owners hesitate for fear that something might go wrong and they might encounter a legal pitfall instead.4. Costs and resources. I believe the most obvious reason why blockchain isn't as common in supply chains as people believed it would be is the heavy investment required to integrate it. Implementing and maintaining blockchain requires building the infrastructure for the chain, hiring blockchain experts, and incurring operational costs as well. This alone is enough to deter any small businesses considering investing in integrating blockchain into their supply chains.


Related: Mass Adoption of Blockchain Technology by Entrepreneurs? Major Challenges Are Involved.The future of blockchain in supply chainAlthough these challenges are unnerving enough to scare away many keen entrepreneurs, some solutions are emerging to address them. These hybrid solutions involve integration with IoT devices, AI algorithms, and cloud platforms to reduce scalability and complexity concerns, making blockchain integration less complex and more desirable.

59,"If You Don't Learn How to Pivot Your Business, You'll Watch It Perish — Here's What a Successful Pivot Looks Like.","Feb 19, 2024",Hilt Tatum IV,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/if-you-dont-learn-how-to-pivot-your-business-youll-watch/469027,"
Netflix, Instagram, Slack. These three companies have one thing in common: Their initial business plan wasn't sustainable, and they became the formidable companies they are today because they chose to pivot in a new direction.Pivoting in startup culture is a strategic business decision to shift course to capitalize on a new need in the market that your product or service can meet with calculated changes. Doing so successfully requires high organizational adaptability and flexibility to achieve long-term success.In a business world that is constantly fluctuating, pulling the plug when things don't go as planned is an easy out. However, successful entrepreneurs and investors who truly understand their markets can see innovative ways to meet new opportunities by tweaking current business models.



Is it time to pivot in your business? Let's see when it makes sense, how to do it well and what it looks like in both success and failure.Related: Knowing When — and How — to Pivot Is Key to Your Business' Survival. Here's What You Need to Do.


Time to make a changeI have lost track of how many businesses I've seen with everything set up for success, only to have the market pull the rug out from under them. Even the most business-savvy and meticulously prepared ventures can be surprised by economic changes.From market shifts to new technological advancements to drastic economic hits, numerous external factors can force companies to consider pivoting their business model. Internal factors such as plummeting performance metrics or shifts in consumer behaviors may indicate it's time to change.The truth is that few successful businesses got to where they are today following the same strategic plan they started with. While always maintaining your core values — what makes your company unique — keeping your organization agile is essential. You should always prepare to make a necessary shift that will keep your company relevant and financially stable.Decision timeRecognizing the need to pivot and deciding to execute are two different things. There are many factors to consider, and several stakeholders will likely need to sign off. That's why conducting extensive market research, data analysis and forecasting is essential before deciding next steps.


Some businesses might be experiencing a rough patch that will even out with a few tweaks and perseverance. For others, a drastic overhaul of their business model may be necessary for survival. There's no instant solution or easy answer. A decision of this magnitude requires due diligence and belief in your team and product.A great example of pivoting based on informed decision-making is Netflix.Initially, it was a mail-order service for DVDs in the early 2000s. Even though it had a corner in the at-home entertainment market, it felt the strain of growing competition. While executives had their eyes on the current industry trends, they also saw an entirely new, untapped market to conquer.In 2007, it launched its streaming platform, where many of the same movies and shows they sent in the mail were now ready to enjoy on demand. They pioneered the streaming revolution and continued to adapt as they began developing new and original content.


Yes, many others eventually followed suit, but the point is that Netflix executives understood the market and their company so intimately they knew when it was time to pivot and executed it in a way that disrupted their industry and kept their company's profits rising.Related: What Tennis, Microsoft and Starting My Own Company Taught Me About the Mind's Role in Achieving SuccessSuccessful implementationThe next phase of the pivot is setting everything in motion. Implementation can be one of the most challenging aspects because your business will likely face scrutiny and backlash from all angles, including the inside.This is the phase where clear, effective communication becomes critical. You will feel resistance from your employees who are uncomfortable with change. Stakeholders who weren't involved in the decision will feel slighted. Industry pundits may think this change is outlandish. Your company's messaging and resolve must be unwavering regardless of who says what.


If you've done the proper research, considered all the options and scenarios and have buy-in from the appropriate parties, no other forces should change your stance unless there's a legitimate threat to your business's future.Communicating this shift from the point of empathy and care while respectfully sharing the need for a pivot and how it will work is essential to keeping the process steady. Pivoting your business is never easy, but planning and implementing the process effectively can be successful.There are no guaranteesNotice how I said it ""can"" be successful. Like your initial business plan, it could still fall flat even if laid out and executed perfectly.The unfortunate part of business is that there's always risk involved. Nothing is ever promised. Yes, pivoting could save your business from failing — or it could lead you down a path that seems promising but is yet another dead end. If that's the case, learn from it. It could mean the end of the line or another detour on the road to your company's true potential. Regardless, don't let a single failure go by without gaining insights for improvement or wisdom for what does and doesn't work.


Failure feels miserable, yes, but it's an incredible teacher. Even if your pivot is successful, that doesn't mean you won't have to stay on your toes, ready to adapt as the market changes again. No business is ever safe. Industries shift. Competition grows fierce.Never stop innovating. Don't get comfortable. Keep your eyes on the path forward, watching for whatever obstacle is next.Change isn't a bad thing. Pivoting isn't a sign of weakness or failure. The leaders who are open to change of direction tend to be most successful. They're the ones who are vigilant and ready to pounce on the next opportunity before anyone else knows it's there.Stay flexible, be ready to adapt and when the time is right, pivot well.

60,6 Instagram Story Strategies That Will Grow Your Following,"Feb 16, 2024",Dmitrii Khasanov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/6-instagram-strategies-that-can-grow-your-reach/469036,"
Instagram has become indispensable to any business's digital marketing strategy, boasting over 1.3 billion active users, 3.76 billion daily visits and 500 million daily story users. This platform provides a substantial opportunity for businesses to engage with their target audience and enhance their return on investment (ROI). Despite its popularity, the competitive environment on Instagram can make it challenging for brands to stand out and make a significant impact.As more retail brands seek attention on the platform, standing out and making a meaningful impact can be challenging. Social media managers and marketers can employ several strategies to scale reach and, consequently, enhance ROI on Instagram. How? Let's figure it out together.The initial crucial step is to establish clear goals for your business to maximize the return on investment of Instagram stories. Define what you aim to achieve with Stories — driving more traffic to your website, increasing brand engagement, or generating buzz around the brand. Understanding your objectives, target audience, and engagement strategy is paramount. Create specific and measurable goals for each campaign, breaking them down into manageable steps to track success.



For instance, if your goal is to gain more followers, set a realistic target, such as reaching 10,000 in the next six months, by targeting individuals interested in your business, brand, category, or industry. It's extremely important to set achievable goals, allowing you to celebrate milestones as you reach them.So, what is the magic behind maximizing your ROI? Unfortunately, there are no special secrets or hidden formulas; all a business can do is focus on producing quality content and continually test new approaches. However, these strategies might accelerate the performance of your stories.


Related: 3 Ways to Use Instagram Stories to Boost Your Brand1. Provide more informationInstagram provides a unique way to boost your brand and turn visitors into buyers effortlessly by using the ""swipe up"" feature. Simply add an attractive image and a call to action and invite your audience to visit a link. When people swipe up on your Instagram Story, they'll be directed to the page you want them to explore. It's a simple yet effective way to engage and potentially convert your audience.2. Show that you are liveLive stories have a unique appeal as they draw your audience in by sending automatic notifications to your followers. When you decide to go live, generating buzz and excitement around something happening at the moment is essential. In this case, your business may create a sense of urgency and encourage active participation from your audience.Related: How Instagram Stories and Instagram Live Help You Interact with Your Customers


3. Storytelling still rocksCreating visual stories on Instagram is powerful for building brand awareness. Visuals are more engaging than text, effectively reaching a broader audience. With its focus on visuals, storytelling on Instagram helps build an emotional connection with viewers and sparks their curiosity to learn more about your brand. Through this approach, you can convey your brand's story and values compellingly, strengthening your connection with the audience.4. Collaborate with influencersInfluencer marketing campaigns have the potential to boost brand awareness and drive sales growth significantly. While reaching out to influencers directly on Instagram is an option, I would recommend using an influencer marketplace for more efficient and timely discovery of the best influencers for your campaign. Remember that you do not need to collaborate with celebrities and Instagram superstars; instead, consider micro and nano influencers as they make waves in 2024.Related: How Many Followers Do You Need To Make Money on Instagram?5. Do not be afraid of paid advertisingInstagram's advertising platform is a potent tool for expanding your brand's reach and engagement on the platform. With the average user spending 30 minutes daily on Instagram and 63% of American users checking the platform at least once a day, it offers a strategic means to maximize your ROI and attract attention to your paid content. Consistent posting plays a crucial role in increasing visibility. The more frequently you post, the higher the likelihood of appearing in the Explore feed, being featured on other accounts, or ranking highly in searches for keywords and hashtags you commonly use. Establishing a regular posting cadence is essential to maintaining audience interest. Posting consistently every week has the potential to double your followers compared to those who post less frequently than once a week.


6. Ask your followers and get engagementRemember that marketing is about understanding your audience's likes and dislikes, and Instagram Stories can help you learn more about them. Creating polls and asking questions in your stories prompts users to interact by clicking on them. These interactions provide valuable insights that can improve your business and marketing strategies. You can also use these features to effectively advertise new products, making it a versatile tool for engaging with your audience and conducting market research.

61,The No. 1 Priority for Small Businesses This Year Is to Increase Revenue — Here Are 4 Ways to Do Just That.,"Feb 16, 2024",Rich Rao,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-for-small-businesses-to-increase-revenue-in-2024/468815,"
As 2024 begins, goals and resolutions are top of mind. According to a recent report by Intuit QuickBooks, the top priority among business owners is to increase revenue, above getting financing or launching new products or services.Increasing revenue is no easy feat, but entrepreneurs can employ a variety of strategies to help achieve growth in 2024. Even if some macroeconomic pressures like inflation and interest rates may ease this year, they are likely a continued concern for businesses. By looking for new ways to modernize and improve business processes, entrepreneurs can be better positioned to power momentum in 2024 and beyond, even in ever-changing economic conditions.Related: 4 Secrets to Turbocharging Revenue Growth Every Executive Must Know



Hire skilled workersHaving good employees is key to business growth, and in 2024 business owners say it's a top priority, even ahead of cash flow. Entrepreneurs believe hiring skilled employees will help them meet increased customer demand, and most employers (89%) want to hire more employees or contractors this year. But hiring can also be costly and according to one study, the average cost per hire was almost $4,700 when you take into account onboarding, training and the ramp up to productivity.Expanding the workforce is especially top of mind for younger entrepreneurs, with more than three-quarters (76%) of Gen Z small business owners and 80% of millennial small business owners saying they want to hire employees this year. Compare this to just 34% of baby boomer-owned small businesses. In terms of how to hire qualified workers, I recommend business owners be very specific when developing job descriptions, zeroing in on the problems and challenges you're trying to solve with the role. And by offering employee benefits like health care and paid vacation, small businesses will be better positioned to compete with larger enterprises in attracting top talent.


Optimize inventory management to enhance omnichannel salesAs business owners embrace omnichannel sales, selling across multiple online and in-person channels can maximize revenue but can also add new complexities to running your business. Have you ever ordered a product from a business, big or small, only to find out it's actually sold out? Optimizing inventory management so you can deliver the best customer experience is key for success and continued consumer loyalty.Take for example Matt Paggi of Barred Woods Maple, a QuickBooks customer who shared with our team just how crucial a positive first-time shopping experience is — especially during the busy holiday season. The holidays are typically when they do almost a third of their annual business, and each year they see returning customers who've made gifting their maple products a tradition. To help ensure they can manage increased inventory needs they've expanded their presence across various channels to capture both new and returning customers, ramped up production ahead of time and brought on seasonal employees.For business owners like Matt, my number one piece of advice is to use the power of data analytics to optimize inventory management and sales strategies. This includes looking at your sales history to identify the most popular products and impactful channels to drive strategic decision-making and maintain a real-time understanding of stock levels to avoid over and understocking. Additionally, data trends around the cost of raw materials can also help business owners know when they need to buy in bulk or scale back on production.The data shows improving and expanding omnichannel sales is particularly important for Gen Z entrepreneurs, with 88% of Gen Z small business owners looking to expand ecommerce or physical locations to boost revenue in 2024 compared to 66% of Gen X and baby boomers.


Related: These 4 Quick Wins Can Boost Your Customer Count and RevenueDynamic management of cash flow and credit card debtTo make money, you have to have money on hand. Access to cash and maintaining healthy cash flow is essential to small business survival. Whether it's earmarking enough cash to cover overhead costs if payments are late to paying for unexpected expenses and emergencies, business owners have to be ready for the inevitable curveball that will come their way.There are a few simple ways business owners can build a cash flow cushion. First, know your fixed and variable costs and monitor cash flow projections regularly to spot potential problems before they arise. Digital tools can be incredibly valuable in providing you with real-time insights that can help you plan ahead and react quickly. I also recommend treating cash flow savings as a fixed expense and setting firm guidelines for when you'll tap cash reserves.Entrepreneurs also should be mindful of how they use and manage credit cards. Recent data has pointed to the increased reliance small businesses have on credit cards to manage cash flow — 83% of business owners have relied on a credit card to manage their business finances, and 59% of business owners who use credit cards said it was ""an emergency or temporary source of funding.""


What's more, almost 24% of small businesses don't believe they will be able to pay off their credit card balances in 2024 without paying interest. It's important to have a strategy when using credit cards to manage cash flow — and to ensure you stay on top of managing your interest rates on the cards you use — otherwise, this could be a costly expense in the future.Related: 6 Strategies for Optimizing Cash Management When Starting a BusinessSet your financial goalsWhether it is setting an intention for the day or creating a workback timeline to hit a big business milestone, goals are an important part of a business owner's journey.As we kick off 2024, business owners should evaluate what financial goals will make them feel successful. These financial goals can help provide a clear sense of direction, serve as a benchmark for progress and success or unearth areas that need improvement. They can also serve as a road map of your longer-term mission or vision for the business and can ultimately help fuel overall growth.


Success can be measured differently by different people, but regardless of how you view success, setting a goal and understanding revenue targets for your business can help in planning for and achieving a fruitful year ahead.

62,3 Business Basics to Remember in 2024,"Feb 15, 2024",Paul Burke,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-business-basics-to-remember-in-2024/469360,"
The digital world is obsessed with trends. Trending videos, sounds, images, backgrounds — you name it. Trends change overnight and without notice; act quickly or you'll be left in the dust by the algorithm.As much as capitalizing on a successful trend can lift your business, many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) would benefit from shifting their attention from Hail Marys to the basics of business building. These are principles that no matter the social media platform, algorithm or brand, don't go out of style. They were here yesterday, and they'll be even more valuable tomorrow.Let's dive into a few of the basics that will benefit every SMB in 2024.Related: The 5 Fundamentals for Growing Your Startup1. ResponsivenessWe all have that friend who leaves us on ""read"" for days at a time. We may act like it doesn't hurt our feelings or impact our relationship, but it does.



It's no different in business. Responsiveness to your customers shows respect and prioritization to them. By responding quickly to their needs, you let them know that they will be taken care of and that their problem is your problem. This will naturally benefit retention.""One of our company core values is ""radically serve others"" and all of our customer-facing teams truly take this to heart. This is more than evident when we review our weekly metrics and see our average customer response time low and customer satisfaction rating high every week,"" shares Jerry Tsai, President of Acceptd.Make this a company value by putting metrics around response time. This can include how quickly your team responds to emails, customer service requests or phone calls.2. Be a personHard to believe this qualifies as advice in 2024, but with everything digital, automated and AI-powered, you'll find customers are, more often than not, sick of talking to a robot — or even worse, a customer service rep with the personality of one.


Last year while working in operations for a startup, I handled customer service requests for about a month. My responses were quick and not overly formal, clearly written by a human being. You'd have thought I was curing the world from all its pains based on the feedback I received from people.I also found it interesting that people were far more respectful and reasonable, given that it didn't feel like they were talking to a customer service representative as much as they were a person who was here to help them.Teach your team that, as much as professionalism matters, so does coming across as a real person who wants to help people. Measure the success of your customer service interactions with a survey to understand how one method of engagement might be better than another.Of course, this recommendation does come with caveats. Being personable doesn't cover unprofessional, inappropriate or unhelpful support.Related: 5 Ways to Show Your Customers You Understand Them in a Digital-First World3. Follow upWe're always looking for the next best thing. And with that comes forgetting about leads or prospects that fell through the cracks. If you're not systematically following up with prospects, you're losing business.""People are doing more research than ever and earlier than ever, meaning they might not be ready to move forward when they initially reach out. We found that ⅓ of our leads weren't converting for 2+ months after their first inquiry. That shows the power of following up even months after their first contact,"" says Oakwood Management CEO Keith Jones.If your business is digital-first, extend your automated email sequence another month or two. If your business is lead-generation, this means setting up reminders to call and email prospects until you know they're not in the market for your service anymore.


""Prospects often have many different priorities, and knowing that you care enough to check in with them regularly goes a long way in establishing trust,"" adds Sriharsha Guduguntla, Hyperbound CEO.Trust is developed over time — one reason why following up weeks or months down the road can be such a high-value investment. It shows prospects you are diligent and process-oriented. Bonus points if you can personalize your outreach as much as possible so they know you care and remember their specific circumstance.Related: 4 Insane Truths About Failing to Follow-upThese tips won't take your business to the moon or help you go viral. They aren't talked about on social media by influencers or business gurus. They have been lost in a sea of distractions and trends that pop up one day and disappear the next. That's the biggest benefit of following these tips. They are so rare that you instantly distinguish yourself from your competitors by getting the basics right.


Do the basics at a high level for long enough, and you'll see the results compound through higher retention, better conversion rates, more word of mouth and a stronger business foundation.From there, you'll find you may not even need to chase the latest trends to be successful. Simply focusing on serving your customers is unique enough to achieve success.

Chick-fil-A, a renowned fast-food establishment with an 80-year legacy, is celebrated for its fan-favorite cuisine, top-notch service, and memorable 'my pleasure' experiences. However, its franchise opportunity comes with a unique twist. In this article, we'll dive into what makes Chick-fil-A an exceptional fast food concept while only being an average franchise opportunity.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Unwavering focusChick-fil-A's secret sauce lies in its unwavering focus. Just like aiming a rifle precisely at a target, Chick-fil-A hones in on a few key aspects it knows it can excel at, and it does so brilliantly. This approach is similar to being a ""rifle"" rather than a ""shotgun"" in business. It's all about hitting one bullseye rather than several random targets.Before we get into what makes Chick-fil-A an exceptional concept, let's rewind a bit and explore the history of this iconic brand.



The birth of Chick-fil-AIn 1946, the founder, Truett Cathy, began his journey with a restaurant he named the Dwarf House — it wasn't even named Chick-fil-A yet. Cathy was on a quest to perfect the chicken sandwich, a pursuit that spanned a whopping 18 years. Finally, in 1964, he achieved chicken sandwich perfection with a simple combination of bread, chicken, butter, and pickles.He trademarked the name Chick-fil-A, with the ""A"" signifying grade A quality. Chick-fil-A was born, and the same mouth-watering chicken sandwich we enjoy today is a testament to Cathy's unwavering commitment to excellence.Related: 5 Things You Need to Know Before Investing in a Chick-fil-A Franchise


The Chick-fil-A experienceWhen you think of Chick-fil-A, what comes to mind? Great food served quickly, impeccable service, and, of course, that ever-present smile. ""My pleasure"" seems to be the anthem of Chick-fil-A employees, making every visit a delightful experience. Chick-fil-A has set the standard for what a fast-food restaurant should be.Just as Southwest Airlines is known for online flights and Ritz-Carlton for five-star service, Chick-fil-A stands out as a brand that instantly conveys its mission. It's a brand that speaks for itself, one where you understand precisely what they do.Non-stop growthChick-fil-A isn't just a successful fast-food chain; it's an industry titan. It currently reigns supreme as the highest-grossing fast food chain globally. But here's the intriguing part: others have followed its model and are thriving too. Names like Raising Cane's and In-N-Out Burger have embraced Chick-fil-A's philosophy of doing less but doing it exceptionally well.Chick-fil-A's remarkable achievement includes an unprecedented 60 years of non-stop business growth since the first store opened in 1967. The impact of this extraordinary journey is evident in the fact that Chick-fil-A averages over $5 million per location. That's more than what McDonald's and Burger King combined can claim.Related: 24 Interesting Facts You Should Know About Chick-fil-AChik-fil-A's cultureThese five reasons combine to drive Chik-fil-A's success:


Food Quality: Chick-fil-A's menu is intentionally limited, focusing on what they do best. This streamlined approach ensures top-notch quality and a loyal customer base.Customer Experience: Chick-fil-A's employees are trained to create exceptional experiences for customers. The core four principles - make eye contact, smile, speak enthusiastically, and stay connected - are the foundation of their service excellence.Belief in Something: Closing on Sundays, even when it could mean more revenue, shows Chick-fil-A's commitment to its values. This choice has created a fiercely loyal following.Building a Strong Brand: Chick-fil-A has built an iconic brand over eight decades, standing as a shining example for other restaurants.Profit Margins: With an average profit margin of around 30%, Chick-fil-A franchisees can expect substantial returns on their investment.The catch(es)Now, you might wonder, with such stellar success, why isn't Chick-fil-A considered the ultimate franchise opportunity? Two crucial factors set it apart from the traditional franchise model.


1. Lack of Exit Value: Chick-fil-A franchisees do not have the opportunity to sell their business or its assets. Once they're done, they're out. There's no exit strategy, which is a significant drawback for those seeking long-term investment.2. Limited Growth: Chick-fil-A franchisees can only own one location. While this laser focus aligns with the brand's philosophy, it hinders those aspiring to scale and grow their franchise empire.Related: Why Chick-fil-A Employees Never Say 'You're Welcome'Still a dream for manyDespite these limitations, Chick-fil-A offers an enticing proposition for a specific group of individuals. Here's why:Low Entry Cost: The initial investment is a mere $10,000, with virtually no risk involved.Profit Share: Chick-fil-A franchisees typically earn around 5-7% of the business's profits. Considering an average location's revenue, this translates to a substantial income. However, there's a significant caveat: The competition to become a Chick-fil-A franchisee is fierce. With more than 50,000 applicants annually and only a handful of new locations opening, the odds of being selected are less than 1%.


Chick-fil-A undeniably boasts one of the best fast-food concepts in the world. It has mastered the art of focus, quality and customer service. Yet, when it comes to franchise opportunities, it falls short due to the absence of exit value and limited growth potential. While Chick-fil-A may be a dream come true for some fortunate individuals, it may not align with the aspirations of those seeking scalable and long-term franchise investments.

64,These 3 Quotes From Jeff Bezos Will Change How You Run Your Business,"Feb 14, 2024",Gene Marks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/these-3-quotes-from-jeff-bezos-will-change-how-you-run-your/468800,"
Want to change how you run your business? Listen to Jeff Bezos. The former CEO of Amazon was recently interviewed by podcaster Lex Fridman and during the course of this more than two-hour conversation discussed everything from space travel to weight-lifting. But, as a business owner, there were three nuggets of advice that came out of the conversation that really stuck with me. And if you also run a business, you'll probably agree.""There are a thousand ways to be smart.""Bezos said this in the context of telling the story of why he decided to change majors from physics to computer science. A star student and a lover of science, Bezos entered college with the aspiration of becoming a theoretical physicist. But he quickly realized during college that there were some people who are just naturally gifted at some things, like a classmate who was able to figure out a physics problem in minutes, which took Bezos hours.

65,5 Phrases That Kill Your Chances of Receiving Funding,"Feb 13, 2024",Liam Gill,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-phrases-never-to-use-when-asking-for-money/469088,"
I've had the luxury of hearing thousands of startup pitches. This has provided me with a unique opportunity to spot pitching methods that work regardless of market conditions but also those that consistently fail no matter the stage of the company, experience of the founders or market conditions.A significant misconception for founders when fundraising is the belief that they must ""convince"" a VC to invest. The truth is that most VCs decide whether they are interested just minutes into a pitch when they hear the problem, solution, team and traction. After this, every action you take as a founder, every word you say, is simply an opportunity to give that investor a reason NOT to invest.With this in mind, let's look at some phrases that consistently give investors a reason not to invest and kill founders' chances of fundraising.



1. ""We can sell this company within five years.""Building a startup from an idea to a successful company is hard. It takes extreme dedication and hard work. While many founders believe that explaining to investors how they might be able to return their capital (and promising a short timeframe for that return) can be enticing, the truth is that when dealing with venture capitalists, they want to see your commitment to building your business to $1B+. When you start talking about selling the company in the short term, it demonstrates that:You are not 100% focused on the growth of the business.You are more interested in the money than the problem the company solves.The best startups have founders who deeply care about the problems they solve for their customers and not people who are simply trying to get rich.Claiming that you can sell a company in the short term is a major red flag for investors.Related: Should You Pitch Your Startup to Early-Stage Investors?2. ""We don't have any competition.""When an investor hears that you don't have any competition, they immediately become concerned. Nowadays, there is no business idea you can come up with that someone has not thought of before. So, if there is no competition, you must have an incredible reason. Often, unless there is a recent technological innovation or legal change, there is no reason why you won't have some competition.Many founders make the mistake of claiming there is no competition because they think about competition not as other solutions to the problem they are solving but as other companies offering the exact product/service. For example, when AirBnb pitched, they included Craigslist as a competitor. While Craigslist isn't in the business of allowing people to stay in strangers' homes instead of a hotel, the site can connect with others and arrange to stay with someone in a foreign city. Therefore, it is a viable solution to the problem AirBnb was solving and is a competitor. Thinking of competition in this manner will help you find the right competitors to list in your pitch deck.


Finally, reframing how you think of the competitors' slide in your deck is essential. Founders often believe that a lack of competitors is a good sign to investors; aside from raising concerns that you don't fully understand your market, having no competitors can signal to investors that there is no demand for your product. If nobody else is even trying to make money in your market, maybe there isn't a market to begin with. This slide is your chance to show that (i) there are competitors and (ii) how you are better.3. ""We need you to sign an NDA.""Venture Capitalists will not sign an NDA. As an investor, I can confidently say that the conversation ends when a founder asks for an NDA. Investors are hearing thousands of ideas a year and picking the top 5-10; no investor will sign an NDA that risks them being unable to work with dozens or hundreds of companies to hear your pitch.From the founder's perspective, you shouldn't be worried about sharing your ideas unless you have patent or IP considerations. The reality is that companies succeed based on their execution, not ideas. If you have a great idea, you should also believe that you are uniquely positioned to execute the concept in a manner nobody else can. If that isn't the case, you are unlikely to succeed anyway.Related: This Is How Overfunding Can Kill Your Startup


4. ""We just need money""Investors hate supporting companies that aren't already on a path towards success. When pitching your company, you should never talk about your company as a parked car waiting for gas (money) to get going. You should always pitch your company as a car racing toward the finish line; you could go much faster with more gas.Any indication that your company does not already have positive momentum and is relying on a capital injection to get moving drastically increases the risk associated with the business and ends most VC conversations.5. ""I don't need a cofounder,"" or ""We just met a few months ago.""Especially at the pre-seed stage, your team is your most investable asset. Anyone can copy your idea. Investors are looking for a team they believe can execute the idea. If you dismiss their concerns about the size of your team by arguing that you can do it alone or show that your team hasn't worked together long, you create doubts about your ability to execute. If there are deficiencies in your team, don't try to brush them off; instead, focus on how you will remedy them through strategic hires to ensure your company's success.Founders breaking up or giving up is the number one cause of startup failures. While this may seem like a trivial question to you. For investors, the long-term commitment and potential of the founding team are the primary considerations in any pre-seed or seed-stage investment.

66,4 Launch Strategies for Startup Success and Longevity,"Jan 29, 2024",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-launch-strategies-for-startup-success-and-longevity/468612,"
The startup scene across the United States is expanding at almost unprecedented rates. Data from the Economic Innovation Group (EIG) shows that the country's business startup rate in 2021 was the highest since the Great Recession. This statistic alone illustrates two facts: founders are confident in the opportunities in the U.S. economy, and the startup marketplace is growing more crowded in almost every industry.As a result, founders are turning to more innovative approaches to ensure their product launches stand out from the crowd, becoming both memorable and financially successful.The United States has traditionally been a hotbed for startup activity. With a culture that embraces entrepreneurship and values business growth, the country has traditionally welcomed new ideas and innovation.



However, having a great idea is no longer enough to succeed. With nearly half a million new businesses being created every year, it can be hard for founders to cut through the noise to get the attention of investors and potential early customers and launch their first product. Some of the most successful recent launches have seen business owners turn to innovative and unconventional tactics to help them stand out in their marketplace.Although common challenges vary depending on which industry a startup is in, some apply to almost any startup. Most have to work with limited resources regarding manpower and finances. New companies also need to overcome lower brand recognition levels than their more established counterparts, making it harder to stand out.


Product launches can be divided into three phases: pre-launch, launch, and post-launch. Applying an innovative approach can be beneficial at either of these stages, and it will depend on your industry to determine when it is most beneficial to think and act out of the box.Related: 3 Things Your Business Idea Must Have To Succeed — as Proven By Famous Harvard Business School Startups1. Develop a compelling pre-launch strategyThink of a music festival: for hours and sometimes days, lesser-known bands are taking the stage, building up to the main event, the headliner. As these bands play, the crowd's excitement grows, and they are ready to cheer as loud as they can for the main artist. The previous bands have helped to create a buzz around what is coming next.The same process happens when your startup is getting ready to launch a new product. In the pre-launch phase, your team is looking to build excitement and anticipation that turns into endorsement and sales once your product is ready. Teaser campaigns can work well to build excitement, or your team could leverage your social media channels to build a community around the upcoming product. Just like the crowds at the festival, engaging with the community will help build buzz.


Stock trading app Robinhood is a great example of a successful pre-launch strategy. Well before the app was launched, the founders attracted over a million users. They used a compelling proposition — $0 commission on trades — and a referral marketing strategy to build buzz. Signing up was simple, and any new user had the right to invite others. The more people a user invited, the higher they moved up in the queue to gain access to the app. By the time the product launched, a community of traders was waiting to use it.2. Leverage influencers and partnershipsWorking with influencers and celebrities and building partnerships with complementary brands can be powerful tools during the pre-launch and launch phases. The influencer's notoriety and their community can become multipliers for marketing messages, and they may also be among your first customers.Direct-to-consumer beauty company Glossier has been using a novel approach to influencer marketing for its product launches. Rather than working with established influencers, the company sends products to people who engage a lot with its online content or have bought a high volume of products. These ambassadors then share their thoughts and help spread the word about new products.Related: 5 Things You Should Know Before Collaborating With An Influencer


3. Create unconventional launch eventsLaunch events offer startups another excellent opportunity to connect with their audiences. While the classic, opening-night-style event may work for brick-and-mortar startups, tech businesses can still utilize this strategy to lift the proverbial curtain on a product.Virtual tours and other experiences work well for launch events, especially if they allow the audience to interact with the product. Consider using the pre-launch phase to deliver clues about the product, allowing your audience to build a connection. The launch then becomes the final step that reveals the product and perhaps offers free access to those who have consistently engaged during the pre-launch phase.4. Leverage customer engagement and feedbackIt is too easy to pour all your energy into the launch and pre-launch phase but forget about post-launch engagement. Doing that would mean your company is missing out on one of its biggest opportunities.The post-launch phase is when you turn first-time customers into advocates. This is the perfect time to ask for feedback and show your customers you care by resolving problems quickly. It is also important to keep an open mind toward product iterations and adjustments during this phase. No matter how much time your team spent developing your product, it is almost impossible to foresee every potential issue.


Dealing with concerns quickly and engaging customers regularly will go a long way toward building a loyal customer base for your brand.Related: Redefining Customer Engagement in a World Where Data Privacy ReignsConclusionInnovative product launches make an impression, with consumers buying your product immediately and others holding off. Taking a creative approach to the pre-launch, launch, and post-launch phases can help startups build the foundations of a loyal customer base that has supported the brand for decades.There is no right or wrong way of applying these out-of-the-box approaches. Draw inspiration from the examples above, but remember to develop a launch strategy that is authentic to your startup for the highest impact.

67,4 Trends That Are Defining the New Era of PR,"Jan 29, 2024",Sarah Evans,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-trends-defining-the-new-era-of-pr/468643,"
The landscape of public relations is evolving at an unprecedented pace, driven by technological advancements and a shifting focus on what truly resonates with audiences. As we navigate this new era, several key trends are emerging that redefine the role and strategies of PR agencies. While the fundamentals of the practice remain relevant, the way the job is performed now teeters more on a balance of tech-powered and human-driven approaches.Related: 5 Innovative PR Strategies to Boost Your Brand in 20241. AI and predictive analysis: The new PR playbookInfusing artificial intelligence and predictive analytics into public relations is more than a trend; it's a revolution. Modern PR agencies leverage these technologies to foresee media trends, identify storylines and pinpoint the most effective reporters and outlets. This tech-driven approach ensures that the content reaches the right audience and engages them effectively, resulting in a consistent flow of impactful media placements.



Example strategy:AI-Powered Media Landscape Analysis: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current media landscape, scanning thousands of articles, social media posts, and trending topics to identify emerging patterns, hot topics, and key influencers.Predictive Storyline Identification: Leverage predictive analytics to identify potential storylines gaining traction.Targeted Reporter and Outlet Matching: Analyze past articles and reports from various journalists and media outlets, creating a list of reporters and outlets most likely to be interested in targeted stories.Related: Five Ways To Ensure A Successful 2024 Public Relations Plan For Your Business


2. Depth of engagement over audience breadthGone are the days when the success of a PR campaign was measured solely by the size of the audience reached. Today, the quality of attention matters more. Engaging with niche markets, local news, and specialized channels like podcasts and newsletters has proven more effective. Focusing on the depth of engagement, this approach fosters stronger connections and more meaningful conversations with the audience. It reflects a shift towards building trust, awareness, credibility, and authority -- which are the foundational and fundamental building blocks of public relations.This depth-first approach involves creating content that resonates personally, sparking not just views but also conversations, shares, and a strong community presence. PR agencies are increasingly prioritizing metrics like time spent on content, the quality of discourse in comments, and the emotional resonance of the message. By doing so, they can foster a loyal audience base more likely to advocate for and stay engaged with the brand. This methodical focus on nurturing a dedicated following is especially crucial in an era where consumers value authenticity and personalization more than ever.Related: Artificial Intelligence is Revolutionizing Marketing. Here's What the Transformation Means for the Industry3. Strategic communications in tech PRThe tech industry presents unique challenges and opportunities in PR, especially in sub-verticals like cybersecurity, cloud and SaaS. Agencies specializing in tech PR excel in navigating these complex landscapes. Their strategic communications are tailored to resonate within the dynamic tech markets, often involving securing prestigious awards and coveted speaking engagements that amplify visibility and establish authority.


This involves a meticulous understanding of both the technological aspects and the market dynamics. By harnessing data analytics, market insights, and consumer behavior patterns, PR professionals are crafting campaigns that inform, educate, and engage diverse stakeholders. This approach is integral in demystifying complex tech concepts for the general public and positioning tech companies as thought leaders and innovators. Whether it's launching a new product, managing a crisis, or shaping brand perception, the strategic communication efforts in the tech sector are increasingly about creating a narrative that aligns with both business objectives and user expectations, fostering a powerful brand resonance in an ever-evolving digital landscape.4. Efficiency and productivity: Beyond billable hoursThe traditional model of billing by the hour is being challenged. Modern PR agencies focus more on productivity and results than just the number of hours worked. This trend is about doing more with less — leveraging technology and efficient strategies to deliver results without unnecessary overhead. It's a win-win for both agencies and clients, leading to more productive engagements and more impactful outcomes.These trends signify a transformative period in the world of public relations. Agencies that embrace these changes — employing advanced technology, focusing on meaningful engagement, specializing in strategic communications, and prioritizing efficiency — are leading the way in this new era. This comprehensive approach and deep expertise across various sectors exemplify this modern PR agency, one that is not just keeping up with the times but actively shaping the industry's future.

68,Selling Your Small Business? Here Are 5 Advantages of Passing It Down to Family,"Jan 29, 2024",Mark Kravietz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-advantages-of-selling-your-small-business-to-family/466238,"
Recent studies show that 51% of the current American business market is owned by Baby Boomers, who are set to retire over the next 10 years. However, according to the Exit Planning Institute, the success rate for businesses that go to market and successfully sell is only 20% to 30%. These businesses often begin as a labor of love, with a founder's vision and hard work driving their success. However, there comes a time in every entrepreneur's life when they contemplate an exit strategy for their SMB. Unfortunately, only one-third of small business owners actually have a succession plan in place.While there are various factors to consider in this process, one often underestimated but critical aspect is the advantages of selling your small business to your family. Engaging in open and honest conversations with your loved ones presents a valuable opportunity to discuss the future direction of your business. Consider these five benefits of selling your small business to a member of your family as you think about your company's next phase.Related: The 3 Ts of a Successful Family Business TransferPreservation of your legacy: Handing over your business to a family member helps ensure the continuation of your established legacy. It helps assure that the values and visions you've cultivated over the years are upheld, and that everything you've built doesn't disappear when you move onto your next chapter.Tax and financial advantages: Succession planning within your family often leads to significant tax savings and financial benefits. There are several tax benefits available, including the gift tax exemption, which means you can gift a certain amount annually per person ($18,000 per person, $36,000 per couple, as of 2024). You can gift shares of your business to reduce the size of your taxable estate. You may also consider taking advantage of income-splitting, which can lower your family's income taxes if you transfer your business interest to your children. Apart from an annual gift tax exemption, there is a lifetime federal gift tax exemption that can be utilized when transferring a business. Keep in mind that this exemption can change annually, but in 2024 the lifetime exclusion is $13.61 million.Smooth(er) transition: With a family member already familiar with your work style, personality and the business, this often makes for a smoother transition. This familiarity reduces the learning curve and makes for a more seamless transition. It can also be common to structure the deal so you can retain some level of involvement or ownership, providing a safety net and easing some stress around the process. This approach allows you to monitor the business' progress and assist as needed, even after officially stepping down.Greater flexibility: When you pass your business to a family member, you often have more flexibility when it comes to timeline, payment arrangements and roles during the transition, as opposed to a more structured third-party sale. This permits you to gradually phase out of your role, allowing the family member to take on increasing responsibilities over time.Sense of security for customers and employees: Chances are that your customers and employees trust you to act in their best interest. By selling to a family member, you are passing the baton to someone you trust — and maybe even someone they've had a chance to meet or interact with — which may provide a sense of security to your employees and customers. This may lead to higher employee retention and improved customer satisfaction.Related: Now Is the Time to Think About Your Small-Business Succession PlanThe role of family in your exit is significant and multifaceted. Navigating family dynamics can often be complex, and selling your business to family can also come with its fair share of challenges. It's critical to address these challenges head-on and have a clear plan for resolution. Consider involving legal and financial advisors to help structure the deal and create a formal agreement that outlines the roles and responsibilities of family members in the business. Establishing clear boundaries and expectations can prevent misunderstandings and disputes down the road. Identifying your successor and completing a successful transition is one of the most critical things you will do as a business owner, and making the right decision could preserve your business for years to come.

69,"I Built an Online Solopreneur Business That Generates $150,000 of Passive Income a Year. Here's My 5-Step Guide To Success.","Jan 26, 2024",Liam Gill,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-5-step-guide-to-success-in-online-business/468604,"
With wages stagnating and layoffs seemingly part of everyday life for the past three years, many professionals have sought to start a solopreneur business. A solopreneur business is a business (often digital) that the owner can run without a team.In September 2022, I left my job. Despite having two law degrees and a Master of Sciences, I was wrapping up a one-year contract that paid me $50k annually while working 50+ hours per week. Now, I did have some savings and had been planning to start my solopreneurship venture for a few years, so I wasn't starting from zero. Before that one-year contract, I founded a technology startup and worked a higher-paying job in the technology industry.Related: 4 Ways to Make Over $1 Million With Your Online Business



When I left my job, I calculated that I had six months of runway to make enough to cover my annual costs before finding a job. It is vital that before you start any solopreneur journey or abandon your source of income, you know exactly how long you have to make your business work. This allows you to minimize stress by determining a stopping point instead of endlessly dragging yourself and your family through the pain of trying to start a business while dropping deeper into debt.Let's start your journey to $150k and walk you through exactly how I did it, step by step.Related: The 5 Stages of Personal Wealth — How to Master Your Money For Business Success1. Hacking your initial audienceThe biggest challenge in building a solopreneur business is starting the journey and building an initial audience. Going from 10,000 to 50,000 followers is much easier than going from 0 to 10,000. From my experience and speaking to many content creators, I've learned that you must hack your way to your first 10,000 followers. There is no set formula for this early stage of building your brand.The most common mistake I see when people are starting their journey is that they try to create systems that can take them from 0 to 100,000 followers. This doesn't work; you'll need to fight for every subscriber until you reach a base of subscribers who consistently interact with your content (often around 10,000). Once you have a base of followers, you can start building your systems, but it's a waste of time in the early days.My first step started about two years before I left my job. At the time, I was working for a newsletter publication, sending summaries of daily business news to roughly 40,000 entrepreneurs each day. I was lucky enough to be able to add a link in my by-line for over a year, prompting readers interested in legal insights for their startup or small business to subscribe to my newsletter. This little trick helped me gain my first 10,000 followers.


Other ways I've seen content creators hacking their way to their first 10,000 followers include viral videos, product creation, viral tweets, cold messaging, cold emails, paid advertisements and much more. If you are starting your journey, this is where you need to be creative and focus all your time and effort. Until you can hack your way to 10,000 followers on socials or a newsletter, you'll struggle to generate revenues effectively and consistently as a solopreneur.Related: 4 Ways to Avoid Loneliness as a Solopreneur2. Focus on one channelOnce you've gained 10,000 followers on one channel, you must focus on that channel. For me, it was email. For ten months, all my content was written for email; if I had time, I repurposed it for social media. A big scaling mistake solopreneurs make when building their audience is immediately trying to expand it onto multiple platforms. Don't lose momentum on one platform by dividing your attention. Dominate one channel before using your influence and following that channel to give you a headstart on any other channels you choose to use.3. Diversify income sourcesWhile you should focus on just one channel for growth, you need multiple channels for income. My audience is startup founders. I get paid by advertisers to promote products, founders themselves to teach them how to fundraise, and investors for referring companies to them. Focus early on securing multiple sources of income; even if you make very little from each source, it's better to grow the size of these deals than to try seeking new channels when others dry up desperately.


Related: Diversify Your Income: Protect Your Finances with These Strategies4. Capture every pricepointWhen monetizing your audience, you need to capture every price point. A major failure I see today is solopreneurs who charge $10,000+ for consulting with no cheaper services available. While it's true that a $1,000 offer might cannibalize some of their higher-priced sales, I've found that lower-price products can help generate interest in higher-priced ones and build trust and loyalty with your audience.If you only help people who can pay $10,000 for consulting, why would the average person follow you? Too many creators abuse those followers who cannot pay large amounts; they build a brand of their likes, retweets, subscriptions and follows, then abandon them when they need help.Related: 5 Strategies to Thrive as a Solo Business Owner — Without Burning Out


5. Interact with followersCommon advice you are likely to hear is commenting on top creators' posts to gain exposure to their audience and grow your following. In my experience, this isn't the optimal path. Instead, I chose to spend my time engaging with my audience.While my comments on their posts won't get 1k+ views, they build a relationship between me and my followers. It means a lot to a random follower or reader when I take the time to write to them or comment on their posts. In the long run, it makes it more likely that they will support my posts, remain a follower, and purchase a product, not to mention the many great relationships I've built with followers!

What is lead scoring?Lead scoring is a methodology sales and marketing teams use to rank prospects against a scale that represents the perceived value each lead represents to the organization. The main goal of lead scoring is to prioritize leads, identifying which ones are ready to be passed on to sales and which ones require further nurturing.Key components of lead scoring:Demographic information includes data like job title, industry, company size and location. These factors can indicate how well a lead matches your ideal customer profile.Behavioral data entails tracking and analyzing a lead's interaction with your brand, such as website visits, content downloads, email engagement, and social media interactions. These activities provide insights into a lead's interest level and intent.Lead source: The origin of the lead (e.g., a marketing campaign, referral, or organic search) can also play a significant role in determining the lead's score.BANT criteria: Some organizations use BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, time frame) as a framework to score leads based on their purchase readiness.Related: 3 Automated Lead Generation Strategies To Implement In Your Sales Process


What is lead grading?Lead grading is the process of evaluating leads against your ideal customer profile (ICP). It's about assessing how well a lead fits the key characteristics of your target market. Unlike lead scoring, which is dynamic and changes based on a lead's behavior, lead grading is generally static, based primarily on demographic information.Key components of lead gradingCompany Information: Size, industry, and revenue can determine whether a company fits within your target market.Decision Maker's Profile: Roles, titles, and level of authority within the company are crucial to understanding whether the contact can make purchasing decisions.Geographical Location: For businesses with geographic limitations or preferences, the location of a lead can be a significant grading factor.Related: How to Generate Leads in 2024 When Cold Acquisition, Emails and Trade Shows Don't Work AnymoreDifferences between lead scoring and gradingWhile both processes aim to qualify leads, they differ in focus. Lead scoring is about a lead's interest and behavior, whereas lead grading evaluates how closely a lead matches the ideal customer profile. Essentially, scoring is about the lead's actions, and grading is about the lead's attributes. When implementing lead scoring and grading:Define Criteria: Clearly define what constitutes a high-quality lead for both scoring and grading. Collaborate with both sales and marketing teams for a comprehensive view.Use Marketing Automation Tools: Many CRM and marketing automation platforms offer lead scoring and grading functionalities. Utilize these tools to automate and streamline the process.Regular Review and Adjustment: Continuously monitor and adjust your scoring and grading criteria to align with changes in market trends, customer behavior, and business objectives.Training and Alignment: Ensure that marketing and sales teams are trained on using lead scoring and grading in their workflows.The implementation of lead scoring and grading represents a transformative step in the journey of sales and marketing optimization. By intelligently classifying and prioritizing leads, businesses can achieve higher efficiency and create a more personalized approach to customer engagement. This dual strategy serves as a bridge, harmonizing the efforts of sales and marketing teams, and ensuring that each lead is nurtured with the right attention and resources.


It is crucial to recognize that lead scoring and grading are not static strategies. They require ongoing refinement and adaptation to the ever-changing market trends and customer behaviors. Businesses should view these methodologies as living components of their sales and marketing ecosystem, continuously evolving with the organization's growth and learning from customer interactions.The true power of lead scoring and grading lies in their ability to provide actionable insights. When leveraged correctly, these insights can lead to more strategic decision-making, better alignment of sales and marketing objectives, and, ultimately, a significant impact on the bottom line. Businesses that master these techniques will enjoy improved conversion rates and build stronger, more lasting relationships with their customers.Lead scoring and grading are not just tools for businesses; they are vital cogs in modern sales and marketing machinery. They enable organizations to navigate the complexities of customer acquisition and retention with greater clarity and precision.

However, this approach can often lead to disappointment.Why? Because, in reality, most sales presentations end in a resounding ""no."" Most, if not all, salespeople do NOT have a 100% close rate. Most salespeople have a close rate of less than 50%, meaning they fail more than they succeed.



So, what's the solution?The key here lies in shifting your objective. Rather than persistently chasing after a sale, pivot your focus to simply getting an answer. This shift will not only reframe your outlook on success but also lay the foundation for a more nuanced and effective sales strategy.


Related: Here's Why Your Team Needs to Say 'No' More Than 'Yes'The winning answers: Yes, no, or clear directionNow that we have shifted our outlook on success, determining what constitutes a victory in a sales pitch boils down to receiving one of three distinct responses: a resounding ""yes,"" a clear-cut ""no"" or a well-defined direction. Here's how they translate to success:Yes: This one's easy. It means your pitch has resonated with the potential client, and they want your product or service. Securing a ""yes"" is unequivocally a win.No: A flat-out ""no"" is still a triumph in the grand scheme of sales, as it allows you to move on and redirect your efforts to more promising leads. If you can swiftly acknowledge a prospect's disinterest, you can efficiently streamline your approach and better allocate resources. If you can quickly identify a no, you can focus all your energy on the opportunities to get a yes. Too many salespeople fool themselves into thinking they have a prospect or a lead when what they have is a no. They waste a lot of time chasing nothing.Clear Direction: This response implies a specific follow-up task and a scheduled time to reconnect with your prospect. It's still a win because it confirms potential interest and outlines a roadmap to an eventual ""yes."" The key to the Clear Direction is a specific follow-up time frame. If the timeframe isn't specific, it's probably a no that you haven't recognized yet.Recognizing the value of a ""no""Too many salespeople cling to unproductive leads driven by a misguided perception of their potential as future sales. This inclination towards holding onto unpromising prospects is rooted in several factors, including:Lack of understanding of what a ""no"" truly means: They are viewing the rejection solely as a closed door, rather than as an opportunity to refocus efforts on more viable prospects.Pressure from managers to maintain a full pipeline, even if it's filled with unqualified leads: This means retaining leads that may not align with the ideal customer profile, and ultimately hinders the overall efficiency of the sales process. This is a combination of a problem with the salesperson and a problem with the sales manager.The hopeful belief that a prospect might return to make a purchase: While optimism is a valuable trait, it must be tempered with a realistic evaluation of a lead's likelihood to convert.For sales managers, it's imperative to take a proactive role in educating your team on discerning genuine opportunities from those unlikely to convert. It is also important not to pressure your team into chasing false hope on leads that are actually dead.


Related: How to Generate Leads From LinkedIn At No CostThe power of clear directionEncountering a situation where the initial response is neither a definitive ""yes"" nor a resounding ""no"" is not uncommon. To differentiate the future ""yes"" from the future ""no,"" make sure you can establish a clear direction that not only sustains the momentum of the interaction but also guides the path for subsequent engagement.This involves setting a specific timeframe for follow-up or assigning a task that leads to the next interaction. Make sure your follow-up plans are specific and result-oriented; they should not just serve as a formality but work to enhance the chances of converting the prospect into a ""yes"" in the future.Maintaining close ratios while moving through leadsWhile a ""no"" is a clear sign to move on to other potential prospects, a delicate balance is crucial for keeping close ratios within the desired range.


If you start speeding up the process and blowing through leads and your close ratio goes from 15% down to 10%, that suggests missed opportunities and hints at underlying issues in your overall sales process.Take a step back to analyze your sales process meticulously, identifying any shortcomings or areas requiring refinement.The key principle remains: strive for a swift progression through leads, but not at the expense of compromising your close ratio. This delicate equilibrium ensures that speed and efficiency can coexist with the ultimate goal of achieving successful conversions.Remember that your new definition of a ""win"" should be just getting an answer. Armed with this new perspective, go out there, talk to your prospects, get some answers, and master the art of sales success. As long as you are getting an answer, you are successful 100% of the time!

Many execs or small business owners think social media is complete fluff — and for most businesses, it is.And when they say fluff, they don't mean to say it's pointless. It's well-documented that social media is a powerful tool. The skepticism with investing in social media is that it can be a coin toss if there is a return on investment (ROI).""That is because most marketers do not apply any direct-marketing tactics to their strategic approach — if they are even strategic at all,"" author Kim Walsh Phillips said in her latest book, Ultimate Guide To Instagram For Business, Second Edition.

73,4 Steps to Becoming a Sales-Focused Founder (and Why It's Important),"Jan 5, 2024",Jyoti Bansal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-become-a-sales-focused-founder-and-why-its/467333,"
Remember Pebble?Users loved the original ""smartwatch,"" which all the way back in 2013 could show texts and notifications on your wrist. But despite rave reviews and being years ahead of its time, Pebble fell woefully short in the one metric that really mattered: sales. It was ultimately sold to Fitbit for a mere $23 million — a sad end to an amazing product.For startups and their founders, this kind of product-sales disconnect is surprisingly common. It will only become more pronounced in today's uncertain economy, where customers are spoiled for choice, leaving businesses to live or die on the strength of their sales efforts.



As the founder of three software companies, I learned the hard way that having an effective sales strategy matters just as much as creating a great product. When I started my first company, a platform for monitoring software performance, I came from an engineering background and focused relentlessly on product. (No surprise, considering the sum of my sales experience at the time consisted of selling farm equipment at my father's shop back in India!)The problem with that attitude? Once a company starts growing, sales, marketing and distribution are as important as the product itself. You might make the best TV in the world, but if you can't get it on the shelf at Best Buy, you won't last long. All told, about 40% of new product launches fail, so businesses need all the sales muscle they can muster.


Looking back, my journey to becoming a sales-focused founder had some clear stepping stones. For other founders and entrepreneurs, especially those like me who may be new to sales, here are four steps to going from sales skeptic to expert:Related: 5 Tips to Master the Art of Sales and Get Your Business AheadStep 1: Accept that sales actually matterAs an engineer, I'd never stopped to think that sales could be a competitive advantage. To me, the word conjured stereotypical (and inaccurate) images of slick-haired guys who were good at schmoozing customers. I know so many founders in that boat: Sales is an afterthought … until you discover that your brilliantly engineered product isn't selling.In the early days at AppDynamics, we shot from the hip with sales, an approach that had gotten us to several million dollars in annual revenue, primarily by landing a few big accounts like Netflix. But a fellow CEO pointed out the obvious: If we ever hoped to cross the $100 million threshold someday, we needed to get scientific about sales.


For me, the crucial first step was education. If a software engineer can learn programming, they can learn sales. So I embarked on what amounted to a mini degree.I studied companies similar to mine that were three to five years ahead: How did that company run its sales process, and what kind of salespeople did it recruit? Leaning on experts helped too. For example, I hired John McMahon, a top authority on enterprise software sales, as an advisor for weekly whiteboard sessions.For busy founders, this education represents a significant time investment but is well worth it. In one study of 500 B2B companies, the top 25% generated 2.6 times more ROI from sales costs than their peers in the bottom quartile.}Step 2: Build your sales machineSo many companies make products with great technology but they never stop to answer a critical question: How does our product actually make customers' lives better?


For us, this quickly became clear: We kept heads from rolling. Our software enabled companies to monitor and quickly troubleshoot performance slowdowns — the kind of glitches that led to downtime, lost customers, and disgruntled CTOs. Once the product-value connection was clear, my team and I got scientific about building a sales machine.The first step here was pure math. Let's say our annual sales target was $10 million, with each deal worth an average of $100,000. By factoring in average closing rate (30%, for instance) with average closing time (six months), we were able to calculate exactly how many leads we needed in our funnel and how many salespeople we needed to get there.Hiring, training and incentivizing is equally important. We learned to quickly part ways with reps who weren't right for the job, and to promote high performers just as quickly. Alignment with the rest of the company and timing matters, too. Are your product and go-to-market teams ready to ramp up? How much cash is on hand to burn while the sales machine ramps?Done right, the flywheel starts turning. In one study of B2B companies, those with a rigorous sales process saw an average of 28% higher revenue growth than peers lacking one. By contrast, half of underperforming organizations in another survey had non-existent or informal sales processes.Related: Want to Sell More? Don't Start With Your Product or Service — Start With Yourself.


Step 3: Relentlessly focus on people (and champions)Numbers aside, at its heart, sales is all about people. That's why I still spend at least a third of my working hours chatting with prospects and customers, in person or via Zoom. It's a powerful way to get product feedback and an even better way to find your champion.Your champion is the person on the inside of a company who's going to bat for you — who will evangelize your product to bosses and decision-makers, giving you a leg up on the competitors. In the early days, I struggled to grasp how important having a champion is. But in the absence of the right relationship with the right person, our proposals never had a chance.Finding a champion for your product at a small company is one thing. At a large corporation, because there are so many decision-makers, making a sale is like getting a bill through Congress. Cultivating not just one but multiple champions is critical.Just choose the right ones.Step 4: Remove surprises from the sales processB2B sales is a long game. With large customers, the courtship typically lasts six to nine months. Nobody wants to find out four months in that they've been talking to the wrong person because their contact has no plans to buy or can't greenlight a purchase.


The trick to avoiding such bombshells? Don't take shortcuts. Take time to pinpoint the real decision-makers. Understand their pain points (not just yours). Make sure your product meets purchasing criteria (or better yet, help write the criteria — the not-so-secret trick to winning most contracts). Anticipate what rivals are telling customers — including what they're saying about you.If this seems like a lot to remember, it is. But online training tools like MEDDPICC and SalesHood break the sales process down into manageable chunks. At the end of the day, sales is a huge commitment of resources, with B2B SaaS companies typically spending 35% of revenue on it and marketing. Removing surprises can yield big savings.Now that I've built and refined sales machines at three companies, I know that improving the process never ends. I've also learned the importance of hiring an expert VP of sales and CRO. Whether it's reaching $1 million, $100 million or $1 billion in annual sales, I wrestle with the same questions that preoccupied me at the start, from hitting targets to sussing out traps laid by competitors. I may be a founder and CEO, but I'm still getting my degree in sales.Related: 8 Ways Your Startup Can Master Sales and Growth

74,5 Tips for Creating SEO Content That Ranks,"Jan 4, 2024",Nick Zviadadze,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-tips-for-creating-seo-content-that-ranks/467284,"
If you want to rank well on Google and drive organic traffic, it's essential to know how to create content that's optimized for search engines (SEO content).SEO-friendly content is fundamentally different from conventional content, which means there are some caveats you need to consider if you want your blog posts to rank.In this article, I will give you five practical SEO tips for creating content that ranks.



Why is SEO content important?Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is important because it can place you on the top of search engine result pages, improving your online visibility and driving more organic traffic to your website.To do that, you need to create content that's engaging and valuable to humans and also optimized for search engines. It's the only way to land on the first page of Google and attract the right audience you can later convert to customers.


Here's how you can create quality SEO content:Related: 5 Simple SEO Strategies to Improve Your Rankings1. Write with a keyword in mindBefore you start writing, you need to pick a keyword your audience looks up on search engines. You can use a keyword research tool to find relevant keywords with a good balance of search volume, relevance and competition.After you select a keyword, type it into Google and read content that ranks for it. Analyze these top-ranking articles, reverse engineer their structure, identify common themes, and learn why Google views them as valuable.


Then, use these insights to craft your article around the target keyword. This method ensures your content aligns with search intent and has a better chance of ranking high on search engines.Writing an article first and attempting to fit a keyword afterward is a common SEO mistake. But it's like fitting a square peg into a round hole — it just won't work.2. Write for robots and humansCreating SEO content is all about striking a delicate balance between writing for search engines and your target audience.Writing for robots means strategically incorporating relevant keywords throughout the text, optimizing meta titles and descriptions, and using header tags. These and other SEO strategies help search engines understand the context of your content, improving its chances of ranking.


While writing for robots is crucial, Google's primary goal is to deliver valuable content to human readers. That's why you also need to craft engaging and helpful content that matches the search intent of your audience.One important tip is to structure your SEO content to improve readability. That's because users mostly scan articles instead of reading every word. You need to write engaging subheadings, bullet points and short paragraphs to help the readers quickly find the information they're looking for.3. Start with a content outlineCreating a coherent article without a proper outline can be challenging, even if you're an expert. That's why having a content outline to guide you can help with the article's flow and prevent content overlap or repetition between different sections, improving the quality of your content.An outline helps the writer know exactly what information they need to provide to meet the search intent, creating a more straightforward writing process. This ensures a well-organized article that conveys all the necessary information.


Creating an outline doesn't need to be complicated. You can just Google your main keyword and analyze the structure of top-ranking articles of your competitors. Use this information to create a winning outline, covering the most important points and your unique insights.Related: 3 Ways to Build Content Pillars That Will Boost Your Google Ranking4. Create high-quality contentToday, Google is a lot smarter than it was in the early 2000s.Back then, you could get away with writing short-form, mediocre blog posts and still manage to rank and drive organic traffic.Today, however, unless your content is as high quality as possible, your chances of ranking are very slim.Here are some simple SEO techniques that can help you create better-quality content and improve your online visibility:Focus on long-form content: Although Google has mentioned that word count isn't a ranking factor, long-form articles tend to rank better. That's because this type of content is more likely to satisfy search intent and tick all the right boxes with search engines and readers alike.Outshine your competitors: Identify gaps in the existing content of your competitors and include additional explanations to provide more value to the readers.Use simple language: Write in clear and simple language, avoiding jargon that may alienate readers. Make your content universally understandable to cater to a broader audience.Include visual elements: Create a better user experience by including images or videos to improve engagement and understanding of your content.Leverage compelling data: Use data, statistics and expert quotes to enhance the credibility of your article and position yourself as an authority.Cite high-quality sources: Referencing reputable sources to back up your claims makes your content more trustworthy and provides additional resources for your readers.5. Focus on content velocityContent velocity refers to the frequency with which you publish new content. You want to increase your content velocity as much as possible to improve your authority and your chances of ranking high.Your content can't rank if it isn't published, so you need to establish a regular publishing schedule with as many articles as possible. If you don't have the time to focus on this strategy, working with an SEO agency can help you increase content velocity.Publishing content regularly signals search engines that your website is active and authoritative. However, it's essential to find the right balance — while quantity is important, you should never sacrifice quality for quantity, because your content simply won't rank if it's bad.Related: The Best Way to Get More Results From Your Content


SEO content is important because it helps search engines understand what your website is about. By optimizing your content for search engines, you increase the chances of ranking high.You can create better SEO content by starting with a content outline, writing with a keyword in mind, writing for robots and humans, focusing on quality, and increasing content velocity.Use these five tips to take your SEO content to the next level and start ranking high on Google.

75,How to Plan Your Quarter-One Marketing Strategy in 5 Simple Steps,"Jan 1, 2024",Christopher Tompkins,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-plan-your-q1-marketing-strategy/466830,"
Whew! Another (hopefully) successful year is in the bag. But don't rest too easy because the best time to set yourself up for success in 2024 is right now. The beginning of the year is a perfect opportunity to reflect on last year's wins and losses and use them to refresh your strategy heading into Q1.Read on as I reveal how you can develop a cohesive plan that focuses on your audience, goals and budget.1. Nail your quarter-one marketing planEvery new year brings new opportunities for brands to grow their profits and keep those customers smiling. Now is the perfect time to conduct an annual reflection on your marketing and deeply dive into how your strategy performed.



The year's busiest season is over; now it's time to plan for an even better coming year. That said, here's how to develop a cohesive plan focusing on your audience, goals and budget.Related: How to Create a Successful Marketing Plan: 5 Steps


2. Reflect on the previous yearNow isn't the time for business as usual. The goals you set for this quarter will set the pace for the entire year, so it's the perfect time to reevaluate what you think you know about your brand and audience. If you want to see success this year, it's time to question everything.That means taking stock of your past achievements and mistakes (key word there). Analyze your previous years' KPIs and metrics. How did last year compare to the years before it? The answers to these questions hold the secrets of success and should be the light that guides you throughout the new year.Start by gathering these key things: your annual website traffic, engagement rates, conversion rates and customer acquisition costs. Identify the patterns of your consumers' behavior by studying the social media engagement flow, website behavior and sales data to use for your next batch of creative ideas.3. Audit and optimize your online presenceEvery business strives for a strong online presence, and while some of you may have seen that come to life, others may not. Regardless of your performance last year, it's time for a full online brand audit. Pull together all the metrics from every community you are a part of and determine whether critical elements such as brand message, social content, ad campaigns and website visits are working or need adjusting.


Remember, you should always go into your audit with a plan in mind, so here's how you can work your magic:Firstly, take a look at your website design and content. Is it making you want to explore what's on the page or click away immediately? Is it user-friendly and easy to navigate where the customer needs to be? Can your website be easily viewed on mobile? If not, it needs a refresh.Additionally, take a quick look through your social media profiles. Update your bio, banner and profile picture to reflect your current brand and target audience. Keep your profiles consistent with one visual aesthetic, and optimize using keywords in every content posted.These small steps make the most significant difference in the world when it comes to attracting a new audience and keeping your current one.Related: How to Grow Your Brand's Digital Presence from 0 to 100,000 Followers in Just 6 Months4. Clean up your communitiesIf you want to stay in your audience's good graces, you need a solid plan to tell them about your products and provide something valuable that keeps them coming back. This includes everything you post online, including blogs, social media, emails, networking groups, etc.The answer to this? It's simple: every quarter, you should be going through and cleaning up all of the communities your brand has been involved in within the last year. Identify your messaging, content types and aesthetics across all platforms to be sure your brand is represented consistently and cleanly.Online communities are vital for any brand, but too many communities can often lead to slip-ups.


Most importantly, remember your email community. Take a look at your subscriber lists, as they've likely changed a lot in the last year. Reevaluate your content, and make sure it's written to speak to your audience as it is today, and not the audience you had a year ago. Remember, it's not about you.5. Adjust your paid advertising planAdvertising is truly an art form and with each campaign comes new insights into how you can continue to improve. The beginning of the year is the perfect opportunity to look at the annual overview of how your ads performed over each month or quarter. So, to refine your ads, here are the top things you should be looking for when analyzing the previous year's results:First, take a close look at how your ad campaigns over the full year performed individually. Look at each campaign's numbers and analyze the specifics. Looking at details such as ad spend, engagement, and ROI, you can figure out which campaigns did well and which ones didn't, determine why, and going forward you won't waste time and resources on things that don't work.Next, make some changes to how you fund your ads. This could mean moving money around to the campaigns that did the best or making small adjustments to how much you're willing to pay for certain demographics or geographic areas.


Finally, something we marketers know all too well: adjust your campaigns based on changing trends. There are always new places to show ads and new ways to make them. So, be on the lookout for new opportunities, like trying out video ads instead of carousels.

76,8 Pitfalls Small Businesses Must Avoid When It Comes to Marketing Themselves,"Dec 27, 2023",Thomas Helfrich,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/8-pitfalls-small-businesses-must-avoid-when-it-comes-to/465939,"

The power of content marketing for small businessesIt's a well-known fact that content marketing is a strategic marketing approach that has been around for years and has gained even more prominence with the continued growth of social media and other technologies.Rand Fishkin, co-founder and former CEO of Moz, puts it succinctly: ""Content marketing is the new SEO."" As a marketing technique, it's aimed at attracting a targeted audience through consistent content for profitable customer action.


For small businesses, it's a potent tool to reach a wider audience, establish their presence, build brand awareness, generate leads and ultimately bridge the gap between sales and marketing for B2B lead generation. Some key benefits of content marketing for small businesses include increased website traffic, a boost in SEO rankings, lead generation, increased brand awareness and much more.The consequences of common mistakes in your content marketingFor small businesses to survive, getting every detail right is crucial. Unlike larger brands, small business owners can't afford to get things wrong, as the consequences can significantly impact their brand reputation. When content marketing goes awry, you might experience the following:Poor performance in search engine rankings.Reduced website traffic, which ultimately affects revenue.Wasted resources, effort and time spent on creating content.A competitive disadvantage as your competitors seize the opportunity to win over your target audience.Related: 8 Things Technology Startups Need to Do Before Creating Their Content StrategyThe content marketing mistakes small businesses must avoid to succeedNow that it's clear that making mistakes with your content marketing can be detrimental as a small business owner, what are the red flags to watch out for? To solve any problem, it's important to identify it, as that makes it easier to avoid. Here are some mistakes that small businesses should steer clear of in their content marketing efforts:


Mistake 1: Failing to define your target audience clearlyWhile this may sound like a basic principle, you'd be surprised at how many small businesses have no idea who their target audience is. Simply putting your product out there and hoping it gets purchased isn't enough. Without researching your audience and building an ideal customer profile, you're setting yourself up for failure from the start.Make the most of research tools to understand your customers, their preferred platforms, the problems they're searching to solve and how you can position yourself as the solution they need.Mistake 2: Lacking a clear and consistent content strategyWithout a well-defined content strategy, achieving or sustaining your content marketing goals is challenging. Understanding the importance of content marketing is one thing, but executing it successfully is another. The absence of a content strategy can mark the beginning of the end of your content marketing efforts, and that's something nobody wants.Consistency is crucial for successful content marketing, as it allows for regularly delivering valuable information to the audience. This helps build trust and credibility, grow your audience and generate leads through an effective system.


Mistake 3: Neglecting to keep up with trendsAs a small business owner, you're doing yourself a disservice by not staying updated with industry trends. Customer behaviors are constantly evolving, and the online space provides valuable insights into those changes. Falling behind means you're in the dark when it comes to your business.Staying current with industry trends and best practices in search engines and social media platforms gives you a competitive advantage. The only way to achieve this is by being proactive, agile and adaptive.Related: Why Producing High-Quality Content Matters for Your BusinessMistake 4: Compromising on content qualitySurprisingly, the quality of your content plays a pivotal role in the success of your content marketing efforts. Unfortunately, many business owners overlook this crucial aspect, which can come back to haunt them.


High-quality content has the power to be actionable, persuasive and emotionally engaging, encouraging your audience to take the desired action. You can draw in the attention of your target audience, boost brand awareness and position yourself as an authority by producing interesting and useful content.Mistake 5: Neglecting SEO best practicesFor small businesses, leveraging organic content marketing is the most cost-effective and sustainable approach. However, getting it right requires careful attention and planning. Ignoring search engine best practices like mobile responsiveness, keyword research and on-page SEO means setting yourself up for failure.By adhering to search engine best practices and strategically positioning your business, you gain an advantage on search engine result pages (SERPs), drive traffic to your website and establish your business as a relevant and valuable brand.Mistake 6: Always sounding sales-orientedWhile it may seem like your product is a surefire sell, that's not always the case. Pushing it aggressively at your audience can have the opposite effect. One of the biggest content marketing blunders is coming across as too sales-focused whenever the opportunity arises, which can drive your audience away.


Instead, focus on providing value to your audience consistently. Since people are emotional creatures, they are more likely to buy from you because of the value you offer. Value sparks curiosity, which in turn boosts conversion rates. Pay close attention to the value you deliver through your content marketing efforts.Mistake 7: Lack of content varietyVariety is often said to be the spice of life. Imagine if your content marketing lacks variety — wouldn't it become monotonous and boring? Many small business owners fall into this trap. While a particular content type may have worked in the past, it doesn't guarantee the same success every time.To get the most out of your content marketing, embrace diversity. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to content marketing since people respond differently to various content types. Experiment with different content formats, from text-only to visual content, to achieve the best results across various marketing channels and platforms.Related: 6 Marketing Pitfalls That Can Haunt Your Company


Mistake 8: Failing to measure and analyze resultsJumping on the content marketing bandwagon isn't enough if you can't measure your results. You won't know how well your content marketing is performing without proper measurement.Ensure you have key metrics and KPIs in place to gauge what's working and what's not. The specific metrics to measure will depend on the services you offer and the objectives you want to achieve. It could include website traffic, clickthrough rates, bounce rates, conversion rates and more. Several tools, such as HubSpot, Semrush, Moz and others are available to help you track your performance effortlessly.Drawing the curtainIn summary, content marketing helps small businesses reach their audience, build brand awareness, generate leads and drive sales. However, it's crucial to steer clear of these common content marketing mistakes to achieve success; otherwise, you may be setting yourself up for failure before you even begin.

Is your business ""making the world a better place""?It's become a business cliché, because everyone wants to feel good about making money. But if your company didn't start out with an altruistic mission, it can often feel like the incentives are out of whack. But don't write yourself off just yet, says Patagonia's director of philosophy, Vincent Stanley. He wants you to know that even the most celebrated philanthropic business didn't start out that way. ""Patagonia was meant to be an easy-to-milk cash cow,"" he says. ""Not a risk-taking, environment-obsessed, navel-gazing company.""Stanley has been with the outdoor apparel brand since 1973, when his uncle, Yvon Chouinard, started it as an offshoot to support his real venture, making rock- climbing equipment. But as Patagonia grew, Stanley says there were ""a handful of moments that stunned us into consciousness."" One such moment was their discovery that cotton — ""what we thought was a natural and therefore virtuous fiber"" — was actually the most toxic material to grow. That and other stories are detailed in a new book, The Future of the Responsible Company: What We've Learned from Patagonia's First 50 Years.

78,How Modern Technology is Rewriting the Rules of Marketing,"Nov 29, 2023",Christopher Tompkins,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-social-media-and-modern-technology-are-rewriting-the/465449,"
Ads look a little different in today's world than they did in 2013, and it's all thanks to the innovative minds of marketers and professionals who saw the changing marketing landscape and found new ways to adapt and refine their work.So, with that said, let's take a look at some of the biggest trends and tools that have emerged in the last decade and how they've shaped today's digital marketing space.Social media and search engines have become a stapleFirst up, we have the (in)famous social media platforms. These have become every extrovert's dream and connected billions of people together. In the marketing world, these spaces have provided businesses with a stage to strut their stuff.



Sure, social media was big in 2013, but today's social media blows it out of the water. Take Facebook, for example. It remains the largest social media platform today, just as it did a decade ago. Here's the difference: in 2013, Facebook had 1.2 billion users. Today, it has over three billion.Unsurprisingly, this massive growth of users has also led to social media ad spending skyrocketing from an estimated $4.1 billion in 2013 to over $72 billion in 2023. Along with a rise in the number of users, social media platforms also provide advertisers with more ways than ever to interact with their audiences. For example, stories and short-form videos have become pivotal, providing brands with immersive ways to engage their audience.


Next is SEO. Remember the days when finding information was like searching for a needle in a haystack? Thanks to the evolution of search engines, today, if you need to find the best tacos in town, you can simply ""Google it.""The practice of search engine optimization has grown in importance as businesses strive to optimize their online presence and rank higher in search engine results. This visibility is crucial — can you even remember the last time you looked at the second page of a Google search?Without SEO, your website might as well be hiding in plain sight, and we all know how well that works out.It's not just about keywords and metadata — marketers need to grasp the nuances of voice search, featured snippets, and mobile-friendliness to maintain a competitive edge in the digital realm.


That brings me to my last point in this section: mobile optimization.It's a phone's world and we just live in it!In the last decade, mobile devices have become more than just another piece of tech — they have become the centers of our universe. With the mobile-first approach, marketers have had to adapt to a world where screens are small and attention spans are even smaller.The key to success? Responsive design, user-friendly mobile apps, and embracing the thumb-scrolling generation.Related: 6 Free Tools That Help Optimize Your WebsiteTraditional marketing has moved to digitalThe power of digital PR is also something that cannot be ignored. Remember when PR was all press releases, phone calls, and snazzy press events?Well, in walked the digital space, where PR has transformed into managing online reputations, securing backlinks, and crafting compelling narratives that capture customer's attention while scrolling. This opened many doors for businesses to connect with their audience on a more personal level.Moving from print ads to digital ads allowed brands to reach a variety of highly specific audiences in a short amount of time - something that has truly revolutionized marketing in the last decade. The term more for less stands true in this instance.


Now, brands can have successful digital PR campaigns involving influencer collaborations or virtual conferences at the click of a button instead of fighting to be on the front page of the newspaper.Related: 10 Marketing Strategies to Fuel Your Business GrowthContent marketing has become crucialLast but definitely not least is content marketing. Content marketing has transformed from mere blog posts and newsletters into a full-blown art form in the past decade. It's not just about creating content; it's about telling compelling stories through podcasts or live shows.Whether it's an engaging video, an informative infographic, or a heartwarming blog, content is king, and creativity is your crown. With this reliance on connectivity — trust has moved to the front of every consumer's mind.


If you want to build trust — you better be prepared to prove it. We have learned in the last decade that our audience won't just take our word for fact anymore. They want to see the proof in the pudding. Customers demand the truth, and they can sniff out dishonesty from a mile away. So, be open about your brand, products, and values. Authenticity is the name of the game, and consumers appreciate it more than ever.This means every strategy should be hyper-focused on personalization. Gone are the days of generic, one-size-fits-all marketing campaigns. Now, it's all about making your customers feel like each message was created just for them.Using data, we can personalize our marketing efforts to each customer, delivering a more unique and tailored experience. This not only improves customer satisfaction but also drives more sales and revenue for businesses.

79,"If You Forget About Lead Gen, You Can Forget About Growth","Nov 17, 2023",Matt Sunshine,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/if-you-forget-about-lead-gen-you-can-forget-about-growth/313261,"
What's the worst thing that can happen if you buy weak leads from a questionable source? New York City real estate broker Nathan Horne almost found out.Horne's employer, The Corcoran Group, focused on branding instead of strategic lead generation. So, when Horne called someone he thought was a hot lead, he got the surprise of his life. Instead of a potential buyer, the police detective who answered the phone made a veiled threat about having a gun and being willing to use it.Fortunately, Horne received only a verbal scolding and not something more dangerous. It turns out there's a whole underground world of companies that specialize in lead generation, but those in the broker business—like Horne—have discovered that these businesses not only provide poor leads, but also occasionally flirt with illegal activity (like lead dilution, acquiring leads by dubious means or, in Horne's case, providing fake leads that can lead to irritated recipients).



En route, Horne learned a big lesson: If your company doesn't have successful lead generation, you're putting your business's future at risk—not to mention leaving your team hesitant to pick up the phone and call an untested lead.Move beyond your personal spider webWhy do so many companies fall into a trap that keeps them from focusing on their lead generation? Call it the spider web effect.


When founders begin their organizations, they work their own networks first. Eventually, they tap out these personal spiderwebs and neglect to move beyond them. Instead, they delve into everyday operations and forget to keep bringing new prospects in the door. And if someone brings up the notion of organized lead generation? A succinct ""we aren't ready for that yet"" usually stops the conversation.To outsiders, this may seem shocking. Yet it's common, particularly among lifestyle businesses large enough to allow their owners to prosper just enough. Those types of organizations weren't created to scale; they were created to provide an income for the entrepreneurial C-suite folks.Is it any wonder that so many commercial establishments closed down after the founders retired?You can get out of the ""no lead gen"" rutOur own company started similarly 35 years ago. For 25 years, lead generation was a passing fancy. Customers came but weren't wooed. And while we enjoyed growth in that time, little of it came through a solid lead generation strategy (because, to be frank, we didn't have one).


Thus, a decade ago, we decided to align our lead generation and marketing tactics. And we've grown phenomenally ever since, like the 90 percent of other businesses that have made similar decisions, according to CSO Insights.Of course, some companies ardently say they want to get bigger, but they're not necessarily following a wise map, either. Far too many bring in outside salespeople to make cold calls. That's not a lead-generation tactic; it's a cold-calling one. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't, but it's always a tough way to scale.The best strategy? Hire amazing salespeople and supplement what they naturally do with a content-driven lead-generation protocol. Without this kind of commitment, even the most exciting organization with the highest potential can run the risk of not hitting revenue goals, frustrating the heck out of amazing sales professionals and not closing deals due to lack of appointments.Stay ahead of the competitionUnless you like the idea of falling behind the competition, you owe it to your company to make lead generation a priority by developing a thorough content marketing campaign. Constant content creation and dissemination ensures you won't be scrambling for prospective buyers.


The more consistent you are, the better your returns: Orbit Media says that nearly half of bloggers who put time and effort into blogging make money. HubSpot concurs, noting that busy blogs offering at least 16 posts every month can expect traffic to triple, as opposed to their barely there blogging counterparts.Ready to begin? Here are the rules:1. Go to your customersStart at your heart by surveying your clients about what they want to know, what they read, how they think and where they hang out when they're not buying your merchandise or services.Their answers will help drive content. At the same time, ask your salespeople and customer service personnel what they're constantly being asked. They'll happily share everything they've heard, and you can turn their responses into content topics later. The more research you do up-front, the better your plan will be.


Although this should be an ongoing task, plan on about 30 days to get a head start. Evaluate the feedback to use the information innovatively. Ironically, that's what SurveyMonkey did. It sent out surveys to users to make its brand more attractive. As a SurveyMonkey enthusiast, I'm pleased to see the company utilizing its own offerings to improve.2. Devise your plan of attackOpen a Google Doc or grab a piece of paper. Then, clearly write down what you plan to do in terms of content creation. Just as you wouldn't start a business without a proposal or route, don't jump into speaking engagements, blogging, ebooks, webinars or any other content production without forethought.What will your plan look like? That's up to what you discover. Mine included a mission to produce only educational content, not promotional pieces. As the one spearheading everything, I worked during ""off"" hours on fulfillment to get traction. Now, our team is all on board because we're able to track how effective our content is month over month.3. Share your trade secretsDon't gasp at the thought of sharing your expertise. It's not your grandmother's famous cookie dough recipe, after all. If you don't offer anything valuable through your content, you're just sending out sales pitches. Instead of treating readers, viewers and listeners like droids, craft intriguing items that provide insider knowledge.


Through this approach, you'll humanize your efforts. In the eyes of the public, you'll be seen as a partner. This will lower readers' defenses and promote honest engagement. In addition, you'll set up your content creators to be thought leaders. For example, at Influence & Co., a content marketing agency we work with, CEO John Hall has made being honest his mantra with significant reputation-boosting and profit-generating results.4. Create accountability for maximum resultsObviously, you'll want to measure your success, to determine how well your lead generation is working. Why not start by developing a service-level agreement (SLA) between the sales and marketing departments? An SLA defines each team's role in sharing and ensures important information won't be lost in translation.In addition, have key performance indicators in place. The KPIs can be tracked by spreadsheets and monitored routinely. At our company, we consistently investigate which content is bringing in the most leads. That's an actionable approach and puts everyone on the same page.The time is nowWondering whether the time is right to strike on this type of lead gen venture? It is, hands down. As the old adage says, ""A good plan today is better than a great plan tomorrow."" The faster you get a process in place, the faster you'll see those golden returns.

80,He Used To Train Horses. Now His Business Does $11 Million In Annual Revenue.,"Nov 16, 2023",Kim Kavin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/he-used-to-train-horses-now-his-business-does-11-million/464708,"
Back when Jeffrey Bell was a horse trainer hanging around racetracks all the time, his father-in-law poked at him to ""get a real job."" His father-in-law had a friend who sold franchises, so Bell got familiar with the business model. In 2010, he took the leap and bought a Floor Coverings International franchise in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.Today, Bell is the company's top franchisee — largely, he says, because he got out of his own way.""At some point, I really believed I was the best at everything,"" he says. ""But if that's true, you better be a heart surgeon. I had to hire salespeople, and people to help grow my residential, and people to grow my commercial. There are franchises that are one person, but what I'm doing is different. It's not a one-man-band.""Related: Exploring Expansion Strategies for Franchise Success, From Goals to Growth



Floor Coverings International expects to close out the year with 250 locations, and Bell's operation is on track to do $11 million in sales. But according to CEO Tom Wood, that's in part because Bell looks outside his home franchise for inspiration. ""One of his mentors is a franchise owner over at California Closets who is doing $40 million this year,"" Wood says. ""That's who Jeffrey makes sure he talks to a couple times a year to think about the next level.""Here, Bell shares three more of his success strategies.1. Focus on ""Who, Not How""Floor Coverings International sends franchise owners books to read. Most recently, it was Who, Not How, by Dan Sullivan. Bell agrees with one of the book's core lessons: ""If you hire a good salesperson or a good marketing person, you don't have to figure out the 'how.' They know the 'how.' You, as the franchise owner, just need to figure out the 'who.' I have employees who have been with me from the day I started. They were the 'who.' They knew the 'how'… If I have the right people, I can leave 80 percent of my people alone.""

""My marketing was me going into a bar and introducing myself to people,"" he says with a laugh. But he's adapted to some of today's data-driven realities. ""We do things like geofencing, which is when you do a job and capture the IP addresses of all their neighbors to try and sell them too,"" Bell says. ""If you walk into a flooring store with your phone in your hand, I can capture that, and the next time you go online, you'll see a banner ad for my store. I know it's creepy, but it's the world we're living in.""3. Build Up Repeat BusinessBell says 80 percent of the $11 million he'll do this year is from repeat-relationship customers. It might be a disaster-restoration company that comes back to him again and again for flooring. It might be residential customers who give him a reference, or do another project. ""When I look at franchises that are struggling, 95 percent of them come from paid-for leads. They're coming from marketing and advertising,"" he says. ""That's OK in your first year. It may be OK in your second or third year. But if that's how it is in your fourth year, if you have no repeat business, you're doing something wrong.""Related: She Competed On The U.S. Olympic Swim Team Before Becoming This Brand's Top Franchisee. Here's Her Winning Business Strategy.Franchisor perspectiveFloor Coverings International was bought in 2005, and CEO Tom Wood says Bell's approach to business exemplifies the operational changes the new owners want to see.


""Franchising in the 1990s, especially in home improvement, is what I would call man-in-a-van franchising. It was one guy, one truck, you worked from home,"" Wood says. ""But we had a vision to transform Floor Coverings International into an executive franchise. Bell has learned that business leaders, top performers, will always find a way to grow — and to grow profitably.""The home-improvement category is struggling this year compared to the pandemic boom years of 2020 and 2021, Wood says, but Bell is figuring out ways to keep advancing the business.""Jeff knows he might not grow 20 percent this year,"" Wood says, ""but he's sure as heck going to figure out how to grow 10 percent.""

81,"To Maximize Your Profits This Black Friday, You Need to Collect More Than Your Customers Dollars","Nov 14, 2023",Gene Marks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/to-maximize-your-profits-this-black-friday-you-need-to/464741,"
Black Friday — the day after Thanksgiving — is the biggest shopping day of the year and the start of the holiday season, which, for many retailers, can contribute as much as 30% of their annual sales. So it's a big day. But if you think Black Friday is just about the holiday season, you're wrong.Of course, the day is important for the holidays. Black Friday was the biggest day for in-store shopping in the U.S. in 2022, reaching 72.9 million consumers, up almost 15% year over year. But it's just as important for after the holidays. That's because Black Friday isn't just about sales. It's really about data.My smartest clients know this. And they make it a priority to leverage Black Friday as a way to collect as much information as they can from everyone entering their store. Why? Because the data they collect will help drive sales long after the holidays have ended.



Retailers of all sizes face a significant drop-off in sales after the holidays, and it's always a struggle to generate demand. But it doesn't have to be that way. The data you collect from your Black Friday traffic can boost your sales in those slow winter months. So, how to do this? You need a reason for the customer to stay engaged.For starters, collect an email at checkout. Asking for a ""like"" or a positive online review is great, but you're not collecting data that way. Asking for an email is a way for you to control the engagement. It's true that sometimes some won't want to share, and that's fine, too, because people have to opt in if you're going to market to them online. So encourage them. Say that you'll add them to your special ""VIP Customer Club,"" which will make them eligible to receive future discounts and special promotions. Some retailers ask if a customer would like a receipt emailed, and that's another good way to collect that information.


Another strategy is to push your visitors to your website. Hopefully, you're selling your products not just in your store but also via an ecommerce platform. If you don't, you really should because my most successful clients sell products through multiple channels. On Black Friday, offer a special promotion for customers who choose to purchase products online or special products that are only offered online. When someone buys from you online, you're collecting their data, and you can give them the option to have their email added to your VIP club at checkout. At the very least, you'll be collecting physical shipping/ordering data that can be used for future postcard mailings.Consider a raffle. It's simple and old school, but it's an effective way to collect an email address or physical mailing address. Have them drop a business card or fill out a form to get a product or service for free and, of course, ask on that form for permission to add to your VIP Club. Your cost of giving away free stuff is minimal compared to the benefit of using that data for future marketing.Many of my retail clients do events. These are the businesses that generally offer experiences or lifestyle products, and they enjoy doing in-store events to further educate their community. The pandemic taught us that doing these events online can also work. Schedule an event for January or February and promote it in your store. People would need to sign up for this event, so have an online or physical way to do this in order to capture their information.Partner with others. All of the above activities can be replicated by friends of yours on the Main Street. By offering co-promotions with some of them, you can pool your resources and share your data. This way, you can potentially double the amount of information you're collecting on Black Friday.


Finally, use a loyalty program. The suggestions I've made above would incur minimal cost. But if you want to step things up - and pay more — you can subscribe to retail loyalty platforms like Clutch, Recharge, Smile.io and others. These platforms — which are mainly designed for mobile use — allow your customers to accumulate points, get access to gift cards, belong to a recurring program, join certain membership tiers and take advantage of VIP ""exclusive"" offerings. They provide real-time data analysis of program usage, can be customized, and also integrate with other software.These are all great ways to collect the data you need. But the most important thing is what to do with the data once you have it. And for this, you need a good customer relationship management (CRM) program.A CRM is merely a database that will store whatever information you obtain about anyone who's walked into your store. Some loyalty platforms and most point-of-sale systems either offer this capability or can be integrated with a standalone CRM system, and there are many platforms available at an affordable price. You will use this database to build demographics and sales history about your customers.When a CRM system is used the right way, no customer — or prospective customer — falls through the cracks. Using the data you've collected on Black Friday and throughout the holiday season, they should be receiving regular (opt-in) emails or postcards from you about product offerings, events or other activities at your store. You can leverage the data to target specific customers based on what they've purchased from you. You can use the data to create lookalike campaigns on both Facebook and Google, where you can target online ads directly to them. As you build this database, you'll build a community of customers that you can go back to year after year.


And that's the most important thing about Black Friday. It's not just one day of sales. It's also a day to collect data for future sales. If you approach it that way, you'll see a revenue increase that can extend far beyond the holiday season.

83,AI Increases Worker Productivity By 14% — That's Why Embracing It in This Key Area Will Make Your Business Stronger.,"Nov 3, 2023",Kelsey Raymond,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/embracing-ai-will-make-your-business-stronger-heres/463737,"
Artificial intelligence provides businesses with a way to unclog bottlenecks and execute their value propositions as efficiently and effectively as possible.Take the hubbub around ChatGPT, for example. With a simple prompt, AI can craft a script, a blog post or an academic paper with at least most of the necessary components. According to Botco.ai, 73% of businesses they surveyed have harnessed the power of generative AI to produce various forms of content.For organizations that invest a lot in corporate communication and marketing, this sounds like a dream come true. Type a few lines and AI does the heavy lifting. No need to break the bank by hiring pricy vendors or setting up an in-house content squad. It's like a content creation fairytale, right?



Here's the catch: Creating truly engaging content takes more than a few clicks in an AI tool. It demands a smart business strategy tailored to your specific goals and objectives. Even as more companies begin to defer some of their efforts to AI, that kind of expertise still needs to be human.Related: Writing Content With AI Won't Help You Win Against Google Search Rankings. Here's Why.


Adding a human touch to AI content creationAlthough AI undoubtedly excels in terms of speed and bulk content creation, it's crucial to recognize the potential pitfalls that can emerge when entrusting the entire content creation process to AI.First, there's the issue of planning. Regardless of your industry, content goes far beyond being a mere collection of words on a page; it's a strategic endeavor that requires careful consideration. Crafting an effective content strategy involves creating an editorial calendar, which entails much more than just selecting dates and establishing a posting schedule. An editorial calendar takes into account myriad variables, such as content types, timeliness, cadence and more. While AI can assist in certain aspects, it has its limitations in comprehensively managing all of these interlocking aspects.Second, if you opt to use an AI tool, quality control is the true indispensable role of humans when it comes to AI content creation. While AI can indeed generate content, it isn't very useful without a human hand to guide and refine it. This human element provides crucial details related to previous articles published, incorporating timely hooks and ensuring alignment with the preferred tone of voice and in-house style. Speaking of style, there's also the critical task of reviewing and editing AI-generated content for plagiarism and consistency.Related: 3 Principles for Scaling Content With AI Without Sacrificing Quality


Teamwork makes the dream workGenerative AI solutions aren't the enemy; they're a valuable asset that can streamline aspects of your content creation process. However, to harness their true potential, partnering with knowledgeable humans is key. If you're looking for a partner to help enhance your AI content creation efforts, here are some considerations to keep in mind:1. Don't say 'yes' to a hard noAccording to a survey by Salesforce, AI is making some serious headway in the world of content creation. It found that marketers use generative AI for basic content creation (76%), copywriting (76%) and more. Those surveyed also predicted that generative AI would save them five hours of work every week. So, while AI might still seem like a bit of a wild card in some areas, the pros of teaming up with AI for content far outweigh the cons.However, a word of caution: If you come across a potential partner who's allergic to the idea of AI, that's a red flag. Whether it's ChatGPT lending a hand with outlining content or Grammarly performing some baseline editing magic, AI has carved out its spot in the content creation world. So, when you're chatting with agencies or potential partners, ask them how they're making AI a part of their workflow. If they say, ""We're not using it yet, but we're on the lookout for ways to weave it in naturally,"" that's a good sign they're forward-thinking.2. Don't stop at the what — ask the how, tooAccording to the Botco.ai study, nearly half of the people they talked to — 49%, to be precise — said AI had a hand in shaping their final content. How AI helps the content creation process can differ from one company to another, but when you're considering a potential partner, you've got to ask them to spill the beans on how they're specifically using AI.


If they're just starting to dip their toes into the AI pool, throw them a curveball and ask where they're planning to use it in their content creation process. Alternatively, if they're already using AI extensively, find out which parts of the content creation journey it's lending a hand in. And here's a little pro tip: Pay extra attention if they mention using AI for plagiarism checks. In a world overflowing with content, having AI play detective for copied text is as close to perfection as you can hope for.Speaking of perfection (or being far from it), we recently put our team and ChatGPT to the test by having them write the same article. We found pretty quickly that AI had a nasty habit of using hypothetical stats instead of real ones. Fortunately, that's exactly why the human touch is essential. A human can verify facts and add an extra layer of credibility, which is why your preferred partner must ensure a human touch is included in their content creation process.Related: AI Wrote Half of This Article. Here's Why Entrepreneurs Should Take Note3. Don't forget about KPIsAI isn't just good for the company bank account; it's a game-changer for your employees, too. A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that access to AI increases worker productivity by 14%, and it can help employees multitask and handle more complicated questions faster.


Now that's some pretty clear success right there, but success can look different for everyone. So, when you're teaming up with a company that's riding the AI wave, you've got to speak the same success language. Is it all about keyword rankings? Or maybe it's all about the clicks and conversions? Or even worse, what if Google wakes up tomorrow and decides to throw a penalty flag on AI-generated content? Are you ready to pivot like a pro if that happens? Fortunately, by keeping a close eye on KPIs, you can be ready to switch gears if you notice your rankings starting to slip.Ultimately, the secret sauce to thriving in the age of AI-powered content is teaming up with a savvy, open-minded and results-driven partner who's got your back. Blend the magic of automation with the expertise of a proven agency, and you've got yourself a recipe for content success.

84,How I Eliminated the Sales Funnel By Focusing On This One Business Strategy,"Nov 2, 2023",Nathan Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-eliminate-the-sales-funnel/464214,"
As entrepreneurs, you know how challenging it is to prospect new clients. It is often the most challenging part of running a successful business. Finding the right sales strategy to meet your business needs and objectives can take time and effort.You've probably gone through various iterations of trial and error, from cold calling to email campaigns, experimenting with a mix of strategies rooted in the traditional sales model. While the conventional sales funnel works for many businesses, it's not the only approach. You can tailor or even eliminate the sales funnel, the route we chose for Rentec Direct, the property management software company I founded. The traditional sales model didn't make sense for us, so we focused on service instead of sales.Before I dive in, below is an overview of the typical sales funnel that most companies rely on:



Awareness: A prospect becomes aware of your business and its products and services, perhaps through an advertisement, Facebook post or Google search.Interest: A prospect gathers more information about your company by visiting your website, reading a case study, or signing up for your newsletter.Decision: A prospect decides whether or not to buy your product or service. Many companies entice customers by offering a promotion or discount code.Action: A prospect buys your product or service. Many companies offer training, education and support at this final stage.Related: How I Built a Sales Funnel That Generates Over $80 MillionThe typical sales process also includes a lot of cold calls and prospecting through third parties. Through trial and error of the above, we discovered what worked for our business. We realized we were losing people at the top of the funnel when we didn't establish that relationship early on. That's when we shifted to building customer relationships at the very beginning through our free two-week trial, onboarding and training programs. As soon as a potential customer signs up for our trial, a dedicated account specialist reaches out to walk the prospect through the account setup process, provide step-by-step training, and go over how to access helpful resources on our blog to get the most out of the user experience. This personalized approach might seem like a high overhead to invest in a trial client who has yet to pay for the service, but we've found that the additional attention is of significant value to these new users.


By focusing on service instead of sales, we no longer engage in prospecting. Instead, we meet our clients with what they need, proactively scheduling meetings to ensure they get set up correctly on our software. This approach stands out from competitors, allowing clients to ask questions early on and access resources at no additional cost. Consequently, we've built trust, resulting in more referrals and long-term relationships, with many clients staying with us for over a decade!Here is an example of that approach in action. We worked with a California landlord struggling with manual rent collection. She knew she needed to automate but didn't know where to start. After a friend recommended us, she signed up for a free trial. Our account specialist contacted her when she signed up to set up her account and train her on automating rent payments. This one-on-one assistance helped her increase efficiency in minutes and gave her the confidence to incorporate the software into her daily routine. Soon after, she became a client. This personalized approach laid the foundation for a long-term relationship.Related: 7 Mistakes to Avoid in Your Sales FunnelBelow is the framework that we use to focus less on sales and more on service, which may be helpful for your business, too:


Build relationships early: Build trust early with potential new clients through an educational blog.Offer a free trial or demo: Give potential customers a chance to experience your product or service before committing to a purchase. Like in the use case above, the customer decreased her time processing rent in minutes, demonstrating the value of our software.Provide proactive customer service: Learning a new technology can be overwhelming, and knowing where to turn to get the right help can be tricky. Don't wait for your customers to come to you with questions or issues. Instead, offer assistance before they ask, showing that you are invested in their success early on.To summarize, focusing on service instead of sales has been a game-changer for our business. By providing this early support and training, we have built lasting relationships with our clients and have grown our business. It sets both parties up for long-term success and is worth a trial if you want a new sales approach.

85,Silent Signals — How Top Sellers Anticipate Customer Needs,"Nov 2, 2023",C. Lee Smith,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-top-sellers-anticipate-customer-needs/464276,"
Only 54% of sales professionals go beyond selling their product and help buyers solve a problem or achieve a goal, according to our 2023 SalesFuel survey of B2B decision-makers. The best of what's left will ask smart discovery questions to figure out how to help.The elite sales pros, however, the ones who are the most valuable trusted advisors to their customers, can anticipate their needs and stay ahead of the curve. They know how to practically read their customers' minds.I first learned about the importance of this from the father of a woman I was dating. This woman was special, and I knew I wanted to marry her. First, I had to make it through the difficult conversation with her father. Fortunately, he gave his permission, along with some advice. He told me, ""You need to learn to read her mind."" When I replied I wasn't a mind reader, he repeated his advice but didn't elaborate.



Though it took me a while, I figured out what my father-in-law meant. I needed to understand my future wife so well that I could practically read her mind. This advice has also served me well in business.Now, more than ever, buying decisions made by customers and prospects involve multiple people. Our research shows that buyers are checking out sellers long before they make initial contact.


To understand what's on the minds of your customers, you need to track the activities of several types of buying influencers.Related: 3 Ways to Read Your Customers' MindsWhat their CEO is sayingYour knowledge-building process should start with what their company's CEO is saying, because what's important to him/her becomes important to their employees and purchasing decision-makers. In smaller organizations, no purchasing takes place without the approval of the CEO. Sellers too often ignore the CEO, believing them to be beyond reach.You may not be able to reach them, but you can educate yourself about their thoughts and activities. Start by conducting a simple online search on the CEO to learn where they've been quoted and where they've appeared publicly. You can also identify the CEO's opinion on key business issues by reading the articles they post on their LinkedIn account.


What their buying team is doingThe employees on your customer's buying team will be downloading position papers and signing up for webinars. They may also be visiting specific pages on your website. Using the right tracking tools, you'll see the topics that interest them and have further insight into what is on their minds.What their customers are saying (and doing)Your market research on the customer's typical buyer, their priorities and behavior can help you understand who they ultimately need to satisfy. In addition, every business wants to know what customers think of their product or service. Checking out the online reviews by customers is mandatory because you must understand your prospect's reputation as part of your effort to read their mind.What similar customers of yours are sayingIf similar customers of yours in the same industry are experiencing a specific challenge, such as a supply-chain problem, your customer might be as well. You can speak authoritatively by introducing the topic with a phrase such as, ""Some of my other accounts tell me…"" Be careful to avoid any specifics that might breach confidentiality.Related: How to Understand Customer Needs


What industry experts are sayingYour customer's buyers may not be actively posting comments or articles about the latest trends in their industry, a situation that will make mind-reading a challenging proposition. You can improve your competitive position by tapping into the content produced by industry experts. Reading industry websites and blogs and listening to podcasts and vlogs allows you to identify the changes that are taking place, along with the pace of those changes. You'll also learn what your customer's competitors are doing.With this information, you know what should be on your customer's mind, and you'll sound knowledgeable when you include a reference to the latest product launch or industry merger in your initial email message or during casual conversation.What their marketing people are sayingThis content reveals what they want the public to know about them. You should know it, too. Start with their website and their blog. Check LinkedIn for what they want other businesses to know. Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and other social media indicate what they are communicating to prospects and customers.The proofWe listen to our clients about why they buy our products. We also survey their customers to find out what they ultimately need to help them succeed. These steps are not always enough to give us transparency into our customers' minds.


When one of our smallest clients casually mentioned that they were using our proprietary research to be more credible with their clients, I perceived a way to anticipate needs and develop an opportunity. Because many business professionals seek — but are not sure how — to obtain credibility.By listening to clients and projecting industry trends, we foresaw that today's sales professionals navigate an increasingly competitive business climate where decision-making happens online and where buyers form opinions about sellers based on what they discover online. This online discovery process makes it crucial for sellers to possess sterling credibility.To meet the need for enhanced credibility, we introduced a new product line, and I started writing my second book on sales credibility. Our buyers now have the tools they need to optimize their online presence and their credibility. Through our SalesCred product, they also learn how to read their prospects' minds.Nothing shows a customer that you care more than when you deliver a product or service before they have fully envisioned it. These people will not always openly share their thoughts. But if you are observant, attentive and caring, you can learn to read their minds. Maybe that's why my father-in-law was such a good salesperson back in his day.

86,How to Turn Every Employee into a Sales Superstar,"Oct 27, 2023",Cynthia Kay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-ways-to-turn-every-employee-into-a-sales-master/463990,"
I admit it. For years, I hated the idea of selling. In fact, I turned down sales jobs. However, when I started my own business, it became a priority. Most small business owners love what they do. They enjoy developing the product or service. They love doing the work and are excited when someone buys what they make. Selling-not so much. Over the years, I have changed my attitude. I don't sell. I don't need to. Instead, I have conversations with clients. I ask questions. I listen and offer ideas. In short, I educate and consult.But I am not the only one who sells at my company. In fact, selling is everyone's job. Why? It is simple. When you run a small business, you do not have a machine to grind out leads, vet them, and close the deal. You need every person on your team to generate business for the company. Not to mention selling your company to potential employees and partners. Skeptical? Don't be. Even the most introverted person can sell with a little bit of help. Here is how to turn every employee into a sales superstar.Related: Why AI Won't Replace (Great) Salespeople



1. Develop business literacyEngaged employees are good for business. In many cases, it's why they choose to work for a small business, where there is more opportunity to be hands-on. We need to ensure employees understand the business — all parts — not just their individual roles.In my organization, this means having an employee shadow someone to learn more about the process. We routinely do a debrief so employees know what we are working on. We show how we quote jobs and the financial picture. In other words, we are constantly educating. We also encourage questions and ideas. When employees understand the business, they are more comfortable talking about it and can sell others on the organization.


2. Ramp up communication skillsThink presentation and communication training is just for supervisors or employees on the fast track to promotions? I say no, and it comes from experience. I have developed and presented communication seminars for various individuals, from people on the plant floor to frontline call center workers, sales trainees, and company CEOs. Want to energize your team? Help them develop personally and professionally? Create a bond with your company?One way is to invest in them by offering communication workshops. This shows employees you care enough to provide an opportunity to learn new skills and connect with others. Those skills come into play in day-to-day interactions and conversations. Remember I said I don't sell; have conversations. Your employees' conversations are just as important, if not more important, to selling your products and services. They are on the front lines and may discover customer needs before anyone else does. If they are good communicators, they can spot the opportunity and then connect customers to the right source.Related: Why Every Employee in Your Company Should Have Communication Training3. Share your sales toolkitIf you want employees to help champion your efforts, they need to understand your sales and marketing toolkit. What strategies are you using to grow the business? Show them how you present the company brand to customers. They connect their work with the end result by helping them get familiar with all of your sales tools. Use company meetings or gatherings to feature company videos, display marketing collateral or demonstrate new products. You can also send links for employees to watch presentations or take part in webinars.


Related: 15 Strategies for Quickly Expanding Your Business4. Give employees facetimeFor a long time, business owners or salespeople were the face of the company. That's because many are under the false impression the person with the title is the best one to communicate or sell. That is not necessarily the case. Today, progressive companies are looking to broaden their efforts and feature employees at every level of the organization in critical communications, from recruitment to customer sales.I like to involve employees in meetings with clients. First, they listen and observe. Later, we discuss how the meeting was conducted and the strategy. The next step is to have them participate in a targeted way. Employees who participate or are featured in customer interactions have a more intense connection to the company. They are proud of their work and love to serve up their expertise. For example, have them share a story about how they built a product. Ask them to describe a process or give them a ""tour"" of your facility.Confidence comes from ability, and ability comes from practicing or doing a task. When you give real people facetime, it is a powerful sales tactic.


5. Offer rewards and recognitionDo employees value recognition? Yes. In fact, Gallup and Workhuman have research that shows there is a direct correlation between employee recognition and business outcomes. That is why it makes sense to recognize employees who take part in customer meetings, sales efforts or employee recruitment.I love to do a ""shout-out"" during a company huddle and share details about how the employee helped make an impression or close a sale. If you have a company communication, feature them. As for rewards, there are options. You can send employees home early on a Friday or give them an extra day off. Gift cards are popular. Bonuses are even better.

88,From Setback to Success — 4 Ways to Turn Your Struggles into Resilience,"Oct 16, 2023",Henri Al Helaly,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-strategies-to-turn-hard-times-into-resilience/462847,"
Embarking on an entrepreneurial journey is like navigating an uncharted sea. Each wave, whether towering or serene, adds a unique dimension to the odyssey. Highs and lows, crescendos and silences have marked my journey. But in every phase, two constants have remained — resilience and leadership. Here's a deeper dive into my voyage, where failures morphed into pillars of success and team dynamics constantly reshaped my leadership philosophy.Related: Positivity is Provocative — 3 Ways to Embrace Optimism in a Negative World1. The early stumble lays the groundwork for a robust enterpriseWhen I stepped into the entrepreneurial arena, my vision was clear, and my ambition was soaring. But unforeseen challenges often eclipse passion. My initial enterprise encountered turbulent waters, compelling me to introspect. Rather than dampening my spirit, this period became a masterclass in resilience. I assimilated the essence of adaptability, honed my strategy formulation skills and learned the art of converting challenges into opportunities.



I vividly recall a particular incident during the early days of my startup. We had secured our first major client, a deal that promised significant traction for our fledgling business. My team and I had spent countless hours preparing our pitch and proposal. On the day of the presentation, however, an unexpected system glitch nearly jeopardized everything. The client was visibly frustrated, and the weight of that moment felt suffocating. I felt like we had lost our big break.But as they say, it's not about how hard you fall but how quickly you get up. Taking a deep breath, I navigated the situation with transparency and honesty. I apologized to the client, explained the situation and offered a contingency plan. To my surprise, they appreciated our integrity and gave us another chance. That moment taught me that while expertise is crucial, integrity and adaptability are the bedrock of long-term success.Related: 5 Ways to Adapt to Change and Build a More Resilient Business Model


2. The ascent: Juggling diverse leadership hatsReinvigorated, I began my ascent, initially with a tight-knit team of two. Inspired by narratives like Google's growth story, we expanded, eventually celebrating the milestone of 100 team members. Leading such a diverse ensemble was akin to orchestrating a symphony. Each individual brought unique strengths and perspectives to the table. My role transcended managing tasks; it involved nurturing aspirations, fostering collaborative spirits and ensuring each voice echoed our collective vision.Related: 10 Simple Ways to Build a Collaborative, Successful Work Environment3. Rekindling the essence of team dynamicsIn an industry replete with volatility, there came a phase where I found myself back with a core team of 10. This phase was a golden opportunity for introspection and rejuvenation. A smaller team meant more profound interactions, closer collaborations and a return to our foundational ethos. It reemphasized the significance of a shared vision, strengthening our foundation for the challenges ahead.I remember gathering everyone in the old conference room – the very room where years ago, with a similar small team, we'd charted out our initial goals. The nostalgia was palpable. We reminisced about those days when lunch breaks meant everyone huddling together, sharing stories and occasionally debating the best pizza toppings. It wasn't just about work but forging bonds and understanding each individual's dreams and fears.


This phase was a golden opportunity for introspection and rejuvenation. A smaller team meant more profound interactions, closer collaborations and a return to our foundational ethos. Over coffee and late-night brainstorming sessions, we revisited our roots. We discussed what initially inspired us, what we hoped to achieve, and what had changed along the way.One evening, around a makeshift campfire on our office terrace, Alex, our lead developer, shared a touching story of his father, a small-town carpenter who always emphasized the importance of crafting things with love and dedication. That story became our metaphor – regardless of the size or scale, everything we built henceforth would be with the same passion and precision.It reemphasized the significance of a shared vision, strengthening our foundation for the challenges ahead. As the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the camaraderie within our compact unit grew. We became more than just colleagues; we became a family, committed to our shared purpose and each other's success.Related: Want to Improve Workplace Efficiency? Improve Your Team Dynamics First.


4. Marching forward: Resilience as the beaconEach chapter of my entrepreneurial story enriched me, infusing invaluable lessons. Whether it was steering a burgeoning team or recalibrating strategies amidst setbacks, resilience emerged as my guiding star. I believe leadership is an amalgamation of tenacity, adaptability and vision.Looking back on my own journey, I realize it's an intricate tapestry of failures and successes, of setbacks and leaps forward. Yet, the most profound lessons I've gathered aren't from the successes but from the failures, the stumbles and the moments of doubt. It's from the silence after a storm, where reflection yields clarity, and from the understanding that leadership isn't about commanding but inspiring.For fellow entrepreneurs navigating this multifaceted realm, I'd like to offer some distilled wisdom:Embrace Failure as a Teacher: Failures aren't the end; they're the bends in your entrepreneurial road. Each setback is a lesson in disguise. Take, for instance, the narrative of Steve Jobs. His ousting from Apple, a company he co-founded, could have been the end. But he returned with a bang, leading Apple to its golden era.Stay Agile and Adaptable: The business world is in flux, and the ability to adapt can be your greatest asset. Embracing flexibility ensures you remain in sync with market dynamics and customer needs.Invest in Relationships: Beyond strategies and business models, it's the relationships - with your team, partners, customers, and even competitors - that define your entrepreneurial journey.Prioritize Mental and Physical Well-being: The demands of entrepreneurship can be overwhelming. Prioritizing self-care ensures you're at your best - both for your business and for yourself.Never Stop Learning: The entrepreneurial realm evolves rapidly. Continuous learning, be it through courses, seminars, or simply being attuned to market shifts, ensures you stay ahead of the curve.To wrap up, entrepreneurship is less a destination and more a journey. It's about charting your unique path through trials and triumphs. The experiences you gather define your business but also, more importantly, shape the entrepreneur and leader within you. Embrace the voyage, for in its challenges lie the greatest rewards.

89,Nail That Sale — Top 10 One-Liners to Go From Salesperson to Trusted Advisee,"Oct 3, 2023",Mikey Lucas,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/top-10-one-liners-to-go-from-salesperson-to-trusted-advisee/462338,"
Sales is an art form. It requires techniques, skills and A LOT of practice. The thing about sales is that there are key opportunities in the sale called ""golden moments."" The golden moment is the point where your sale can go one of two ways: really good or really bad! The key is to know the right thing to say at these crucial times — and often, it isn't what you would expect.When you're in the depths of a sale, there is a lot of pressure building between you and your potential customer. Your job as the seller is to release this pressure for them. How do you do that? Reverse psychology. As a natural part of the sale, you and the customer are positioned on two opposing ends. To overcome this, you need to join them on their side. Step out of the salesperson position, and think, reason and talk like them. Want to see how to achieve this? Let's jump into my top 10 one-liners to make the golden moment yours.Related: 8 Simple Keys to Becoming a Better Salesperson



1. Acknowledge past hesitations""Obviously, you would've (insert action of your sale) if it was right for you.""Here's the deal, people have reservations, and it's crucial to acknowledge them upfront. It demonstrates respect for their judgment and decisions, and it creates an environment of mutual understanding. It's not about overriding their concerns but aligning with them to find the best possible solution. Bring a voice to their concerns. Make them valid. The more you hear and reflect your customer's concerns, the more they become open to you.


2. Prize frame technique""I'm not sure if this is going to be a good fit, but we will just have to see.""This one's golden, and it must be done when the sale is going well! It subtly communicates that what you're offering is valuable and desirable, requiring a proper fit. It lets the client know you're as discerning as they are, evaluating if your offering aligns with their needs. This fosters a partnership approach rather than a hard sell. What you're doing here is taking the decision-making from the customer to yourself, strengthening their desire for what you're offering.3. Address the elephant in the room""Everyone wants to save money; I'm just here to ensure this is the right fit for you.""Let's face it, we all want to save a buck or two. By bringing this mutual understanding to light, you're creating an alliance with the customer. It shows that you're not just there to make a quick sale but to genuinely find a fitting solution for them. You are making them feel they're not just a number, but a person to you. Bring this one out early to build transparency and authenticity with your customer after your initial rapport has been established.


4. Tie down the obvious""If I could offer gas for a dollar cheaper per gallon, would you want to know?""Simplicity and relatability are key. Positioning your offering in everyday terms makes it accessible and appealing. You can edit the example to something that is similar to your own sale. It demonstrates to the customer the ""no-brainer"" aspect of the deal you're about to propose. If they're not interested in obvious benefits, they might not be your ideal client. And that's okay! Knowing this early on saves both parties valuable time.5. The pull back""Do you have (insert a problem) that could affect (insert an issue)? We need to assess that."" Maintaining control and creating investment is crucial. By pulling back at the right moments, you're not just throwing in the sale; you're strategically positioning the customer to be part of the process, ensuring they feel valued and heard. You are using reverse psychology here. By pulling back, the customer feels they can trust your word more. Nothing is without problems. If you practice this, you not only take back control of the sale, but you tell your customer ""I am realistic, and this is a sale you can trust.""


Related: 7 No-Brainer Strategies to Close More Sales by Getting Customers to Trust You6. Smile and inform""If you decide this isn't for you, I at least want you to have the right information.""Information is power. A friendly demeanor paired with the provision of valuable information creates a positive interaction, regardless of the outcome. It's about leaving them in a better place than they were before they met you. This one-liner is great at moments when you can see the customer pull back. Like the pull-back liner, this signals to the customer they can trust you. By outlining the value you bring to them, they can see the value in the sale.7. Jump on that bandwagon""Let's see what some of your neighbors are doing and weigh the pros and cons.""


This is about leveraging social proof. People often find comfort and validation in knowing what others are doing, especially their neighbors. It's not about following the crowd but providing a broader perspective and additional reassurance. If the customer doesn't have neighbors to compare, find another group. Perhaps you're selling computers, and students are regular customers of yours. Speak about your customer base as you know them. ""I have many art students come in for this model of computer for design. We should weigh the pros and cons for you.""8. Quick exit for time-wasters""Like I said, I have another appointment.""Time is of the essence. This line allows you to transition away from less serious prospects gracefully. It underscores the value of your time without dismissing theirs, maintaining professionalism and respect. Re-emphasize the fact you have said this before. It helps you to transition out of the dead-end interaction politely and efficiently.9. The pressure relief valve""Yeah, I wouldn't do that either.""


Sometimes, agreeing with a customer's concern is the most effective way to build rapport. It alleviates pressure and shows your human side — that you're not just a sales machine but someone who understands and respects their viewpoints! Say the unexpected. Remember: You need to join the customer on their side of the equation. Walk in their shoes with them, validate their concerns, and make them feel safe. Sometimes all that is needed is to just hear them out.Related: 10 Qualities Separating the Extraordinary Salesperson Apart From the Pack10. Here's the catch""Here's the catch: Most companies don't want you going with (insert product) because of how (insert good attribute) it is.""The key here is to turn the strength of the product into a weakness. This same technique is used in interviews when interviewees need to say a weakness of theirs. Customers always expect a catch! If there isn't one, that is likely a suspicious sale. Make a strength of your product its weakness, and satisfy this expectation of theirs in a way that works for you.


And remember — practice makes perfect! And no two sales are ever the same, even with the same product. With time, you will know the golden moments where you can use these one-liners to go from salesperson to trusted advocate to the customer. Join them, be their friend, and take off the sales hat from time to time. Your transparency and authenticity is the biggest asset you've got, no matter the product!

90,How to Craft a Bulletproof Sales Strategy That Will Survive Any Economy,"Oct 2, 2023",Lewis Schenk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-craft-a-bulletproof-sales-strategy-that-will-survive/458834,"
If you've been on social media or listened to the news recently, you would undoubtedly have heard about the upcoming ""recession."" While I believe a lot of this is simply fear-mongering, there could potentially be some concerns that we may all face, particularly as business owners.As a business owner, you have a lot of pressure on a daily basis. To provide for yourself, your family and your employees and their families. In times like these, one of the most important things you can do is prepare your business for the inevitable ups and downs of the market. While downturns can be difficult to predict and even more challenging to navigate, building a robust sales process can help your business survive even the toughest of times.Here are some tips for building a robust sales process that can help your business survive and thrive, no matter the economy.Related: Here's Why Customer Engagement on Social Media Is Important to Your Brand1. Deeply understand your ideal customerTo navigate through economic downturns, it's imperative to have a profound understanding of your ideal customer. Beyond demographic information, you should comprehend their pain points, challenges and aspirations. Conduct in-depth customer research, gather feedback and create buyer personas that encompass their motivations and behaviors.



By understanding your customers on a deeper level, you can tailor your sales approach to address their specific needs. This not only enhances your value proposition but also establishes trust and credibility. When customers feel heard and understood, they are more likely to choose your products or services, even in challenging economic conditions.2. Establish clear metrics and KPIsA robust sales process relies on clear and measurable metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs). These metrics serve as a compass, guiding your team's efforts and allowing you to track progress effectively. During downturns, having a data-driven approach becomes even more critical.Identify and define KPIs that align with your sales objectives. These may include conversion rates, lead-to-customer ratios, average deal size and sales cycle length. Regularly monitor and analyze these metrics to identify trends and areas for improvement. By having a data-driven sales process, you can quickly adjust strategies and tactics to respond to changing market conditions.Related: How to Determine Your Franchise's KPIs and Achieve Profitability


3. Diversify your efforts: Create additional channelsOverreliance on a single sales channel can leave your business vulnerable during economic downturns. To build resilience, diversify your sales efforts by creating additional channels. Explore both online and offline avenues that align with your target audience and industry.For instance, if your primary sales channel is in-person events, consider expanding into digital marketing, ecommerce or strategic partnerships. Diversification not only expands your reach but also spreads the risk. When one channel faces challenges, others can continue to generate revenue, helping your business weather downturns more effectively.Related: Why E-Commerce Businesses Need to Rethink Their Channel Strategy4. Increase volumeDuring economic downturns, businesses often face the challenge of maintaining revenue streams. In such scenarios, proactively increasing sales volume emerges as a strategic move. At first glance, this approach might appear counterintuitive, especially when consumers are tightening their purse strings. However, by offering special promotions, enticing discounts or value-packed bundled deals, businesses can effectively target and attract price-sensitive customers. These incentives not only drive sales but also ensure a consistent revenue flow, even in challenging times.


To complement this strategy, it's imperative to optimize the efficiency of your sales team. This involves streamlining administrative and sales processes to reduce bottlenecks. Investing in comprehensive training programs and cutting-edge technology can equip your team with the skills and tools they need to excel. Furthermore, empowering salespeople to expand their outreach and tap into a broader audience can open up new revenue channels. By intelligently amplifying your sales initiatives, businesses can counteract potential drops in average deal values and ensure a robust and healthy sales pipeline, ready to weather any economic storm.5. Leverage technology and automationIn an unpredictable economy, leveraging digital tools becomes essential for sales resilience. Integrate customer relationship management (CRM) systems to gain insights into customer behaviors and preferences. These platforms enable your sales team to tailor their approach, prioritize leads and enhance customer interactions. Additionally, consider automating routine tasks like lead scoring and email follow-ups.Automation not only minimizes errors but also allows your team to concentrate on relationship-building and deal-making. With potential limitations on in-person meetings, it's also wise to invest in virtual communication tools. Platforms for video conferencing and virtual demos ensure continuous engagement with clients, bridging any physical gaps. By embracing digital transformation, your business is better positioned to navigate economic uncertainties efficiently.In conclusion, building a robust sales process to thrive during downturns requires a multifaceted approach. Deeply understanding your ideal customer, establishing clear metrics and KPIs, diversifying your sales efforts and increasing volume are all essential components of a resilient sales strategy.

91,This Startup Is Reinventing the Yellow School Bus. Here's Its Playbook for Winning Over the Hardest Customers (Like Public Schools).,"Sep 19, 2023",Liz Brody,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/this-startup-is-reinventing-the-yellow-school-bus-heres/458411,"
How do you drive a big yellow school bus with 70 kids goofing around in the back every day? ""You just gotta tune out the noise,"" shrugs Marllury Urbina, who's been doing it in and around San Francisco for 22 years.She's always loved the job, but it's come with stress. Out the door at 4:50 a.m. every day, she got used to maneuvering hilly city streets with one hand on the wheel while the other held a sheet of paper with directions for changing routes. There were student names to memorize, and antsy moms and dads to please. People always wanted to know — was she late? Did she already come and go? She had no way to communicate with parents, so she just started getting out of the bus and drawing an X in chalk on the ground, as if to say, Yes, the bus was here.Urbina saw the world start to change. Uber coordinated fleets of cars. Google Maps made directions easy. But the school bus industry was stuck using paper and chalk-drawn X's. And then, finally, it seemed progress would come for the buses too — or maybe not?

It could revolutionize Urbina's job with modern technology, if only the company could figure out a way in. But that wouldn't be easy. Yellow buses are part of an old, deeply entrenched, $50 billion global industry of large fleet operators — and to compete against that, Zūm would need to win over the huge, change-resistant, slow-moving bureaucratic public school districts that hire them.This is the moment that kills many innovative companies. Medical brands that can't sell to hospitals. Tech startups that can't get hired by governments. A founder realizes that their outré-clever innovation is worth nothing if it can't lure big customers away from their comfort zone.So, how do you do it? That was Zūm's billion-dollar question — and here is the playbook it came up with to make the sales.Ritu Narayan, who started Zūm to get her daughter from school, says, ""It's all her fault!""Image Credit: Courtesy of ZūmRULE No. 1  Get a toe in the door. Zūm did not set out to conquer impossible enterprise clients. It was born out of a much more personal problem — one that ate at an immigrant mother named Ritu Narayan as she worked inside a cramped cubicle at eBay.


Narayan built a career off defying expectations. She grew up in Delhi, where women did not typically become engineers, but she did — and left for the U.S. at age 24. She worked stints at Oracle, IBM, and Yahoo before running a senior product team at eBay. One day, her daughter's ride from preschool fell through. What was she supposed to do? Drop everything to go pick the kid up? Then it kept happening. Narayan had watched her own mother have to quit her career to raise children. ""And I'm here sitting in the heart of Silicon Valley, which solves any problem,"" she says. ""Why not this one?""So she started building a solution. It was a rideshare service like Uber, but specifically for getting kids around. Maybe the babysitter fell through, and the child needed to be picked up at school or had to go to soccer practice. Parents could use Narayan's app to summon a car, driven by someone who'd gone through intensive background checks and also had childcare experience, and then they'd be able to track it and communicate in real time. The service launched in February 2015, and to name it, Narayan held a little contest among people she knew. As if on cue, a 12-year-old came up with the winning entry: Zūm (pronounced zoom). Narayan's brothers, Vivek and Abhishek Garg, joined as cofounders.Related: 10 Growth Strategies Every Business Owner Should KnowImmediately they discovered that there was a small market for this. Some parents used it for emergencies; others paid for daily or weekly school pickups. There were even a few competitors in the space, including Shuddle, which raised $12.2 million. But Shuddle ultimately folded, and Zūm started looking to acquire more clients.One day, they were chatting with the assistant dean of a local private school, and they learned something interesting: The school was using a big bus to regularly shuttle a few students between its two campuses. Maybe Zūm's drivers could handle this instead for less money? Narayan and Vivek convinced the school to give them a $50,000-a-year contract, and it opened their eyes to the kind of revenue that was immediate and dependable: What if they became a transportation solution for parents via schools?As it turns out, school systems — both private and public — have a need for what's called ""alternate"" transportation, generally jobs not covered by basic yellow school bus service. For example, it might be helping students whose commutes are too long or too challenging for the regular routes to accommodate. Zūm started going after these small contracts, and by the end of 2018 it had several between $50,000 and $1 million.Despite this new line of business, Zūm was still very much the company Narayan originally envisioned. Parents were using the app to get rides for their kids, while the work for school districts was being fulfilled by Zūm drivers in their own cars. But in 2019, Narayan bumped up against the kind of existential question that many entrepreneurs face: What business was she in, and did her old ideas have to fall away to fulfill her company's true potential?Those thoughts started to percolate with one of Zūm's contracts in California's Oakland Unified School District, which paid Zūm $400,000 over three years to transport special education students with especially high needs. After it got going, Narayan was meeting with the transportation director, who walked her into a room where parents were often faxing — yes, in 2019! — their pressing concerns about school bus issues: Did it come yet? Did Tommy get on? Then the director shared how antiquated the bus system was, with walkie- talkies being used to coordinate with drivers. Narayan left that day wondering, If Zūm was transporting 10% to 20% of the kids in its school districts, why not go for 100%? Why not become a full-fledged yellow school bus company — but one wired for safety, efficiency, and user experience, kitted out with ace technology designed by the best engineers they could find?


Narayan started to think through what this would mean. First, there was the question of whether they could even get the big ""100%"" contracts. ""Districts are very hard customers to sell,"" says Narayan. Many of them owned or leased their bus fleets, and only contracted with private vendors for part of their daily transit needs. And the school bus industry — with 500,000 buses carrying more than 25 million children across America today — was dominated by a handful of large operators with long legacies.If Zūm decided to go for it, there was another question: Could they be both a school bus company and an on-call service for parents? That seemed unlikely; those were very separate businesses, and too difficult to run simultaneously. This was harder for Narayan. She was proud of Zūm's origin story — of being a working mom helping other working moms. Now she might abandon those women. ""There came a point where if you don't make a decision, it's too late,"" she says. ""You lose the edge that you have created in the market. But it's so tough because you could be giving up everything you've done so far, too. This is where you die or you fly.""Related: The Four Steps to Creating Lasting Change in Any Area of Your LifeNarayan spent around eight months wrestling with this decision. Her inner circle was split too. Her brother Vivek, who serves as chief operating officer, advocated for switching. ""Uber and Lyft had raised billions of dollars, but they were not profitable,"" he told her — which was to say, Zūm's original model might be iffy. But at least one investor and board member was not so sure. ""We were a bit intimidated,"" admits Bryan Schreier, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which bet early on Apple and Airbnb and led Zūm's $5.5 million Series A in 2017. ""We're used to founders dreaming big. But to us, school buses seemed like a super entrenched business, and it was really hard to see how a startup would truly reinvent it.""Narayan and Vivek, however, had come up with another differentiating factor. They wouldn't be just any old high-tech yellow bus company. Theirs would also help districts convert to electric vehicles. Over 90% of school buses run on diesel — a head-scratching figure, given the growing concerns about climate change. Zūm's founders believed that technology, combined with sustainability, was a strong value proposition for school leaders. ""That started to sound a bit more promising,"" says Schreier.Narayan finally felt confident to make the pivot to yellow buses: Yes, she'd be walking away from her original vision for Zūm, but she'd be building a sustainable company and making the planet healthier for all those children she loved serving. Now all they needed was to figure out how to actually pull it off­ — and to find a school district willing to hire them.RULE No. 2 Find the lone wolf. Kimberly Raney has always done things differently. In 2016, when she became director of transportation at Oakland Unified School District — two years before Zūm came on her radar — she wasn't your typical leader. (This is a woman who spent 18 months traveling in an RV with her wife, 12-year-old kid, two monkeys, a cat, and a rescued pig.) She'd been a manager at FedEx and had run a package delivery company. So when she landed at Oakland, she looked around and went, What the heck? ""It just amazed me to see the lack of technology,"" she says. ""I'm 48, and the buses show up the same exact way as when I was a kid.""Raney had a big job. The district contains 99 schools and partners with the city, using its public buses to get most of its students to class. But it awards big contracts to private vendors for about 1,500 special-education children, who are ferried door to door. Especially for this kind of delivery, it seemed obvious to Raney that the parents should be able to track their kids, the same way they could follow a FedEx package.


That's why when Zūm first pitched her in 2018, she was intrigued. At the time, Zūm was hunting for ""alternative transportation"" jobs, and Raney gave them the $400,000 contract — as a ""trial run,"" she says, ""to see if they could actually do what they said they could do."" Raney was the one who showed Narayan the fax machines that had prompted her to rethink the company.So when Zūm's founders decided to become a more full-service yellow bus operation, the first person they thought of was Raney. Maybe she'd be willing to give them a shot.Related: 4 Steps to Getting More Clients Right NowBut you don't make a pitch like this out of nowhere. Instead, Vivek started having conversations with Raney, talking theoretically about how Oakland could tech up its whole transportation system. He found out in 2020 that the district's contract, which would pay $11.5 million annually, was coming up for renewal for all their special-education students, and potentially could be worth $115 million. The current vendor was First Student, which has been around for more than 100 years and, with about 40,000 buses, is arguably the leading operator in the country. But anyone could submit a bid. And Zūm decided to go for it.First, though, it had to figure out: Would it try to become a school bus company all at once — acquiring and operating a whole fleet? Narayan decided against it; that was too much to start. For this bid, they'd propose partnering with an established operator that would use Zūm's platform in its own buses. Meanwhile, her team doubled down on its technology.Zūm took the software it built for ridesharing, and scaled it for an enterprise level. Fleet operators could save time and money with route optimization and collect data on driver performance. Drivers would have tablets that guide them by voice through the streets, alerting them when a child was sick and rerouting them to save time. Parents would have apps that let them always see where their kids were. And the schools got dashboards showing where every vehicle, driver, and child was at any given moment, with more information (like driver history, students' special needs, exact time a child was picked up or dropped off) available with a click on an icon.As the engineers worked, Vivek shared some of this potential with Raney. The idea was to give her a sense of the capabilities she could get for Oakland if she asked for them in the Request for Proposal (RFP) — the document she was working up to solicit bids for that next big contract. And sure enough, when Oakland did issue its RFP in January 2020, it required, for the first time, real-time tracking, route optimization, and electric buses. Zūm had three weeks to submit its proposal.By now the founders had realized: If you want to win over a difficult client, you need to learn to speak and think like them — which is why they hired a vice president of partnerships named Sarah Skinner, whose career in education included working with public school districts on data-driven strategy. When Oakland put out the bid, Skinner says, ""We asked, 'Can you provide your routing data and the number of students that need transporting? Because we want to understand if we can optimize these routes.'"" After Oakland provided the information, using Zūm's new tech platform, the company found a way to do the job with fewer buses — 76 instead of 103 — while reducing the number of children who spent an hour or more commuting from 70% to less than 10%. Oakland's fleet, it promised, would be fully electric no later than 2025.


Related: How To Use Entrepreneurial Creativity For InnovationRaney and the other decision-makers were sold. Zūm got the contract. ""It was a risk. We'd be taking a first chance,"" says Raney, who's not sure she'd have been so bold ""if I wouldn't have had so many conversations with Ritu and Vivek, and really seen that they care about my opinion to fix things immediately. But I knew they would do everything in their power not to fail.""Zūm had turned a sympathetic supporter into its first big contract. Now it needed to leverage this into getting many more.Image Credit: Courtesy of ZūmRULE No. 3 Be ready to fight. With Oakland secured, Zūm was developing a playbook for other districts: Get a toehold with the small alternative vendor contracts. Find an innovation-minded adopter who can become a champion. Build a relationship and show them how your company differs before they look for a vendor. Then, go all out to win.Later in 2020, just across the bay, San Francisco's public school district put out its RFP for school busing. Looking to transport at least 3,500 students to 122 schools for five years, its scope was more than twice that of Oakland's, and it asked each bidder to submit a price. As with Oakland, the incumbent was First Student.To win the bigger contract, Zūm decided it was time to compete head-on. Now that they'd successfully launched their technology in Oakland, they moved to become a ""full-stack"" yellow bus service: They'd lease the fleet, integrate their tech, hire drivers, and become electric in San Francisco by 2026. They put in a bid for $152,121,000 for five years.Related: Change Is a Team Sport — So Every Player Needs to Own It. Here's How to Get Everyone Involved.


But Narayan was not naive about the steep road ahead. At some point soon, this wouldn't just be about winning contracts — it would mean doing battle with incumbents. ""When disruption happens, the old guard tries to protect their territory,"" she says matter-of-factly. ""They'll try to remove the new player from joining the trade associations or other places of importance so they look like a small clown who will soon get out of the business.""The fight happened fast. San Francisco gave the contract to Zūm, and unlike in Oakland, First Student did not go quietly. It protested the award — and when that didn't work, it asked a California court to intervene. It also sued Zūm. It alleged in part that its former operations manager who was hired by Zūm misappropriated trade secrets during the bidding process. Narayan says the two companies settled. Zūm kept the contract.The feud intensified last year over the bid for Seattle's public schools, but in this case, Zūm was the aggressor. The district gave the contract to First Student, its vendor for 30 years. Zūm protested, saying it had come in at a lower price, and pointed to errors in evaluating the two bids. In response, the district canceled that RFP and put out a second. First Student won again. And again, Zūm protested. The district's final solution was to split the contract between the two companies — three years for around $40 million each — starting on July 6, 2022, with just two months to go live before school started. ""It's just what we had to go through,"" Narayan says.RULE No. 4 Play every hand you have. In 2022, there were 19,269 public school districts in the U.S. — and Zūm started plotting to get all of them. As part of that strategy, they eyed Los Angeles Unified School District. It's the second-largest district in the country behind New York, with nearly 600,000 students in more than 1,400 schools and centers covering 710 square miles. If Zūm won a big chunk of business there and executed well, it would prove its ability to handle the needs of most other districts. But that's easier said than done. Although the L.A. district has a projected expense fund of $12.9 billion this school year, it's said you can't even sell them a pencil.Related: Two Words That Can Help You Get More ClientsThis district gets most of its students to class via the 3,000 buses and other vehicles it owns. They outsource the rest. When the latest bid went out for what would be 405 buses, Zūm threw its hat in. To up its chances, the company hired yet another industry vet — Liz Sanchez, who'd been in the C-suites of First Student and National Express, Zūm's fleet partner in Oakland. Sanchez became Zūm's executive vice president of school transportation and started calling up her contacts in Los Angeles. ""I had good relationships there,"" she says. ""This is a very small industry.""Still, the district had a new transportation director that Sanchez didn't know, so Zūm leaned in hard on its strengths. As a tech company, it was acquiring more and more data: money saved with route optimization, commute time decreased, emissions cut. They could also prove things like a 98% on-time pickup rate in Oakland and 4.9 out of 5 stars based on over a quarter million parent satisfaction ratings across all districts on the app. (Whenever it's a three-star rating or below, the founders and executive team get notified and someone calls the parent immediately.) It all made a convincing case for Los Angeles, which awarded Zūm the contract last June. Over five years, it will pay over $400 million.


Zūm's vehicles are all carbon neutral and by 2027 will be fully electric, with batteries that give power back to the grid.Image Credit: Courtesy of ZūmRULE No. 5 Evolve your story while staying true to the narrative. Today, a little over three years after winning their first district, Zūm services more than 4,000 schools in six states and has $1 billion in multiyear contracts. Having raised $200 million, the founders say the company is winning about 75% of the contracts it bids on, and will be profitable next year. ""We are only, like, 0.6% of the market share,"" Vivek says. ""So there's way more room to grow.""(Update: It hasn't gone without hitches. Since this story went to press, a new contract with Howard County public schools in Maryland got off to a rocky start with missing buses and delays, due in large part to a national shortage of drivers. Zūm has apologized and is giving updates on its site on how it's resolving the situation.)If Narayan could go back and do anything over again, it would be those months of debating whether to abandon Zūm's founding vision to embrace the bigger possibility. ""I wouldn't take that long!"" she says with a laugh. She knows why she clung to her personal origin story. It was what her investors, employees, and first clients all bought in on. But she came to realize that a skilled entrepreneur is able to evolve that narrative as circumstances and opportunities shift.Related: 5 Factors That Contribute to the Success of Your BusinessToday, as she continues to do that, Zūm's narrative is increasingly about clean energy. If all goes to plan, next year as students head back to school, Oakland will consist entirely of Zūm's new electric buses, a fleet designed to send power back to the city grid. In line with a push from state and federal funding for electrification of the industry, Narayan's early bet on sustainability is proving on the money. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, if half the school buses in the country converted from diesel to electric, it could cut more than 2 million tons of carbon dioxide every year and, with vehicle-to-grid batteries, store enough energy to power the school laptop of nearly every student for a month.And yet, in an important way, this isn't all that different from Zūm's original story. The company began with helping children. It still does. Electric buses mean cleaner air for young brains and bodies, while shorter commutes help them show up fresh for class; cheaper transportation gives schools extra dollars for education. And Zūm's more than 1,000 drivers now have their students' names and individual needs at their fingertips and don't have to worry about telling parents they'll be late — including drivers like Marllury Urbina, who used to write X's in chalk at the pickup stop. She left one of the big incumbents to work for Zūm.""I plan to keep driving my bus,"" she says, ""till the wheels come off.""Related: This $12 Billion Startup Nearly Imploded.

92,How to Use Human Psychology to Crush Your Sales Goals,"Aug 31, 2023",Jason Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-use-human-psychology-to-crush-your-sales-goals/457252,"
Although the marketing world has been changing drastically over the years, some things have stayed the same. I'm talking about human psychology. There are tried and true tactics that win every time based on how we behave and what signals our subconscious behavior and emotional triggers.According to McKinsey & Co., 80% of consumers want retailers to personalize their experiences — so when you use sales psychology, your audience will believe you understand them and their needs. Knowing sales psychology can also help you predict when your clients are going to buy, which in turn can lead to you being more prepared with inventory and/or employees to gain more sales.Related: 6 Psychology-Based Tips to Boost Your Sales



Start with clearly defined goalsThe first step may seem obvious, but before you start selling, it's important to make sure you have clearly defined sales goals. At my business, we start by creating sales goals every quarter and making sure we meet those goals on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.At my company, we make sure our sales team records all of their calls so we can go through and see what they need to work on. We conduct a weekly sales training call with all of our closers, go through calls they recorded throughout the week and analyze what needs to improve — whether that's making sure they're asking prospects the correct questions, using an assertive and supportive tone of voice, building rapport or making prospects feel comfortable and understood.


If the client thinks you don't understand their problem first and foremost, they won't feel confident in your company being the solution they need.Understand the unconscious mindDid you know that 95% of purchase decision-making takes place in the unconscious mind? If you want to learn how to access the unconscious mind — and your customers' emotions — focus on these key areas:The psychology of colorColors evoke different types of emotions so it's a great way to use it in your branding and marketing. There are usually many different feelings associated with each color, but here are a few to get you started:


Brands that choose purple usually portray luxury and feelings of sophistication.Blue evokes feelings of calmness and trustworthiness. That's why a lot of doctors' offices and spas will be painted blue.Orange creates feelings of warmth and showcases creativity and adventure. It's also vibrant and can be well suited to attracting younger crowds.Restaurants that want to evoke feelings of hunger and excitement may want to use the color red.Brands that want to come across as confident and sophisticated can opt for the color black.My company's logo is a mix of blue, red and white. As an American company, we purposefully chose these colors to mimic the feelings that come from the pride Americans have for our flag. Red isn't just used to evoke feelings of hunger, it's also used to signify power and fearlessness, which is what we stand for.A quick note of precaution on the psychology of color: Each color can also portray a negative emotion along with a positive one. For example, red is great for evoking feelings of hunger, but it can also evoke anger.Related: 6 Ways You Can Leverage Consumer Psychology to Drive More SalesThe psychology of pricing


I believe that the psychology behind numbers is one of the most powerful tactics you can use. An MIT study shows surprising results regarding the number nine. You may have even done this powerful trick yourself. In fact, it's so powerful that the MIT study indicated when it came to a dress in a women's catalog, the experiment tried three different prices $34, $39 and $44. You would think people would have bought the dress the most when it was $34, but changing the price from $34 and $44 didn't change demand at all, however, changing it to $39 increased demand by a third.The psychology of scarcityPeople want what they can't have, and there are various ways you can leverage this psychology of scarcity. I recommend using flash sales as a quick cash flow increase and to keep your customers on their toes. You can do this through email marketing, ads or social media. On your website, you could also try showing how many items are left in stock. There's more FOMO (fear of missing out) if there are only four items left versus 100.The psychology of social proof


People want to follow what other people are doing. You might think they just ""want to be popular,"" but the need comes from wanting to feel like we belong and are well-liked. It's a basic human need, and as such, we look toward what others are doing when we're confused. A 2022 study by TINT showed that 75% of customers search for social proof, including reviews and testimonials, before making a purchase — so make sure you use everything from user-generated content on social media to video and written testimonials.Related: 5 Psychological Reasons 'Social Proof' Beats Everything Else in MarketingFocus on why people buyThere are many factors why people buy, including but not limited to money, status, security, popularity and transformation. At my company, we focus on business growth and transformation, so our ad campaigns specifically revolve around making sure feelings of success, security and power are evoked.You should be evoking emotions throughout the entire client journey, from your ad to the purchase and even after you close the sale. This is where a lot of businesses fall off on the client journey, but even after your product is bought, there are still many ways to evoke feelings and make sure you receive a positive client testimonial/review or a referral. Checking up on your clients will make them feel like you care.


In order to win at selling, at the end of the day you need to focus on selling a lifestyle, not just a product based on features. By defining your sales goals, learning about customers' emotions and needs and accessing the unconscious mind through pricing, colors, scarcity and social proof, you will be able to leverage sales psychology.

93,5 Reasons Why Salespeople Make the Best Business Leaders,"Aug 28, 2023",Kristopher Tait,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-reasons-why-salespeople-make-the-best-business-leaders/457247,"
Warren Buffett, Ginni Rometty and Howard Schultz share a common background — they all worked as salespeople before becoming CEOs of Berkshire Hathaway, IBM and Starbucks, respectively. Buffett worked as an investment salesman, Rometty got his start in a sales role at IBM, and Schultz had a stint as a salesman for Xerox.Each serves as proof that salespeople make excellent business leaders. But let's look more closely at five reasons why salespeople possess the attributes that set them apart as exceptional corporate leaders.Related: What Does It Really Take to Be a Successful Salesperson? The Answer Is Simpler Than You May Think.



1. A customer-centric mindsetSalespeople are inherently focused on understanding and serving their customers — that is, quite literally, the ""name of the game"" for them. That's also why they understand the importance of delivering value, cultivating strong relationships and ultimately meeting, if not exceeding, customer needs.This customer-centric mindset allows them to develop a deep understanding of the market. It equips them to identify emerging trends and make strategic decisions based on insight. Successful CEOs share this understanding of their customers, their product-market fit and how they design products and services that drive growth. It also sets them apart as accomplished leaders.


Related: Want to Level Up Your Success? Follow these 4 rules2. Strong communication, influence and relationship skillsSales professionals possess exceptional communication skills and a high level of emotional intelligence (EQ) — not to mention the powers of influence — which allows them to adeptly navigate delicate situations by reading the room and gauging the non-verbal communications between participants. They possess keen powers of perception, and by tapping into their EQ, they can convey complex ideas clearly and concisely, negotiate deals persuasively, and ideally build trust with key stakeholders.These communication and relationship-building talents translate beautifully into the leadership domain for CEOs who must articulate their vision, motivate teams and develop a culture of open dialogue daily. Furthermore, CEOs must frequently seek support for their strategic initiatives, which also necessitates strong partnerships with external stakeholders.3. Results-oriented and goal-drivenSalespeople perform extremely well in a results-driven environment. They are most effective when setting and pursuing ambitious goals and work best with a single-minded focus to achieve them. This results-oriented mindset is essential for excelling within a high-performing business culture, where accountability and a focus on outcomes remain critical.


One thing that stuck with me and I want to emphasize is the 'ambitious' note mentioned above. Rarely do you overachieve by merely aiming for the number in front of you. Once you get your target number, consider adding 50% to it and determine the steps required to hit that number. This approach works in almost every role you can think of.CEOs with a sales background bring this goal-driven mentality and overachieving mindset to their leadership roles, and they uniquely understand the importance of defining clear objectives and implementing actionable plans to drive their organization forward.Related: Why AI Won't Replace (Great) Salespeople4. Resilience and persistenceThe sales profession demands steadfast resilience and persistence in the face of rejection and setbacks. Salespeople often face numerous ""nos"" before finally securing a ""yes."" This ability to bounce back from failures and maintain a positive outlook helps build a strong character that can weather storms effectively. As C-suites, salespeople bring this invaluable resilience to their leadership roles, allowing them to push through challenging situations and inspire or stabilize their teams during periods of uncertainty.


Personally, I remember being told not to take an initial 'no' as a final answer but instead to use that 'no' as a reason to revisit my argument, my plan or my offering and ensure I'm providing sufficient details to explain why whomever I'm talking to should care or be inspired to action. It was an awkward lesson to learn initially, but a vital one — and one I've also made sure to share with my broader team.Salespeople shine as outstanding wartime CEOs in times of crisis, keeping calm in the face of chaos and immediately putting solutions into action.Related: 5 Tips to Keep Team Motivation Going During a Pivot5. Exceptional problem-solving abilitiesAdaptability and agility are essential traits in the sales world. Despite facing daily challenges, salespeople persevere because they're in it for the wins. To succeed, they rely on strong problem-solving skills to overcome objections, address customer pain points, and ultimately find innovative solutions to close deals.


Early in my career, I tackled the demanding aspects of sales — cold calling and handling constant rejections. But with consistency comes crucial learning experiences, like understanding how to influence, speaking with a smile, adding tone and excitement to your delivery, and confidence. These experiences contribute to rapid growth; while you don't notice it on the spot, they are an investment in your future self.This ability to think critically and adapt swiftly is equally vital for CEOs. They regularly encounter complex business problems that demand quick and effective solutions. Based on their sales background, CEOs can confidently handle these challenges, as they have sharpened their problem-solving and adaptability skills throughout their careers.In the words of William Clement Stone, ""Sales are contingent upon the attitude of the salesman—not the attitude of the prospect."" It's like the golden rule for both salespeople and business leaders, a shared mindset. No matter how tough things get, the crucial factor determining success lies in your skills, attitudes, and ability to lead.

Q: People tell me to post regularly on LinkedIn, but nobody's reading. Should I just quit? — Derek, AustinThis article could flop. You might not even get past the first paragraph. That's just a fact of life for anyone who writes anything. But it's not a reason to stop.Let's start with some assumptions. You're probably not a professional creator. Maybe you're posting to grow your brand and revenue. At this point, you're a little embarrassed by how poorly you're doing, looking at the opportunity cost of it, and thinking that your time is better spent elsewhere.

95,How to Design a Winning Call-to-Action (CTA) Strategy,"Aug 21, 2023",Alex Quin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-create-a-winning-call-to-action-cta-strategy/457513,"
A well-designed call to action (CTA) can transform mere observers into active participants, guiding them towards desired actions ranging from purchasing to subscribing to a newsletter. In this era of ever-evolving user preferences and dynamic online landscapes, mastering the science behind CTAs is a key component of successful conversion optimization.In this article, we aim to unravel the intricacies of one of the most potent tools in the digital marketer's toolbox — the call to action (CTA).When it comes to conversion optimization, CTAs play a pivotal role. A well-crafted CTA can be the difference between a fleeting glance and a committed action. Research indicates that a strategically designed CTA can boost click-through rates by a remarkable 371%, illustrating the profound impact of these small yet crucial elements on user behavior.



The primary objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive understanding of CTAs and how they can be harnessed to achieve tangible results. Expect practical strategies that will help you construct CTAs that not only capture attention but also drive conversions and meaningful user interactions.Related: 3 Questions Behind Effective 'Calls to Action' That Drive Conversions


Understanding CTAsAt its core, a CTA is kind of like a directional signpost that guides users toward specific actions. These actions could vary from subscribing to a service to completing a purchase. Whether it appears as a conspicuous button, a persuasive line of text or an engaging image, a CTA persuades users to engage with your content.Types of CTAsThe diversity in the world of CTAs is astonishing. Ranging from vibrant buttons that demand attention to carefully chosen words that inspire action, the format you select significantly influences user behavior.Button CTAs: Button CTAs, with their vibrant visuals and concise text, command attention and provide clear directives.Text CTAs: Text CTAs blend seamlessly with content, gently guiding users toward softer actions.Image CTAs: Image CTAs leverage visuals to evoke emotions and showcase products, while form CTAs collect valuable data through interactive exchanges.Social media CTAs: Social media CTAs foster community engagement and expand brand reach.Each CTA type offers a distinct avenue to inspire action, enabling marketers to tailor their approach based on campaign goals, user preferences and the context of interaction, thereby enriching the digital user experience and driving conversions.Role of CTAs in the sales funnelCTAs have a nuanced role at different stages of the sales funnel. From sparking awareness to guiding users through consideration and ultimately influencing decision-making, a well-crafted CTA strategy can yield substantial engagement at each step of the customer journey.


Knowing your audienceThe heart of an effective CTA strategy lies in a deep understanding of your target audience. By segmenting your audience based on demographics, behavior and preferences, you can create CTAs that resonate on a personal level. This personalization is essential, considering that 80% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences. Aside from this, personalized CTAs, tailored to user preferences and behaviors, have been found to convert 202% better than their generic counterparts.The era of one-size-fits-all marketing is dwindling. Personalization is the key. Creating CTAs that align with the unique preferences and motivations of different user personas can significantly enhance their effectiveness. You can create a stronger emotional connection with your audience by addressing specific pain points and aspirations.Related: 11 Call to Action Hacks to Boost Clicks and ConversionsUtilizing customer data to inform CTA strategyThe rise of data-driven marketing has transformed the way we approach CTAs. Analyzing customer data provides valuable insights into what resonates with your audience. Harnessing this data can help you refine your CTA strategy and optimize for conversions.


Crafting compelling CTAsCreating a compelling CTA involves a delicate balance of art and science. The language you use must be concise, persuasive and action-oriented. Leveraging urgency, exclusivity and clear benefits, such as ""Get Started Now"" or ""Unlock Exclusive Access,"" can prompt users to take immediate action.Persuasive language and action-oriented text:The choice of words can have a profound impact on CTA effectiveness. Action-oriented verbs like ""Discover,"" ""Join"" and ""Explore"" trigger a sense of immediacy. It is also recommended to use psychological triggers such as urgency, FOMO, scarcity and social proof that can further enhance their persuasive power.The use of visuals and design in CTAs:


Visual design plays a crucial role in making your CTAs stand out. Elements like color, contrast and typography can capture attention and convey professionalism. However, the design should complement the message without overwhelming the user, as excessive visual elements can diminish conversions.Placement and visibility:The strategic placement of CTAs is essential for capturing user attention. Placing CTAs in high-visibility areas or near relevant content (above the fold) ensures that they are seen when users are most engaged.The concept of ""above the fold"" originated from newspaper design, referring to the content visible without needing to unfold the paper. In digital marketing, it translates to the content users see without scrolling. Placing CTAs above the fold can significantly enhance visibility and engagement. Research from Nielsen Norman Group indicates that users spend 80% of their time on web pages above the fold, underlining the critical nature of this space.


Using CTA relevance to content and context:Contextual relevance is critical for CTA effectiveness. When users encounter a CTA that mirrors their interests or extends the value of the content they're engaging with, it feels like a natural next step. The key lies in understanding the user's intent and aligning CTAs with their journey.CTA responsiveness and mobile optimization:The rise of mobile browsing has reshaped user behaviors and expectations. Whether it's researching products, reading articles or making purchases, users are performing these actions on their mobile devices. Google reports that more than half of all web traffic worldwide comes from mobile devices, highlighting the shift in user preferences.


In this context, CTA responsiveness takes center stage. A responsive CTA is one that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations without sacrificing functionality or user experience. Neglecting mobile optimization can lead to frustrated users, high bounce rates and missed conversion opportunities.A/B testing CTAsA/B testing is the path to refining your CTA strategy. By comparing different versions of CTAs, you can identify which elements resonate best with your audience. This iterative process allows you to continually improve your CTAs based on real-world user interactions.Aside from this, measuring CTA performance is crucial for refining your strategy. Metrics such as click-through, conversion and bounce rates provide insights into the effectiveness of your CTAs. These metrics enable you to identify strengths and areas for improvement.You can easily view some of these metrics with the help of analytics tools. Analytics tools offer valuable insights into CTA performance. Platforms like Google Analytics, Crazy Egg and Hotjar provide visual representations of user behavior, enabling you to uncover trends and patterns that inform your optimization efforts.


Related: Why We Click: The Simple Psychology Behind Calls to ActionRegularly updating and refreshing CTAsStagnation can lead to diminishing returns and banner blindness. Banner blindness is a phenomenon where users subconsciously ignore or overlook elements that resemble advertisements. As users are exposed to a consistent design and placement of CTAs, they can become conditioned to ignore them. Regularly updating CTAs with fresh designs, colors and messaging disrupts this pattern, capturing users' attention once again.Updating CTAs also prevents visual monotony. If users perceive your CTAs as stale or outdated, they might assume your offerings are similarly outdated. Refreshing your CTAs sends a subtle signal that your brand is current and evolving.Crafting a winning CTA strategy is both an art and a science. With careful attention to user preferences, persuasive language, strategic placement and continuous optimization, you can create CTAs that drive conversions and encourage meaningful user actions. Remember that CTAs are not set in stone; they should evolve with your audience and the ever-changing digital landscape. By staying informed, remaining adaptable and consistently refining your approach, you can unlock the true potential of CTAs in your conversion optimization journey.

97,5 Ways Companies Can Create Content That's Actually Helpful,"Aug 11, 2023",Kelsey Kloss,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-ways-to-create-content-thats-actually-helpful/456700,"
Whether you're creating content for social media or PR pitches, savvy marketers will give you the same advice: Make it useful and actionable. However, what's talked about much less often is how actually to do that.In the media world, those little bits of helpful information are called ""service,"" — and journalists are pros at adding it to an article. Editors will often tell their reporters to add a bit of service to a column to make it higher value for the reader. Your company can employ this same strategy in your own content.When content is serviceable, your audience is more likely to remember it, share it and return to you for more high-value information. It's a strategy for building long-term trust and loyalty with your audience (and ultimately revenue as they turn to you, the industry thought leader, for their needs).



Nearly 70 percent of businesses plan to increase their content marketing budgets this year, per Semrush. If you're spending a budget on content marketing, here are five things that will make your content more serviceable — and more likely to produce a high ROI.1. Tips are realistic and simple to followYou may be tempted to give lofty suggestions like ""repaint your living room to make it feel more spacious"" or ""install a home gym to work out more."" But these are quick ways to dissuade your busy audience from engaging further.


Instead, research to provide tips your readers can follow easily and realistically.More practical tips might include ""arrange your short furniture against the wall so you can see more of the floor, which makes a living room seem bigger"" or ""join no-equipment workouts like tai chi or yoga with a group to help you stay accountable with your fitness goals.""If a tip takes more than 5 minutes for your audience to complete, you're probably asking too much.Related: How to Showcase Your Expertise and Become a Thought Leader


2. Following the advice is low-cost or freeSimilarly, your audience shouldn't have to dig far into their wallets to follow your advice. You want to provide them with something of value for free before you ask them for their business with your company. It somewhat defeats the purpose if your content requires them to spend.Both of the examples listed in the previous tip — moving furniture around your living room or joining a free outdoor fitness class — can be done at no out-of-pocket cost.The best pieces of service are those that are free, but keep it under $20 if cash is required.Related: Why Content Marketing Is Crucial to Your Business


3. The advice is highly specificProvide your audience with specific steps to get started and provide as many examples as possible.For instance, if you're a cookie company suggesting ice cream sandwiches for the summer, provide actual step-by-step recipes your audience can follow. Or if you're a barista training school, don't just tell your students that beautiful latte art requires patience and practice — give them a detailed guide on pouring slowly, getting close to the cup and choosing the right milk for a perfectly frothy result.4. Your recommendations are vetted by an expertAlthough your brand is speaking as the expert here, it's even better if you can quote an individual within your company (or a trusted expert outside of it) to incorporate that human element.For instance, a skincare company could ask the dermatologist it developed the line with to share tips on a trending topic, like the skin barrier. Whether you're the expert or quoting an outsider source, note any credentials to establish authority from the get-go.


Having an expert vet your company's recommendations is also a great way to get press around your serviceable content since journalists are always looking for high-value sources.Related: 5 Things Journalists Wish You Knew About Getting Press Coverage for Your Company5. The content is original to your companyIt's surprising to see how many companies simply repurpose other information found online. You don't need to do that! You're the expert in your field, so consult your own experiences to create content that hasn't been published elsewhere.One great way to do this is by referring to the common questions customers come to you with and the answers you provide them with. The more specific you can get, the better.


Let's go back to that barista training school example. If a student asks you questions about the specific ratio needed for different types of pour-over techniques, that's a great piece of content to create — especially if you have a perspective different from the industry norm.The bottom line: If you identify pain points in your target audience and provide realistic solutions, you will be able to create quality content for your audience. Keep their best interests in mind, connect with them on a human level and don't forget to showcase your credentials along the way.

98,The 4 Most Important Skills I Prioritized When Scaling My Business to $1.42 Million In Monthly Revenue In My Early 20s,"Aug 10, 2023",Kash Hasworth,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-4-most-important-skills-i-prioritized-when-scaling-my/453007,"
In today's fiercely competitive corporate landscape, sales teams are an integral part of a business's growth and market position. These teams are the frontline warriors who build relationships, close deals and connect with customers. Yet, many leaders mistakenly forget that behind every strong sales team is an effective leader who understands the critical role of clearly communicating and harnessing their team's full potential.At the age of 20, I joined a small wireless dealer that was less than a year old, and within three years, aggressively scaled the company to 28 different locations across four states with a sales force of over 100 people, driving gross commissions of up to $1.6 million a month.Reflecting on our rise to dominance, I've identified four essential skills that were instrumental in sustaining our high performance. These skills are not only important but an absolute necessity when building a thriving sales team that shatters the results of the average.



Related: How to Grow Your Sales Team into an Efficient, Revenue-Generating MachineSteer the ship, don't mop the deckTo build a thriving sales team, you must identify and cultivate great leaders. It's not merely about replacing yourself but replicating your abilities, your vision and your drive in others. As you scale, your responsibility is not to micromanage, but to empower and delegate. And to do this, you need leaders.


For example, when a location faced staffing issues, my first instinct wasn't to rush in and personally recruit sales reps, regardless of how dire the situation was. Instead, my focus was on finding a leader. Why? Because the leader is the one who can turn the tide, who can take the reins, and steer the location out of trouble.In sales, every role has its battlefield. As a district manager or regional role and above, your battlefield is not to mop the deck; it's the broader strategic actions. Steer the ship. If you find yourself too deep into the weeds, getting caught up in recruiting and managing sales reps, you're not fulfilling your role as a leader; you're slipping into the role of a manager. This shift can detract from your capacity to tackle larger responsibilities and restrict your ability to influence the broader organizational landscape.Related: In the World of Recruiting, 3 Leadership Qualities to Look forCommunicate directly and more than you think is necessaryAt the heart of strong leadership is clear, consistent and honest communication. Clear communication helps in aligning the team with the organization's goals and vision. Consistent communication ensures that everyone is on the same page, avoiding misunderstandings and strengthening a unified approach to achieving targets. Honesty, meanwhile, builds trust and loyalty, creating a supportive environment that boosts morale and productivity.


In the end, the effectiveness of a sales team is a reflection of leadership, and leadership, in turn, is a reflection of communication. The clarity, consistency and honesty of your communication will define your leadership, influence your team's performance and ultimately determine your success.Let's consider a real-world scenario. Suppose payroll is going to be late — which can cause distress for any team. A leader might be tempted to avoid communicating, fearing the team's reaction. But stepping up and transparently communicating the issue is far wiser.As soon as the issue is identified, call your leaders directly, explain what happened, the steps you've taken to resolve it, and when they can expect a resolution. This approach not only shows your team that you respect and value them, but it also demonstrates your ability to handle crises and your commitment to transparency. Even though the news is unfavorable, the strength of your leadership softens the blow, proving that clear and honest communication is an absolute necessity.To put it simply, if you want to build a strong sales team, start by taking a good look at how you communicate.Related: How Successful Leaders Communicate With Their TeamsCreate a consistent culture of accountabilityAccountability often gets a bad rap, typically associated with blame and penalties. However, in a thriving sales environment, accountability is impartial. It's about setting expectations, following up on them, and recognizing that good, bad, or no results are all valuable feedback.In a sales team, consistency in accountability conversations creates a space for proud report-ups, creating an environment ripe for praise and recognition. So when the occasion calls for difficult conversations, they become much easier to have. The accountability culture is not about being faultless; it's about creating an environment where everyone is learning, growing, and driving toward collective success.Related: 7 Ways to Promote a Company Culture of Accountability


Be an unstoppable sales force yourselfWithin an aggressively expanding sales organization, the velocity of the operations, the intensity of the competition, and the high stakes of success put a considerable amount of pressure on leadership. As such, the person leading charge needs to embody more than just strategic vision and managerial prowess. They also need to have a deep understanding of sales and a solid track record of success in this field.Such a leader, equipped with a proven record of success, not only gains credibility and respect but also brings firsthand insight into effective strategy development. Their expertise becomes a cornerstone for training, helping team members enhance their skills and navigate challenges. When able to lead by example, they can embody the attitudes and behaviors that spur success, setting high standards and inspiring excellence within the team.As your sales team grows, you will need to expand your leadership team and delegate responsibilities. At this stage, your ability to attract and retain leaders will depend on your personal growth as a leader, all of which revolve around these four skills. A leader must be equal to or exceed the level of those they lead. Anything less and they risk losing their team's respect and confidence, which can negatively impact the team's performance and success.

99,Amazon Uses These Psychological Tricks To Take Your Money on Prime Day,"Jul 12, 2023",Gleb Tsipursky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/amazon-uses-these-psychological-tricks-to-take-your-money/455494,"
Brace yourselves, dear navigators of the e-commerce maze, as we embark on an exploration of the monumental spectacle of retail that is Amazon Prime Day. Much like the gladiatorial combats of ancient Rome, it's a thrilling spectacle fraught with both promise and peril. And it's your cognitive biases that often play the role of both the lion and the gladiator, pitting you against yourself in a fierce battle of wit and will.Trap 1: The confirmation bias chimeraPicture this: you're browsing through Amazon's tantalizing offerings and you stumble upon a particularly appealing set of steak knives, which you've convinced yourself are just the upgrade your kitchen deserves. Never mind that you've managed perfectly well with your current cutlery for years, the deal seems too good to pass up.This, my friends, is the confirmation bias chimera, rearing its misleading head. In this case, confirmation bias leads you to seek and believe information that supports your existing predilections, while ignoring anything that contradicts them. Suddenly, every review sounds like an ode to these new knives, all the while downplaying the possible utility of your old set. The antidote? Simple: approach each deal with an open mind, always willing to challenge your preconceived notions.

A Marketing Professor Reveals Them — and How You Can Actually Get the Best Deal.Trap 2: The attentional bias abyssClicking through the alleys of Amazon's discounts can sometimes feel like trying to find a needle in a haystack, only for the haystack to be filled with dozens of distracting shiny objects. This is the attentional bias abyss, a trap that lures you into focusing only on aspects that catch your fancy while sidelining the not-so-glitzy details.


Your eyes light up at the sight of an enormous discount on a flashy 4K TV, but fail to register the hefty fees for peripherals, or perhaps the inferior brand reputation. The way out of this abyss? Be a vigilant explorer. Make it a point to scrutinize every detail before you click ""Buy Now.""Trap 3: The anchoring bias albatrossWho hasn't fallen for the classic ""discounted from a staggering price"" trope? You see a blender originally priced at $200 now selling for $100, and you're convinced it's a steal. This is the work of the anchoring bias albatross, forcing you to base your judgments and decisions on the first piece of information you encounter.But what if the blender's real value is closer to $80, and it's been artificially inflated to trick your cognitive biases? The defense? Make sure you do your market research before Amazon Prime Day arrives. Knowing the true worth of an item can keep the albatross at bay.Related: 3 Ways New Amazon Sellers Can Stand Out From the Crowd on Prime Day


Trap 4: The loss aversion leviathanThe loss aversion leviathan feeds on your fear of missing out. The Prime Day deal will disappear on July 12! The ticking clock nudges you into a hurried purchase. You'd rather not risk the regret of missing out on the deal, even though you don't truly need the item.The beast of loss aversion leads you to value the avoidance of losses over equivalent gains. After all, the sting of losing $10 often feels stronger than the joy of gaining the same amount. The weapon to slay this leviathan? Practicing self-restraint. Remember, there will always be another deal, another discount, another Prime Day.Trap 5: The optimism bias ogreFinally, we come face-to-face with the optimism bias ogre, the creature that convinces you that everything will work out in your favor. It's the force behind your belief that the laptop you've just bought won't turn out to be a dud, or that the designer dress you've ordered will fit you perfectly.But the ogre's optimism can lead to disappointment and unnecessary expense. Don't let the optimism bias cloud your judgment. Make sure to thoroughly research products, read customer reviews, and double-check your sizing before making a purchase.


ConclusionAvoiding these cognitive traps on Amazon Prime Day requires both awareness and strategy, but with these tools in your arsenal, you can conquer the event like a seasoned gladiator, with your wallet — and your sanity — intact. Step forth into the arena, armed with the knowledge of your cognitive biases, and claim the spoils of retail victory!

100,5 Sales Call Mistakes That Are Costing You Coaching Clients,"Jul 11, 2023",Jason Moss,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-sales-call-mistakes-that-are-costing-you-coaching-clients/455145,"
Before I became a business coach, I spent a year as a Director of Sales, helping scale a multi-seven-figure coaching business with one of my best friends.Our team took hundreds of sales calls every month, and each week, I would study them to figure out what we did well and how we could improve. Along the way, I discovered a few big mistakes we were making that decreased the chance someone would buy from us by 50% or more.If you're a coach who sells a high-ticket program over the phone, avoiding these mistakes is a proven path to signing more clients, increasing your income and making a bigger impact through the work you do. I only wish I would have discovered them sooner.



Let's dive in…Related: The 5 Best Actions You Can Take to Improve Sales Calls


Mistake #1: Selling with the wrong intentionsA coach recently reached out to me because he was struggling to grow his business and wanted help.I asked him, ""What do you do before every sales call?""He said, ""I pump myself up and tell myself — 'I know I'm going to close this deal.'""It's no surprise to me that he was having trouble.Imagine you're going out on a first date. Do you want to have dinner with someone whose goal is to sleep with you later that night?Probably not.Your potential clients feel the same way. Nobody wants to get on a sales call with someone who wants to ""close"" them.What people do want is an advocate — someone who can show up in the heart of service, unattached to making a sale, focused instead on figuring out how to get them what they want.


Don't show up to a call trying to close the deal. The less attached you are to making a sale, the more likely it is to happen.Mistake #2: Not listening enoughMy top sales reps spent up to 80% of their calls asking questions and listening. My less experienced reps spent far more time talking, pitching, convincing and, in general, running their mouths.For someone to want to work with you, they need to feel seen, heard and understood. You do this by listening, not by talking.When in doubt, ask more questions. The more time you spend talking, the lower your close rate will be.


Mistake #3: Pitching the processYour prospects don't care that much about the nitty-gritty details around working with you.What really matters to them is…How will my life be different after we work together? And will this be worth the pain of hiring you?My average sales reps would overwhelm prospects with details about our program, dragging them into the weeds of how we could help them and what every step of the process would look like.


On the flip side, my best sales reps pitched very differently. They focused primarily on outcomes and results instead, painting in vivid detail what someone's life would look like after working with us. This was far more effective.Related: 6 Simple, Proven Methods to Improve Your Sales SkillsMistake #4: Pushing for the closePeople value freedom and autonomy above everything else. Your prospects want to feel in control during the sales process — like they have the power to determine how and when things happen.Sales pressure threatens this freedom and autonomy. When you try to force someone, however subtly, into taking a step they're not yet ready to take, you're trying to take their freedom away. This is why people hate sales pressure and why it will almost always doesn't work.


My best sales reps were intuitive and attentive on calls. Rather than defaulting to going for the close, they felt out where someone was at and whether or not they were ready to commit. Sometimes the people they spoke to were right there and just needed a little nudge to enroll. Other times, they sensed someone wasn't ready and allowed them more space and time to process and think things through. This approach is much more effective.Mistake #5: Being their friend instead of the leaderMy average sales reps would spend up to ten minutes building rapport on calls — talking about someone's family, where they grew up, what they did this past weekend, etc.My top reps didn't waste this time. They'd spend a minute or two with casual chat, but then they would get down to brass tax.Being overly focused on building rapport usually comes from a place of neediness. It's something you do when you're trying to impress someone.The message you're sending people when you do this is, ""I need to convince you to like me."" This actually repels prospects, rather than attracting them to you.Instead, show up to a call focused on what someone came there for. If someone reached out to you, it's because they need help. They don't want to spend ten minutes talking about the vacation they just went on. They want you to take the lead, figure out what's going on and how you can help. So, get to the point instead.If you can avoid these mistakes, you'll sidestep the biggest issues that kept my team stuck and increase your close rate immediately. That means more coaching clients, more income and a bigger impact on the lives of your clients.Remember that sales is a skill that you can develop with practice over time. I'd encourage you to do so, as it will have a huge impact on your success.Happy selling!Related: I've Conducted More Than 500 Sales Calls Over the Past Few Years.

101,3 Ways New Amazon Sellers Can Stand Out From the Crowd on Prime Day,"Jul 5, 2023",Tanner Rankin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/prime-day-2023-how-new-amazon-sellers-can-stand-out-from/452743,"
While Prime Day has become a staple for bringing masses of customers to Amazon for fantastic deals, Amazon sellers know that translates to more competition for them to get their deals found. That means, having your Prime Day deals featured on Amazon's crowded Prime Day landing pages is difficult for established big-name brands, let alone new Amazon sellers.New Amazon sellers can't rely on the on-Amazon placements to get their Prime Day Deals seen by customers.That said, every year, new Amazon sellers succeed on Prime Day because they've learned that the true key to driving Prime Day sales is off of Amazon and not on Amazon. As a new Amazon seller, these are the three most important things I recommend as an Amazon consultant to focus on to stand out from the crowd on Prime Day.



Related: How Amazon Sellers Can Drive More Prime Day Sales1. Amazon InfluencersPrime Day has been a staple for consumers since it began in July 2015, which means consumers are ready ahead of time, researching deals on items they want to buy on Prime Day. Where do they go to research? They go to the number one and number two search engines in the world — Google and YouTube, respectively.


Leading up to Prime Day, consumers search Google and Youtube for ""best Prime Day deals on (insert product or product category here)"" and also read articles on Google News, Apple News and Flipboard about the same. Your customers are trying to find out if what they want to buy will be on sale on Prime Day. So, let them know.Your goal as a new Amazon seller to stand out from the crowd is to get in front of customers off Amazon to let them know your items will be on sale on Prime Day on Amazon.Here's how it works:Do searches on Google and YouTube for ""Best Prime Day Deals on (your product or product category). EXAMPLE: ""Best Prime Day Deals on patio furniture""You will get last year's results and write down all of the websites and YouTube channels that show up prominently. Now you know who covers Prime Day for your space.Follow them on social media, engage with them, then reach out to them and let them know about your Prime Day deal.There's an added benefit here, too — since we know Amazon likes it when you drive external traffic, this helps boost your on-Amazon SEO as well. What's more, partnering with Amazon Influencers is a great way to increase sales on Amazon all year round.2. Social media advertisingYou're likely already driving traffic from social media ads to your Amazon Store and product detail pages using Amazon Attribution links. If you're not, you should be.


That said, you're going to want to have your audience targeting dialed in leading up to Prime Day. Since you won't have the visibility on Amazon to promote your deal, you'll need as much visibility off of Amazon as you can get.Here's how it works:Prepare videos and images showcasing what your product is, what the savings are on the deal and how your customer would benefit. Don't forget to add a sense of urgency letting customers know this is only for Prime Day.Run the ads to your audiences that you've created for brand awareness. This is the time to venture out past buyer intent targeting and cast a wider net so you reach potential customers who wouldn't normally try a new brand.Use your Amazon Attribution link so you can get up to 10% cash back for the sales you drive to Amazon from the Brand Referral Bonus program.Don't ignore all of the potential off of Amazon when focusing on increasing product sales on Amazon.Related: Want to Quickly Increase Your Amazon Sales? Here Are 3 Key Tips from an Amazon Consultant.3. Advertorials + native advertisingMethod three combines Amazon Influencers with advertising into one powerhouse of a tactic for new Amazon sellers to stand out from the crowd on Prime Day.


Advertorials are review articles with click-worthy headlines that do well on Google, Social Media, Apple News, Google News, Flipboard and more. What sounds better? ""Hamilton Beach Food Processor Review"" or ""This $30 Kitchen Gadget Changed My Life?""The advertorial sounds better because it pre-stages the customer, evokes fear of missing out and communicates the significance of the benefit of the product that lies beyond the click. The customer is ready to buy before they even read the article.Native advertising takes content like advertorial articles and amplifies them out on major publications and platforms with huge audiences among other places. The best part? They look ""native"" to that major publication or platform — in other words, like articles that are supposed to be on that major publication or platform.Here's how it works:


Partner with nano and micro-influencers on articles like ""This Prime Day Deal Will Change How You Garden Forever."" Since you'll be amplifying the content through native advertising, you can partner with nano-influencers but get mega-influencer reach.Once the article goes live, amplify it to target audiences enthusiastic about your subject matter through native advertising.Turn off the native ads after Prime Day concludes.Don't forget to use your Amazon Attribution links in the advertorial.Those are the top three methods, but there are a few honorable mentions.Honorable mentionsEmail marketing: Since many new Amazon sellers likely haven't built up their email lists yet, this falls as an honorable mention, but it doesn't mean it is any less important. If you aren't building an email list to promote your Amazon products, you'll want to start right away.Amazon Storefront: Redesign the above-the-fold section of your Amazon Storefront homepage to showcase your Prime Day Deals.Sponsored Brands ads: Don't forget to run Sponsored Brands ads to your Amazon Storefront for customers to see your Prime Day Deals.Sponsored Products ads: You won't want to miss out on customers searching for specific products on Amazon for Prime Day Deals. Show up in product search results with the coveted Prime Day Deal badge by running Sponsored Products ads.New Amazon sellers can cut through the noise on Amazon Prime Day by venturing off Amazon and sticking to tried and true best practices to drive their Amazon Prime Day sales.Related: How to Increase Your Product Sales on Amazon Today

103,How to Enhance Your Brand Through Thought Leadership,"Jun 28, 2023",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-thought-leadership-can-transform-your-branding/454278,"
Just over five years ago, digital marketing experts estimated that American consumers see between 4,000 and 10,000 adverts every day. Fast forward to 2023, and assuming that number has increased would be safe. To be successful, businesses need to stand out from their competitors.Establishing thought leadership in a field can help reach and retain that coveted market position while also building a position of authority and expertise.Defining thought leadershipThought leadership demonstrates knowledge and expertise in a particular industry, field, or topic. Based on that definition, most company leadership team members should be thought leaders, too. While this is somewhat true, the most effective thought leaders have something else in common: they are passionate about their subject and know how to connect to their audiences.



These exceptional leaders understand how to hold an audience in thrall and deliver powerful messages repeatedly. This is how they establish themselves for the long term.Related: What Exactly Is Thought Leadership?


The power of thought leadership in brand buildingThought leadership automatically builds trust in a brand. Audiences perceive a thought leader as someone they can trust. This trust is automatically transferred to the brand the individual represents.This close association between the thought leader and their brand helps set that brand apart from others. Moreover, person and brand become synonymous with each other.There is another reason why thought leadership is such an effective brand-building tool, and that is its accessibility. To become a thought leader, a person does not need to represent a large brand. Instead, it takes consistency and a clear vision of what content will connect to the audience. That is also why thought leadership is an excellent strategy for challenger brands.Identifying the right topics and audienceHow can thought leaders identify the most promising topics for their audiences? Start by learning everything you can about your target audiences. What are their pain points, and how can your insights address those? What unique knowledge can you and your business share that audiences will find valuable and relevant?


Answering these questions should help prospective thought leaders draw up a list of potential topics to help craft thought leadership pieces. If your company is already engaging in social media marketing, look at the posts and stories that got the most attention. Chances are these will make excellent thought leadership pieces.Do not hesitate to choose topics you are passionate about. Chances are that you will find it easier to connect to your audience and hold their attention if you are talking or writing about a topic you care deeply about. Consider sharing personal experiences and stories. These are often the main elements of a leadership piece that audiences remember.Delivering value should lie at the core of each piece of thought leadership content. Steer clear of obvious marketing messages. Audiences have become wise to thinly disguised advertising content dressed as thought leadership, and the backlash could be hugely detrimental to your business.Related: Why Medical Practices Must Embrace Digital Marketing to Bring in More Patients


Creating high-quality contentHaving identified suitable topics, it is time to focus on crafting your thought leadership piece. As important as consistent communications are, quality is equally critical. Devote as much time as is necessary to write a script or a thought leadership piece.The longer your piece is, the more work should go into it. Think about the difference between sharing a tweet or an Instagram post that your audience may consume while doing other things and a long-form op-ed piece submitted to a national publication. Both require care and attention to detail, but the long-form content requires additional research and effort.Creating quality content also means taking advantage of the tools your brand has access to, including:Leveraging digital channels: leverage every channel on which your brand is present. Twitter is an excellent place to share a link to your latest blog, whereas LinkedIn deserves a longer version. If you're offering webinars, share snippets on other channels.Collaborating with industry influencers: team up with other thought leaders in your field or approach industry influencers in a related field. Not only can you function as inspirations to each other, but you can also reach new audiences through influencers.Establishing authority through speaking engagements and events: do you ever look at thought leaders and feel like you see them everywhere? Some of the most established leaders in their field are successfully taking advantage of speaking engagements and event appearances.Measuring and demonstrating thought leadership impactMeasuring and demonstrating the impact of thought leadership is not dramatically different from measuring other digital marketing activities. Consider the number and level of engagement on social media pieces, for example.


Track shares and comments on blog posts, and consider offering longer-form content in exchange for the audience's contact data. These immediate measures will give you some of the initial insights you need. Over time, the impact of thought leadership will translate into sales and conversions.Related: Why Brands are Simplifying Their Logos and Visual IdentityConclusionThought leadership is one of the most powerful and cost-effective ways for brands to build trust and credibility. It is based on identifying the topics most relevant to your target audience and delivering unique insights based on personal experience and expertise. As a strategy, thought leadership is equally effective for small and large brands, and it can be instrumental in putting a brand on the map for years to come. Take a look at your marketing strategy today to identify opportunities for thought leadership that can help you secure your company's future.

104,4 Crucial Ways to Revamp Your Remote Sales,"Jun 27, 2023",Joel Yi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/unlocking-the-4-cs-of-breakthrough-remote-success/454131,"
Remote work is the future in today's digital age, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that this includes sales teams. Traditional sales techniques, which were once conducted in high-rises or at business meals, have shifted to virtual platforms, creating new opportunities and challenges.Certain factors are game-changers during the transition to creating a remote sales team. Incorporating the 4Cs — Contrarian Compensation, Captivating Recruiting Flywheel, Consistent Coaching, and Compounding Culture — is one such crucial formula.Related: How to Make Remote Sales Work for You



1. Contrarian compensation: Igniting high performanceCompensation in a sales environment is typically straightforward, consisting of a base salary and commission. But what if we adopted an unconventional, counterintuitive approach to compensation plans that could spark greater performance?Consider sliding scales, additional milestone compensation and non-monetary incentives such as travel vouchers or extra vacation days. This not only encourages team members to achieve and exceed their sales quotas but also fosters an innovative, creative environment. If we want our sales teams to be innovative in how they sell, shouldn't we also be innovative in how we compensate them?


When employees see that their extra effort is rewarded with tangible benefits, it stimulates their competitive spirit and fosters a culture of high performance. Moreover, public recognition of their contributions can result in even greater morale and job satisfaction, thereby reducing employee turnover.According to a 2019 Gallup poll, 65% of employees would switch to a position that enables them to work remotely part-time. This indicates that innovative and flexible compensation programs, which may include work-from-home options, can be a significant motivator for your sales team.Related: 5 Tips for Building a Remote Sales Team2. Captivating recruiting flywheel: Continually attracting top talentA common misconception is that once you've filled all your open positions, you can pause recruiting. In reality, recruiting should be a continuous process. A successful sales team evolves, which requires an ongoing effort to attract and retain top talent. This concept forms the basis of the Captivating Recruiting Flywheel.


Embrace the idea of ""topgrading"" — always look for talent that can replace the bottom 10% of your sales team. This is not to instigate a culture of fear but rather to cultivate a mindset of growth, learning, and continuous improvement. By constantly recruiting, you're sending a message to your sales team that complacency won't cut it; that being good is not enough when you could be significant.To create a truly captivating recruiting flywheel, it's also essential to portray an authentic image of your company's culture, values, and vision to prospective employees. Share the success stories of your top performers, give a glimpse of your unique sales strategies, and showcase the dynamic nature of your team.By continuously improving the quality of your sales team, you create a self-perpetuating cycle of success and improvement.3. Consistent coaching: Maintaining peak performanceEven though he is a basketball superstar, LeBron James practices every day. He adheres to a rigorous training regimen because he recognizes the significance of continuous advancement. Similarly, sales professionals require consistent coaching to remain competitive.


However, consistent coaching in a remote setting requires a distinct approach. Creating a high-performing remote sales team requires virtual training programs, role-playing sales scenarios, one-on-one mentoring, regular feedback sessions, and a culture of continuous learning.Remember that coaching is about more than just developing sales skills; it is also about personal growth. Encouraging your team members to cultivate their skills outside of work can result in enhanced work performance. Improving their communication skills, emotional intelligence, or time management skills, for instance, can substantially impact their sales performance.Continuous training's significance cannot be exaggerated. According to LinkedIn's 2020 Workplace Learning Report, a staggering 94% of employees stated that they would remain with a company longer if it invested in their learning and development. Therefore, frequent coaching is a requirement if you wish to retain your top-performing sales talent.Related: Will Company Culture Suffer From the Rise of Remote Work?


4. Compounding culture: Driving sustainable growthA company's culture is the lifeblood of its operations, and it's even more crucial in a remote team. A robust and vibrant culture can make the difference between a group of disconnected individuals and a cohesive, high-performing team.Culture isn't something that happens overnight, and it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's built over time, with careful thought and attention. It's about creating a shared set of values, practices, and behaviors that unite your team, no matter where they are. It's about cultivating a sense of belonging, a shared mission, and mutual respect among team members.Creating a compounding culture means developing a positive feedback loop where good practices, behaviors, and attitudes are consistently reinforced and rewarded, leading to better performance over time. This could include acknowledging good work, celebrating wins together, and creating opportunities for team bonding.Consider virtual team-building activities or creating an online forum where team members can share non-work-related content and discussions. Encourage transparency and open communication. Implement peer recognition programs or regular shout-outs during team meetings.


With a strong, positive culture, your sales team will be more committed and motivated and become brand ambassadors, attracting even more talented individuals to your team.ConclusionCreating a successful remote sales team requires more than mastering virtual communication tools and recruiting self-motivated people. It requires a deliberate and strategic approach incorporating the four Cs: Contrarian Compensation, Captivating Recruiting Flywheel, Consistent Coaching and Compounding Culture.As you transition your sales force to a remote environment, remember the importance of fostering a culture of growth and learning. It involves changing how you recruit, coach and compensate your team. Doing so allows you to create a remote sales team that survives in the digital age and thrives.In the end, what matters is not just being the greatest in the world but also being the best for the world.

106,The 4 Stages of Competence in Sales — What You Must Know to Unlock Your Full Potential as a Sales Professional,"Jun 23, 2023",Nina Concepcion,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-4-stages-of-competence-in-sales/453353,"
Becoming a master of sales is a journey and a process. And while you learn a lot about yourself and others on that journey … it is not one that everyone persists LONG enough to reach the highest level of competence.At that level, even sales calls with the most ""difficult"" prospects become a powerful opportunity for connection, transformation and value transference.As you progress through the four different stages of competence in sales, each stage will bring its own challenges and opportunities for growth.



This article can help guide your journey toward sales mastery and significantly reduce the time it would take you if you were left to learn every lesson the hard way.Related: 5 Ways to Master Sales


Stage 1: Unconscious incompetenceThink back to when you first learned how to do something — something that you are now great at!In this initial stage, we find ourselves in a state of ""unconscious incompetence."" We are unaware of just how bad we are at something.In sales, being at this stage means that while you may have a general understanding of the sales, you likely are ""winging it"" and have no idea why you close some deals but lose many others. OR you may be stuck in analysis paralysis, unsure of what action to take, so instead you are at a standstill.Here is where we stay broke and unaware! The first step is to accept that there is room for improvement and that it is important to you (and your business) that you seek that growth.


Stage 2: Conscious incompetenceThe second stage is where we become painfully aware of the blind spots we were previously unaware of in stage 1. Stages 1 and 2 are really where the majority of entrepreneurs reside.During this stage, most experience a sense of frustration or even disappointment in themselves. It really does feel like an uphill battle without guidance, feedback and support. It feels like nothing we do seems to improve.In this stage, your attitude makes ALL the difference.Be kind but honest with yourself. Challenge yourself to step up to the plate, stretch the limits of your comfort zone, and commit to taking action — more specifically, messy action! Messy action is better than no action.


Over time, you'll start to realize that sales is not just about charisma or persuasion; it's a strategic process that can be learned, practiced and mastered with the right mindset, experience and training.Without practice, improvement and adjustments (ideally through proven strategies like working with a sales coach), it is not possible to progress to the third stage.Related: 6 Simple, Proven Methods to Improve Your Sales SkillsStage 3: Conscious competenceAt this stage, you are taking enough action to start getting the feedback to be able to discern what works and what doesn't work. It looks and feels like a mental and physical to-do list until you reach stage 4.


During this stage, you'll notice that you can navigate the sales process with intention and clarity. However ... you still have to actively think about the steps you must take your prospect through, the questions you must ask and how you respond to objections.There is still a lot of mental analysis and conscious adjustments needed here.Stage 4: Unconscious competenceThe final stage is unconscious competence — the realm of mastery.After investing time, effort and countless hours of practice, you'll reach a point where selling becomes second nature. The well-known 10k hours is the golden rule. However, with training and mentorship, it is easy to cut down this time significantly!


In the zone of mastery, we no longer need to consciously think about every step or technique. Sales becomes intuitive, and you'll effortlessly adapt to different types of people, handle all sorts of objections and close deals with ease.In this stage, it's inevitable to feel excited and energized while speaking to prospects and converting leads into sales.There is, however, no ceiling to your ability to continue to learn, grow and refine. If you want to actualize yourself more fully in any area of life, it's largely about embracing a growth mindset to consistently seek feedback and to take action on that feedback.At this stage, though, sales feels easy, seamless and effortless — because the effort you put in to get to this stage has compounded and is paying interest.Related: 8 Simple Keys to Becoming a Better SalespersonThe power of action and feedback as you move toward masteryAction is crucial — to progress through the stages of competence and ultimately achieve mastery in sales.A lot of imperfect action will ALWAYS yield a bigger result than no action.It's essential to take consistent action, implement what you've learned and put yourself out there in the marketplace.But action alone is not enough.Feedback from a trained eye is equally crucial. Just like a GPS provides instant feedback, having a mentor or coach who understands sales can guide you along your journey.They can help you navigate potential roadblocks and offer valuable insights that you will not be aware of until you hit that wall around the bend. They foresee the signs and recalculate your path within a blink of an eye.The power of tapping into unseen potentialAt each stage of sales competence, there are a few critical adjustments that, when implemented, can unlock your unseen potential and propel you to even greater heights.


It then becomes about working smarter, not harder.Understanding the four stages of competence in sales and each skill set of sales provides valuable insight into your journey of growth as a sales professional or entrepreneur.By recognizing where you are on this continuum, you can take deliberate steps to progress toward mastery. And remember, it's essential to seek feedback, embrace continuous learning and take consistent action in each stage.The journey to sales mastery may be challenging, but the rewards are well worth it. Embrace the adventure, and unleash your full sales potential!

107,3 Proven Methods of Boosting Franchise Operation Sales,"Jun 16, 2023",Dan Rowe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/3-key-methods-of-boosting-franchise-operation-sales/452926,"
The old saying goes, ""Sales cures all,"" and that may be right, but how exactly does a savvy businessperson intending to grow a franchise go about boosting their sales numbers?My inbox and social feeds are filled with ""helpful"" pitches by marketing professionals — digital marketing, PR companies, lead generators, funnels, text marketing... the list seems endless. It's vital, in considering all these come-ons, that you not confuse efforts and results.Think, for example, about how improvements in operations can compound sales growth. I call it the ""10/10/10 Method:"" By focusing on increasing daily customers, check size and visit frequency by 10% in each category, you'll juice yearly sales in a disproportionality large way.Take Five Guys: Its average franchise location does about $1.2 million in yearly sales — roughly 220 customers a day averaging about $15.00 per check. If you can attract just 22 more people a day, and manage to up-sell one additional item on each check, things change dramatically. I recently sat down with Fransmart's CFO and ran the numbers: Yearly sales would go from $1.2 million to $1.59 million — a 32% increase by being just 10% better.



Here are three ways to ensure that your 10/10/10 growth strategy is a success.1. Nail that trial periodMost of your marketing budget, particularly in the early days, will be spent on getting customers to try your concept, so great operations and loyalty programs will keep guests coming back and spending more. Sweetgreen, for example, has a loyalty program that builds revenue by charging customers for extra perks, and it works. Rest assured: people will pay good money for a quality experience.Grand openings are, of course, vital. These events are usually held between a month before and a month after you open and should be designed to create a buzz in the market. Break through the noise by being creative; add a twist to your messaging so people won't want to miss out.


Be exhaustive in your research of the local market and tie your brand's message and marketing into it. And, whether in tandem with opening events or in a separate effort, consider a discount or giveaway to give folks additional motivation to stop by. Give them a reason to invest, because good value and community support are equally vital.When that crowd inevitably shows up, capture it in every way you can — whether in photos, video — heck, rent a drone and show just how far the line goes. A giveaway or other tempting draw may be great, but there's no incentive better than the fear of missing out. If the community sees a massive line, they'll be through the door soon.Related: The 8 Rules to Live By in Franchise Marketing, According to Top Franchise CMOs2. Encourage frequencyRepeat customers are the most profitable because you don't have to re-market to them. If someone enjoyed their first experience, the instinct is to repeat it, in the process hopefully trying other products. There's no marketing or incentive needed to bring these people back through the door: Your brand is the draw.Remember that marketing is an investment in repeat customers: it's not a cost. Consider a customer who uses you two times a month and spends $10 each time: That person isn't just the $10 they spend at that moment, but $240 a year and $2,400 over ten years. And that's not even factoring in the word-of-mouth business they provide by bringing in friends.Another major component of encouraging repeat business is making sure customers can enjoy your brand in whatever way they want, which means having a quality delivery program. You may cringe at the cost of developing your own, and/or partnering with third-party apps, but remember: This isn't just about building incremental sales but building a relationship with a repeat customer who will pay full price the next time they drive by your business. That's worth an investment.


Another vital consideration: The quickest killer of repeat business is making guests feel unsafe or uncomfortable. Great marketing might get someone through the door, but if they walk through a cobweb on their way in, it's over. Ensure that locations are adhering to high standards of presentation, or all the other good work is wasted.Related: 3 Customer-Service Tips That Will Ensure Repeat Business (60-Second Video)3. Grow check averagesI once asked the founder of a popular burger brand what percentage of customers also ordered its fries and maybe a fountain beverage. ""Everyone does,"" he replied. ""Well, most everyone. I think most do."" We watched the line for the next 10 minutes, and less than one-third of the customers were also ordering fries and a drink. Why? Because there was a line out the door and the cashier was trying to move it along instead of suggesting extras.Once you have people in the door, you're failing as a business if you're not doing everything you can to maximize each sale. This is an art: You don't want to apply undue pressure, but remember that you're in business to sell, not just take orders.To that end, customer service is more than a warm smile. People want a valuable experience, and that means having their needs met. Businesses should be prepared to ask good questions, identify specific needs and offer the right products to meet them. That means making sure the staff is well-trained. Suggestive selling will lead to a better experience if it's addressing a genuine need.Many businesses are turning to kiosks now to address the need for such selling. I love Wow Bao, an Asian concept in Chicago that's nailing the ordering process. In the early days of the company, new customers were clogging the lines by asking a long series of questions when ordering, causing regulars to turn away and avoid the wait. In response, the company installed kiosks, and the check average went up by almost 20%! This has driven revenue growth while lowering labor costs and giving repeat customers a better experience… a truly winning formula.

108,How to Revive Dead Leads to Generate Sales and Growth,"Jun 15, 2023",Joel Yi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-sales-farming-can-bring-new-life-to-dead-leads/453028,"
In the fast-paced business world, there is no asset more valuable than leads, as they are the key drivers of growth and profitability. As is often the case, many leads within your CRM may become inactive and be classified as 'dead' due to their lack of recent engagement or conversion. Numerous companies prioritize investing in acquiring new leads instead of allocating resources towards re-engaging inactive prospects. As per the Harvard Business Review, retaining an existing customer is significantly more cost-effective, with a range of five to 25 times less expensive than acquiring a new one.What if you could convert these dead prospects or clients into profitable sales? Welcome to the world of 'sales farming' and revenue recovery, which has proven to be a game-changer for experts, coaches and consultants.'Sales farming' differs from the conventional 'sales hunting' strategy, which focuses predominantly on acquiring new leads. Instead, it promotes the maintenance of existing relationships and the reactivation of dormant leads. This strategy entails meticulously combing through your contact database, identifying prospects whose interest in your business has waned, and strategically reviving it.

A lead may initially go cold for various reasons, including that the timing wasn't right, the prospect wasn't ready to purchase, or your solution didn't meet their current requirements. Often, it is also a previous buyer who, over time, stopped purchasing your solutions. However, conditions alter. What a prospect or client may not have been interested in a few months ago may be exactly what they're looking for now.Therefore, these inactive leads represent a concealed treasure trove of potential business, and it is your responsibility to unearth this value.Related: How to Maximize Your Online Sales Leads

109,4 Secrets to Growth in a Tough Sales Environment,"Jun 15, 2023",Dave DeWalt,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-strategies-to-growth-in-a-tough-sales-economy/453267,"
A global economic downturn might be cooling a once blockbuster funding environment for startups, but don't let the gloomy headlines dent your growth ambitions. Technology advancements are reigniting investment activity and creating new opportunities for scrappy founders that can take advantage.The commercialization of large language models like ChatGPT is driving tremendous excitement about the future of artificial intelligence. In fact, worldwide spending on AI is now expected to hit $154 billion by the end of 2023, according to research firm IDC. And that will have a ripple effect through all areas of business.Already, investors are rushing to fund new AI startups. Meanwhile, areas like cybersecurity continue to see sustained investment. Sure, financiers are more cautious in their bets, and startups now have a mandate to run more efficiently. But the opportunity has never been better for savvy entrepreneurs to build sustainable businesses and investors to make smart — and eventually, lucrative — bets on software's next-generation.



Founders need to ensure they are preparing their own businesses to capitalize on the potential ahead. But competition is fiercer than ever. No matter what type of software they're selling, startup leaders have to intimately understand their target customer and their challenges, then build products that address all those needs in one easy-to-use and secure platform.Recently, at RSA, the largest annual gathering of cybersecurity professionals, I had the opportunity to speak to many of the industry's top entrepreneurs about the strategies they are using to hit their next financial milestones — whether that be $100 million, $500 million or $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. This built on my own experience as a four-time CEO, including three times of a public company.


Here's what I learned.Related: 10 Growth Strategies Every Business Owner Should Know1. Don't start smallIn the beginning, many founders will make the mistake of trying to target both small and large businesses. It divides the sales team and diverts attention away from the true profit center for most early-stage startups.Enterprises have a much larger appetite for experimentation. They're willing to invest in narrow applications that provide capabilities that their larger platforms can't handle — what's often referred to as ""best of breed"" systems.


Instead of wasting time chasing down customers that often don't have the budget for many new IT tools, founders should focus on solving a narrow problem for one customer segment – whether hospitals, manufacturers or retailers — then go after the largest organizations in that sector.That way, startups can quickly narrow down the total number of potential corporations' customers to target and spend the rest of the time figuring out the most effective sales approach to win their business.2. The world is hybrid. Build your product around that.It's obvious that enterprises aren't standardizing on one IT foundation. Businesses are using multiple infrastructure vendors — usually some mix of Google Cloud, AWS, Oracle, or Azure — and many still keep a small footprint of private, on-premises data centers.That means startups can no longer afford to build for just one ecosystem. They have to ensure their products work in all those different environments. The better startups can do this, the more successful they will be with customers.

Don't ignore the public sectorBack in the 1980s, Oracle nabbed the CIA as its first customer. Over four decades later, government institutions have become an even more vital launch pad for tomorrow's technology giants.There's a huge digitization push in the public sector. Around the world, governments are investing in upgrading local and national IT infrastructure, deploying new AI-powered applications and seeking to safeguard all the new software from increasingly hostile cyber adversaries. Founders should take advantage of this.Public sector customers often invest for the long haul. It's why so many vendors can build sustainable businesses just by catering to government customers. But don't underestimate the unique challenges in growing that business.


For many, it will be too difficult to build a profitable company trying to tackle both public and private-sector clients. Instead, startups should decide early-on whether which market they want to target and invest accordingly.4. Connectivity is a huge challenge for businesses — and a big opportunity for startupsFor businesses, the secret sauce to an AI future is connectivity.No longer can enterprises afford to let their technology environments run in silos. With the rapid acceleration of AI, businesses are trying to link those disparate systems together to build richer data streams that can help feed relevant and timely information to the models constantly.Of course, that's easier said than done. Many enterprises are running hundreds, if not thousands of applications. They're in multiple clouds. And they have many legacy programs to manage alongside the new digital investments. For startups, there's major growth potential for tools that can help customers deal with that complexity.


For example, in cybersecurity, companies like Claroty are growing quickly by helping customers protect their newly connected physical and digital environments — what some call ""cyber-physical"" devices — that are increasingly under attack from cybercriminals. In a hospital, this could be the medical devices used on patients, along with elevators, escalators, or oxygen machines in operating rooms.
