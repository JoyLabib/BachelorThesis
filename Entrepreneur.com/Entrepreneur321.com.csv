4,Revenue is up 40%. Why Am I Still Laying Awake at Night Worrying About Cash Flow?,"Feb 2, 2024",Dr. Sabrina Starling,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-handle-your-cash-flow-fears/468292,"
Carl came to our coaching call in a panic. Payroll was due in 3 days, and there was not enough money in his bank account to cover it. Exasperated, he commented, ""I feel like calling it quits. I'm exhausted. I don't understand why this keeps happening! I've been doing this for over ten years, and all the financial stress of owning a business is too much on top of balancing a family and our financial stress. Our revenue is up 40% compared to last year's, and I still can't pay bills. I am working harder than I was a few months ago. Just last night, my wife and I argued because we still haven't been able to do the kitchen remodel I promised her two years ago. Where will I get the money? Why does this keep happening? I have all this debt tied to my business. I want to close it all, change my name, and leave it behind.""Carl's pain is one many of us have experienced. Years ago, I struggled to figure out my business finances. It didn't make sense that the revenue was growing, but I was paying myself less than the previous year, and it was getting harder to cover payroll.When I confided this to a good friend and colleague, he suggested I allocate a percentage of all revenue to pay myself first and set aside a percentage to run the business. Although this seemed like extra work because it involved having an additional account, I realized how much I looked forward to doing my allocations a few months into doing this. It was fun to see the money I was able to pay myself. For the first time after many years of running my business, I felt rich! Reflecting on that makes me smile.



Related: 10 Expert Tips on Managing Cash Flow as a New BusinessWhat seemed like much money back then was enough for me to cover an extra month or two of my pay. It gave me hope for a better future as a business owner. About seven months into doing this, I was able to take a nine-week, fully unplugged, paid maternity leave from my business when my second daughter was born. That was incredible!


I realized that by running my business from one bank account, there were times when it looked like much money was available, so I would make large purchases and add the team to reduce my workload, thinking the business was doing well. Then, six weeks later, I struggled to pay bills and meet payroll. I had failed to account for increased payroll taxes, quarterly estimate taxes, and annual due subscriptions. I also didn't anticipate the drop in sales from my having to spend time training new team members.I was running my business from the survival trap and making decisions accordingly. These cash flow crises led me to take on work with less desirable, demanding clients to get cash in the door. The additional client work caused stress, and I questioned if I was losing money by working with them because I never seemed to get around to writing my book, The 4 Week Vacation®, which I knew would bring in better clients.Related: 5 Steps to Turning Experience (and Failure) Into WisdomI've learned much over the years of running my business in this way and sharing it with others. It's not about how much we make but how much we keep. Hustle culture would make us believe we need to grow our revenue and have more vehicles on the road, a fancy office space, and many employees. After all, those are the signs of success as an entrepreneur. Or are they? These are the very expectations that keep us from being profitable and paying ourselves appropriately.


Reflecting on Carl's challenge, it is easy for our expenses to creep up as the business grows. We start hiring to meet increased demand. This results in the need for more space and equipment. Payroll and rent are the most significant expenses.As revenue grows, our most significant opportunity lies in creating efficiency in our businesses. Running the company with a certain percentage set aside for operating expenses forces me to make decisions daily to be profitable.Related: Why Embracing Failure Is Good for BusinessLimits force innovation and creativity. When we exceed our operating expense budget, we determine how to deliver excellent service with our existing team and platforms. When we hire, we have a training plan for getting the new team member up to speed as quickly as possible, and we articulate to that team member how the key results they are responsible for contributing to profit. I like to set aside three months of the new employee's paycheck in a separate account before hiring. This gives me confidence that we can afford this team member.


As a child, my parents scrimped and saved to send me to private school. They drove me to school in our old pickup truck. I cringed seeing my peers dropped off in Mercedes and BMWs. At dinner, I'd complain about my parents' ""shortcomings."" That's when I learned a powerful life lesson.My father was a banker, and most of his customers were small business owners. They were in debt. My father informed me that it is possible to drive a BMW and be drowning in debt. Once a month, in the evening, he'd disappear into the back bedroom to make phone calls. He was calling his customers who were behind on their payments. He alluded to some of my peers' parents being his customers. My parents chose vehicles we could pay for without going into debt. Sure, we didn't have the fancy cars, but we had peace of mind.After many sleepless nights as an entrepreneur, peace of mind is priceless. There's a better, more sustainable way to run our businesses. We can design our businesses to be sustainably profitable and make choices that give us peace of mind, more time for what matters most, and a growing bank account.

11,'These Steps Are Urgent': IRS Takes Action in Wake of Record-Breaking $688 Billion Tax Gap,"Oct 13, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/irs-reveals-record-688b-tax-gap-intensifies-efforts/463631,"
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced Thursday that Americans failed to pay an estimated $688 billion in taxes owed on their 2021 returns, marking the most significant tax shortfall ever recorded, The Wall Street Journal added. The tax gap has increased by more than $192 billion from previous estimates for 2014 to 2016 and $138 billion from estimates for 2017 to 2019.Approximately $542 billion of the $688 billion total is attributed to underreported income, while the remaining portion of the tax gap is connected to individuals who failed to file their returns on time or as required ($77 billion) or filed on time but neglected to pay their tax bills in full or on time ($68 billion).The gap doesn't include late payments and IRS enforcement efforts, which the agency says are expected to generate an additional $63 billion for the 2021 tax year, resulting in a projected net tax gap of $625 billion.Related: Last Call for Tax Procrastinators: Don't Miss This Upcoming Tax Deadline or Expect to Pay These PenaltiesTo address the significant deficit, the IRS intends to intensify its audit and enforcement efforts. It will also prepare for an influx of income reporting from gig workers due to new rules governing payment apps such as Venmo and PayPal in the tax year 2023, the agency said in the release on Thursday.



""This increase in the tax gap underscores the importance of increased IRS compliance efforts on key areas,"" IRS commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement. ""These steps are urgent in many ways, including adding more fairness to the tax system, protecting those who pay their taxes and working to combat the tax gap.""

12,Last Call for Tax Procrastinators: Don't Miss This Upcoming Tax Deadline or Expect to Pay These Penalties,"Sep 19, 2023",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/dont-miss-this-upcoming-tax-deadline-or-expect-to-pay/457177,"
Millions of taxpayers requested a six-month extension to file their 2022 federal income tax return. If you're among them and haven't yet completed your return, it's time to get serious.The extension runs out on October 16. While plenty of good reasons exist to file for the initial extension, you want to avoid missing this deadline. The penalties for not filing by then can get costly, and you need to shift your focus to your 2023 return.Here's how to wrap this project up.



1. Finalize your documentationThe biggest underlying reason people seek a tax extension is that they don't have the documentation they need to file a complete, accurate return. Use these remaining months of your extension to sort through any loose ends and instill proper bookkeeping and recordkeeping systems so that you don't run into this issue in the future.Most business owners and investors are eligible for a long list of tax deductions. Make sure you have the proper documentation for any deductible expenses, such as business purchases, travel, education, training, charitable contributions and your home office. Double-check your documentation to ensure there aren't any errors or omissions before you complete your return.


The biggest deduction available to entrepreneurs and investors with real estate holdings is depreciation. Taking this deduction correctly requires substantial documentation through a cost segregation analysis — this determines the schedule for depreciating each component of the asset.Land, land improvements, buildings and building fixtures all depreciate at different rates, and a cost segregation analysis will help you accurately calculate the right amount of depreciation. For the 2022 tax year, bonus depreciation was still 100%, making this an even more powerful part of a tax strategy. But these studies take time, so make sure you are on top of this.Related: Want Taxes to Be Easy? Work on Them Year Round2. Check for possible tax creditsTax credits can be even more valuable than tax deductions because they give you a dollar-for-dollar reduction in your tax liability. Yet, many taxpayers don't take advantage of the credits for which they are eligible, either because they don't know about them or because they've received bad advice about using them. Use your extension to make sure you receive the proper tax credits on your return.


The IRS offers a lot of information about tax credits on its website, and a tax advisor should be able to guide you through the process. Some of the many tax credits of interest for entrepreneurs and investors for the 2022 tax year include:Installing solar energy systems.Buying certain electric vehicles.Creating jobs in economically distressed communities.Providing certain benefits to employees.Hiring people from groups that have faced significant barriers to employment.Investing in research and development.Making your business accessible to customers with disabilities.These are valuable tax credits — take them if they apply to you. Don't pay more tax than you are required to pay. Invest that money back into your business.Related: What Gen Z Side Hustlers Don't Know About Taxes — But Should3. Prepare your returnWhile you can use various tax software programs to prepare a return and file your taxes, entrepreneurs and investors benefit greatly from working with a high-quality tax professional. There's simply too much money at stake and too much complexity to treat your taxes as a do-it-yourself project.


If you don't have one already, look for a certified public accountant (CPA) who specializes in tax. As you speak with potential advisors, look for someone who takes a consultative approach. You don't want to feel like just another transaction. You want a tax advisor who will be a trusted member of your wealth strategy team.Related: 6 Steps to Make Tax Season As Painless as PossibleWhat happens if you don't file?It gets expensive. Being just a day late can turn into a penalty equal to 26% of the taxes you owed back in April.If you're still not ready to file your taxes by the October 15 deadline, you absolutely should be working with a tax advisor to navigate the situation. Your advisor will help you in two key ways. First, it's possible you can get an additional extension. These are rare and mainly apply to people living outside of the U.S. or serving in a combat zone, but it's worth checking. Second, and most importantly, a high-quality tax advisor will help you create a plan to get your taxes back on track.


Sticking your head in the sand is not a tax strategy, and facing your tax situation doesn't have to be frustrating or confusing. A good advisor will help you understand the tax law so that you can use it in a way that gives the government what it wants while also legally and permanently reducing the amount that you need to pay.The government wants people to invest in seven key categories (business, technology, energy, real estate, insurance, agriculture and retirement), and it offers great tax incentives to people who do so. Your tax advisor should be talking with you regularly about how you can build these investments into your wealth and tax strategy.

13,The IRS Is Using Artificial Intelligence to Catch Millionaires Dodging Taxes,"Sep 11, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/irs-uses-ai-to-fight-tax-evasion-millionaires-dodging-taxes/458884,"
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a new partner in assisting the crackdown on illegal tax practices: artificial intelligence.The agency is now using AI to investigate tax evasion in large partnerships, including hedge funds, private equity groups, real estate investors, and major law firms, The New York Times reported. The initiative is part of the IRS's efforts to enhance its ability to tackle and address nuanced cases that had previously overwhelmed the agency. The IRS plans to initiate examinations into 75 of the nation's largest partnerships identified with AI assistance.""These are complex cases for I.R.S. teams to unpack,"" Daniel Werfel, the I.R.S. commissioner, told the outlet. ""The I.R.S. has simply not had enough resources or staffing to address partnerships; in a real sense, we've been overwhelmed in this area for years.""



Fueled by $80 billion allocated through the Inflation Reduction Act, the agency aims to increase federal revenue by targeting tax evasion and sophisticated accounting practices used to avoid tax payments — cases that in the past the IRS didn't have the resources to handle given limited resources.The focus on partnerships is part of a broader IRS effort to scrutinize wealthier taxpayers in 2024, focusing on pursuing millionaires with significant unpaid taxes. Additionally, the IRS intends to increase scrutiny of digital assets and investigate how high-income taxpayers use foreign bank accounts to avoid disclosing financial information, according to the report.


This isn't the first time AI has piqued the interest of government institutions. As the availability and use of AI have become mainstream, countless industries have adopted the technology to carry out everyday tasks or combat ones that were previously onerous.Last week, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order calling on the California Department of Technology and other agencies to study the use of generative AI by state workers, create training programs for its utilization, as well as recognize the potential risks and benefits of emerging AI technology for the state government, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.""This is a potentially transformative technology — comparable to the advent of the internet — and we're only scratching the surface of understanding what GenAI is capable of,"" Newsom said in a statement, per The Chronicle. ""We recognize both the potential benefits and risks these tools enable.""

15,There's A New Trend In Healthcare That's Saving Money For Small Businesses,"Jul 21, 2023",Gene Marks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/theres-a-new-trend-in-healthcare-thats-saving-money-for/455756,"
I am seeing a growing number of my smaller clients canceling their health insurance plans. Why? Because for them — and others — there's a better option.It's no secret that providing health insurance is a major — and oftentimes insurmountable cost — for many small business owners. I have a number of clients that contribute to their employees' healthcare — sometimes as much as 100% for individuals — and this can run tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. And there's no end in sight.A recent survey from employee benefits consultants Buck found that on top of prior year-after-year increases, healthcare costs will go up yet again between 6-7 % – and to many of my clients, that's a good year! Each year, they're faced with the same, volatile, uncontrollable and seemingly uncontainable challenge to control these costs and this year is no different. This is why more than half of small businesses find themselves unable to offer health benefits – and lose talent as a result.



And it's not just the cost of premiums. There's also the cost of administrative and lost opportunity time. There's the seemingly fruitless search for better prices in what is clearly an oligarchic market made up of just a very few large providers. It's the awkwardness — and potential privacy concerns - of knowing your employees' health histories which oftentimes figures into the premiums we pay. And it's the time we spend trying to find alternative ways to make healthcare more affordable through add-on schemes like Health Savings and Flexible Spending Accounts.The good news is that there's an alternative and a growing number of my clients are learning about it. It's called Individual Health Reimbursement Accounts — or ICHRAs.


Related: Healthcare is in Turmoil, But Technology Can Save Businesses BillionsThese types of plans are becoming enormously popular with small businesses. So popular that the Department of Health and Human Services forecasts that approximately 800,000 employers will offer these types of plans to almost 11 million employees over the next few years. A recent report from the HRA Council — a consortium of health benefit firms — found that these types of plans have grown 350% since 2020, and are ""doubling on average among all states, with significant growth across all industries, employer types and employee groups"" and that companies with 20 or fewer employers are accounting for 90% of their adoption.According to Jack Hooper, the chairman of the board for the HRA Council and CEO and founder of benefits administrator Take Command, the number of large employers switching to ICHRAs has grown exponentially but ""small and medium-sized businesses are leading the charge to deliver much-needed innovation in the benefits space, consumer empowerment and choice for employees, and cost control and flexibility for employers.""Why so popular? ICHRAs not only cut healthcare costs, but they help employers get out of the healthcare business altogether.


With an ICHRA, you're likely going to pay the same premiums (it's up to you), but this time by a contribution to an employee's account that's setup under the plan. But that's it - the rest is up to the employee. Your employee gets reimbursed by you — pretax like any other health plan and you get a tax deduction for your contribution. But now it's on them to get their own healthcare insurance either through their state or federal healthcare exchange or through an independent insurance broker (some of my clients provide their employees with recommended firms that do this).There's no more deciphering the ins and outs of complicated health plans. There's no more negotiation with healthcare providers. There are no more privacy issues. There's no more internal administration (most of my clients outsource this work to firms that handle these plans). Basically, you just reimburse the employee and you're done with healthcare. Amounts contributed stay with the employer if a worker leaves. And if you're having a bad year and feel like contributing less, you can do that too without switching plans, although you may suffer the wrath of your workforce, so be careful!Related: Health Care Is Now the Top Concern for Small BusinessesWith ICHRAs, employees have more flexibility in their health plan choices and aren't dependent on what an employer is providing. Remote workers may be able to get better deals on their health insurance depending on what's offered in their state. They can choose how much they want to spend and their employers can choose to reimburse for additional costs like prescriptions or mental health coverage.


Because they're easier to understand and offer a less-expensive option for employees, younger workers are participating in these plans at a rate greater than their older counterparts. The HRA Council report found that 57% of employees accepting an HRA (which includes either ICHRAs or QSEHRAs — a similar, but less flexible plan that an employer can offer directly to workers) to fund their marketplace health insurance are between 18 and 44, with the largest age cohort being 26 through 34 for each year since 2020.ICHRAS are ""causing a seismic shift in the employer-sponsored group market — addressing employers' needs to significantly control costs and opening the doors for employees to be more informed healthcare consumers,"" John Kelly, CEO and founder of healthcare benefits provider Nexben, a benefits tech firm, told HR Executive. ""ICHRAs are the 401(k) of health benefits.""Why am I so bullish on these plans? Because they allow even the smallest of businesses to provide some type of healthcare coverage for their existing and prospective employees instead of just throwing up their hands and saying, ""we can't afford this."" In these times of tight labor, you can't not have an answer when someone asks you about your healthcare benefits. With an ICHRA you've got an answer. A good answer. Which is why I'm seeing so many of my clients take advantage of this option over the past few years.

17,"Want Taxes to Be Easy? Work on Them Year Round, Not Last Minute.","Jul 10, 2023",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/want-taxes-to-be-easy-work-on-them-year-round-not-last/452440,"
Taxes aren't just a once-a-year phenomenon. Filing taxes begins with a plan and a daily routine. If your goal is to learn a language so you can visit a foreign country, learning in small, easy-to-digest segments makes it easy to absorb and retain. When you finally take your trip, it's that much more rewarding.The same is true of taxes. Attacking them in the handful of days before they're due is a formula for stress, error and failure. Breaking down tax-related recordkeeping and related tasks into smaller segments, such as reviewing receipts and invoices an hour a week, makes the process more manageable and less overwhelming. Keeping taxes on your radar all year can even be good for your overall finances.Related: Make Tax Season As Painless as Possible by Taking These 6 Steps



Make a regular tax thingHave you ever skipped mowing your lawn for a few weeks? Suddenly, it's up to your knees, the grass gets stuck in your blades and it takes way longer than it should. The same is true of handling your tax-related finances. If you document and file your receipts and invoices when they're fresh in your mind, they're easy to account for properly. That's why you should look at them regularly — how regularly will depend on how much work there is. I recommend looking at everything at least once a month, but if you're doing a lot of business, you may want to do it every two weeks or even weekly. Just make it part of your routine.An excellent way to handle that is to write down an appointment in your business calendar. Writing it down will help in multiple ways. You should also physically write down what you must address at each session.


When you do that, you can also use the information to look forward. This can be really useful if your income differs from month to month. By seeing what you brought in in the past month, you can:Get a better idea of what your year-end income will be.See whether you may fall short and address that before it's a severe problem.Know which clients are your best.When you know whether your year-end income looks like it will be much different from your previous year or what you expected, you can make plans to have money ready to pay at the end of the year or make adjustments to your estimated tax payments.If you find you'll have more money than you expect, it also provides an opportunity to make investments. You can buy something that will help the business — or even take a larger share home.Don't lose the paperworkYour routine attention to tax-related paperwork will pay off at tax time. This is true whether you'll be doing the filing, an employee will or a tax accountant will. Record the expenses that will count as deductions at your regular session closest to when they happen. This will include regular outlays such as rent; variable outlays such as utilities or internet (note the Internal Revenue Service rules if you're declaring the costs for a home office versus a traditional office or facility); and your business phone. One of the easiest expenses to lose track of is business mileage. Entering mileage and the reason for travel will make things easier when it's time to file.


This is where a document management system (DMS) will help. When your business calendar says it's time to attend to your tax-related recordkeeping, you only need to capture all the relevant documents. Whether it's an invoice, a checking account statement, a receipt or any other support you'll need for the IRS, the best DMS will pull all the data in.Leveraging optical character reading (OCR), such a solution will work from cell phone photographs, existing computer files and email attachments. Then, once the data are stored in the cloud, you can categorize your paperwork by type and manipulate them to produce reports you can use, such as expense or income statements. These also reduce errors that make the IRS unhappy and can result in fines and penalties. And, should the IRS wish to conduct an audit, all of those data will be easily accessible and organized. The IRS even prefers electronic records.Related: 3 Ways to Save Money on Taxes That Most Entrepreneurs MissJust a little bit goes a long wayProductivity experts from David Allen to Tony Robbins and publications like Harvard Business Review and Psychology Today have pointed out that the best way to accomplish a large task is to break it down into smaller ones. Short, productive bursts of time will move you inexorably to the finish line as the year progresses. Visual cues, like a Post-It note on your computer, can help you make year-round tax record management a habit. Be specific about your tasks. Mnemonics help; maybe ""Taco Tuesday"" becomes ""Tax Record Tuesday."" With almost no pain, you'll be prepared when tax season begins. While the procrastinators around you are pulling at their hair and biting their nails, you'll be doing things directly relevant to your business — with every hair in place and nails intact.

18,These Are the U.S. Cities Where High-Earners Have the Most (And Least) Purchasing Power,"Jun 20, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/us-cities-where-your-salary-is-worth-the-most-and-least/454460,"
A six-figure salary may seem like a lot, but depending on where you live, your take-home pay might only be a quarter of your earnings after accounting for taxes and the cost of living.A new report by financial technology company SmartAsset found that the purchasing power of a $250,000 salary drastically varied based on location.The city where a $250,000 salary was worth the least was New York—those six digits dwindled down to a mere $82,421 after factoring in taxes and the cost of living—followed by Honolulu ($82,672) and San Francisco ($82,776).



Related: While Rent Prices Dropped Around the Country, Manhattan Hit a New Record HighThe cities where high-earners take home the most of their $250,000 salaries are Memphis, TN which came in at No. 1 with $203,664, followed by El Paso, TX ($200,180), and Oklahoma City, OK ($197,381).


SmartAsset used its paycheck calculator to determine the take-home pay of 76 of America's largest cities and then adjusted the take-home amount to factor in the average cost of living for each of the locations. The three cities (New York, Honolulu, and San Francisco) where high-earners lose most of their salary to taxes and other expenses were also the only cities in the report where workers' six-figure salary was reduced to five digits after taxes and costs.Here are the U.S. cities where the value of a $250,000 salary is worth the most and least.Where $250,000 goes the furthest:1.

19,How You Structure Your Business to the IRS Can Affect More Than Your Tax Bill. Here's What You Need to Know.,"Jun 5, 2023",Nellie Akalp,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-you-structure-your-business-to-the-irs-matters-heres/450527,"
The business formation structure you chose at startup may no longer be the best one for your business. As you grow, your company's legal entity can affect your tax bill, personal assets and ability to attract investors, raise money and expand your business.Those are many variables, so let's explore your options.Related: Which Business Structure Is Right for You?



Sole proprietorshipsMost startups in the U.S. start — and stay — as sole proprietorships. Of 33 million U.S. small businesses, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says 28.3 million are nonfarm sole proprietorships.Sole proprietorships are the simplest form of legal business entity. The setup process is easy. While sole proprietorships without employees don't need an Employer Identification Number (EIN), it's recommended since many banks won't let you open a business account without one.


There is a downside, however. There is no legal separation between a sole proprietor and the business. So, you are personally liable for any debts, obligations and lawsuits against your company. If your company is sued, your personal assets (property, bank accounts, etc.) can be at risk.For tax purposes, sole proprietors report their profits and losses on their individual tax returns (IRS Forms 1040) and attach a Schedule C Profit or Loss From Business, showing income, expenses and allowable tax deductions. In addition to income taxes, sole proprietors pay self-employment taxes of 12.4% for social security and 2.9% for Medicare. Taxes are due April 15.PartnershipsMany entrepreneurs start businesses with family or friends or look for partners when their businesses grow. Like sole proprietorships, there is no legal separation between the partners and the company, so the partners' personal assets are at risk if something goes wrong.Unless specified differently in the partnership agreement, all partners are equally responsible for paying taxes. Partnerships use IRS Form 1065, Schedule K, to list partners and the business's revenues and expenses. Plus, all partners must pay self-employment and estimated taxes. Partnership tax returns are due March 15.


Related: 5 Tips for Structuring Your New Business Like a ProLLCs offer liability protectionAs their businesses grow, many entrepreneurs become uncomfortable with their personal assets being at risk and explore incorporating their companies.There are two ways to incorporate: forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or a C Corporation. Both structures are considered separate legal entities and protect business owners from the company's liabilities, shielding their personal assets.Owners of LLCs are called members. Single-member LLCs are taxed like sole proprietorships using tax form 1040 and Schedule C. Multi-member LLCs are taxed like partnerships and use partnership forms 1065 and Schedule K and K-1. LLC members must still pay self-employment taxes. You can also opt for an S Corp election (see below).


You must file Articles of Organization with your state to form an LLC. And while not required, it's recommended that you create an operating agreement. An operating agreement defines the roles and responsibilities of a multi-member LLC.LLCs are becoming increasingly popular due to their relatively simple management structure, fewer compliance requirements and flexible tax treatment. They're essentially a ""have your cake and eat it too"" option. For instance, multi-member LLCs can allocate percentages of the company's profits and losses to the members as they see fit.LLCs have fewer and less complex compliance responsibilities than C Corps. They don't have to elect officers or a board of directors. There are some ongoing compliance requirements — check with your state to learn more.The biggest disadvantage of owning an LLC is that you can't issue company stock, making it more challenging to raise money.


C Corps offer robust liability protectionAs your business grows, you may want stronger liability protection and opt to form a C Corporation. While C Corps are more complex to form and operate, they provide the most robust liability protection for the company's shareholders. C Corps must file Articles of Incorporation in the state where you operate.A C Corp is a separate business entity and files a tax return on its profits and losses using IRS Form 1120. But the owners/shareholders are considered corporation employees, receive W-2s and are taxed as individual taxpayers, often called ""double taxation.""However, C Corps can deduct employee-related costs, like wages, health care, retirement plans, operational expenses and fringe benefits like company cars. Ultimately, the current C Corp flat tax rate of 21% may be lower than what sole proprietorships and partnerships pay,In C Corps, the company and its employees each contribute 6.2% of the employee's wages to Social Security and 1.45% to Medicare. Plus, employers contribute to their state-run unemployment insurance funds (SUI).


It's easier to raise money and attract investors since C Corps can offer unlimited numbers of shares and multiple classes of stock.C Corps typically have higher registration costs and more compliance requirements, including adopting bylaws, submitting annual reports, holding shareholder and board of director meetings and more.Related: The 5 Biggest Tax Differences Between an LLC and CorporationThe S Corp tax electionLLCs and C Corps can elect to be taxed as S Corporations, allowing them to divide profits into wages and dividends. While dividend distributions aren't subject to employment taxes, shareholders must be paid reasonable compensation as defined by the IRS. Electing to be taxed as an S Corp can lower your overall tax bill while maintaining liability protection. S Corps use IRS Form 1120-S, and tax returns are due on March 15. To elect S Corp status, you must file IRS Form 2553 no later than March 15 of the tax year the election is to take effect.


However, only American citizens and residents can be S Corp shareholders, and only 100 shares can be issued, so check with your accountant before choosing this path.Get adviceIt's crucial to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the different business structures. For many entrepreneurs, the liability protection and possible tax savings outweigh the added costs and complexity of incorporation.With so much at stake, it's recommended that you consult with your accountant or attorney to help determine which structure is best for your business today and for future growth.

20,6 Common Scenarios When You Might Need a Tax Attorney — and Why You Should Hire One Sooner Than Later,"Jun 2, 2023",Anthony Cavaluzzi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/6-common-scenarios-when-you-might-need-a-tax-attorney/452190,"
Tax attorneys specialize in matters of tax law. These laws continually evolve and change, often making compliance a challenge. If you find yourself or your business up against complex tax challenges, facing issues with the IRS or simply want tax time to go a little smoother, a tax attorney can often be a powerful resource of expertise.Here are a few notable reasons you might consider the help of a tax attorney in the months ahead.Related: Why Business Lawyers Are a Necessary Expense



1. You are starting a businessIf you're launching a business but are also new to the process, hiring a tax attorney can provide the guidance needed to navigate the tax obligations that come with it. This includes ensuring compliance with federal tax laws and any state and local tax requirements likely to impact your enterprise. Having an advocate in your corner can provide the insight and support needed to understand your options while avoiding costly mistakes throughout each phase of the rollout.Protecting your business, finances and assets requires preparation and adequate structuring. Some business transactions carry sizable tax consequences — and without knowing the potential implications, you could find yourself owning the IRS and state agencies more than you realize.


With the help of the right tax attorney, you're often much better equipped to:Structure your company as a corporation, partnership or limited liability companyHandle capital gains and lossesDeduct off non-performing assetsStructure profit-sharing or constructing pension plansRegardless of the size or scope of your new business, how you approach tax management is key to avoiding problems and maximizing opportunity. An experienced tax attorney can help refine that approach and design a plan that positions you for success.2. You are facing an IRS auditBusiness owners aren't the only people who can benefit from the help of a tax lawyer. While corporate partners or business owners are sometimes forced to undergo an IRS audit, anyone at nearly anytime is susceptible to audit notification. If this is your situation, you may hire an attorney to communicate with the agency and auditors on your behalf. You may use IRS Form 2848 to provide the tax lawyer power of attorney and represent you before the IRS.Your legal representative has the power to receive tax information for the matter in question and the current tax year, though you can extend their access to additional reporting periods by listing them on the form. The right attorney can also help appeal some of the actions taken by the IRS after an audit and help you settle a debt or make an offer in compromise with the IRS.


Please note that a CPA is not the same as a tax attorney. While certified professional accountants generally help with such tasks as initial tax preparation and minimizing the risk of an audit, such professionals typically aren't certified legal professionals and, therefore, can't represent you in court. Tax attorneys help you with tax compliance and defense.Related: What I Learned From a Two-Year IRS Audit3. You are seeking tax-exempt statusA Section 501©(3) status is for non-profit organizations like charities, private schools, churches and private foundations. Not every organization is eligible for this tax exemption status, and a tax attorney can guide you through the IRS application process for nonprofit status. Depending on the nature of your organization, there are different forms to complete and an attorney can help determine your eligibility for a particular sector.4. You are handling estate taxes or probate mattersTax attorneys can handle estate planning and the taxes related to decisions before or after an individual passes away. If your plan is to leave your business or related assets to a spouse or children, there are tax laws that could take a sizable portion of their funds away. Estate taxes are a concern that a tax attorney can address when you are estate planning.


If you are the recipient of an inheritance, you may have additional tax liabilities. If you don't know where you may be liable, hiring a tax attorney can provide the expertise to understand and navigate those obligations without running afoul of the IRS. It's common for people to utilize both a CPA and a tax attorney throughout such a process.5. You are facing a tax-related investigationIf you've been charged with tax fraud and are under criminal investigation by the IRS, it may be best to consider the help of a professional. Convictions of tax fraud often come with hefty fines and sometimes even significant prison time, making it important to have the best representation possible. Additionally, tax attorneys don't have to testify against their clients, something that can't be said about a CPA. Tax attorneys can also help fight a tax lien and work out tax debt payment options.6. You are unable to meet your tax burdenOwing money to the IRS can put you and your business in a difficult position, especially when the IRS demands payment terms you can't meet. Falling behind on your tax burden complicates the problem, but a tax attorney can help. Your attorney can help gather evidence to build a case for a smaller payment or debt plan, potentially negotiating lower payments and a more reasonable period of time for debt repayment.Related: All Business Entities Are Not Created Equal: Finding the Perfect One for You


Facing your tax concerns with a tax attorneyTax attorneys can help you find relief from legal action taken by the IRS. They can also work with you to proactively prevent tax law issues. But no matter your situation or needs, working with a tax attorney can help ensure you and your business are prepared for any tax-related challenges that lie ahead.

The start of every new year inevitably means that tax filings are around the corner. For any accountant and bookkeeper, Q1 is their busiest time of the year because tax season is in high gear. If you're self-employed, you're probably starting to receive those 1099s from your various side hustles, projects and gigs.According to a survey, 33% of Americans procrastinate in doing their taxes and wait until the last minute. It also found that millennials are the most likely to procrastinate on filing their taxes compared to other generations. Who can blame them? It's a lot of work and generates stress and anxiety for most people.The IRS notes that self-employed people spend an average of 24 hours preparing their taxes. Aside from the time-suck and the anxiety that tax-prep creates, it's also rife with accounting and tax-filing uncertainties, as well as the onus of knowing what deductions qualify and meeting deadlines to avoid penalties. From our internal studies, 18% of freelancers pay fines for not paying quarterly tax returns.Related: The 3 Best Ways to Save on Taxes When You Have Multiple Business Ventures

24,Meet the TikToker Who Went From Sleeping in His Truck to Starting a 7-Figure Tax Business,"Apr 6, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-a-tiktoker-went-from-homeless-to-7-figure-business-owner/449111,"
Today, 28-year-old Duke Alexander Moore is living many a millennial entrepreneur's dream: He's successfully zeroed in on his niche and is using social media to turn a major profit.The founder of seven-figure business Duke Tax, a membership-based tax service for creators, influencers and entrepreneurs, Moore parlays his extensive tax knowledge into content for his TikTok account @dukelovestaxes, which presents critical tax tips with an entertaining flair to its 3.4 million followers.But the path to becoming a multi-million-dollar business owner wasn't a straightforward one.



Despite having an entrepreneurial spirit for as long as he can remember (he sold CDs, complete with graphics and labels, in elementary school), Moore found himself at a difficult crossroads after college. ""I got in trouble because I was selling things I was not supposed to be selling,"" he tells Entrepreneur. Having a record made finding employment difficult. In 2014, at 24, Moore had secured a job at a warehouse as a forklift driver, but he was deeply unhappy.


In 2018, when Moore's boss screamed at him one day for finding a more efficient way to complete a task that wasn't ""the right way,"" he broke down — and realized it was time to strike out on his own.Related: The Complete, 12-Step Guide to Starting a Business | Entrepreneur""At an early age, I was self-taught: taxes, bookkeeping and write-offs.""Moore knew that he needed to ""become an expert in something"" if he was going to succeed. So he began to consider what he liked — and was already good at.Moore had ""enjoyed numbers"" since he was a child playing with multiplication machines. He was also familiar with navigating the tax system: As a teenager, he'd modeled for the Campbell Agency, which meant he'd had to file as an independent contractor.


""That's how I originally got involved with taxes,"" Moore explains, ""because at an early age, I was self-taught: taxes, bookkeeping and write-offs, just learning all that jam.""Committed to his new venture, Moore trained with QuickBooks, the accounting software developed by Intuit, to become a pro advisor. That designation allowed him to be listed in QuickBooks' directory and have business sent his way.Then, when one of Moore's first clients requested help with her taxes, he decided to get some official expertise in that area as well. In 2019, he became an enrolled agent — the highest credential the IRS awards.But in those early days, it still wasn't enough to make ends meet. ""During that period, I experienced homelessness for a couple months,"" he says. ""It was very, very tough…I slept on the street two or three times, but most of the time I was either sleeping in my truck or at a friend's house.""


Related: How Andres Pira Went From Homeless on the Beach to Real Estate Tycoon""[TikTok] took me from zero to seven figures.""Moore, who ""refuses to take no for an answer,"" wasn't willing to give up on his business.At the time, Moore, like millions of Americans, would often scroll through TikTok. And what he discovered on the app would ultimately change the trajectory of his career and life.""I'll never forget, I saw this one tax video [on TikTok],"" Moore says. ""I'm like, Okay, I'm in taxes. I can do that too.""


So he decided to give it a try. Moore started with a tax series, replicating some of what he'd seen on the app. But the content wasn't sticking, and Moore's confidence was low. ""I was very nervous in front of the camera,"" he recalls. ""Very shy. It was so bad. I don't even know how I can just pick up a camera today. It would take me almost a day to record one video.""When [someone's] scrolling the For You page, how do you make your video fit in with everyone else's videos?Then he began to take a closer look at the kind of content that was performing on the app.""TikTok is a really entertaining and engaging app,"" Moore says. ""So when [someone's] scrolling the For You page, how do you make your video fit in with everyone else's videos? Could you imagine someone dancing or making a skit, and [then] you have someone like, 'Hey, you need to file your taxes.' You'd be like, Oh my God, skip. Block.""


On a mission to up his content's entertainment factor, Moore scrolled for inspiration — and found it in the form of someone wearing a bath towel on their head. Moore followed suit, putting a towel on his own head, and continued to talk taxes.The unconventional move was successful — incredibly so. After that point, Moore's account ballooned, growing to three million followers in just a year and a half. ""Then it took me from zero to seven figures,"" he says.@dukelovestaxes Claiming your BF/GF on your taxes #taxtok #taxnews #taxes #tax #dukelovestaxes ♬ original sound - Duke TaxRelated: 3 Ways To Go Viral on TikTok With Audio | Entrepreneur


""[Duke Tax's] goal is to be your protector and have you pay the least amount of tax possible.""As Moore continued to expand his business, it became clear that many CPA firms don't fully understand content creator taxes. In fact, confusion often comes from both sides. Many creators don't realize they're running a business; they owe money and are eligible for deductions, just like any other business owner, Moore says.Moore set out to fill the tax-service gap for creators, and today, Duke Tax focuses primarily on helping them and entrepreneurs with their taxes.Creators are business owners, so Moore helps them behave accordingly: setting up an entity structure, like an LLC, and keeping proper books.""This IRS thing is just a game,"" Moore says. ""They want to have you pay the most amount of tax possible — that's the game. [Duke Tax's] goal is to be your protector and have you pay the least amount of tax possible. There's not much we can do without bookkeeping.""


Moore also stresses how important it is for creators to reinvest their earnings, as there's no guarantee the brand deals will keep coming.Perhaps better than most, Moore understands that no entrepreneurial endeavor comes without uncertainty and challenges, but the willingness to keep going — no matter what — is what sets apart those who find success.""My No. 1 lesson I preach at all times is progress, not perfection,"" Moore says. ""There are so many times we focus on the perfection of things, which [prevents us from] actually getting the thing done. It's repetition that makes perfection. Go out there and make mistakes. It sounds weird, but every time I make a mistake, I always learn something.""Related: Keep Going: How to Avoid Burnout as an Entrepreneur | Entrepreneur

25,4 Essentials for Selecting the Perfect Business Real Estate,"Mar 31, 2023",Dan Rowe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-essentials-for-selecting-the-perfect-business-real-estate/447309,"
You've heard the old saying, ""You can't judge a book by its cover."" Actually, that's not always true; customers judge a book by its cover all the time. In many cases, your business's real estate and its curb appeal are the first messages being sent. Do customers notice your establishment? Do they understand the business by looking at it from 500 feet away? Is its image compelling?That's why the right real estate is often the first marketing tactic to consider — certainly for any retail or restaurant enterprise. If you don't stand out, even on the busiest roads, you're in trouble. That's in part why, at Fransmart, we include marketing plans in the real estate approval process, because once a lease is signed on a bad property, it's too late to fix.And here's a chance to learn from my mistakes. Early in my career, I was opening a restaurant in Silicon Valley and secured a site directly across from Google's headquarters. I was elated: The property tested off the charts in terms of population density and disposable income. What could go wrong?Here's what we never considered: Google feeds their employees for free — employs world-class chefs to make incredible food throughout the day. We had direct access to one of the largest workforces in the country, and couldn't break through because none of them were hungry. Dumb mistake.



A bad site can never be cheap enough, while good sites pay you, so take your time to thoroughly vet locations, including carefully assessing the trade areas and traffic patterns at different parts of the day (and on several different days).A few other critical factors to keep in mind before locking your brand into its next location.Related: How AI Will Transform the Real Estate Market


1. AccessMost first-time business owners don't realize that there are two sides to every street: a breakfast side and a dinner side. Starbucks, for example, is precise with placement — often sitting on busy roads that lead directly to freeways, and always on the side of the road that leads to the freeway in the morning. If your business isn't positioned to take advantage of a target demographic while they're on the road, then you've set it up for failure. Also, customers prefer right turns over lefts, and if a site requires a left turn to access, it better be a well-lit one.Lastly, with the rise of third-party delivery apps, a site must be convenient for delivery drivers and take-out orders. The wrong property could cause a logjam in the parking lot, causing customers and delivery drivers to avoid it.2. VisibilityMy business is located on a busy street in Scottsdale, Arizona named Scottsdale Road, with more than 50,000 cars traveling each way every day. Your business is a free billboard on such busy roads, so make sure the location stands out. Think about the streets you normally drive on, now try to remember which brands on them you recall (likely a small percentage).Know the area where you're opening like the back of your hand. What are the traffic patterns and major landmarks? Placing your business where it can be seen by the most possible people should always be the goal.Also, consider orientation. The building should be oriented so that its branding is clear and easily seen. (Being in front of a strip center's entrance would be a goal, for example).Related: 4 Reasons New Franchisees Fail (and How to Succeed)


3. Co-tenancyThere's a potentially fatal incongruity in, say, placing a high-end hipster café in a K-Mart-anchored shopping center. A brand needs to be congruent with nearby businesses. It's not enough to simply be in a strip center, busy mall or crowded airport.Certainly, the evolution of outdoor malls or other shopping centers has opened opportunities for restaurant and retail franchises to find a home, but the downside is that competition has never been higher. So, finding the right spot with the right co-tenancies is a strategy you need to master. Centers with landmark retail anchors like Whole Foods, Home Depot or AMC Theaters are perfect — typically attracting large, diverse crowds of potential customers.4. ParkingYour building can look incredible, but if you don't have the space to accommodate visiting traffic, you're doomed. With the rise of delivery and take-out orders, having parking space to manage sudden influxes (such as heavy dinner rushes) is essential, and properties should be planned accordingly.Keep in mind, too, that structured parking is a restaurant killer: It's hard to navigate, often crowded and a hotbed for accidents and car damage. What's worse — the common perception is that garages are unsafe: dense, dark and out of view of the public. Deliveries are also exponentially more difficult if you rely on them. Surface parking, by contrast, offers quick access and easy visibility.Related: 5 Mistakes Franchisees Make When Looking for Business Real EstateOne last tip: If you're renting in a shopping center or outdoor mall, finding space near a business with a different rush period can make all the difference. If the bulk of your business is done in the evening, finding a site near a coffee shop or breakfast restaurant can be a boon for parking.

26,Everything You Need to Know About Filing Your Taxes 2023,"Mar 30, 2023",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/when-are-taxes-due-2023-and-other-questions-answered/448638,"
Benjamin Franklin said it first: ""In this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes.""Although Tax Day occurs every year without fail, it can still be daunting. Regardless of if you hire an accountant, use tax-filing software or file your taxes the old-fashioned way, it's best to be prepared so that you don't face any surprises this tax season.Why is Tax Day 2023 on April 18 instead of 15? Tax Day 2023 is April 18. Historically, Tax Day falls on April 15 — however, this year the 15th is a Saturday and the next weekday is April 17, which is Emancipation Day in Washington, D.C. By law, Washington, D.C. holidays impact tax deadlines the same way federal holidays do.



When is the deadline for an extension? Those who cannot file before or on April 18 can apply for an extension and will have until October 15, 2023, to file income taxes. However, be mindful that an extension does not mean you have extra time to pay any taxes owed; it simply means you have more time to submit your tax forms. If you owe money, it's wise to file your taxes on time to avoid any penalties.Related: What Gen Z Side Hustlers Don't Know About Taxes in 2023 — But Should


What changes are made to Tax Day 2023? Some tax credits such as the Child Tax Credit (CTC), Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child and Dependent Care Credit will return to 2019 levels, meaning those who qualify might receive a smaller refund than last year.Those who received a $3,600 credit per dependent in 2021 for the CTC will, if eligible, get $2,000 for the 2022 tax year.Eligible taxpayers with no children who received roughly $1,500 in 2021 for the EITC will receive $500 in 2022.The Child and Dependent Care Credit returns to a maximum of $2,100 in 2022; it was $8,000 in 2021.When will I get my tax refund after filing? The IRS issues most tax refunds less than 21 calendar days after filing. However, if you file on paper and not electronically, it could take up to four weeks to receive your refund.Related: 10 Important Tax Numbers Every Business Owner Should Know to Save Big on Their Taxes This YearHow to file your taxes if you moved mid-year or work remotely:Because the pandemic changed workplace norms irrevocably, many people have relocated. If you moved or changed locations during the past year while still working for the same employer, follow these tips to ensure you file correctly.


Determine your residency status: If you move to a new state and change addresses, you may become a resident of that state for tax purposes. However, if your permanent address is in your previous state and you spend a significant amount of time there, you might still be considered a resident of the former state and need to file taxes there.Gather your tax documents: Collect all the tax documents that you received from your employers, banks and other sources of income. Make sure you have documents from both the state you left and the state you moved to.Determine if you need to file state taxes in multiple states: Depending on your residency status and the amount of income you earned in each state, you may need to file state taxes in both your previous state and your new state. Check the tax laws for each state to determine your filing requirements.Use tax software or hire a tax professional: Filing taxes can be complicated, especially when you move mid-year. Consider using tax software or hiring a tax professional to help you navigate the process and ensure you file correctly.File your federal taxes: Regardless of where you lived and worked during the year, you must file your federal taxes. Use your W-2 forms and other tax documents to file your federal tax return.File your state taxes: If you need to file state taxes in multiple states, make sure to file the correct forms for each state. Follow the instructions provided by each state's tax agency and pay any taxes owed.For more general tax questions and guidance, see this guide.

27,What Gen Z Side Hustlers Don't Know About Taxes in 2023 — But Should,"Mar 29, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/what-gen-z-side-hustlers-dont-know-about-taxes-but/448450,"
It's that time of year again: tax season.If you love it for its refund potential or hate it for its tediousness and/or cost, knowing how to navigate it successfully is key to saving you money and time ahead of the April 18 deadline. What's more, it's important to keep in mind that some things about paying taxes remain the same year after year, while others look a bit different.Stimulus payments and additional tax breaks introduced during the pandemic, such as the child tax credit and earned-income tax credit, have all but disappeared in 2023: That means many Americans can expect smaller tax refunds this year, The New York Times reported.



Additionally, according to a recent Bankrate survey, 69% of tax filers are anxious about their refunds this year, citing inflation and lower payouts. Compounding the issue is the fact that these refunds are essential for most Americans just to get by: 75% of U.S. adults who expect money back this year say it's important for their overall financial situation, per the survey.Related: 5 Steps to Tax Season Success | Entrepreneur


""Making sure that you get every credit and deduction is critically important this year — you want to make sure you get everything you're entitled to,"" Karen Orosco, president of global consumer tax and service delivery at H&R Block, says.Even experienced taxpayers might find it challenging to stay up to date on those changing credits and deductions, but it can be especially difficult for those whose circumstances are no longer the same — say, they've started working an additional gig for extra income.And it can get even more complicated for Gen Z, some of whom are filing for the very first time, and many of whom have already launched side hustles of their own: 52% of respondents to H&R Block's 2023 survey, which was conducted among 1,000 U.S. adults, revealed they have at least one.""Whether it's to make ends meet or because Gen Z prefers financial independence — they love the variation in their types of work,"" Orosco explains, ""so they'll stitch together many [different kinds].""


Entrepreneur sat down with Orosco to learn more about what Gen Z filers should be aware of this tax season. Read on for three tips that will make getting that refund easier than ever before.Related: Handle Tax Season Yourself This Year | Entrepreneur1. First and foremost: Know what you oweIt might seem obvious, but in an era of alternative income streams, it isn't always — particularly for younger filers. Many Gen Z side hustlers aren't aware of what activities require them to pay taxes on their earnings, according to H&R Block's survey.And that's an issue considering how much they are making outside of a nine-to-five: The survey found that 39% of Gen Z brought in upwards of $600 in 2022 through selling items online, investing and more, yet the vast majority (70%) neglected to keep detailed records of how they made their additional income over the past year.


For many, that oversight includes ignoring sums received on peer-to-peer payment apps like PayPal, Venmo, Etsy and Facebook Marketplace; just 44% of survey respondents knew they had to pay taxes on those earnings.Tracking these activities not only ensures you pay the required amount, but it also makes it possible for you to write off certain expenses, as the IRS considers side hustles small businesses.""As such, you're entitled to deduct different expenses that a typical employee would not be eligible [for],"" Orosco says. ""So it's important to have all your receipts, that you are tracking mileage — where you went and why.""Related: 14 Tax Deductions Your Small Business Might Be Overlooking


2. Explore your filing options — and choose the best one for youToday, several paths exist for Gen Zers looking to file — from working with a tax pro in a brick-and-mortar office to using online software from the comfort of their couch.And that ability to choose is as important as it's ever been; approximately one-third of Gen Z plans to file via their mobile devices or computers, Orosco says.Even a tax-preparation mainstay like H&R Block, which has been in the business for nearly 70 years, recognizes that the younger generation is consuming data and approaching taxes differently, Orosco says — which means that the companies that help them file have to rise to the occasion.""It's super important [Gen Z filers] get the expertise that they need,"" Orosco explains, ""and we're prepared to meet them where they are — whether that's completely digitally, working with a tax professional and anything in between.""


Related: These 11 U.S. States Are Reducing Individual Income Taxes3. The earlier you file, the better (even if you're short on cash)It might seem counterintuitive for filers who expect a refund to procrastinate on their taxes.""As someone said to me, 'It's my money that I'm getting refunded — I'd rather have access to it as quickly as I can,'"" Orosco says.Despite the seemingly straightforward logic, many Americans do put the process off.


A lack of critical information is part of the problem: Nearly one in three filers doesn't know when tax day is, according to a survey conducted by Fidelity subsidiary Investment Property Exchange Services  — and that figure jumps to 53% for Gen Z taxpayers.Yet another contributing factor is the misconception that one has to have all the funds owed available to pay at the time of filing.""Those things are completely separate,"" Orosco says. ""The best advice I can give is even if you find yourself in a situation where you didn't set aside any money [for taxes], and now you're going to owe, still file as quickly as possible because then you know exactly what that tax liability is. You can plan for it. There are payment options with the IRS. So the sooner you file, the more time you have to figure out how you're going to make that payment.""Related: Want to Lower Your Taxes?

28,How to Identify a Good Investment (Even During Economic Uncertainty),"Mar 28, 2023",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-identify-a-good-investment-even-during-economic/446369,"
Rising inflation. Ongoing supply chain problems. International conflict.There's a lot of volatility in the market today, which has many entrepreneurs and investors feeling stressed. With this much uncertainty, choosing how to allocate money and being confident in those choices can be challenging. Too often, people get trapped in analysis paralysis or needlessly lose sleep second-guessing themselves.One of the best ways to ease that stress is to take the emotion out of your decision-making. And the best way to take emotion out of the equation is to establish a clear set of investing criteria. By knowing precisely what a good investment looks like, you'll be able to make wise decisions quickly, efficiently and confidently, no matter what else is happening in the world.



Related: Why the Current Volatile Market is an Opportune Time for Impact Investing in Undercapitalized EntrepreneursStep 1: Understand who you are and what you wantInvesting is not a one-size-fits-all process. An excellent opportunity for you may not be great for someone who doesn't share your interests, risk profile and goals. This means establishing your investing criteria begins with introspection.


Spend time answering the following questions:What kind of lifestyle do you want your investments to fund? The answer to this question will help you begin to create accurate financial targets.Are there certain types of assets you enjoy more than others? Some people love buying and managing real estate, while others prefer commodities or currency. Some people are deeply involved in a single business, while others enjoy the thrill of serial entrepreneurship.How do you feel about using leverage? The extent to which you're willing to use borrowed capital as a source of funding will impact the types of investments that make it onto your preferred list. Strategically using leverage can dramatically increase your opportunities to generate returns, but this technique isn't a good fit for everyone.Step 2: Use the tax law to your advantageI always tell my clients: The tax law is a series of incentives. It is the government's way of telling you what it wants you to do, and when you listen, the government is willing to invest with you. So, while there are a lot of investments that will increase your taxes as you earn more money, there are some excellent options that the government is so excited to have you make it is willing to reduce or even eliminate your taxes.How does this work? Governments around the world recognize their societies are better off when businesses and private citizens invest in things like creating jobs, building housing and growing food. So, they create tax incentives to promote these investments.I recently wrapped up an in-depth study of these incentives in the U.S. and 14 other countries and identified seven categories of investments that every government supports. The categories are:


BusinessTechnology, research and developmentReal estateEnergyAgricultureInsuranceRetirement savingsWhich of these categories matches the criteria you established in step 1? Spend time learning more about what incentives the government offers to investors in the categories that interest you most. When you use these incentives, you're putting yourself in a position to build wealth faster by decreasing the amount of money you're paying in taxes.Choose the category that fits you best. Then, double down on your research. Ideally, you will become narrowly focused on a specific niche within your chosen category. The more you learn about a specific investment and the more focused you become, the more you will increase your expertise. The greater your expertise, the lower your risk.Related: 7 Best Types Of Investments In 2023Step 3: Make a checklist Now that you have clarified what you're looking for in an investment and identified the tax-effective categories in which you'll invest, you can finalize the specific criteria you'll use for evaluating each option. Your goal is to create a detailed checklist that lets you quickly and confidently determine which investments suit you best. Once you have established this framework within your investing niche, you'll be able to scale your investment process.


Your list should include the prospective investments:Target rate of returnExpected cash flowLeverage requirementsExit strategyAnd, of course, tax repercussionsCreating this framework isn't a black-and-white task. Your goals, circumstances and values will determine what makes an investment a good fit for you.You absolutely can and should do this work with the support of your CPA and other financial advisors. They can help you navigate the technical requirements on the tax side and make more precise financial estimates. Having the right team in place, alongside a proven wealth and tax strategy, serves as extra protection from making poor choices in high-stress situations.At the end of the day, you'll have the peace of mind that comes from knowing you are making investment decisions based on where you are in life, where you want to go and how you'd like to get there. Plus, when you build your investing strategy in connection with your tax strategy, you'll be able to make more money, more quickly and pay fewer taxes at the same time.

I'm a certified public accountant but my firm doesn't prepare tax returns. However, I'm also a business owner. This means, like my best clients, I pay close attention to my taxes. Why? Because for a business owner, taxes are usually one of our biggest expenses. If you're running a business, these are 10 federal tax numbers that are very important for all of us in 2023.$160,200This is the maximum amount of wages that can be taxed for social security (FICA) benefits at 6.2% (the 1.45% Medicare tax has no limit). Any wages paid over this amount are not subject to the FICA tax — employee or employer. This is important because if you raise an employee's compensation above this amount, they're receiving an added tax benefit which should be part of your salary considerations this year.

This is the amount you can contribute to an individual Roth IRA account. Roth IRAs often get ignored by my clients but they're a fantastic way to put after-tax money away and watch it grow tax-free with no penalties or additional taxes on withdrawal. Because the stock market is down, I have a number of older clients taking distributions from their 401(k)s, paying the tax on a lower capital gain, and then transitioning those amounts to a Roth where the amounts are never taxed again. Everyone should be putting money into a Roth IRA.$7,500This is an added ""catch-up"" contribution that can be made to your 401(k) account if you're over the age of 50 — which means that more than half of business owners in the U.S. are probably eligible. There's also a $1,000 catch-up for individual IRAs for people in this age group. Thanks to the recently passed Secure 2.0, the 401(k) catch-up amount is going to rise to as much as $10,000 annually for those between the ages of 60 and 63 starting in 2025 and will then be adjusted for inflation each year.$66,000


That's the amount that can be contributed to a 401(k) plan this year which includes both employer and employee contributions and does not include any ""catch-up"" contributions. This amount is limited to your income and discrimination tests (see below).$150,000That's the amount of compensation that defines a ""highly compensated employee."" This is important because the number of people you have in your 401(k) retirement plan that earns over this amount will figure into your plan's year-end discrimination testing and that may limit the amount you — and they — can save. The takeaway: The more employees —particularly non-highly compensated employees — that contribute to your 401(k) plan, the more you can contribute.Related: 3 Ways to Save Money on Taxes That Most Entrepreneurs Miss$0.655That's the IRS-reimbursable mileage rate for 2023 and it changes every year based on the fluctuating costs of operating a vehicle. This is important because you can reimburse your employee for any miles traveled above the commute to your office (for example to a customer) and you'll get a tax deduction — and the amount won't be taxable to them. This is potentially a great added benefit to provide for your staff, particularly in these times of high gas costs.$300This is the amount you can pay your employees each month to reimburse for their commuting expenses. You'll get a deduction and they won't be taxed. If an employee drives to work, you can also pay them $300 to reimburse for their parking expenses with the same tax treatment. It's another benefit to consider and could be a helpful enticement to get your people back into the office more often.


$1,160,000That's the maximum Section 179 deduction you can take this year for the acquisition of capital assets. This applies to both new and used assets like capital equipment, machinery, furniture and most computer software. There are ""bonus"" depreciation deductions that your business can take in addition to the Section 179 amounts. You can even finance these purchases and get these deductions — just make sure they're ""in service"" by year-end.$12,920,000That's the individual federal estate lifetime tax exemption which means that a married couple can leave more than $25 million of their assets upon their deaths tax-free to the beneficiaries. After that, most transfers of assets will be taxed at 40%. This exemption gets reduced to $7,000,000 individually in 2026.


$17,000This is the amount you can gift this year and the recipient won't be taxed. This is in addition to the lifetime addition above and applies to anyone, not just family members.You know what's coming next, right? It's the usual caveat where I write that your situation may be unique and you should always consult your tax professional before making any decisions based on the above numbers.

31,Make Tax Season As Painless as Possible by Taking These 6 Steps,"Feb 28, 2023",Joseph Camberato,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/6-steps-to-make-tax-season-as-painless-as-possible/445013,"
Q1 marks the beginning of a critical time for businesses — tax season. As you know, it can be a busy and stressful time of year for most businesses, regardless of their age, industry or profitability. No one wants any surprises after they file, so it's important to start preparing sooner rather than later.By planning ahead, you'll ensure your business is organized and ready to file on time. You may never enjoy tax season, but there are ways to make it as painless as possible. Here are six steps to ensure your business is ready — come April 15.Related: These 6 Tax Tips Will Help Make Tax Season Easy for Your Business



1. Prepare throughout the yearGetting ready for tax season starts long before you're ready to file your tax return — you should be preparing throughout the year. This starts with having an accounting system in place where you can keep track of your finances.There are tons of free and inexpensive options when it comes to accounting software, including QuickBooks, Xero and ZohoBooks. The software is more comprehensive than anything you can do with an Excel spreadsheet, and most give you the option to collaborate with your accountant.


In addition, businesses should be paying their quarterly tax obligations throughout the year. The exact filing schedule will vary depending on your business entity. Once you get on a schedule, you'll likely find that paying your taxes as you go will make your life easier and help you avoid any fines or penalties.2. Make sure your books are balancedYou don't want to run into tax problems because of mistakes or missing transactions. Make sure all of your business transactions are recorded and accurately categorized. Take the time to reconcile your accounts and ensure that your financial software matches what your bank account says.You should also make sure that you're separating your personal and business transactions. Otherwise, you're going to create a lot of frustration for yourself.3. Gather your paperworkStart gathering your paperwork together at the beginning of the year. You'll need to provide receipts for any deductions you took in case your business gets audited. It's a good idea to digitize your receipts, so you don't have to worry about anything getting lost or damaged.


You'll also need the following documentation to bring to your accountant:Your taxpayer identification number (EIN or SSN)Income statementBalance sheetsBank statementsPayroll recordsEstimated tax paymentsPrevious year's business tax returnIf you have employees, you're required to file W-2s with the Social Security Administration by Jan. 31.Related: 5 Steps to Tax Season Success4. See what tax credits you qualify forNext, you want to see what kind of tax credits your business qualifies for. Tax deductions reduce your taxable income, while tax credits reduce your total tax bill. You can look for industry-specific tax credits or see if there are any state-specific tax credits you qualify for.One of the most advantageous tax deductions for financing is Section 179, which allows you to write off nearly the entire value of an equipment purchase on the current year's tax return.


The IRS provides information on its website about available tax credits and eligibility requirements. It's a good idea to work with a tax professional to ensure your business actually qualifies for any credits you identify.5. Work with an accountantIf you're in the early stages of building your business, you may be tempted to file your taxes on your own to save money. However, the short-term benefits often lead to longer-term problems, and most entrepreneurs find more benefits in working with an accountant.Tax laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it's impossible for the average business owner to stay on top of these changes. Accountants understand all of the relevant tax laws and filing requirements and can help you minimize your tax liability.Plus, filing your taxes can be time-consuming and tedious, especially if you don't know what you're doing. Using an accountant will save you time and help you avoid costly mistakes. Plus, you'll have peace of mind knowing that your business taxes are filed accurately and on time.


The upside of working with an accountant extends well beyond tax season; Your accountant can work with you throughout the year to develop strategies to minimize your tax burden.Related: 3 Ways to Save Money on Taxes That Most Entrepreneurs Miss6. File early if you canApril 15 is commonly thought of as Tax Day, but the exact filing deadline depends on your business entity. Sole proprietors, single-member LLCs, and corporations that ended their year on Dec. 31 have to file taxes by April 15.But if you're a partnership, multi-member LLC, or S-Corp filing Form 1120-S, you're required to file by March 15. The IRS begins accepting tax returns beginning in mid to late January, so it's a good idea to file early if you can.


By filing early, you'll avoid processing delays with the IRS and save yourself the stress of attempting to file at the last minute. If you wait too long to get the process started, you may have a hard time getting in with your accountant.Scheduling an appointment with your tax pro early ensures you can file on time. Otherwise, you may have to request an extension.

34,What Is Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)?,"Feb 22, 2023",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/what-is-modified-adjusted-gross-income-magi/446161,"
You're likely to encounter modified adjusted gross income during your research for the best way to get through tax season. MAGI is a modified version of adjusted gross income (AGI) used to determine eligibility for certain tax benefits.If you're looking to make the most of this tax year, keep reading for a comprehensive understanding of MAGI.What is modified adjusted gross income? The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses a modified adjusted gross income calculation to determine an individual's taxable income.It is a tool used for calculating eligibility for various tax benefits, including:Deductions.Credits.Exemptions.What is the difference between MAGI and AGI?AGI is the first step to take when it comes time to determine federal income tax liability. It's calculated by starting with your taxable income and subtracting certain ""above-the-line"" deductions, like IRA contributions, student loan interest and alimony payments. The result is your AGI.



On the other hand, MAGI is a modified version of AGI used to determine your eligibility for certain tax benefits and to calculate the taxable Social Security benefits. AGI is a more comprehensive measure of your taxable income rather than the focused calculation of MAGI.Related: What Is Adjusted Gross Income? Everything You Need To Know.How is MAGI used?MAGI is used in several ways to determine eligibility for certain tax benefits and other financial assistance programs.Some of its most common uses include:


Determining eligibility for tax credits: MAGI is used to determine eligibility for certain tax credits, like earned income tax credit (EITC), the child tax credit and the American opportunity tax credit. The higher your MAGI is, the less likely you will be eligible for these tax credits.Calculating the amount of taxable Social Security benefits: MAGI will determine the amount of Social Security benefits subject to federal income tax. Depending on your MAGI, you may owe tax on a portion of your Social Security benefits.Determining eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP: MAGI is used to determine eligibility for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Medicaid and CHIP provide health coverage to individuals and families with low incomes. The higher your MAGI, the less likely you are to be eligible.Determining eligibility for certain education benefits and educator expenses: Education benefits such as the Lifetime Learning Credit and the Student Loan Interest Deduction will be determined by MAGI. The higher your MAGI, the less likely you will be eligible for these benefits.Determining eligibility for retirement plan contributions: Retirement plan contributions, such as contributions to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, will be affected by your MAGI. The higher your MAGI, the less likely you are to be eligible to make contributions to these types of retirement plans.Related: 17 Passive Income Ideas for Seniors to Boost Retirement IncomeHow is MAGI calculated?Start with your taxable income: This is the total amount of money you earned from all sources, such as wages, salaries, investment income and business income.Subtract adjustments to income: Subtract any ""above-the-line"" deductions from your taxable income, like traditional IRA contributions, student loan interest or alimony payments.Add back certain deductions: Some IRA deductions, such as foreign earned income, are subtracted from taxable income to arrive at adjusted gross income (AGI) but must be added back to arrive at MAGI.Subtract qualified deductions: Then subtract any ""below the line"" deductions from the AGI, including standard deduction or itemized deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable contributions.Calculate MAGI: Add any deductions or exclusions subtracted in step three and remove any qualified deductions from step four to get your MAGI.What are some common tax benefits calculated with MAGI?While taxes vary for each filer, there are some common tax benefits you might qualify for. Take a look at how MAGI might relate to those benefits.Roth IRA contributionsA Roth IRA is a type of individual retirement account (IRA) allowable for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Unlike traditional IRAs, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, which means you don't receive an immediate tax break for your contributions.However, the benefit of a Roth IRA is that qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, including any investment gains.


To be eligible to make a full contribution to a Roth IRA, your MAGI must be below certain thresholds. For the 2022 tax year, the MAGI contribution limit is $125,000 for single filers and $198,000 for married couples filing jointly. If your MAGI is $120,000 and you are a single filer, you can make a full contribution to a Roth IRA for the 2022 tax year.Related: What Is a Roth IRA? How It Works and How to Get One StartedHealth savings account (HSA) contributionsA health savings account is a tax-advantaged savings account used to pay for qualified medical expenses. It is typically paired with a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) and is designed to help individuals save for future medical expenses.HSA contributions are tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income and, in turn, your MAGI. To be eligible to contribute to an HSA, you must be covered by a high-deductible health insurance plan and cannot be enrolled in Medicare or other stipulations.


Again, your tax-free HSA contribution eligibility is based on your MAGI. For the 2022 tax year, the MAGI threshold for single filers is $138,000, and for married couples filing jointly, it's $276,000. If your MAGI is $150,000 and you are a married couple filing jointly, you are not eligible to make tax-free contributions to an HSA for the 2022 tax year.Earned income tax credit (EITC)The earned income tax credit (EITC) is a federal tax credit for working individuals and families in the low to moderate-income tax bracket. The credit is based on a percentage of earned income and is designed to increase as earned income increases to help supplement income.The EITC is available to taxpayers who have earned income from wages, salaries, tips and self-employment and those who receive unemployment compensation.Related: Capital Gains: How Digital Entrepreneurs Can Master The Essential Art Of Fundraising


Premium tax credits under the Affordable Care ActPremium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are also known as the health insurance premium tax credits, a federal financial assistance program meant to help eligible individuals and families pay for healthcare.The tax credits are available to those who buy insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace and meet specific income and coverage requirements.The tax credit amount is based on your MAGI and the insurance cost. If your MAGI is $35,000 and you are a single filer, you may be eligible for a premium tax credit to help pay for health insurance purchased through the Marketplace.Related: What is Self-Employment Tax?


Child tax credit The child tax credit is a tax credit that provides a credit of up to $2,000 per eligible child under the age of 17. The amount of credit you receive depends on your MAGI and the number of children you have. The higher your MAGI, the less likely you are to be eligible for the full amount of the child tax credit.This means that a single taxpayer with a MAGI of $30,000 and two eligible children would be eligible for a child tax credit of $2,000 per child, for a total credit of $4,000.What should you keep in mind about MAGI?MAGI is not adjusted for inflation: If your MAGI increases due to inflation, you may become ineligible for certain tax benefits or financial assistance programs even though your real purchasing power has not changed.MAGI is used for multiple tax forms: MAGI is used for numerous tax forms, including Form 1040, Form 1040A and Form 1040EZ. It is essential to understand which form you need to use and how to calculate your MAGI accordingly.MAGI affects more than just your federal income taxes: While MAGI is primarily used for federal tax purposes, it can also impact your eligibility for particular state and local tax benefits and financial assistance programs administered by the state.Certain life events can impact MAGI: Life events such as marriage, divorce, childbirth or retirement can affect your MAGI and your eligibility for certain tax benefits or financial assistance programs.MAGI is subject to change yearly: Your MAGI can change annually due to changes in your income, deductions or other factors. It's essential to monitor your MAGI each year and understand how it may impact your financial situation.Can you change your MAGI?While it's not possible to change your MAGI for the previous tax year, it is possible for it to change in the future.You can do this by:


Increasing your income: Increasing your income through a job or business is one way to increase your MAGI.Reducing your deductions: Reducing your deductions, such as mortgage interest or charitable donations, can increase your MAGI.Making contributions to a traditional IRA: Contributions to a traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income and, in turn, your MAGI. However, remember that traditional IRA contributions may be subject to restrictions based on your MAGI and other factors.Making contributions to a health savings account: Contributions to a health savings account are tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income and MAGI. Remember that you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan to be eligible to make HSA contributions.Deferring income: Deferring income, such as through a deferral agreement with your employer, can reduce your current year's income and, in turn, your MAGI.Related: The 2023 Complete Tax Preparation BundleWhat does MAGI mean for you?Your MAGI calculation is critical in determining eligibility for many tax benefits and credits. Maximizing your income tax return benefits is always a good idea.While you've got a comprehensive rundown on MAGI, contacting a tax professional to help you with your IRS forms this time of year never hurts.Ready for more research?

Either way, the IRS expects to be more efficient this year compared to last as it begins to deploy its nearly $80 billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act. The agency kicked off tax season by hiring 5,000 new workers for its customer service team and implementing new technology, CNBC reported.Back in August, the Inflation Reduction Act allocated $79.6 billion in funding to the IRS over 10 years with intentions to improve customer service and technology and clear any tax return backlog. Given the increase of 29.1% in returns already processed compared to this time last year, the new initiatives appear to be leading to a more efficient tax season for all.Related: The IRS Hates Telling Entrepreneurs Anything About Taxes.

Income tax is one of the critical components of the tax system, and if you are someone who earns a wage, salary or other forms of compensation, then you might owe taxes this year.



Understanding what income taxes are is vital as you go through tax preparations leading up to the federal due date. The amount of income tax you owe and your income tax return is determined by the taxable income you earn throughout the year.Tax brackets operate so that higher income gets taxed at a higher rate, with a staggered system as incomes decrease.In the United States, income tax funds several government operations, such as:National defense.Education.Infrastructure.Social Security benefits.Medicare and Medicaid health insurance.Keep reading for more information on the different types of income taxes.Related: Tax Credits are the Incentives in the Inflation Reduction ActFederal income tax Federal income tax is a tax imposed by the federal government upon the income earned by people in the US.

In 2022, the highest income tax rate was 37%.State income tax Most states in the US impose an income tax. Each state has specific tax rates, rules and regulations, but they generally follow a similar structure to the federal income tax.

Related: 7 Small Business Tax Deductions You Need To KnowCapital gains tax People must pay special taxes when they gain income from investments like stocks, bonds or real estate. For capital gains, the tax fate depends on the holding period of the investment as well as the taxpayer's overall income.If an investor owns the capital for less than a year, known as short-term capital, this is simply taxed as ordinary income. However, if an investor owns the capital for more than a year, known as long-term capital, they are taxed at a lower rate. In 2022, the top rate for capital gains tax was 20%.Self-employment taxSelf-employment tax is owed by those without an employer who therefore don't contribute to Social Security and Medicare through their employer.

Off-camera, contestants have around 45 minutes to make their pitches, which are edited down to around 11 minutes for the show itself.But no matter how impressive the product, how well-researched the business plan or knowledgeable the entrepreneur is about the market, the truth is that nothing matters to the sharks (as the investors are called) more than the first few moments after the contestant appears in front of them.""Whether or not a person likes you is going to be decided within the first five or six seconds of your meeting them,"" says Barbara Corcoran, real estate mogul and one of the show's longtime judges. ""It's not fair, but assumptions are made within seconds about our intelligence, sophistication and abilities.""

38,3 Ways to Save Money on Taxes That Most Entrepreneurs Miss,"Jan 31, 2023",Kale Goodman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/money-saving-tips-entrepreneurs-often-miss-in-tax-filing/424005,"
There is one time a year that requires a detailed level of attention for a business owner, no matter the size of your business.When tax season comes around, entrepreneurs initiate survival mode sometime between January and April 15 and look for every way to get a few more deductions.Bookkeeping, tax filing, audits and deductions will assist in keeping a good relationship with the IRS, as well as supporting good habits for your business; however, because getting everything just right can be overwhelming, it is easy to miss important things and leave money on the table that would be better suited in your pocket.



Tax season reaches beyond the immediate tax return and can have a lasting impact five or even 10 years down the road. While you can make certain deductions one year that will benefit you, as your business grows, having a different strategy is in your best interest.This requires experience, a little patience and a willingness to learn from the mistakes you made.


There are three very important things every business owner should be paying attention to when you file your yearly taxes to ensure you are getting the most out of your return. These examples can also create strong business habits that will help you create a long-term operation.Related: 75 Items You May Be Able to Deduct from Your TaxesThe home office deductionWhile it may be more convenient to work from home, as well as being fiscally cheaper, it may make you a target for audits.Since you can deduct items like the square footage of your home office or short trips to the office supply store, it is crucial that you have the documentation to verify everything you list as a deduction.


With less obvious options like the Augusta Rule — in which you can rent your home out to business events and summit meetings — you have more options for write-offs and every purchase adds up. Nearly every purchase that you make for your business is considered tax-deductible as it relates to your business.Although not every person who works from home will be audited, if you were to go through a formal audit and you do not have proper documentation for your deduction claims, you can have those deductions revoked.If your business is growing quickly and producing high capital, you may want to consider moving your business into an office lease to keep your home and business separate.This will be to your advantage when you are looking for clear defining factors in listing deductions, but if that's not your cup of tea as an entrepreneur and you like the home office as a center for operations, make sure you keep proper documentation of your home office to ensure your write-off isn't arguable in the case of an audit.

It can be quite easy to get into a rhythm of using the same tactics every year, but this can cost you in the long run.Let's say you were to buy a new vehicle every year or two for your business. It could be a worthwhile plan for the first couple of filings that will help ease some of the financial pressure on a young business.


However, this can turn into abuse — not from a legal standpoint, but in the metric that vehicles depreciating over time will cost you more than the deduction would save.Working with a professional accountant to have a good roadmap to how your deductions will affect you not only this year, but in future filings, is a good thing to consider. This will help with the guidance of what you should be used as a deduction and what would be better to leave behind.Map your deductions out accordingly because they can save you a lot of headaches and money 10 years from now.Related: The IRS Hates Telling Entrepreneurs Anything About Taxes. Here's How You Can Find Out What They're Thinking.


Categorize your business properlyIt is a necessary task to ""list"" your business regardless of where you operate. That being said, there are four options upfront as to how you list your business by definition and how your business is classified can save you or cost you money.The four business classifications are:LLC: A limited liability company.S corp: S corporations are corporations that elect to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes.C corp: A C corporation is a legal structure for a corporation in which the owners, or shareholders, are taxed separately from the entity.Sole proprietor: A person who is the exclusive owner of a business, entitled to keep all profits after tax has been paid but liable for all losses.With all of these options, it is imperative to either know what you are doing or work with someone who does to register your business accordingly in the state you own a business.Related: 14 Tax Deductions Your Small Business Might Be Overlooking


It can be misleading as to which definition will be the best to suit your needs; however, if you do it correctly, it can create a good foundation that will benefit you.There can be many options to choose from when you are looking for deductions within your business, whether you are working from home or in an office space, under an LLC, sole proprietor or S corp. If you are unfamiliar with how to navigate this information, it is best to hire an accountant/bookkeeper to help guide you through.While there are many ""deductions"" you can apply to your business, being aware of the things that will benefit you now and in the long run can relieve stress when you need it most.Utilize every deduction you can to bring the cost of running your business down like materials, office supplies, office space, vehicles, advertising, etc., then consider what you will still be able to use in the big picture by measuring your growth against what you are saving this year.


Documentation is one of the most important things you can do, so if you don't have the time to be on top of it, hire a competent bookkeeper.

39,5 Small Business Tax Audit Triggers and What to Do If the IRS Comes Calling,"Jan 30, 2023",Jason Carr,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/what-small-businesses-can-do-if-the-irs-comes-knocking/442111,"

Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only. It should not be considered legal or financial advice. You should consult with an attorney or other financial professional to determine what may be best for your individual needs.Although most small business returns filed every year don't get audited, the IRS is certainly becoming more active. For instance, in November 2020, the IRS announced it would ramp up audits of small businesses by 50% in 2021. Then, in August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, including $80 billion in IRS funding, with approximately $45 billion going toward enforcement — conducted by at least some of those 87,000 new agents the IRS is reportedly hiring.So how can you stay out of the IRS's crosshairs? To an extent, there's nothing you can do, as some audits are totally random. However, in most cases, audits result from actions or omissions by the taxpayer — certain of which are more likely to trigger some unwelcome mail from the IRS announcing an audit.



Here are five of the most common small business tax audit triggers.Related: These Are the Top Tax Filing Mistakes Made by Small Business Owners (and How to Avoid Them)


1. Failing to report incomeWhether it's intentional or simply due to an oversight, failing to report income is a common trigger for an IRS audit.The IRS receives copies of 1099 forms sent to your business, so in many cases, it's easy to spot a discrepancy between reported income on a tax return and the information included in tax reporting forms. If there is a discrepancy, the IRS will flag it on your return and, most likely, initiate an audit.In addition, as more individuals turn to side hustles and gig work to make money, the IRS is taking steps to ensure that it's keeping tabs on what people are earning. While it has delayed implementation for tax year 2022, the IRS will soon be requiring third-party settlement organizations such as PayPal and Venmo to issue 1099-K forms to individuals being paid $600 or more via these platforms.Fail to report income? There's a good chance the IRS will notice.


2. Large deductions and excessive expensesSmall businesses should claim all justifiable business deductions. That's their right under our tax laws.However, there are no bright-line rules that define what's ""justifiable"" — only a somewhat fuzzy standard that a business expense must be both ordinary and necessary.Because there's ambiguity in these terms, some taxpayers take it too far and claim unreasonably large deductions and excessive expenses, leading to audits. The odds that a deduction will trigger an audit increase if such deductions or expenses are either out of line with IRS standards for similarly situated businesses and/or significantly larger than the prior year.It's also important to note that certain deductions tend to draw more scrutiny than others, including the home office deduction, travel costs and vehicle use, to name a few.


Related: Top Tax Write-Offs That Could Get You in Trouble With the IRS3. Large amounts of cash transactionsIf you run a ""cash business,"" such as a restaurant or barber shop, that fact alone makes it more likely that you'll be audited. When a business relies mostly on cash transactions, they face an increased audit risk because the IRS may be concerned that the business is underreporting income.If your small business has a large number of cash transactions, there may not be much you can do to prevent an audit — but if you keep good records and disclose your income, the risks stemming from an audit will be greatly reduced.4. Claiming business losses year after yearAre you running a business or trying to write off expenses for a hobby? IRS guidelines say that if you have earned a profit in at least three of five consecutive years, the presumption is that the business is being run to generate a profit. If not, it could trigger an audit, because having multiple years of losses can lead to the IRS questioning if you have a legitimate business.


If your business is not, in fact, a hobby but continues to generate losses, make sure to keep accurate and extensive records to help prevent the reclassification of your business as a hobby.5. S Corp shareholder-employees earning low or no salariesIt's common for small business owners to establish an S Corp instead of an LLC to avoid paying self-employment tax on distributions. However, to take advantage of these tax benefits, the S Corp shareholder-employee must be paid what the IRS deems a ""reasonable salary"" — a paycheck comparable to what other employers would pay for similar services.If there's additional profit in the business beyond the salary, those can be paid as distributions.The IRS is on the lookout for S Corps paying shareholder-employees unreasonably low salaries — or in some cases, no salaries at all. When compensation is misaligned relative to a similar position in a similar industry, it may trigger an audit.


Related: What I Learned From a Two-Year IRS AuditWhat to do if you get audited by the IRSThe idea of an audit strikes fear in most people because they immediately conjure up a vision of IRS agents forcefully knocking on the front door of their home or business, ready to rifle through their records.That's not how things work, at least for most people who are subject to audits. Remember, audits are rare. And when they do happen, most are done by mail. While it's not common, some audits take place at an IRS office (a ""desk audit"") or at a home or business (a ""field audit""). Regardless, if you find out you're getting audited, don't panic and contact an experienced tax audit lawyer, especially if there's significant money at stake. Do this right away, because the IRS requires a timely response.In many instances, resolving an audit will involve providing documentation to the IRS to substantiate the figures on your return. That may end the matter, or there may be some adjustment to the amount you owe, as well as penalties and interest, that you may agree to pay.


However, you may disagree with the conclusion reached by the IRS, in which case you'll have 30 days to appeal the IRS' findings. Disputes proceed with an appeal with the IRS Office of Appeals, followed by a petition to the U.S. Tax Court in the event your appeal is unsuccessful.While it's important to know what to do in the event of an audit, the best way to avoid negative repercussions from an audit is to avoid one in the first place. Be aware of the most common audit triggers. Avoid them if possible. Keep good records. And if the IRS comes calling anyway, contact an experienced audit defense attorney to help you through the process.

Tax season is underway, and depending on where you live, you might not owe as much as you did last year.At least 11 U.S. states, the majority led by Republicans, are reducing individual income taxes this year, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, a group that lobbies for lower taxes.""We are seeing the culmination of two years of substantial tax cutting across the country, in response to historically high revenues and a desire for states to remain competitive in a much more mobile environment,"" says Jared Walczak, the vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, per Fox Business.Related: Taxes on Small Businesses Across the Globe, Mapped: See Where Rates Are High, Low  — and NonexistentThe cuts come at a time of high inflation and economic uncertainty, with a reported 69% of Americans fearing a possible recession by the end of 2023, per Bankrate.In addition to the individual income tax rate reductions, five states, including Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, will implement corporate income tax reductions.These are the 11 states slashing individual income taxes:1.

42,How This New Accounting Feature Can Save Businesses From Fraud and Financial Mishap,"Jan 9, 2023",Nick Chandi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/what-is-auto-reconciliation-how-can-it-save-small/441240,"
Imagine this. John Carter begins his job as the country club's new finance and administration director by reconciling its payroll journal entries with employee payroll logbooks provided by its payroll processor. It takes him weeks and distracts him from other important issues. Eventually, Carter deduces that the club's HR director is misappropriating thousands of dollars in overpayments to herself and other employees.Without reconciliation, Carter might not have been able to discover the fraud. He might have caught it sooner — maybe even prevented it — if the club had a monthly or biweekly reconciliation policy that provided tight oversight of its bookkeeping.Reconciliation reliably helps monitor cash by cross-validating accounting data with an independent financial record like a bank statement to reduce errors, duplicated entries and inaccurate information.



Does your accounting data show more cash than is available in your bank account? Maybe a customer's payment bounced, or you forgot to account for bank fees. Reconciliation bolsters the integrity of your bookkeeping, helps monitor cash flow, identifies fraud, prevents overspending, and creates accurate financial statements.Related: Six Technology Trends Every Bank Should Be Ready For In 2021 


Small and medium-sized businesses have very limited resources, typically with one overworked accountant reconciling financial records manually. Depending on factors like a small business's purchasing and sales values, number of employees, operational history, etc., reconciling can be time-consuming, laborious and error-prone. Consider the steps involved:Logging onto the banking portal.Downloading bank statements.Manually comparing each entry against its counterpart in the accounting records.Documenting the process across multiple spreadsheets.A misstep at any stage, with any entry, can jeopardize the whole process.Moreover, most payment methods take time to settle. Here's a breakdown:Related: How to Protect Your Small Business Against Fraud


Payment methods and settlement timesACH (Automated Clearing House) creditApprox. 1 business dayACH debitApprox. 1-2 business daysSame-day ACH credit1 business daySame-day ACH debit1 business dayWire transferInstantReal-time payments (RTP)InstantChecks3-7 daysSome of these settlement times force a lag that masks the available balance, which transactions are still processing, and when different sets of transactions are likely to settle. Small businesses usually work with thin margins, and making financial decisions on outdated or faulty information can be incredibly costly.Banks also process transactions in batches. A small business may make ten separate ACH credit transactions of $1,000, yet, the bank processes it as one $10,000 transaction, making it challenging to tie each payment to the appropriate transaction on the bank statement.Related: How To Properly Write a Check in 5 Simple StepsAutomatic reconciliation solves these issues by uploading and cross-validating banking records with their accounting platforms. It offers accurate financial statements, sped up bookkeeping and improves financial management. With small businesses under increasing pressure to close their books faster, think of the time, cost and labor savings owners could have with auto-reconciliation.


But businesses are limited in choice. Some auto-reconciliation tools require manual intervention, like uploading bank statements, while major accounting platform providers like QuickBooks allow users to import banking data for cross-verification via proprietary APIs with large financial institutions. But what if a small business banks with a financial institution that doesn't link with their accounting platform or vice versa?Related: How Open Banking Can Benefit Small BusinessesBanks have a real opportunity here — to get ahead of the curve and offer true auto-reconciliation through a universal accounting API that pushes banking transactions directly into any and every accounting system. Auto-reconciliation via APIs ensures that a business's accounting records are always up-to-date because its bank automatically populates its accounting platform with real-time information. Offering a universal accounting API ensures that banks never come up short in serving the small business community and that businesses never have to think twice about whether their banks and accounting systems are compatible.The broad application of APIs in the banking industry offers immense value to other services, like loan origination. Lending APIs streamline and accelerate the underwriting process by establishing a direct connection between lenders and loan applicants, increasing transparency and access and reducing the potential for fraud. Banks with supercharged services via third-party APIs are becoming more common in places like the UK, where open banking is government-mandated.


Related: Open API: What's Next?We're still quite behind in the US and Canada, but not for long. The reality is that auto-reconciliation is one small business need that speaks to a larger one: Small businesses need specialized care. Banks must catch up or risk losing customers to competitors who understand the game and are expanding to access a broader range of niche services. Banks and payment providers that quickly offer value-added services via APIs to their small business clients will benefit long-term through client retention.Of course, technology is not 100% foolproof — some degree of manual checking will still be necessary. But by offering their small business clients a chance to automate a critical accounting process, banks can invest both in their clients and their own futures.

43,What Is a 1099 Form? Everything You Need To Know.,"Jan 7, 2023",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/what-is-a-1099-form-everything-you-need-to-know/442401,"
A 1099 form is a document that businesses use to report various types of government payments to both the IRS and payees.This includes payments for services, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and other types of income. There are various 1099 forms, each with specific instructions for filling them out.If you're an entrepreneur or small business owner who wants to stay compliant with the IRS, it's critical to understand what a 1099 form is and how it applies to your business. Read on for an overview of the different types of 1099 forms and how to navigate the filing process.



What is a 1099 form, and what is it used for?A 1099 form is an information return that reports taxable income other than wages, salary, and tips.For example, if you're self-employed or earn rental income, you'll likely receive a 1099 form.The 1099 form reports what's referred to as miscellaneous income, and there are many different types of 1099s.Here's a quick run-through of some of the other common 1099 forms and what they report:Form 1099-B: Proceeds from broker transactionsForm 1099-C:Cancellation of debtForm 1099-DIV: Dividends and distributions from investmentsForm 1099-H: Health insurance premiums that the taxpayer paysForm 1099-INT:Interest income earned throughout the yearForm 1099-K: Merchant card and third-party payment transactionsForm 1099-NEC:Nonemployee compensationForm 1099-Q: Distributions from qualified education programsForm 1099-R: Distributions from pensions or annuitiesForm 1099-S: Proceeds from real estate transactionsForm 1099-SA:Distributions from health savings accounts (HSA)All that said, the most common type is the 1099-MISC, used to report income earned from rental property, providing services as an independent contractor, or earning royalties. If you receive a Form 1099-MISC, you're considered self-employed (an important fact to remember).While this may seem like a lot of extra work, being self-employed has some benefits, such as the possibility of deducting business expenses on your tax return.Be sure to speak with a qualified tax professional if you have questions about filing your taxes after receiving a 1099 form.Related: Time To Send Out 1099s: What To KnowIs a 1099 a tax return?A 1099 form is not the same as an income tax return. It's an informational form that reports specific types of income and other financial activities. Essentially, you use the information from the 1099 forms to complete your taxes.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires businesses to file 1099 forms for almost any payment over $600 made throughout the year. That includes payments for services, mortgage interest, royalties, and other miscellaneous income.


The payee doesn't need to issue a 1099 form for any payments under $600; nonetheless, both the issuer and recipient must report this income on their tax returns.Related: Selling $600 or More on Peer-to-Peer Apps? Expect a 1099-K1099 vs. W-2A 1099 is an IRS form that shows an individual's income from specific types of payments.A Form W-2 is a tax form that reports the wages an individual has received.


The primary difference is that 1099 forms are issued to non-employees, whereas W-2 forms are issued to employees. Businesses are responsible for reporting employee wages on W-2 forms, while self-employed individuals (think freelancers and independent contractors) must report payments outlined on their 1099s.Additionally, self-employed individuals may receive 1099s and W-2s, depending on the work they perform.Generally, W-2 forms report wages from full-time employment or an employer/employee relationship, whereas 1099 forms report income from freelance work, contract labor, royalties, or rent payments.Unlike 1099s, W-2 forms withhold federal income taxes (and state taxes) from employees' wages. Therefore, individuals need to note whether their income was reported as a W-2 or 1099 to know what taxes they must pay.


Related: W-2 or 1099? Why It Pays To Classify Your Employees CorrectlyWho needs to file a 1099 form? A 1099 form reports income from freelance work, rentals, investments, and other alternative sources. In most instances, if you earned more than $600 from any of these sources during the year, the person who paid you must send you a 1099 form by January 31st. You will then use this form to complete your taxes.When reporting your income on your taxes, use the correct 1099 form.For example, if you received payment from freelancing, you should generally fill out a 1099-MISC.Note that you're responsible for paying taxes on all of your income, regardless of whether or not you receive a 1099 form.Speak to a tax professional if you have any questions about whether or not you need to file a 1099 form. They can guide you through all the reporting requirements and help keep you above board.Related: How Do I Give a Temporary Employee a 1099 Form?When are 1099 forms due?For businesses, 1099 forms are due by January 31st of the year following the calendar year when payments were made. This applies both to copies to be sent to contractors and the IRS.


For individuals, 1099 forms must be received by January 31st, following the calendar year during which payments were made. All relevant 1099 forms should be reported on individuals' tax returns by April 15th of the same year.If an individual does not receive a 1099 form from a business or other payer, they should still report the income on their tax return. Individuals should keep track of their income throughout the year in case 1099 forms are not provided.Failure to meet these deadlines can result in expensive penalties. Businesses that fail to file 1099 forms on time face a minimum penalty of $50 per form, with a maximum of $290 per year. The specific penalty depends on the form type and the time passed after the deadline.The IRS can also impose additional penalties for what it finds as intentional or negligent filing errors.


How do I file a 1099 form with the IRS?If you're an independent contractor or self-employed individual, you'll need to file a 1099 form with the IRS come tax time.Here are three things to know about 1099 forms and how to file them with the IRS:1. A 1099 form reports income not subject to withholding tax. This includes interest, dividends, royalties, and payments made in exchange for services (including rent, commissions, fees, and tips). The payer of this income should send a 1099 form to both the payee and the IRS.2. There are many types of 1099 forms (more than 15), each for a different type of income. The most common is the 1099-MISC, used to inform the IRS of miscellaneous income. You would file a 1099-MISC if you received income such as rental income or freelancing income during the year. Other common 1099 forms include the 1099-INT (for interest income) and the 1099-DIV (for dividend income).


3. When it comes time to file your taxes, you'll need to include your 1099 forms with your return. You'll also need to send a copy of each form to the IRS, so be proactive about keeping the informational report handy.Here are some tips for filing your 1099 forms correctly:Review each form you receive and make sure the information is accurate.Choose the correct filing method, whether direct entry, paper filing, or digital e-filing.Double-check your work to ensure all your forms are filled out completely and accurately.File your forms with the IRS and report them on your tax return by the deadline.Correctly filing your 1099 form is essential for ensuring that you comply with the IRS and local tax agencies. It also helps to protect you from any potential penalties and audits.Related: New IRS 1099 Rule for PayPal and Venmo Targets Very Small Businesses and Will Cause Misreporting and Errors


Common mistakes people make when filing 1099 formsPerhaps the most common mistake is failing to report all the income they receive. While this can be fraudulently intentional, unintentional misreporting can happen if you forget to include income from a side gig, lottery winning, or receive cash payments instead of a check or money order.If you don't know whether to report a specific type of income, it's generally best to err on the side of caution and include it. Otherwise, you could face IRS penalties or miss out on potential tax credits.Another common mistake made on the business end is incorrectly reporting the taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the person or business you paid. The TIN can be either a Social Security number (SSN) or an employer identification number (EIN).If you report an incorrect TIN, the IRS might flag the return as inaccurate and send you a notice asking for clarification. As such, you always want to double-check the TIN before filing your return.


Lastly, some taxpayers fail to file their 1099 forms (and other information returns) by the established deadline. The deadline for paper filings is February 28th, and the deadline for electronic filings is March 31st.If you miss the deadline, you may be subject to late fees and interest charges from the IRS. By avoiding these mistakes, you can ensure that your 1099 filing process goes smoothly (or at least increase the chances of a smooth process).Related: Save Yourself Money and Avoid These Top Tax Filing MistakesAre there penalties for not filing a 1099 form on time or incorrectly filing one?The IRS imposes various penalties for businesses that fail to file 1099 forms on time or file them incorrectly. Perhaps the most significant penalty is the failure-to-file penalty, assessed at a rate of 0.5 percent of unpaid taxes per month; a business will be subject to this penalty if it fails to file a 1099 form within 30 days of the due date.


Moreover, if a business files a 1099 form more than 60 days after the due date, the penalty can increase to $435 per form.In addition to the failure-to-file penalty, businesses may also be subject to a failure-to-pay penalty if they don't pay the amounts shown on the 1099 forms by the due date. This penalty is equal to two percent of the unpaid tax liability and accrues monthly until the total amount gets paid.Finally, businesses may be subject to interest charges on any unpaid taxes.How can I get help if I'm having trouble filing my 1099 form correctly?If you struggle to fill out or file your 1099 form correctly, there are a few places to turn for help.

44,Act Now on Your Year-End Tax Strategy to Save in 2023,"Dec 10, 2022",Bruce Willey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/act-now-on-your-year-end-tax-strategy-to-save-in-2023/440178,"
Come January 3, a new Congress will convene in Washington, DC, setting the stage for potential tax changes that could impact small and medium-sized businesses. With that in mind, it's important for businesses to engage in certain tax planning strategies and to take advantage of tax credits that will soon expire or be phased out.The Employee Retention Credit (ERC) is one such credit. Created in 2020 to provide economic relief during the Covid-19 pandemic, the ERC lets businesses claim thousands of dollars in refundable tax credits to compensate for losses experienced in 2020 and 2021 while they continued to pay employees. Businesses subject to a full or partial shutdown or significant decline in gross receipts can qualify.Many small and midsize businesses I know are eligible for two quarters or more of credits, which can range as high as $7,000 per quarter per employee in 2020, with higher per-employee limits in 2021. But the time frame for claiming this credit is shrinking. Start planning now.



Businesses have just three years from the time they filed their 2020 and 2021 quarterly tax returns to claim the credit. Even if you received funds from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) previously you can qualify for the ERC credit, but you'll need time to gather all the necessary documentation before filing the required amended return.Related article: How to Obtain the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) Under the Second Round of Covid Relief 


Beware of companies advertising huge ERC payouts that are ""too good to be true,"" as the IRS noted in a special warning. The agency further cautioned that ""improperly claiming the ERC could result in taxpayers being required to repay the credit along with penalties and interest.""Know how to find someone who can help you if a problem arises. I had a client who signed a contract with a firm that promised an ERC credit twice as large as what we projected along with lifetime audit protection, but the firm was cagey about how to handle a prospective audit and did not list addresses and phone numbers. A red flag for sure, and a reminder that taxpayers should never get too greedy.The importance of tax planningHow many business owners can honestly say their accountants are advising them on tax planning, like the ERC benefit, rather than merely doing their taxes? Is yours building a tax-strategy foundation that generates recurring savings year after year?Take the initiative and ask your accountant what plans they have in place to generate savings year in and year out, plus what strategies they're using to accomplish that.


Don't make the mistake of merely asking your accountant how you can save on taxes just before the year's end. If you do, you may be advised to buy a vehicle for your business because the cost can be fully written off using a bonus depreciation. This is not an example of a great, forward-thinking tax strategy. And that particular deduction, by the way, will lose 20% of its value in each of the next four years, starting in 2023. It'll be completely phased out by 2027.Related article: How to Give Yourself a Tax CutAccountants should have a plethora of strategies to help small and midsize businesses and their owners save on taxes. For example, ask yours about research and development credits, or credits for hiring veterans and disabled individuals and members of other groups that the government has identified as facing employment barriers.How to avoid an auditIt's more important than ever to use only legal ways to limit your tax liability. Here's a list of some dos and don'ts:


Don't put your family vacation on your company's books. If there is a business purpose for a partial business/family trip and that purpose constitutes more than 50% of the trip, document it and proportionally deduct your costs. Include notes about the purpose of the travel, your itinerary, the agendas of meetings and conferences, whom you met with, etc. The IRS has heightened record-keeping requirements for travel deductions.Keep original receipts, not just credit card statements. Taxpayers often assume a credit card statement constitutes a receipt. It does not. Your expense items on a credit card receipt only will likely be denied.Get in a habit of documenting all relevant expenses while you're incurring them; and consider assigning an employee for that purpose or use technology. You've got to document the business reasons for the deductions claimed because there are heightened documentation requirements for business travel and for meals. You probably won't remember all these necessary details if the IRS audits you two or three years after an event has taken place. If you fail to document actual expenses, you should deduct IRS-published travel per diems by city.Don't pay personal expenses through your company. Write a check to yourself from the company for a legitimate reason like a salary, wages or distribution. Then pay personal bills for your mortgage and electric bill out of your checkbook, not the company's.Related article: The IRS Hates Telling Entrepreneurs Anything About Taxes. The messages are slowly sinking in. Four clients so far have told me they've completely revamped their internal processes to take better records. They're spending the time to do this now because they understand it could be riskier in the future.Nobody knows what tax changes, if any, are in store, but there are changes already on the books that business owners should be aware of, including benefits that are slated to disappear. Act now before it's too late.

Many Americans rely on tax refunds to pay bills and save for retirement, but next year's checks could be significantly smaller than in previous years.In a November press release, the IRS revealed that taxpayers may see less money back in 2023, as there were no stimulus checks in 2022, and those who do not itemize and instead take the standard deduction will be unable to deduct their charitable contributions.Related: When It Comes to Taxes, Here Is How to Handle InventoryGenerally, taxpayers receive a federal refund when they've overpaid yearly taxes or withheld more than the amount owed.

Persistent inflation has caused financial strain for millions of Americans, forcing some to seek a second form of income to make ends meet.A new report by Qualtrics found that 57% of workers surveyed want to work overtime or extra shifts, and 38% of workers have already looked for a second job, with an additional 14% planning to begin the hunt. The survey was based on over 1,000 respondents who work full time and are at least 18 years old.""With budgets tightening, workers are searching for ways to meet the rising cost of living, including finding new jobs,"" said Dr. Benjamin Granger, Qualtric's chief workplace psychologist, per the report.



Workers are also relocating or intending to soon. The survey found that 18% of workers reported moving to an area with a lower cost of living, with an additional 13% planning to do so.Related: 'Ask For a Raise Now': Salaries Aren't Keeping Up With Inflation. Here's What to Do.


In the survey, 70% of working parents reported that their paychecks were not keeping up with the cost of living, with 47% saying they looked for another job — the highest of any demographic surveyed.However, there might be some relief by way of taxes.The IRS announced on Tuesday that it would be changing certain rules to account for the ongoing financial strain brought by inflation. The adjustments could allow for relief to taxpayers in 2023, particularly those who fall in lower income tax brackets.Married couples filing jointly will see an increase of $1,800, or a 7% bump.

Single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately will see an increase of about 6.9%.

47,Man Who Caught Aaron Judge's Record-Breaking Baseball May Have to Change His Tax Bracket,"Oct 6, 2022",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/catching-aaron-judges-historic-home-run-ball-will-cost-you/436736,"
Aaron Judge made history this week when he hit his 62nd home run, breaking the American League record for most home runs in a season.One lucky fan, Dallas-based Cory Youmans, happened to catch the ball, and in doing so, gained a pricy piece of memorabilia.Sports Illustrated estimated that the ball is worth around $2 million, which could end up costing Youmans a fortune via a hefty tax payout, should he decide to sell.



A similar issue arose in 1998 when it was anticipated that Mark McGwire was set to break the same record, prompting the IRS to release a statement claiming that whoever caught the ball would be taxed, regardless of what they did with it.The statement was retracted after anger from fans and legislators but maintained that if the catcher returned the ball immediately, there would be no consequences.


It remained (and still remains) murky as to what the other options for the lucky catcher would be. A team will sometimes offer someone who catches an important ball a trade for other memorabilia, like signed jerseys and game-used balls.As it stands, there is no official rule with the IRS as to whether or not fly balls or catching a fly ball is deemed a taxable event, so in the event that Youmans decides to hold on to the ball without intent to sell, he most likely won't have to pay taxes on it.Should he decide to sell it, however, it might play out a bit differently.If Youmans sells the ball for the estimated $2 million, it could put him and his wife (Sports Illustrated reporter and former Bachelor contestant Bri Amaranthus) in the maximum tax bracket (37%), depending on other factors such as their annual income and deductions.


It also depends on how long Youmans keeps the ball before he decides to sell it.Since the ball and game have such historic significance, it would be considered a ""collectible"" in the eyes of the IRS, which would give it a higher-than-normal capital gains tax rate of 28%, according to H&R Block chief tax officer Kathy Pickering.Still, it remains unclear what Youmans will decide to do.#Rangers Security whisked away a Dallas man by the name of Corey Youmans who caught Judge's 62nd home run ball.#62 pic.twitter.com/lP7jequjIJ— Joe Trahan (@JoeTrahan) October 5, 2022When reporters asked him what he planned to do with the ball after the historic catch, he quickly quipped ""that's a good question, I haven't thought about it.""Reporters then asked him if he was going to give it back to [Aaron] before he walked off, which of course would be another option as to what Youmans could decide to do with the ball.Let's just hope he gives Judge a fair price.

48,These Are the Top Tax Filing Mistakes Made by Small Business Owners (and How to Avoid Them),"Sep 28, 2022",Anthony Cavaluzzi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/save-yourself-money-and-avoid-these-top-tax-filing-mistakes/434541,"
The wrong tax filing mistake could lead to an IRS audit, which amounts to quite an ordeal for a small business owner. In addition to the lost time and productivity trying to answer the demands of the IRS, overpaying and other mistakes will impact your company's bottom line.Though these filing mistakes might seem like decisions that are completely out of character for you or your staff, the tax filing process grows more complicated as your business expands.There are several common mistakes businesses make on their taxes, which can be avoided if you and your staff take note of the rules and ensure you are up to date with any IRS changes.



Related: First-Time Business Owners: A Brief Guide to Tax Filings1. Inaccurate reportingIt doesn't matter whether your reporting error is accidental or intentional, misreporting your income to the IRS (both personally and as a business owner) leads to scrutiny. Virtual currency must be reported as well as any investment income and non-employee compensation.


The IRS uses its computers and 1099 forms to match what has been reported to them with what has been reported to you as a business owner, so it is essential that you pick up the information correctly. Income may be reported to you on information returns, such as the 1099-MISC form showing nonemployee compensation if you are an independent contractor, or the 1099-K form showing credit card and certain other transactions, regardless of your entity type if you have a certain amount of transactions.If the forms are wrong and you can't get the sender to correct them, report the wrong amount with a proper adjustment and attach an explanation to your return so you are only taxed on the correct amount.Related: New IRS 1099 Rule for PayPal and Venmo Targets Very Small Businesses and Will Cause Misreporting and Errors2. Meal expense deductionsIt's a minor thing, but trying to claim 100% of meal expenses when working with clients is a problem. Client entertainment allowances have changed, and continually attempting to skirt this truth could prompt IRS involvement. Only 50% of certain business meals are deductible. Although treating a client to a meal to win them over or paying for your own meals on a business trip is a legitimate business expense, you can only deduct half of the cost.


3. Tax preparation procrastinationOne way to make tax preparation much easier is to make sure your records are well kept. Actively documenting expenses and deductions requires a proper recordkeeping process. You must be proactive! It is recommended to use a digital accounting tool to help you and your staff keep track. The tool should be able to auto-fill expenses from uploaded images and store data in the cloud may be very helpful.When you have access to a tax consultant, you shouldn't wait until tax season to figure out what to do about filing and record keeping. By working on tax planning with expert help and making sure records are kept and paperwork processed throughout the year, it can avoid some of the tiny mistakes that could cause an audit. It can also help prevent a shockingly high tax bill that you aren't prepared for. If you miss the tax filing deadline, your business will be assessed a 5% per month penalty by the IRS that will continue to increase until the return is filed.Related: A Year-End Tax Checklist 4. Ignoring mileage recordsThe tax laws allow for business owners to claim mileage when using a personal vehicle for business purposes. However, this deduction must be supported by accurate records.


Keeping an electronic log or a notebook in the vehicle to write down the date and mileage are ways to support your mileage claims. Mileage deductions are a common area of confusion. Make sure you understand the per-mile rate you can deduct and any exceptions that may apply to that rate. Also, it's important to note the maximum current allowable mileage deduction for the year for all vehicle types so you don't exceed it. This amount could change from one year to the next.5. Lowballing estimated taxesMany business owners postpone or dread the quarterly payments of large checks to the IRS. These large payments cut into a business's cash flow and may not be properly planned at the outset when budgeting. But lowballing estimated taxes can lead to paying penalties (20%) if you pay less than what you owe or pay late. It's best to accurately assess your estimated taxes for the year and pay each quarter on time.All of the estimated taxes your business needs to pay, including self-employment tax and Medicare tax, should be carefully and accurately totaled. If there are omissions and the IRS considers this misleading, you could end up being fined for intentional fraud or even face tax fraud allegations.Related: Will I Be Penalized for Paying a Now Underestimated Tax Payment?


6. Use the wrong retirement planSmall business owners can use their retirement plan contributions to reduce their tax liabilities. However, choosing the wrong plan could actually limit the deductions you can take or require you to pay for employee contributions that your company can't really afford.Professional help with your small business development and tax preparation can also help you avoid making some of these costly mistakes. To find out what other tax issues could cost your business money, consider speaking to a tax consultant.

53,"If You Do Business in Multiple States, You Might Owe More Taxes Than You Think","Jul 20, 2022",Nellie Akalp,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/you-might-owe-more-taxes-than-usual-thanks-to-nexus-laws/429892,"
Growing their business is a critical goal for many business owners. But the process can be complex and confusing — especially if it involves nexus. The Sales Tax Institute defines sales tax nexus as ""the level of connection between a taxing jurisdiction such as a state and an entity such as your business. Until this connection is established, the taxing jurisdiction cannot impose its sales taxes on you.""Before 2018, a company needed a physical presence in a state for nexus to exist. So, for example, if your business was in California but you had a warehouse in Indiana, you were required to collect sales tax from customers in both states.But the Supreme Court ruling in the South Dakota v. Wayfair case in 2018 changed how out-of-state businesses collect and remit sales taxes. The ruling leaves it up to each state to determine nexus, and a physical presence is no longer required. Most states now mandate that remote retailers with more than 200 transactions or $100,000 in in-state sales collect and remit sales taxes to the state where the goods are purchased and delivered.



Nearly every state has enacted nexus laws affecting remote sellers. The sales tax percentage varies by state and often by municipality, and each state has its own rules, registration processes and tax collection agencies. When a remote seller or marketplace facilitator (see the common terms below) crosses the nexus threshold, the business must obtain a seller's permit and register to remit the state's sales tax on each taxable purchase.Related: Do You Know the Sales Tax Rules for the States in Your Supply Chain? If Not, It Could Be Costly.


Common nexus termsAlthough the terminology varies from state to state, it's important to know the following terms:Remote seller: A person or business that does not have a physical presence in a state, selling and shipping products to consumers in that state.Marketplace facilitator: A business, such as Amazon, eBay, and Etsy, that sells goods and services on behalf of third-party sellers. The facilitator contracts with marketplace sellers to help sell their products through a physical or electronic marketplace.Marketplace seller: A person or business selling through physical or electronic marketplaces operated by a marketplace facilitator. Marketplace sellers don't need to collect tax on transactions when a marketplace facilitator collects and remits the sales tax for them.Voluntary disclosure: Each state also has its own process for unregistered remote retailers to self-disclose and pay previously unpaid or underpaid tax liabilities (without penalties in most cases). The self-disclosure period is typically three to four years, and the penalties are high for failing to pay the sales tax owed.Streamlined sales tax system: This allows remote sellers in 24 Streamlined member states to submit one application to collect and remit sales and use taxes. Remote sellers can register in each individual state or for all 24 member states. Check Marketplace Sellers and Marketplace Facilitators for more information on registration.Sales and use tax. Although many states use the words ""sales and use tax"" as one term, the taxes are actually different.Sales tax is a state-set percentage of sales on taxable goods passed through to the customer at the time of sale. Customers pay the sales tax on applicable purchases, but the business owner must collect and remit the sales tax to the appropriate agency.Use tax is a percentage of taxable goods not collected from the customer at the time of purchase. Instead, it is the customer's responsibility to remit the tax to the appropriate state agency. When use tax is due, businesses must inform their customers of their obligation to pay the tax.Local or municipality taxes. Most states have additional local (city or county) sales tax regulations. The state determines what the highest add-on tax can be, and the city or county decides what to charge.Related: How to Manage Multistate Tax Planning as a Small-Business OwnerHow to register for sales taxMost states collect sales tax through their state departments of revenue. Remote sellers obtain a seller's permit and then set up a business account on the state's tax remittance portal. Remote sellers and marketplace facilitators can set these up directly or through a third party.Also, in most cases, sales taxes are remitted monthly and paid directly through the online portal.


Nexus for payrollEmploying workers in another state establishes a different type of nexus: income or payroll nexus. If a business has an employee working in another state, it must register to pay payroll taxes in that state.It can get complex. For example, if you have employees (even part-timers) in Connecticut, your business is required to register with the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, Connecticut Department of Labor (Tax Division) and the Connecticut Paid Leave agency. Employers are required to withhold federal taxes even in states without an income tax.Some states have reciprocal agreements where taxpayers who live in one state and work in another can be exempted from paying taxes in both states. Because paying multi-state payroll taxes can be overwhelming, many small business owners use a third party to help with registration and a payroll service to handle the payments.Since the Supreme Court decision in 2018, most states have enacted new nexus laws. In many states, failure to comply is considered a felony. In others, it's a misdemeanor. And since the regulations vary from state to state, it's imperative you learn what the laws are in every state.

Then, review those pages and fix any issues such as slow loads or confusing calls-to-action. Over time, track items like page bounce rates, average session time and general pages per session. If you see an increase in engagement, you will know that you're making better first impressions.Related: 7 Ways to Improve Online Engagement With Visual ContentAim for a personal touchPersonalizing your exchanges with buyers makes them feel welcomed and appreciated. That's a big bonus when you're trying to make a memorable first impression on someone who doesn't know your company. But you can't get personal if you don't know enough about your audience. That's why tools created to support a customer identity strategy are beneficial.


For example, leverage a Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) system to gather data that fuels personalization. A reliable CIAM provides a way for consumers to opt into your company's ecosystem. Once they're part of your organization, their data becomes available for you to use and you can use this data for customization purposes. Identity platform Okta estimates that CIAM customized communications could bump up sales by 20%.After putting your customer identity tech stack in place, start experimenting in terms of personalization methods. You can use consumers' names consistently to send AI-powered custom marketing content. This deepens your bond with buyers and shows them that their first impressions of your brand were correct.Live up to your hypeA fast way to destroy a great first impression is with broken promises. Even a small slight — like not answering an email within a guaranteed timeframe — can have big repercussions. Therefore, you and your team should do everything you can to be transparent, genuine and honest in your dealings with customers.For instance, let's say you tell customers that you protect the first-party data you collect. This could include anything from a physical address to a credit card number. To support your pledge, you would need to put security measures in place. Why? If a cyber criminal hacks into your website and takes all your customers' information, you'll be the one answering tough questions.


The same holds if you promise buyers that they will get free shipping but end up charging them accidentally. You could risk losing a valuable relationship even if your program made a mistake. Fine-tune your system to avoid these risky mistakes.Customers don't expect you to be perfect all the time, particularly if they've had a lot of interactions with your brand. Loyal customers are surprisingly generous with second chances. MIT research indicates that 74% of disgruntled consumers will forgive after receiving both financial and non-monetary remedies. However, you do have to prove to them upfront that you deserve their loyalty. Because of this, your first encounters have to be consistent and true to your word.Related: Bill Gates Says Unhappy Customers Are Good for Your Business. Here's Why.Most of us realize that first impressions matter on a personal level. They matter in the professional realm, too. When your first impression is delightful to prospects and buyers, you set the stage for a more rewarding relationship. You also set up a foundation that will allow your business to grow.

55,"All Your Burning Tax-Filing Questions For This Year, Answered","Apr 18, 2022",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/tax-day-2022-deadlines-and-all-your-questions-answered/423161,"
Tax Day looks a little different in 2022. With respect to the pandemic and unprecedented events of 2021, this tax season presented changes including new tax rules, deadlines, extensions and refunds. Here's everything you'll want to know to minimize mistakes, maximize your refund and file your tax return successfully.   What changes were made to 2022 Tax Day?In the wake of the pandemic, significant changes were made to tax legislation, such as increasing standard deductions, raising income tax brackets and reimplementing required minimum distributions. With several new regulations, like the recent IRS 1099 rule for PayPal and Venmo, it's important to take note of what's shifted to understand what may or may not affect your specific taxes and filing status. If you received unemployment benefits or stimulus checks in 2021, be mindful and check that you were eligible or received the appropriate amount, otherwise you might have to pay a certain amount back. 



When do I need to file my taxes? If you're expecting a refund, you should file as soon as possible. Alternatively, if you owe money, it might be wise to wait closer to the April 18 deadline. This will give you more time to organize a plan for how to pay. Why are taxes due April 18th instead of April 15th this year?April 18th, 2022 is the official deadline for most Americans to file their 2021 federal income taxes, as opposed to the Tax Day standard of April 15th. The 18th does not imply an extension — it reflects the fact that Emancipation Day, a federal-government-recognized holiday, falls on the 15th this year.  


Do federal and state taxes have the same due date?Although most states require residents to file their taxes by the federal tax deadline, there are certain states that uphold different due dates, as well as the nine states that don't require a tax return at all. As a standard, a state won't require you file your taxes before the federal deadline, so you can safely assume they can be filed on the same day. Still, be sure to check your state's 2022 tax deadline to avoid any unnecessary stress. Will there be an extension? A nationwide extension has not been announced and is not likely, as there haven't been significant disruptions that would affect tax code like there were in the past two years with the pandemic. However,  the IRS announced a May 16th extension for Kentucky, Illinois, Tennessee and Colorado because of tornadoes, wildfires and winter storms.When are taxes due if I file an extension, and how do I do it?You can file for an extension through the IRS website, and you must do so by April 18th. You'll then have until October 17th, 2022 to submit your 2021 income tax return. However, keep in mind that filing for an extension does not extend the due date for payment on any money you might owe to the IRS — it just gives you more time to complete and submit your tax return. What filing options are available to file my income tax return?You can file your taxes electronically through the IRS or a third-party site like TurboTax. Completing your taxes electronically allows for an overall faster filing process, and you'll receive your refund more quickly. You'll also be able to request a direct deposit if you're expecting a refund. You can go the traditional route if you have your documents together and prefer to mail them in, though this does extend the processing time.


Related: Handle Tax Season Yourself This Year.What forms do I have to fill out?There are three options when it comes to filing your federal income tax return: 1040, 1040EZ, and 1040A. Although they vary in complexity, they all serve the purpose of reporting your income and determining if you owe money or are owed a return. However, it's wise to ensure you fill out the correct form to avoid any mistakes that will cost you. 1040EZ is the shortest and simplest form, but it has the most limitations. You can only use the EZ if you are filing as single, married and filing jointly, reporting income of $100,000 or less, under the age of 65 by the end of the last tax year, among other restrictions. Also, it's crucial to remember that you cannot claim dependents or itemize deductions when using the EZ form. 1040A is a bit more complex, but it allows for more adjustments, filing as head of household and claiming dependents. However, like the 1040EZ, you cannot itemize deductions and therefore have to claim the standard deduction. 


1040 is the longest and most complex form, but it offers optimal flexibility and can be used by anyone, whereas the 1040EZ and 1040A cannot. However, if you make more than $100,000 a year in taxable income, you must use the 1040 and do not qualify for 1040A or 1040EZ.  If you're still unsure, you can do a quick quiz on the IRS website, which will help you determine what form you need to complete and any other information you might need to file correctly and on time.  Related: First-Time Business Owners: A Brief Guide to Tax FilingsHow do I determine what tax bracket I'm in?Your tax bracket is contingent on income and filing status. For the 2021 tax year, there are seven federal brackets that reflect the percentage owed of your annual taxable income: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% or 37%. 


10% – $0-$9,95012% – $9,951-$40,52522% – $40,526-$86,37524% – $86,376-$164,92532% – $164,926-$209,42535% – $209,426-$523,60037% – $523,601 or more How do I know if I owe money?Money owed is largely correlated to filing status, how many allowances claimed and dependents. Most simply: the more allowances you claim on your W-4 form, the less is withheld from your paycheck, but the more you'll owe when tax season rolls around. 


If you're unsure, don't remember or want to be prepared, there are a few ways to find your tax information to avoid any surprises on Tax Day. You can view the details of your federal tax status, payment history and current balance by making an account at IRS.gov/account.  You can call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040. If you have them, review your previous tax returns and statements. This might also yield information you missed and an opportunity to file an amended tax return. (You have three years after the tax filing deadline to file for a possible extra return.)What happens if I miss the tax deadline?If you're owed a tax refund, there will be no penalty for filing late. However, be mindful of the regulations for your state taxes, as those may vary. If you owe money to the IRS, penalties will begin to accumulate after the tax filing deadline.For every month your tax return is late, you are charged 5% of the taxes owed, and fees can increase up to 25% after 60 days. For every month your payment is late, the penalty is 0.5% of taxes owed, which can also increase up to 25%.It's always smart to file on time to avoid late penalties and plan accordingly if you're late or owe money.   Related: Be Smart About Taxes and Keep More of Your Hard-Earned Cash.When will I get my refund back, and what should I use it for?If you file your taxes on time and electronically, the IRS reports that you'll likely get your refund within 21 days. Even if you filed your taxes early, you still won't receive your funds until mid-February as a lawful safety measure to prevent fraudulent refunds. Depending on how much you anticipate receiving, tax refunds can be used to invest, save or even kickstart your dream side business. Before getting your refund, assess your finances and think about how to wisely spend — or save — the money you'll get back. Tax refunds can feel like a saving grace, so be mindful about where you are in relation to where you want to be, and how the funds will assist in your financial future.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

Note: This is an update of a piece published in March 2021 that reflects new guidance administered by the IRS over the subsequent year.When you buy Bitcoin and sell it for a profit, you are subject to capital-gains taxes. This is the case whether you buy Bitcoin and sell it for dollars or whether you exchange it for other cryptocurrency for a profit. This is also the case if you buy Bitcoin, it goes up in value and then you exchange the Bitcoin for goods or services.The IRS has given guidance twice on cryptocurrency tax issues in IRS Revenue Ruling 2014-21 and 2019-24. The critical determination by the IRS in 2014 was that cryptocurrency is property, not currency, for federal tax purposes. This critical determination meant that crypto-trading profits will be treated similar to stock-trading profits, as stock and crypto are both considered property for tax purposes. Treating crypto profits like stock seems straightforward enough, but the rules are not so clear for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, since crypto can be purchased with dollars, go up or down in value and then be exchanged to buy a Tesla, pizza or even withdrawn for cash at a Bitcoin ATM. These exchange outcomes are not common in stock trading, and as a result the rules for crypto taxation are confounding.



Related: Tax Rules for Buying and Selling Bitcoin and Other CryptoTrading of crypto and short-term vs. long-term gainsLike a stock portfolio that you personally own, you will need to track the value of the crypto you buy, and then you'll also need to track the value of crypto when it is sold or exchanged. For example, if you bought Bitcoin for $30,000 and then sold it in exchange for $50,000, you'll have a gain of $20,000. This gain is subject to tax at either short- or long-term capital-gains rates depending on how long you held the Bitcoin. If you held the Bitcoin for more than one year, you get preferred long-term capital-gains rates of 0-20%. Essentially, the long-term capital-gains tax rate is 0% for low- to middle-income earners (generally less than $40,000 if single, $81,000 for married couples),15% for middle- to high-income earners (generally income up to $445,000 if single, $510,000 for married couples) and 20% for high-income earners (generally income in excess of $445,000 if single, $510,000 for married couples).If you held the Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency for a year or less, then you are subject to short-term capital-gains rates, which vary from 0-37% based on your modified, adjusted gross income.Exchanging one crypto for anotherThe exchange of one cryptocurrency for another causes taxable gain. For example, if you bought $50,000 of Bitcoin one month and then exchanged it for Ethereum later worth $70,000, then you have a taxable gain of $20,000. This is the case whether you held the Bitcoin for one minute and traded it for other cryptocurrency or whether it was held for years.Using crypto for goods or servicesWhen you exchange cryptocurrency for goods or services, you are taxed on the increase in value that cryptocurrency has from the time of purchase until the time it is exchanged. For example, if you bought a Tesla with $100,000 worth of Bitcoin, you would need to track when that $100,000 in Bitcoin was purchased, and you would then pay tax on the increase. If that Bitcoin were purchased at a value of $40,000, then there would be a gain of $60,000 when that Bitcoin is then exchanged for the Tesla. If held for over a year, it will be a long-term capital gain and will be at preferred rates. If the Bitcoin was held a year or less, the $60,000 gain will be taxed at short-term capital-gains rates.Crypto lossesWhen you buy and then sell Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency for a loss, you are entitled to a tax loss. Losses can occur when selling crypto at a loss and when exchanging crypto for other cryptocurrency or goods or services at a loss. Losses from one crypto trade or exchange can be used to offset other crypto gains. Short-term crypto losses can offset short-term crypto gains, and long-term crypto losses can be used to offset long-term crypto gains. Crypto losses can also potentially be used to offset gains from stock or mutual funds. If crypto losses exceed crypto gains, as well as stock, ETF and mutual fund gains, then up to $3,000 of the loss can be used to offset other income such as wages or self-employment income. Any losses that cannot fully be used against income in the year incurred can be carried forward to future years and netted against future crypto or stock-trading gains.


Crypto forks and airdropsIRS guidance in 2019 clarified two unique items that can occur on a crypto blockchain. The first is a fork. There are different kinds of forks that may occur, and what crypto owners need to know for tax purposes is that if a new coin result from a hard fork, those new coins are considered taxable as ordinary income to the recipient. The IRS also clarified in 2019 that an airdrop of new coins to existing cryptocurrency holders will be taxable as ordinary income to the recipient at regular income-tax rates. Airdrops are distributions of free coins or tokens to current cryptocurrency holders and are usually promotional.Crypto mining is ordinary income taxed at regular ratesCryptocurrency mining  is ordinary income for tax purposes. Cryptocurrency mining is a service that computers provide to a cryptocurrency blockchain network. The owners of these computers typically receive cryptocurrency from the network in exchange for their services. So, for example, if I owned computers or other hardware devices that provided cryptocurrency mining, then I would typically receive crypto in exchange for these services and would pay tax on that crypto to the IRS. The payment in crypto is taxable income just the same as if I were paid in dollars to perform these same services to the network. No only do you have tax at regular ordinary income tax rates, but crypto miners will also need to pay self-employment tax on this income as it is deemed a trade or business. Because of this tax outcome, many crypto miners use an s-corporation as they can minimize self-employment tax liability in a S-corporation. The value of the crypto when it is received is the value to be used for tax-reporting purposes. If the value of the crypto increases after it's received, then you will pay capital-gains tax on the increase of value when the crypto is later sold or exchanged. So, for example, let's say you received Bitcoin worth $1,000 for crypto-mining services and that this crypto then increased in value and three months later was sold and traded for $1,500. The first $1,000 would be taxable as ordinary income. This income will be subject to regular income-tax rates, which range from 0-37%. The $500 increase in value in the Bitcoin after it was earned will be treated as capital-gain income.Crypto staking taxation has not been addressed by the IRSThe taxation of crypto staking income has not been addressed specifically by the IRS. Staking is similar to mining, but is different in many ways. If you are staking crypto and you own or control a node, it is likely that your income is ordinary income and that income will be taxed at ordinary income rates where you will also be subject to self-employment tax. This is similar to the taxation of crypto-mining income. If, however, you are only staking crypto and someone else owns and controls the node, then it is likely that the income will be taxed at regular rates. But that self-employment tax is not due, as you aren't in the trade or business of crypto staking and you are only providing crypto to be staked, not hardware or services. The IRS has not specifically addressed staking, but there are pending cases in tax court on crypto staking that we hope will provide more guidance and clarity on crypto staking income. Record keeping and reporting is requiredThe taxation of cryptocurrency is complicated and requires diligent recordkeeping when buying, selling or exchanging. The responsibility to properly report this is on the crypto owner. There are numerous cryptocurrency-tracking applications that have been created to help cryptocurrency investors, users and traders properly track and report their taxes. Taxbit has set themselves apart as the crypto tax leader and has the most robust offering amongst crypto tax providers, but there are around 10 other companies that have an application to assist in tracking your crypto for tax purposes.The IRS requires the reporting of cryptocurrency gains and losses on form 8949. Form 8949 is filed with your personal 1040 tax return. All providers of crypto in the U.S. will be requited to report crypto transactions and trading to the IRS beginning next year. This includes Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Cash App, Voyager, FTX US, PayPal and Binance.us. Whether the exchange you used reports to the IRS already or not, you still have a reporting obligation.But do not think that you can avoid taxation by using a company outside the U.S. You need to be wary, as this can result in additional foreign asset reporting requirements to the IRS. For example, the foreign bank account rules known as FBAR have a pending rule change that would include crypto holdings to fall under the definition of a bank account and would thus result in foreign bank account reporting of crypto assets. Additionally, crypto held with a provider outside the U.S. that exceeds $50,000 in value may also require the filing of a Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, or Form 8938. In sum, do not assume that trading and holding crypto abroad will exempt you from tax-reporting obligations. In fact, it makes it more complicated, and it does not reduce your tax obligations.Related: New IRS 1099 Rule for PayPal and Venmo Targets Very Small Businesses and Will Cause Misreporting and Errors


Using an IRA to defer or obtain tax-free gains on crypto profits A Roth IRA can be used to invest in crypto and can grow and come out tax-free at retirement. When trading crypto with a Roth IRA or other retirement account, you can bypass the tracking and annual tax-reporting, as crypto profits in a Roth IRA or other retirement account are not subject to tax and do not show up on your 1040 personal tax return.Many early adopters of cryptocurrency who my company worked with found the tax rules and reporting of cryptocurrency gains to be onerous and expensive. These early adopters enjoyed dramatic value increases, and in turn saw significant tax bills when selling or exchanging that cryptocurrency. The Roth IRA became a particular favorite for those who perceived large gains, as it allowed them to invest and own cryptocurrency where the gains can grow and come out tax-free once they reach retirement age of 59 ½.A self-directed Roth IRA is a more tax-efficient option to invest or trade cryptocurrency for the long haul. For those unfamiliar, the income and gains made by a Roth IRA are not taxable and they grow and come out tax-free at retirement. This is the case with stock you trade in your Roth IRA, and it is the case with crypto that you trade in your Roth IRA. When using a retirement account, you can also skip over the annual tax reporting on your 1040, given that the income in a retirement account is exempt from capital-gains taxes.In additional to Roth IRAs, you can also use traditional IRAs, HSAs solo 401(k)s and other retirement accounts to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Keep in mind that traditional IRAs and 401(k) accounts are subject to tax on the distributions from those accounts at retirement, but are not subject to tax year-to-year and grow tax-deferred until you take distributions from the account.It is important to realize that the funds in a Roth IRA or other retirement account cannot be withdrawn until the account owner reaches 59 ½. If the account owner takes a distribution of the gains on a Roth IRA before the owner reaches age 59 ½, they will be subject to early withdrawal penalties and taxes on the investment gains withdrawn.The usual broker dealers who provide retirement accounts do not allow you to invest and trade cryptocurrency in their IRAs and Roth IRAs. Instead, you will need to use a retirement account custodian who provides self-directed accounts. This is what my company and about 20 other companies in the so called self-directed IRA industry provide. These companies allow you to invest in real estate, private companies, and some allow for cryptocurrency. When choosing a provider for a crypto IRA or crypto Roth IRA, watch out for significant trading fees, make sure they are licensed and ensure that you are comfortable with the management team and services selected.   The landscape surrounding cryptocurrency and its holders' legal accountability will continue shifting, necessetating due diligence. With less than a week till tax day 2022, now is the time to conduct yours.

58,"Taxes on Small Businesses Across the Globe, Mapped: See Where Rates Are High, Low — and Nonexistent","Apr 18, 2022",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/taxes-on-small-businesses-across-the-globe-mapped-see/424351,"
Image Credit: Courtesy of OnDeckAs our world becomes more interconnected and doing business across borders increasingly common, corporate tax rates have emerged as a hot topic — the make-or-break factor when it comes to foreign investment. Some of the biggest companies on Earth, including tech behemoths like Apple, Amazon and Google, have turned to countries with lower rates to save big on taxation, rewarding those that bring them the greatest profits. The minimal international coordination regarding corporate taxation prompted leaders of the world's 20 largest economies (G-20) to endorse a global minimum tax rate of 15% last October. ""We call on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting to swiftly develop the model rules and multilateral instruments as agreed in the Detailed Implementation Plan, with a view to ensure that the new rules will come into effect at global level in 2023,"" the draft conclusions, as seen by Reuters, stated.



Related: The Pandora Papers Reveals Where the Richest People in the World Are Hiding Their MoneyThe deal was signed by 136 countries, which account for 90% of the global economy, per the World Economic Forum. The new rate applies to overseas profits of multinational firms with $868 million in sales globally and allows local governments to instate a tax rate of their choosing — though a company's home government could bump its taxes to meet the 15% minimum threshold and prevent the profit loophole. 


To get a sense of just how widely corporate tax rates vary from country to country, small business lending company OnDeck mapped it out. OnDeck pulled corporate-tax-rate data from KPMG, the Tax Foundation, Trading Economics, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and various government websites, applying each country's tax laws to ""a model company with revenue of $1 million, profit of $100,000 a year, five to nine employees, is owned by a resident of the country in question, and earns a majority of its revenue from business operations within the country in question.""Related: Here's How The UAE's New 9% Corporate Tax Could Impact the Country's Entrepreneurial EcosystemOnDeck's study didn't include companies in the oil, gas and mining sectors, or publicly traded companies.Here's what the study found.


North America's tax rates for business owners are comparable to the global average The average corporate tax rate for North American countries is 21.5% — about in line with the worldwide average. In the U.S., companies are subject to a 21% federal tax rate in addition to state corporate taxes, which range from 0% in South Dakota and Wyoming to upwards of 9% in Alaska, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and a high of 11.5% in New Jersey, per the Tax Foundation. Canada comes in close behind the U.S., imposing a $27,125 tax per $100,000 in annual profit.But tax rates in nearby island nations vary more significantly, with a taxation of $33,000 per $100,000 in annual profit in Saint Kitts and Nevis; $30,000 in Saint Lucia and several others; $15,000 in Cuba; and $0 in the Bahamas — the only remaining tax haven associated with the continent.

Still, there's quite a bit of variation, with a taxation of $36,000 per $100,000 in annual profit in Suriname (the highest corporate tax rate anywhere in the world); $25,000 in Ecuador, Chile and several other countries; and just $10,000 in Paraguay. Additionally, it takes an average of 42.1 days to start a business in South America — considerably longer than Canada's one-and-a-half days, Georgia's one day or New Zealand's half a day. 


Image Credit: Courtesy of OnDeckAfrica has the highest corporate tax rate, on average  Africa has the highest average tax rate of any region, at 27.5%. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), developing countries rely more heavily on corporate income tax; in Malaysia, for example, corporate taxation makes up 66% of the country's total tax revenue versus just 9% in France and the United Kingdom. Chad, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Sudan and Zambia have a taxation rate of 35% — tied for the second highest in the world. The process of starting a business is also expensive and difficult; in Equatorial Guinea, for instance, it requires approximately 16 procedures to get a new venture off the ground. Image Credit: Courtesy of OnDeckEastern Europe has some of the lowest corporate tax rates The average corporate tax rate for European countries is 17.9%, remarkably lower than those in Africa, South America or North America. Malta levies the highest taxation at $35,000 per $100,000 in annual profit, but the range is wide across the continent, dipping to just $15,000 in Georgia, $12,500 in Cyprus and even as low as $0 in Monaco (dependent on earning a minimum of 75% of revenue within the country) and Vatican City. Starting a business is also relatively expedient, taking only 12.7 days on average. 


Image Credit: Courtesy of OnDeckThe Middle East and Central Asia have the lowest average tax rateSmall businesses in the Middle East and Central Asia are taxed at the lowest average rate, just 16.7%. Many governments in the region receive the majority of their revenue from national oil and gas companies (which were not included in this study), driving down taxation rates for small businesses outside of those sectors. Case in point: Qatar imposes a $10,000 general corporate tax rate per $100,000 in annual profit and more than triples that figure to $35,000 (or even more) for oil companies. Similarly, Bahrain serves as a tax haven for most businesses, charging $0, but it can levy a 46% tax rate on oil and gas companies' net profits. Image Credit: Courtesy of OnDeckCorporate tax rates vary significantly across the rest of Asia and Oceania As we've already seen across several continents, taxation rates can differ substantially from country to country. For example, Japan has the highest rate in the region — $33,580 per $100,000 in annual profit — while South Korea has one of the lowest in the region at just $11,000. Bangladesh, with a tax rate of $32,500 per $100,000 in annual profit, is another high-tax standout in the region, while island nations Nauru and Vanuatu round out the tax havens across the globe.

April 18 is Tax Day, the last day that tax returns for individual income can be submitted to the federal government, with many celebrating money earned back or lamenting the money that they still owe.Everyone has that one friend or family member who always seems to manage to find the most bizarre or out-of-the-box loopholes to get money back when it comes to filing taxes.Tax deductions and filings can be extremely nuanced and specific, and many can miss out on potential money in the bank by overlooking deductions that they might qualify for.

60,4 Effective Strategies to Reduce Your Income Taxes,"Apr 13, 2022",Kyle Leighton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/4-effective-strategies-to-reduce-your-income-taxes/422507,"
For most income earners, taxes are an inevitable part of life. As such, taxpayers know that April 15 (or April 18 for 2022) comes around every year. Still, it's easy to enter tax season unprepared — and get surprised by a bloated tax bill. But by planning ahead and making a few strategic money moves throughout the year, filers can reduce their burden and hold onto more of their hard-earned cash.1. Invest for retirementInvesting for retirement is one of the best ways to reduce income tax burdens while also saving for your post-work future. Those individuals whose annual earnings fall below IRS limits can generally contribute to a traditional individual retirement account (IRA), and eligible employees may have access to a 401(k) through their employer.Pre-tax contributions to these accounts can lower individual taxable incomes in a given year, allowing savers to minimize their current tax bill and enjoy tax-deferred growth until retirement. Best of all, these tax write-offs don't require itemization, which means earners can lower their income and still take the standard deduction.

Take advantage of healthcare expensesDespite the high cost of premiums, health-insurance carriers often charge deductibles and copays to pass some healthcare costs onto consumers. Fortunately, the IRS offers ways to reduce the financial strain.


One method to reduce income taxes is to take advantage of high-deductible healthcare plans and open a health savings account. These tax-exempt accounts allow earners to contribute up to $3,650 for individuals or $7,300 for families (plus $1,000 for those over 55) in tax-free dollars. The money also grows and can be withdrawn tax-free to pay for eligible medical and dental expenses.Some employers also operate FSAs, or flexible spending accounts, which (in 2022) allow employees to contribute up to $2,850 for qualified medical, dental and related over-the-counter expenses. Depending on the plan, employers may permit savers to roll the funds over every year or require them to use contributed funds within a 12-month timeframe.For those with higher medical costs, the federal government also permits tax filers to deduct medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of a person's gross adjusted income in a given tax year.Related: Handle Tax Season Yourself This Year


3. Check for tax creditsDeductions lower taxpayers' burdens by reducing the income eligible for taxation. By contrast, credits cut tax bills dollar-for-dollar — and if the credit reduces a tax bill below zero, the IRS may refund the remaining credit, even for taxpayers who don't have to pay federal income taxes.One particular credit many taxpayers may be unaware of is the earned income tax credit. The IRS calculates this credit based on income and family size to issue refunds, which could total up to $6,728 for earners who made less than $57,000 in 2021.Related: 75 Items You May Be Able to Deduct From Your Taxes4. Watch out for business deductionsSmall-business owners, sidehustlers and freelancers may qualify for dozens of potential deductions and tax credits, depending on the business they run. A few common deductions include:


Business-related vehicle mileage or travel expenses.Website, membership and subscription fees.Internet and phone bills (proportional to business use).Office and technological supplies.Advertising fees.And even insurance premiums.Self-employed individuals are also allowed to write off 50% of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax that pays for Social Security and Medicare programs. And once again, the IRS doesn't require itemization to claim this deduction.Paying taxes is an inevitability that all income earners face, but that doesn't mean filers should pay more than necessary. Planning ahead, studying tax codes, itemizing receipts and saving for retirement and healthcare expenses make it easy to keep tax bills to a minimum.

61,5 Last-minute (No Judgement) Tax Tips,"Apr 9, 2022",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-last-minute-no-judgement-tax-tips/423406,"
If you haven't finished your taxes yet, don't panic.You're much more likely to make mistakes if you're under stress and feeling rushed. Take a deep breath and set aside some time to tackle your taxes with a clear mind.We've put together five last-minute tax tips to help you avoid common mistakes, save money, and set yourself up for greater financial success.



1. Know the factsIn the U.S., personal tax returns are due April 18, 2022. Unlike in 2020 and 2021, the IRS is sticking to its deadline this year.But there are still pandemic-related complexities to consider. Work with your tax advisor to review any stimulus payments or Advance Child Tax Credits you received to ensure you received the appropriate amounts.


If you received a Paycheck Protection Program loan, your tax advisor can work with you to ensure you follow IRS guidelines. Expenses paid with PPP loan proceeds are tax-deductible even if your loan was forgiven, so don't miss this.Business owners may also benefit from another pandemic-relief program — the Employee Retention Credit. This gives eligible employers a refundable tax credit for the employer's share of Social Security tax. In 2021, the credit was equal to 70% of qualified wages up to $10,000 per employee per quarter paid through September 30. That means you could be eligible for a tax credit of up to $21,000 per employee.2. Find a great tax advisorIf you aren't working with one now, it may be challenging to find a good one this late in the game. Still, invest time in your search. It's not too soon to start thinking about your 2022 taxes. Referrals are a great place to start.Your tax advisor should become a trusted member of your wealth strategy team. Look for a CPA who will take the time to get to know you and your goals. The best tax advisors will use a proven strategy for permanent tax reduction that aligns with your wealth strategy.


3. Maximize deductionsThere's no reason to pay more tax than you owe. Yet, we often see people do just that because they miss out on taking qualified deductions.Remember: Tax deductions aren't loopholes. Instead, these are incentives the government has intentionally included in the tax code to encourage people to spend money on things the government believes benefit the larger society, such as building a business or investing in housing.If you haven't been tracking throughout the year, take the time to review your financial transactions and other expenses. With each one, ask: How can this be deductible?Deductions may include:


Home officeCharitable contributionsAutomobilesChild careStudent loan interestEducation and trainingBusiness travelWork with your tax advisor on this. Even now, there are still some opportunities to add to your 2021 deductions by contributing to certain retirement plans — including IRAs and SEPs — before April 18.4. Check on your state taxes if you have a pass-through entityMost U.S. businesses are pass-through entities, or PTE, a type of business structure where the business's profit flows through to the individual income tax of owners and members. Some states have created an incentive for these businesses in the form of an elective pass-through entity tax, so it's important to know the rules in your state.Here's how it works: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 capped the deduction people could take for their state and local taxes at $10,000. In states with an optional PTE tax, eligible taxpayers can shift the payment of state income taxes from the individual to the entity, where the taxes are fully deductible.This is one of many tax strategies you should be able to count on your tax advisor to include in your planning.


5. Ask for an extension if you need oneRequest an extension if you can't complete an accurate return by April 18, but don't wait to make a payment if you owe additional tax. Extension or not, all tax payments are due on April 18 to avoid penalties and interest.If you can't make your full payment, talk with your tax advisor about the best strategy. Different waivers may apply to your situation and help minimize penalties.

62,California Woman Wins Lottery by Accident,"Apr 8, 2022",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/california-woman-wins-lottery-by-accident/424296,"
When LaQuedra Edwards put $40 into a lottery scratchers machine at a Tarzana, Calif. Vons Supermarket last November, luck was on her side in an unexpected way. Edwards didn't get to choose her ticket that day; a stranger bumped into her, causing her to accidentally select a $30 200X Scratchers ticket by mistake — and win a $10 million prize. Edwards recalled the serendipitous encounter, saying, ""some rude person"" bumped into her, ""didn't say a thing and just walked out the door."" Annoyed that she wouldn't be able to buy her go-to set of lower-priced tickets, Edwards went back to her car — and got the surprise of a lifetime. 



Related: North Carolina Man Wins Lottery Twice After Accidentally Buying 2 Identical TicketsScratching off the ticket revealed she'd just won millions. ""I didn't really believe it at first, but I got on the 405 freeway and kept looking down at (the ticket), and I almost crashed my car,"" Edwards said. ""I pulled over, looked at it again and again, scanned it with my (California Lottery mobile) app, and I just kept thinking this can't be right.""


Edwards plans to use her winnings to buy a house and start a non-profit organization, and the Vons location that sold the lucky ticket will receive a $50,000 bonus. How much will Edwards walk away with after taxes? Although California is a relatively high tax state, there's an exception for lottery winners (those who bought their tickets in the state, at least.) But those winnings will generally be subject to the highest federal tax rate — 37% — and, when lumped in with overall annual income, may incur local and state taxes. Related: The Harder You Work, the Luckier You GetEdwards may not be a full $10 million richer, but it's safe to say her winnings are worth more than the apology she didn't get in front of the lotto machine that day.

63,"TurboTax Owner Intuit Slammed With FTC Lawsuit, Accusations of 'Bait-and-Switch' Advertising","Mar 30, 2022",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/turbotax-owner-intuit-slammed-with-ftc-lawsuit-accusations/423495,"
As Tax Day approaches (April 18 this year), many people are looking for an easy way to check the often onerous task off their to-do lists. Some turn to tax-preparation services to make things easier, but the associated costs can add up, and few want to part with more money than they already owe or sacrifice a portion of their refund. That's where ""free"" tax-filing software comes in — or so Intuit-owned TurboTax, one of tax prep's major players, wants you to think.The Federal Trade Commission has just sued Intuit, alleging its advertising touting ""free"" tax-filing services via its TurboTax software is ""deceptive."" In a press release, the FTC argued that the majority of tax filers can't use the ""free"" service because it excludes people like gig-economy workers who receive 1099 forms or those who earn farm income. The government agency claims that approximately two-thirds of tax filers were unable to use TurboTax's free service in 2020 and has asked a federal court to put an end to Intuit's advertising campaign. Related: Tax Day 2022: Deadlines and All Your Questions Answered



""TurboTax is bombarding consumers with ads for ""free' tax filing services, and then hitting them with charges when it's time to file,"" said Samuel Levine, director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection. ""We are asking a court to immediately halt this bait-and-switch, and to protect taxpayers at the peak of filing season.""The FTC voted 3-1 in favor of bringing the lawsuit against Intuit. 


But Intuit, which is also behind Quickbooks, Mint, Credit Karma and Mailchimp, disputes the FTC's allegations. In a press release for the company, Kerry McLean, executive vice president and general counsel of Intuit, said, ""The FTC's arguments are simply not credible. Far from steering taxpayers away from free tax preparation offerings, our free advertising campaigns have led to more Americans filing their taxes for free than ever before and have been central to raising awareness of free tax prep."" Related: These Are the Most Common Tax-Filing Mistakes for EntrepreneursIntuit went on to say that the FTC's lawsuit exemplifies a ""significant disconnect"" between government agencies, as the software giant was a founding member of the Internal Revenue Service's Free File program and was ""at all times"" compliant with IRS requirements. Intuit Inc. was down 1% as of 10:43 a.m. EST.

64,"President Biden to Propose New Minimum Tax Targeting Billionaires, Unrealized Gains","Mar 28, 2022",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/president-biden-to-propose-new-minimum-tax-targeting/423247,"
President Joe Biden is expected to propose a new minimum tax for ultra-wealthy Americans when he announces his 2023 budget, per a document acquired by CNBC. Dubbed the ""Billionaire Income Tax,"" it would require U.S. households worth in excess of $100 million to pay a 20% minimum tax, with more than half the revenue likely stemming from those worth more than $1 billion. According to the document, ""This minimum tax would make sure that the wealthiest Americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters."" The proposal is expected to lower the deficit by approximately $360 billion over the next 10 years. Related: 5 Ways That Billionaire Warren Buffett Pays a Lower Tax Rate Than His Secretary



Households worth more than $100 million that already pay 20% on their entire incomes will not have to pay more with the 20% minimum rate, but those that haven't will have to make a ""top-up payment"" to meet the new threshold. ""As a result, this new minimum tax will eliminate the ability for the unrealized income of ultra-high-net-worth households to go untaxed for decades or generations,"" the document reads. Biden's 2023 budget is expected to be announced today, and, as first reported by The Associated Press, fact sheets released Saturday by the White House budget office reveal the plan is expected to reduce projected budget deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next decade.


But Congress must still decide if it wants to see the proposal through. When Senate Democrats proposed a billionaire's tax last year — one that would have taxed the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest households — it didn't come to pass.

65,5 Questions All Entrepreneurs Should Ask Before Hiring an Accountant,"Mar 25, 2022",Kale Goodman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-questions-all-entrepreneurs-should-ask-before-hiring-an/421238,"
When you are in the beginning stages of starting a business, it is often challenging to balance all the necessary assets you need to be successful.One of the most influential people you should have on your team is a competent accountant or accounting and tax planning firm. Whether you are a one-person operation, have a few employees or your business is established and has hundreds or thousands of employees, having an accountant to help guide you with tax returns, audits and bookkeeping is necessary.But how do you find the right accountant for you?



It can be overwhelming and sometimes costly for a business owner to find the right person for the job. The key to finding the right accountant is asking the right questions upfront to understand if he or she is the right fit, but when you're starting a business, it might be hard to know what those right questions are.Related: Why Accounting Skills Are Indispensable for EntrepreneursHere are the five questions you should be asking when you consult different agencies or accounting firms to hire for your bookkeeping and accounting needs. 1. What industries do you specialize in or have the most expertise in?Not all businesses are the same. Similarly, not all accountants are the same.Your business is in a particular niche and has specific requirements for billing, bookkeeping and accounting. If you're a medical provider billing insurance, your books are going to look completely different compared to an ecommerce business. You don't want to miss out on nuanced expertise. Finding someone with a background in your type of business will help you decide on the right company or person to hire. Every business is different, and you will need someone who knows how to navigate that accordingly. 


2. What is your business model?Asking questions about their business model and mode of operation is an important differentiating factor.  Some accounting and bookkeeping firms will charge you for every minute you spend with them, whether it's on the phone or in person. Newer companies like Easier Accounting operate on a different model. We set you up with a subscription that allows you unlimited access to our accountants for questions and consultations.For some, it may work to have someone who bills hourly because you only need him or her a couple of times per year. For others, it works a lot better to have open lines of communication without the fear of spending 15 minutes of billable time for a 15-second question. Know your expectations and ask the right questions to understand if they can fulfill them. Different businesses and business owners will require different types of business models. For newer business owners, working with someone who will mentor and help you is generally the best, but it usually comes with a monthly retainer instead of hourly pricing.3. How many services do you offer?Sometimes it can be good to have multiple sets of eyes on your books. Using one company for bookkeeping and another for tax preparation can have certain advantages, but most of the time, it makes things messier.


Asking about the services they offer is an essential question for many reasons. A lot of this comes down to expectations and an understanding of what your business will need. A record of transactions, known as bookkeeping, is the basic foundation of accounting, but there are other facets of accounting and financials like tax planning and preparation. Knowing how cohesive their operation is should be a factor in your decision to hire a firm. If they are only available to do bookkeeping but can't help with tax filing or audits, you may find better value elsewhere.Many accountants are a one-person show, and it works for some businesses, but other accounting businesses are firms with different departments. This allows the employees to have a deep understanding of their area of expertise while allowing the business to help with multiple aspects of your financials. This specialization is the most efficient way of operating the back end of your business and is something to look for in an accounting firm.Related: 5 Trends Driving Disruption in the Accounting Industry 


4. Are you a single person or a firm? To add to the last question, since it is hard for one person to cover everything well, do they have a team of people who are well-educated and who specialize in a specific service? Knowing more about your accountant and their business can help you find reassurance that you're going to have the best service possible. A firm that does tax planning, bookkeeping and tax preparation and has departments for each will stand head and shoulders above a single-person operation.Some people who are used to dealing with one individual and like to build rapport with that individual may not enjoy the experience as much. Still, you should understand that a single person generally can't serve your business the same way a firm can.5. Do you offer both compliance and advisory services?As touched on above, with larger firms or accounting businesses, it is not uncommon that the company you hire will handle only bookkeeping and tax preparation. While this will keep you in compliance with the IRS, it won't help you strategize to get the most significant tax return possible. 


Understanding the capacity of these firms is essential. Since many firms are only focused on compliance but don't help you maximize your tax return with strategies upfront, you'll want to find one that does both, especially as your business grows and becomes more complicated.Related: Every Entrepreneur Should Know AccountingThere are a lot of questions that don't necessarily have answers when you start a business, whether it is large or small. But having as many resources at your disposal as possible will make the journey less stressful. When you look for an accountant, find a business you can trust and someone you can turn to when things become stressful. It is best to find someone who will be patient and willing to admit when he or she doesn't have an answer — an accountant who will not shy away from seeking an outside opinion or turning to his or her team.


As hard as it is to navigate the bookkeeping, taxes, audits, etc., for your business, hiring someone to help guide you through this process is worth every bit of financial cost and mental focus.

66,New IRS 1099 Rule for PayPal and Venmo Targets Very Small Businesses and Will Cause Misreporting and Errors,"Feb 17, 2022",Mat Sorensen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/new-irs-1099-rule-for-paypal-and-venmo-targets-very-small/418771,"
The IRS recently announced that payment apps such as PayPal, Venmo, and CashApp will be required to issue 1099s to small businesses and self-employed persons. Here's what you need to know.New rule is targeted at very small businesses and individuals with a side hustleStarting in tax year 2022, payment apps will be required to report to the IRS total payments received by a business account in excess of $600 annually. This new requirement is clearly targeted at the smallest of small businesses and at individuals with a side hustle, as the prior rule only required a payment app to report when an account received more than $20,000 and had 200 or more transactions within the year. These micro-businesses that collect less than $20,000 a year previously did not fall under the 1099 rule, but will now be treated like every other business, large or small.Related: Venmo Built Crypto Trading Into Its Payments App



A small business, including an individual with a side hustle, must report its income received regardless of whether a 1099-K was issued from a payment app. This is something that companies large and small have dealt with for years from payment apps and credit-card processors. However, these very small businesses that are now subject to the new rule do not have their own internal tax departments or a CPA who prepares their taxes to help them wade through numerous income issues and questions that arise when receiving a 1099-K.Small businesses worry about two 1099s being reported for the same incomeIgnatius L. Jackson, a Phoenix CPA, worries that the income will be counted twice if payment apps ""send a 1099-K to a small business for payments received and the business that makes the payment will also send a 1099-NEC, basically double counting the income."" Consider a graphic designer who does part-time freelance work and who is paid $3,000 by a single customer for their work via PayPal. The freelancer will get a 1099-K from PayPal for the $3,000 and will also get a 1099-NEC from the business customer they did work for in the amount of $3,000. Because two 1099s are reported, it appears that the freelance graphic designer made $6,000. The IRS is actually instructing businesses to issue a 1099-NEC to contractors they pay even though they know the contractor will also be receiving a 1099-K from their payment app. The IRS is requiring two 1099s in this instance, and it's going to cause confusion and overreporting of income for self-employed persons and very small businesses.


While proper accounting procedures and bookkeeping can help avoid the double counting of income, self-employed persons with a side hustle, freelancers and the smallest of small-business owners simply don't have the resources or technical expertise to catch these accounting details and will be left doing their taxes with multiple 1099s reporting the same income. Mr. Jackson says, ""I foresee it will be a disaster when these 1099-Ks start being sent and will likely result in taxpayers having to pay someone to help them with their tax returns, when they could normally do them on their own.""Concerns over personal payments being misreportedPayPal and Venmo have two different account types: personal and business. Presumably, they will only be reporting 1099-Ks on business accounts and business owners can establish a separate business account and can have their customers pay that account. Despite the two-account option, it's going to be very common for business owners to receive personal payments in their business accounts, and those amounts will get included on their 1099-K to the IRS.The examples are endless and happen in some of the most common self-employed situations. Consider a hairstylist whose who goes out for drinks with a friend who is also a client, and that friend ends up splitting costs for drinks and pays her hairstylist friends business account. Or consider the childcare provider who is paid $7,000 a year for their services but also incurs and is reimbursed another $2,000 over the year for gas or food that is bought to care for the children. If the childcare provider is paid via Venmo for the entire $9,000 for the year, their 1099-K will reflect $9,000 in gross income, and not $7,000 that is the taxable part of the payments. These self-employed persons and taxpayers can certainly deduct the travel and food costs as expenses to income, but it will create a significant record-keeping burden on them to verify the amounts reported on their 1099s to ensure that they aren't reporting more income than they received.


Related: Visa, PayPal to Allow Customers to Pay With CryptocurrencyTips for following the new Venmo/Paypal rulesSmall businesses who will begin receiving 1099s under the new rules should keep in mind the following three key tips to avoid overreporting of income on their taxes.Separate your business and personal account payment apps. Small-business owners and self-employed persons should use a separate business account for their business activities. They should only use that payment account for business income and expenses, and it should be tied to their separate business-checking account. They need to be careful not to receive personal reimbursements and funds into their business- payment account, as those amounts received will end up on their 1099-K that's reported to the IRS.Track expenses and reimbursement amounts. Keep good records of your business expenses and amounts you are paid that are reimbursements of costs you covered for your customer. These amounts are used to reduce the gross income reported to the IRS via a 1099-K, but you've got to keep good records and need to track these items in order to deduct them.Don't double count income on 1099s. There will be numerous instances where a self-employed person who provides services to a business customer will receive a 1099-K from the payment app and they will also receive a 1099-NEC from the same customer for the same payment. Self-employed persons and small businesses using payment apps need to ensure that they do not count these amounts twice on their tax return and need to track their business income carefully so that they don't get taxed twice on the same income. Don't just rely on the 1099s themselves to track your income. They can result in overpayment of taxes as the payment app has to report the payment, and so does a business customer who is paying the small business or freelancer.These new rules will certainly create new headaches, but as with anything else, stay up to date and do your due diligence and they don't have to cause undue pain.

Taxes can be costly. These costs cut into your income and can have devastating effects on your quality of life, especially in times of transition. Although marketing is my main business, I wear many hats as an entrepreneur. Learning some accounting and ways to save on taxes are valuable tools to have on hand. When families find themselves facing a new season of life, I've discovered ways to avoid or lessen the strain taxes can put on their financial situation.Just starting out: FIRPTA withholdingOne of the first major investments a family usually makes is purchasing a first house.Real estate can be a solid investment. Traditionally, homes appreciate in value. When it's time to sell your primary residence, a capital-gains tax is calculated on the profit. Most homeowners will be exempt from this tax: Single owners pay no capital-gains tax on the first $250,000 of profit. Married couples filing jointly are exempt from the first $500,000 of profit.



Real estate, such as your home, is a type of real property. If your home, or any other real-property investment, is purchased from a foreign person who is a nonresident alien, then the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA) requires withholding a certain percentage from the real-estate transaction at the time of purchase. The IRS will expect this to be remitted to them within 20 days of the transaction.A common exemption that applies in this situation is if the property is purchased for under a certain price and if it will be used by the family as a residence. Other exemptions enable investors to reduce or eliminate the withholding amount.  


Related: How to Leverage Real-Estate Tax-Deferral Strategies to Grow Your BusinessPreparing for retirement Sooner or later, your family grows up. Braces, college and weddings will be expenses of the past. You'll need to start preparing for retirement long before these milestone events. In a recent Barron's  article, Gabriel Shahin, CFP, identifies the two most important things to do for your long-term financial health: cutting down your debt and investing for growth. Become strategic with your investments by understanding the ups and downs of the stock market. Invest in suitable mutual and exchange-traded funds, and you could get higher returns during market drops. Consider ways to minimize taxes you'll pay when you're retired. Distributions from Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts aren't taxable. Treasury bonds are exempt from state taxes. If you think through your retirement today, you could greatly benefit from tax-free income.

The dreaded inheritance tax offers the double whammy: When you die, you're going to owe taxes on all the stuff you can't take with you.Your estate includes all your stuff: cash, stocks and bonds, real estate, art collections, boats, cars. After you die, an executor will make sure that all outstanding debts and expenses are paid. If the value of your estate at that point is worth more than a certain exemption amount, then your estate will owe taxes on this excess amount. Many states also have an estate tax.When your heirs receive their portion of the inheritance, they may pay an inheritance tax too. To minimize the plethora of future taxes, many families look carefully into how they buy or transfer property. This can affect the value of the estate.Assets, such as properties, can be moved out of your estate and into a family limited partnership. You would be the general partner and main decision maker. Heirs are appointed as partners with a stake in the company.Related: Smart Estate Planning Tips for EntrepreneursReal-estate investment trusts (REITs) enable you to invest in real estate through stocks. Because they're treated as pass-through entities (like LLCs and S-Corporations), income isn't taxed until it's paid to shareholders. And heirs don't pay capital-gains tax on stocks that are unsold at the time of a relative's death.


To be fair, if you're in this situation, it would be wise to hire an estate planner to help you navigate these decisions. An attorney can help you with the specific legal language used in your will or trust to protect your assets.Taxes are intimidating and can be expensive, but with proper preparation and guidance, you can manage your taxes during inevitable life transitions and gain financial freedom at the same time.

71,100-Plus Millionaires Call for Wealth Taxes on the World's Richest: 'Tax Us Now',"Jan 20, 2022",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/100-plus-millionaires-call-for-wealth-taxes-on-the-worlds/414145,"
In a bid to bridge the widening wealth gap, some of the world's richest citizens are requesting that governments across the globe raise taxes on ultra-wealthy individuals. The call to action was published this week as an open letter signed by 102 millionaires who share a belief that the current international tax system has fostered inequality and mistrust. The group calls itself the ""Patriotic Millionaires,"" and it includes Disney heiress Abigail Disney, who has long called for higher taxes on the ultrawealthy; her brother Tim Disney; and venture capitalist and early Amazon investor Nick Hanauer. The signatories come from eight different countries, including the U.S., Canada, the UK and Germany.""As millionaires, we know that the current tax system is not fair,"" they wrote. ""Most of us can say that, while the world has gone through an immense amount of suffering in the last two years, we have actually seen our wealth rise during the pandemic — yet few if any of us can honestly say that we pay our fair share in taxes.""



Related: Why the Rich Need to Stop Worrying About Being Taxed""To put it simply, restoring trust requires taxing the rich,"" the letter continues. ""The world — every country in it — must demand the rich pay their fair share. Tax us, the rich, and tax us now."" 


The letter's release coincides with the originally scheduled timing of this year's World Economic Forum, which brings together world leaders, business executives and other elites in Davos, Switzerland. (The in-person 2022 Forum has been deferred to this summer due to ongoing pandemic-safety concerns, with a series of virtual sessions occurring this week.) The 2022 Forum's theme asks, ""How do we work together and restore trust?"" and the aforementioned millionaires are urging particpants to ""acknowledge the simple, effective solution staring them in the face"" — higher taxes for the rich. The letter also comes after Oxfam issued a report advocating more taxation for the rich. According to the organization, the world's 10 richest men have profited so much from the pandemic that a one-time 99% tax on their gains could, at minimum, cover the cost of all Covid-vaccine production.Related: How Do Wealthy People Get Away With Not Paying Their 'Fair Share' of Taxes?

72,3 Steps to Make 2022 Your Best Tax Year Yet,"Jan 16, 2022",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/3-steps-to-make-2022-your-best-tax-year-yet/404535,"
The new year is here, which means tax season is right around the corner.In many ways, taxes became more complicated during the pandemic, with newly added exemptions and deductions, making it more important than ever to get ahead of the game. Now is the time for business owners and investors to create an effective tax strategy for 2022.Here are three steps you can take to start the year off strong.



Step 1: Analyze IncomeReview your 2021 income and your projections for 2022 and 2023. Are you anticipating a significant change? If so, part of your strategy should be to identify what this means for your tax bracket and begin planning accordingly.You can reduce taxes by optimizing the way you receive money from your business or other entities as well. As you start the new year, make sure the salary or distributions you receive from your entities is on track. If you need to make adjustments, do so early so that you don't have to scramble at the end of the year.


Many accountants suggest pushing income to a future year as a way to postpone tax payments. This strategy can be effective, but it isn't always the best choice. There are a few different factors to consider when deciding whether to do this. First, is your income so low you lose deductions? Many personal deductions don't carry over to the next year. Rather than taking deductions now, you may want to accelerate your income to make use of all your deductions.Related: Time to Send Out 1099s. What to Know About Tax Season.If you have gig income or if you plan to sell stocks at a gain this year, make sure you're planning for the associated income taxes. Typically, you should be paying estimated taxes on a quarterly basis. Wage earners have another option: You can withhold more on a year-end bonus or on your W-2 up to the full amount of pay, and it's considered spread evenly over all four quarters.Step 2: Get Your Documentation in OrderJanuary is a great time to get your recordkeeping in order. Invest some time now in establishing a solid system for tracking your finances and creating good bookkeeping habits. Some of the common items to track include:


MileageTravel expensesAll other business expensesMedical expensesChildcare expensesReal estate hours (if you're a real estate professional)Maintaining proper documentation of your income and expenses throughout the year is not only valuable in the case of a potential audit, it also is a great way to keep track of potential tax deductions.Step 3: Become Someone the Tax Law FavorsWhile preparing to make investments, consider if they're the ones the government wants you to make. Tax laws are a series of incentives for business owners and investors, and it's easy to take advantage of the opportunities when you understand how the laws can work in your favor.Related: 75 Items You May Be Able to Deduct from Your TaxesThe government favors producers — such as business owners, real estate investors and commodity providers — and has created huge tax incentives for these activities because they spur economic growth. While consumers typically owe 40% in taxes, producers can easily pay less than 20% in taxes based on the level of their activity. This reduction in taxes allows you to continue to reinvest and grow your wealth.


As you can see, reducing your taxes is a valuable process. Don't allow yourself to be stuck in a tax rut doing the same things you've always done. It's time to reevaluate your plan and set yourself up for your best tax year yet.

73,Understanding the Art of NFT Taxes,"Jan 7, 2022",Michel Valbrun,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/understanding-the-art-of-nft-taxes/401878,"
NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are still a relatively new phenomenon. One could make the argument that they originated with the 2017 Cryptokitties project, but they didn't grab the world's attention until early 2021 when artist Mike ""Beeple"" Winkelmann sold an NFT through British auction house Christie's for $69 million.Since then, interest in them has spread like wildfire, with NFTs being scooped up left and right. If you're going to dive into the NFT scene, it's important to understand how they're taxed. Being such a new financial phenomenon, it's not surprising that many don't fully understand the tax laws regarding NFTs, especially when those laws can be fairly ambiguous.Related: Here's What to Keep in Mind When Creating and Selling an NFTWe can't give you information that's specific to your situation. For that reason, we strongly recommend that, if you've bought, sold or traded NFTs, you hire the services of a professional. What we can do, however, is give you some general information to keep in mind when dealing with NFTs.



Regard NFTs as collectiblesWhen dealing with cryptocurrencies, investors are subject to a specific set of tax rules. You'll encounter similar rules when buying and selling NFTs, but there are some differences, so don't get yourself into trouble by treating NFTs like crypto. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are taxed like stocks, the IRS likely classifies NFTs as collectibles, which are taxed at a different rate.Unfortunately, NFTs present a very new concept to the tax world, and how they're classified for tax purposes is a matter of rigorous debate. Several professionals agree, however, that they fall under the umbrella of collectibles, along with things like gems, coins, antiques and works of art. Experts argue that, while current tax law doesn't elaborate too deeply on what constitutes a collectible, an NFT would be regarded as a work of art.


An NFT being a collectible means that it will be taxed at a certain rate. That rate is higher than what cryptocurrencies are taxed at, so if you make the mistake of treating an NFT exchange like a crypto exchange, you're going to owe more than you expected.The maximum long-term capital gains tax rate for crypto, like stocks and other property, is 20% for the highest tax bracket. The long-term rate for NFTs is 28%, again for the highest bracket. The short-term capital gain rate for NFTs, short-term meaning you held the asset for less than 12 months, is 37%.Track everythingWhen you do anything with an NFT, whether you're buying, selling, or trading, it's up to you to manually record all of the details. Unlike other monetary transactions, including those made with cryptocurrency, there's very little recorded when NFTs switch virtual hands. These dealings are not tracked like traditional purchases.Similarly, there's no easy way to see the value of an NFT. It is again up to you to appraise and record NFT values as they happen so that you have all of that information available when it comes time to file.

74,Setting Up an Office IRA Can Protect You and Your Small Business Team. Here Are 3 Great Options.,"Jan 5, 2022",Dr. Steven Ghim,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/setting-up-an-office-ira-can-protect-you-and-your-small/404305,"
When you first start a business, it may feel like the to-do list is endless. All of the paperwork, all of the hurdles, making your first hires, managing the office, constantly monitoring data — it can be overwhelming. In the whirlwind of those early obstacles, you may neglect something vital to your success, which is setting up an office retirement plan. This is not something to be put off for later or lost in a pile of other work. It's something you should do now that will promise financial stability and trust among employees in the future. As you grow, you've got optionsAs a business owner, there are multiple types of IRAs you can offer to your team. However, when you are just starting and still relatively small, your best option is usually a Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees account (SIMPLE). A SIMPLE IRA applies to companies with less than 100 employees. It is beneficial because it doesn't have many of the start-up and operating costs you might see with other more conventional plans. It also doesn't require you to have other retirement plans, is easy to put in motion in terms of paperwork, and has no filing requirement.SIMPLE IRAs give employees a choice about whether to contribute to the account. But they require you as the employer to contribute either a matching contribution of up to 3 percent of whatever the pay is or a 2 percent nonelective contribution for every eligible employee. You can take money out of the SIMPLE IRA any time, and the withdrawal is tax-deferred, so you're taxed in the year you take it. If you take the withdrawal before age 59 ½, there's a 10 percent fee. If you take it within the first two years, that fee bumps up to 25 percent. 



Related: How to Have a Retirement Worth Saving ForFor 2022, to do a SIMPLE IRA, you need to have made at least $5,000 in any prior two years and be expected to earn $5,000 in the current year. You can put up to $14,000 a year into a SIMPLE IRA. If you're over age 50, you can put in another ""catch up"" contribution of up to $3,000, so your total deposit can be up to $17,000.


You can also opt for a ROTH IRA in place of or in addition to a SIMPLE IRA. ROTH IRAs are subject to most of the rules for traditional IRAs. The big difference between traditional, ROTH, and SIMPLE IRAs is that, with a ROTH IRA, contributions are taxed when you first invest the money. When you want to withdraw funds, there's no new tax event. You've already paid your taxes and don't have to do so again. Although, you must leave the money in your account for at least five years and withdraw after age 59 ½  to avoid a tax penalty. For 2022, you can contribute to a ROTH IRA only if you make less than $144,000 as an individual or $214,000 as a married couple. The contribution limit is $6,000 a year for those under age 50 and $7,000 for those over 50.Related: 6 Reasons to Pursue Entrepreneurship in RetirementFinally, it can make sense to use a 401(k). You can do a 401(k) even with just one employee, but they have to be at least 21 and have worked at least 1,000 hours in the previous year. You don't have to contribute to employee accounts if you don't have one for yourself. But if you contribute for yourself, you are required to make proportional contributions for each eligible employee. 401(k) plans can be more flexible and have higher contribution limits, and there's an option to do a ROTH 401(k). But 401(k) plans are more complex and cost more to set up and maintain. It's usually better to look into these once your business has grown a bit.


In 2022, employees can put up to $20,500 a year in a 401(k) if they're less than 50 years old. If they are 50 years old or older, they can contribute up to $27,000 a year. Together, you and your employee can contribute up to $61,000 ($67,000 for those 50+ years old) or 100 percent of compensation, whichever is less.No need to play gamesAs an employer, you may be able to do more than one IRA at a time. You also can pivot from one IRA to another, such as starting with a ROTH IRA and then shifting to a traditional IRA, based on how your business is doing. But the general rule of thumb is to put your IRA into your budget right from the start. Any brokerage house can set it up for you. It's not necessary to play the stock market here. Just buy a mutual fund that invests in many different companies and keep putting about $1,000 a month into the same IRA every month. Then be sure you reinvest any dividends automatically into the IRA.Related: 7 Best Strategies for Saving for Retirement in 2022Choose the IRA right for you and your business nowMost people are not in any position to disregard how they'll fare financially in retirement. If you wait too long, you pay the price. Setting up an IRA can protect you and your team and indirectly contribute to your business's worker loyalty and stability. If you haven't set up your accounts yet, do so now. It's a smart money strategy that doesn't have to cost you a dime.

75,Why You Should Use a Wealth Management Service,"Jan 2, 2022",Aidan Sowa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/why-you-should-use-a-wealth-management-service/400813,"
Since you're reading this, my guess is that you're at least a bit concerned about your financial future. That's good. If you're a reasonable adult, you've likely grasped that planning for that is a must, particularly in this era of uncertainty. After all, money worries and the stress they produce is one of the biggest enemies of peaceful living.And yes, many are aware of this in spirit, but fail to grasp it fully, partly because financial planning can seem overwhelming, and it's easy to want to postpone grabbing the bull by the horns. I'm here to encourage you, though, to finally let the wealth management experts handle your finances, as the benefits are simply too good to pass up.What is wealth management?Put simply, this term encompasses the creation of a wealth-building plan to support livelihood as well as other life goals and desires. Wealth management professionals will examine accounts and expenses and provide various options to improve your situation. In terms of tax efficiency at the very least, in my experience you cannot do better than to let them do the job. With respect to investment strategy, you can use these pros' help to make decisions in tandem, or give them complete trust and wait for their plan.



How do wealth management services work?These groups or individuals — in addressing a variety of clients' financial needs — offer a range of services, from investment advice to retirement planning, estate planning to tax strategy. In addition, they work as consultants — can tailor a strategy according to each person's financial needs and goals.Such management is a comprehensive project, not just investment advice, and people with high net worth often implement it, since they usually significantly benefit from an integrated approach. Keep in mind, too, that anyone can reap its benefits: the, ""You have to be rich for it to be worth it"" is a myth. Managers are paid via fees that are usually based on clients' assets under management (AUM).


Related: Creating Wealth Is Different From Maintaining WealthBenefits of wealth management• Expert advice: Once you have a financial service watching your back, you have the chance to use all its seasoned help (typically representing many fields) to create a strategy. Typically, these firms are staffed by professionals with knowledge of tax issues and implications, investments, real estate, superannuation and other areas. All will coach you and make sure you don't fall into any potential money traps.• Optimized cash flow and earnings: This is paramount, especially if you're living on the edge or (God forbid) in debt, as it's hard to keep your head above water when you have no clue how much money you're paying for debts. A wealth management service can help optimize cash flow and balance earning versus spending. Moreover, they will provide a solid plan for savings and loan repayments. Once you're out of debt, wealth managers will offer investment options suited to new needs and goals.Related: Snowball: How to use this technique to get out of debt fast


• An end to tax stress: Taxes are complex and prone to changes, but, depending on your knowledge, you can use them to your advantage and save serious cash in the effort. The golden goal is referred to as tax-free spending, but you need to know your stuff to get there. Of course, most humans don't, so getting advice from professionals whose job is to stay on top of codes and policy is a wise move. I've found that there is a way for you to save on virtually every tax — funds that can then be put into retirement or other accounts.• Retirement planning: It's never too early to think about retirement. However, once you start looking into options, you'll likely be meet with various complex schemes, and many savers get justifiably confused. Letting a wealth manager guide you through the process is a reliable way to lay a foundation for golden years.Related: The Good and Bad of the New Tax Proposals for Your Finances• Reaching life goals: Our time on Earth needs to be more than working, eating, sleeping and occasionally vacationing.

A professional will put these visions into wealth-building calculations via a series of viable, financially responsible and beneficial moves.

No matter how you save your money — whether you go for a retirement fund, mutual fund or another method to build up your nest egg — you know the IRS will eventually want its cut. You may have a hazy idea that you need to protect your money, but without understanding exactly how to do it, it's also possible to let tax issues slide. If you don't have an accountant to help you with tax advice, it's possible that you could end up making some tax mistakes. Here's an example of a possible scenario: Let's say that as you move toward retirement, you still don't have your house paid off, little in personal savings but you've spent years plumping up your 401(k) at work. Let's say you have $2.5 million accumulated in your 401(k). An advisor informs you that you'll be taxed at the highest rate and after you take a tax hit, your $2.5 million will become $1.7 million instead.



Let's take a look at how certain factors, such as retirement savings and your home, could get you into some serious tax trouble later down the road. We'll also discuss what you can do about it.1. Traditional IRAs and Qualified Retirement PlansWhen you have money stashed away in an IRA, 401(k) or another qualified retirement plan, you have to pay income tax on the money you've put in, which can drastically reduce the amount you put into your nest egg. 


You may be tempted to leave the money alone for the majority of your retirement years, but unfortunately, according to the required minimum distributions (RMDs) rule, you must withdraw money from your account starting at age 72. Once you reach that age, you don't have a choice: You have to withdraw money from your account or you must pay tax on it. What You Can DoIf you have time on your side, consider both Roth IRA and Roth 401(k) plan options. You can save after-tax money in a Roth IRA and Roth 401(k) — distributions come out of your retirement savings account tax-free after age 59 ½. Do all employers offer a Roth 401(k)? No. However, anyone can use a Roth IRA for their purposes. All you need to do is access your already-existing brokerage account or open a new brokerage account if you don't already have one. 2. Your HouseWhen you decide to sell your home, your primary residence may also give you some tax challenges. The capital gains exclusion gives you massive tax breaks when you sell your home. You'll get a break on the first $250,000 as a single tax filer and $500,000 as a joint filer. In other words, if you saw gains from from $200,000 to $450,000 as a single homeowner, you wouldn't pay any capital gains taxes on the sale of your home. (Unlike paying taxes on capital gains distributions, this option offers a major boon for homeowners.)


Here's the deal, though: The exclusion only applies if you use the home as your principal residence during at least two of the five years preceding the sale. You can also follow specific rules that reduce that requirement to just one year if you find that you need to go into long-term care in a nursing home or other type of facility. However, if you don't meet the requirements, the exclusion can go away completely. In addition, if you switch the home over to a rental property, you may have to pay taxes during the period of time when the home becomes nonqualified. What You Can DoIf you want to keep the capital gains exclusion, so keep your home as your primary residence. In addition, you could sell it before it becomes a major tax burden. 3. Managing Your MoneyWhat are some other ways you can protect your money? Let's take a look at a few, jumping off with what you can do right away: Consider purchasing a qualified longevity annuity contract (QLAC). In other words, you can purchase this insurance product that pays you at any age you choose (usually 80 or 85). You can also defer expenses until you receive QLAC payments. The income you receive can start later than age 70 ½, which reduces your RMDs and associated taxes.Consider purchasing fixed and variable deferred annuities. Withdrawing money from deferred annuities means you could move the accumulated value of these deferred annuities into an income annuity that pays regular, guaranteed income. The IRS will exclude a portion of the payment from tax. Stay employed. Some 401(k) plans allow you to delay withdrawals from your account if you stay employed into your 70s or later and don't own 5% or more of the company sponsoring the retirement plan.Look for the Saver's Credit before you retire. You can claim the credit for 50%, 20% or 10% of the first $2,000 you contribute to a retirement account during any given tax year. You can claim a maximum $1,000, $400 or $200. In 2021, the maximum adjusted gross income for Savers Credit eligibility is $66,000 for a married couple filing jointly, $49,500 for a head of household and $33,000 for all other taxpayers.This list doesn't include all the ways in which you can manage your tax-friendly money, but it can give you a jumping-off point to understand how you can finagle more money into your pocket. 


Understand Taxes Before You RetireMany retirement calculators don't calculate the taxes you'll have to pay during your golden years, which means that many individuals have no real concept of how taxes actually work or how much your money is actually worth upon retirement. When you underestimate the impact taxes may have on your retirement distribution strategy, your entire retirement plan may contain a lot of added risk. When you build your actual distribution plan early on in life (and even in middle age or close to retirement), you want to apply tax strategies directly to your situation so you can keep more of your hard-earned money right where it belongs — in your pocket.

78,"Non-Wealthy IRA Savers Who Invested IRAs Into Small Business, Startups and Real Estate LLCs Targeted in 'Build Back Better' Plan","Oct 11, 2021",Mat Sorensen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/non-wealthy-ira-savers-who-invested-iras-into-small/390076,"
The proposed $3.5 trillion budget-reconciliation package still working its way through Congress contains two provisions that will restrict IRA investments into startups, small business, and real estate LLCs. These provisions came as a surprise to the over one million IRA investors who already invest a portion of their IRA into these non-publicly traded assets. The problematic sections, 138312 and 138314, change more than 40 years of IRA laws and practice, which have allowed IRAs to invest into publicly traded companies as well as privately held small businesses, LLCs, real estate and startups.The two problematic sections are not to be confused with IRA provisions in the bill that are targeting large accounts and high-income earners. These targeted provisions include a $10 million cap on total retirement account balances as well as sections that close out the so-called ""back door Roth IRA"" for high-income earners. Those sections seem intentionally targeted and will land on what Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has called the ""wealthy few"".Related: How a Company's Relationship With Its Accounting Firm Changes as It Grows



The bill targets investment choice instead of account size or income levelSections 138312 and 138314 do not target the ""wealthy few,"" and instead will affect hundreds of thousands of working Americans and retirees who choose to invest a portion of their IRA accounts off Wall Street.  Scott Mackes of Mt. Pleasant, SC, is a military veteran who is now self-employed. Scott has invested his IRA into startups and real estate projects that are led by other military veterans. But under the proposed provisions, IRA accounts like Scott's will no longer be able to invest in these opportunities. What's worse, Scott will also be forced to distribute the existing investments he made from his IRA within two years and will be subject to taxes and early withdrawal penalties. Scott says these IRA provisions are ""devastating"" to him and his IRA and to those raising capital from IRAs for small businesses, startups and real estate projects.Section 138312 of the bill states that an IRA cannot invest into any asset where the income or net worth of the IRA owner are a qualification to invest. Under federal and state securities laws, most non-publicly traded assets require the small business, private fund or startup raising capital to consider the income or net worth of the investor before allowing them to invest. If these provisions are passed, the small business or startup that complies with the securities laws in raising capital, which are designed to protect investors, won't be able to accept IRAs as investors. That seems like an odd policy proposition, as an IRA is closed out from investing in a private asset when that company has complied with securities-law requirements. Shouldn't the policy by the other way around, i.e. if a company raising capital doesn't comply with securities laws, then IRAs cannot invest?IRA savers feel like they're being penalized for being responsibleRetired NYPD detective Jannette La Sota grew her retirement savings over a 25-year law enforcement career. She previously used financial advisors, but became tired of poor performance and high advisory fees. She now manages her own accounts investments and chooses to invest a portion of those funds in real estate and crowdfunding offerings. In a letter to her Congressman and Senators, she said that the IRA provisions in the bill will ""penalize me, and people like me, by taking away the very tools needed to secure our retirement. My life has improved greatly with these investments in my portfolio, and now [Congress] wants to punish me for putting in the time and education to go from inexperienced to sophisticated investor. The money I saved in this plan, and the ability to decide how to invest and use it, is crucial to my ability to care for myself as I age.""Jannette's frustration is one that is common amongst IRA investors that will be affected by this bill, as they have typically spent decades building their account and have been intimately involved in selecting and managing their IRAs investments into non-publicly traded assets.Investments into small biz and real estate benefit local investors and communities Many IRA investors choose real estate, small business and startup investments as they want their investments to not only do well but to also benefit their community. Jennifer Grace is a loan-signing agent and notary in Sacramento, CA. Jennifer is concerned about the IRA provisions in the bill. ""When I have used my retirement funds to invest in stock or companies that I don't have a connection with, I have lost money,"" she explains. ""When I began investing in single-family homes and local companies that improve neighborhoods, I am supporting my community.""


John Kilpatrick of Issaquah, WA, is a retired finance professor and university administrator who still works as a self-employed financial economist and as a visiting professor at Washington State University. John says he invests his IRA into ""workforce housing, to provide clean, safe affordable housing for hardworking Americans."" These are ""fixer-upper"" properties, and John says that he likes investing his IRA this way as he feels that he and his IRA are ""doing well by doing good.""Section 138314 will restrict the popular IRA-owned LLC structure The real estate industry and the hundreds of thousands of IRA investors who invest their IRA in real estate have been watching this bill closely. Section 138314 will significantly restrict IRA investors like John and Jennifer. Many IRA owners have their IRA form and own an LLC outright. The IRA owner is the manager of the LLC, without compensation or personal benefit, and the LLC is funded by the IRA's cash. The LLC then ends up purchasing and holding the real estate investment. The LLC returns all of its income or profits to the IRA. There are many reasons why an LLC is used for IRA real estate investors. First, the LLC provides liability protection to the IRA and to the IRA company. Second, some IRA custodians who allow IRA accounts to own real estate, trust companies or community banks require the IRA to establish an LLC before purchasing real estate, as the LLC protects the IRA custodian.Section 138314 causes problems for IRA owners, as it states that an IRA owner cannot serve as ""officer"" of a company where their IRA invests into. The manager of an LLC is an officer, so anyone who has used an IRA-owned LLC will be affected. This restriction is something wealthy IRA owners can easily side-step, as they have teams of investment professionals and asset managers who already serve as managers of their LLCs, but everyday IRA investors buying single-family rentals with their IRA-owned LLC will be forced to wind down these LLCs. Many won't find it practical to own real estate in their IRA, as the maintenance burden and fees from their IRA custodian can significantly cut into the profits and returns that they are hoping to earn.The IRA provisions will dry up capital needed for small susiness and startupsThe IRA restrictions in the bill will also impact the small businesses and investment projects where these IRA dollars flow. Jamison Manwaring is co-founder and CEO of Neighborhood Ventures, a local real estate company that exclusively invests in Arizona and who has IRAs as investors. Neighborhood Ventures recently bought a hotel and is converting it to an apartment building to address the housing shortage in the Phoenix metro area. Projects like these require capital, and Neighborhood Ventures raises that capital from individuals and IRAs. ""The proposed restriction on IRAs will dry up funds that are needed for local ventures and small businesses and will just force those funds back to Wall Street where they make little difference,"" Jamison says. ""Our investors like to know that they are investing in their community. The proposed restriction  hurts them and restricts their ability to grow their account, but it also hurts companies like ours who invest in local projects and who work hard to solve housing and affordability issues in our communities.""The effect of these new rules is that more dollars will flow back to Wall Street. That is something most IRA savers who invested into these affected assets were trying to avoid.Section 138312 eliminates investment opportunity in the highest returning assets Fred Wilson, a well-known venture capitalist, and blogger wrote about the bill on his site AVC.com. He wrote that the bill would eliminate the ability of IRA holders to invest their IRAs into the highest-returning assets available: VC funds, private equity, and private companies. As Wilson detailed, ""I am sure they are proposing this to prevent wealthy people like me from using the tax shield of the IRA to invest in private businesses, but there are better ways to do that than a blanket prohibition. A blanket prohibition will hurt Main Street, not Wall Street. We already limit what folks who aren't wealthy can invest in by nature of a multitude of regulations. It upsets me to no end that this paternalistic approach keeps the wealthy making lots of money and everyone else on the sidelines.""Why is Congress trying to restrict what assets an IRA can own?The provisions appear to be written to prevent billion-dollar IRA accounts and to disallow investments in founders' shares. Kazusa Flanagan of Honolulu, HI, was concerned about how Sections 138312 and 138314 would affect her ability to invest her IRA and wrote her U.S. Senators. She got a response from Senator Schatz (D-HI), who wrote back that he is a strong supporter of progressive tax policy and said that these specific IRA provisions are ""intended to prevent taxpayers from abusing Roth IRAs to shield assets from taxation; for example, by contributing undervalued founders' shares to a Roth IRA in order to skirt contribution limits. I recognize that modifications to IRA contribution rules affect many taxpayers, and I will keep your concerns in mind as the Senate considers potential changes to IRA treatment in its own reconciliation legislation.""


It's quite clear that Congress is concerned with reports of Peter Theil's billion-dollar IRA that was built by investing in founders' shares. Unfortunately, the IRA provisions, and specifically 138312 and 138314, are written so broadly that they scoop up hundreds of thousands of IRA accounts of non-wealthy IRA savers who simply choose to invest in small business, startups and real estate LLCs. These IRA savers aren't buying undervalued founder's shares, but are being dragged into the restrictions nonetheless.Related: Have You Made These Year-End Tax Moves? Here's How to Keep More of Your MoneyIf the wealthy are the problem, then Congress should specifically target large accountsSo, what's the solution? How can there be progressive tax policy for IRAs that hits the ""wealthy few"" but doesn't scoop up hundreds of thousands of working Americans hoping to have an IRA account with a balance they can actually retire on? In his aforementioned blog post, VC Fred Wilson offered a possible solution, writing, ""What we should do instead is limit the tax advantages of an IRA to a set amount of money, something like single-digit millions. That will limit their attractiveness as a tax shield for millionaires but maintain them as a wealth generator for everyone else.""Section 138301 of the bill does what Wilson suggested, limiting total IRA and other retirement account balances at $10 million. This restriction alone, if passed, would directly target the ""wealthy few"" and limit the tax benefits in their accounts. It's not progressive tax policy to limit investor choice that will affect everyone, especially when that is mostly going to burden and restrict the non-wealthy who are just trying to catch up to the wealthy. If the $10 million cap is enacted, then Sections 138312 and 138314, which restrict investor choice for everyone, won't be needed.The bill is awaiting a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives and is part of the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package that is being negotiated in Congress. It's uncertain which provisions of the bill are being negotiated but it's clear that IRA savers who have invested their accounts into small business, startups and real estate LLCs are contacting their Congressional offices to help educate their representatives on how the bill will impact them.Senate Majority Leader Schumer said on October 4 that the House and Senate plan to vote on the final negotiated bill by the end of this month. The hundreds of thousands of IRA savers who invest in these non-publicaly traded assets will be anxiously awaiting the final text to see if their retirement savings will be harmed.

79,How a Company's Relationship With Its Accounting Firm Changes as It Grows,"Oct 8, 2021",Frank Milone,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-a-companys-relationship-with-its-accounting-firm/383573,"
Every company in every industry has accounting needs, and those needs change dramatically as a company grows and expands. When a company has a true partnership with an accounting firm, it's able to think multiple steps ahead and make sure there's a plan in place.While each company is unique, some general qualities tend to define a successful relationship with an accounting firm at each stage.Companies engaging an accounting firm for the first timeIf your company is reaching out to an accounting firm, it's likely because you are reacting to a need such as tax compliance requirements or an arrangement that now requires a financial statement audit, review or compilation.



The first step is to explore if your need extends further than what prompted the initial call. For instance, it's important to consider how tax compliance decisions being made for the business will impact the individual owners.  Make sure that the firm you engage can move beyond that immediate need and help you get in front of the next challenge or question that is going to arise. Ideally, that firm will not just react to questions or problems, but help you structure your growth and guide decision making in a way that is best both for current operations and the future. 


Tax and compliance in growth mode As your company adds new product lines, enters into different types of agreements, starts selling into different states or holds inventory in multiple locations, the need to be proactive from a tax and compliance standpoint is amplified.While you might be able to get away with a reactive approach to accounting early in a business, as you scale, the stakes just become too high. It can be a huge jolt if you find out you owe taxes in states you weren't planning on paying, for example.Growing companies also tend to enter into more complex agreements, whether that's an equity, debt or revenue arrangement. These deals can have an unexpected impact on your financials, and you need to structure deals carefully to minimize tax exposure.At this stage, your accounting firm can't just be solving problems. It needs to be part of your decision and review process. In addition, certain regulatory requirements kick in as your company reaches growth milestones. When you reach more than 100 employees eligible to participate in your benefits plan, for example, you're required to have an annual employee benefit plan audit. This is a somewhat specialized function not all accounting firms offer, so you may need to engage more than one firm.

At that level, the relationship with your accounting firm moves toward a higher level of technical problem-solving.Your accounting firm should have a range of technical expertise to support your internal team. A tax partner from your accounting firm would work with your internal director of tax, while an audit partner would be more engaged with the CFO. Companies in the upper-middle market tend to rely on their accounting firms to support complex areas such as international expansion, mergers and acquisitions, stock compensation or even going public. The strategic relationship with the accounting firm is there to support the internal team and confirm the impact of these transactions.

Whether you're answering questions about taking government assistance or temporarily shutting the business down, it's best to have an established relationship to rely on. And the thing about those types of questions is that you rarely see them coming.Related: Why Accounting Skills Are Indispensable for Entrepreneurs

80,Have You Made These Year-End Tax Moves? Here's How to Keep More of Your Money,"Oct 8, 2021",Melissa Brock,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/have-you-made-these-year-end-tax-moves-heres-how-to-keep/390079,"
Uh, where did 2021 go? Once you get over the shock that it's already the second week of October, you may want to consider some tactical year-end tax moves. More than two-thirds of Americans experienced financial setbacks in 2020, according to Fidelity. The declines were attributed to job loss, decreased household income or emergency savings drawdown. Overall, 68% had setbacks which looked like this:



23% lost a job or household income20% had an unexpected non-health emergency18% had to provide unexpected financial aid to family or friends16% had a health emergency in their familyWhether 2021 mirrored these issues for you or not, let's go over the year-end tax moves to save you money.Tip 1: Defer income until next year.Consider deferring your income if possible. For example, you may want to wait on a bonus for next year if your company allows that practice.


As a self-employed individual or someone who does freelance or consulting work, you may be able to delay sending out invoices until late December. That way, companies won't pay you until next year.As a retiree, you may be able to postpone retirement account withdrawals so you don't take a tax hit. However, you must remember to meet your required minimum distributions (RMDs).Note: Consider what your tax bracket will look like next year. You may not want to defer your income if you could push yourself into a higher tax bracket by deferring your income.Tip 2: Max out your retirement accounts.Pumping money into tax-deferred retirement accounts might give you the best of both worlds because you can reduce your taxable income by saving in them and you also take advantage of compounding over time when you bump up your retirement savings. Not only that, but your employer could offer a major perk by slinging money toward your account in the form of the company match.


Try to contribute the full amount — $19,500 for 2021; $26,000 if you are age 50 or older.You can also consider contributing money to an IRA (such as a Roth IRA). You can contribute $6,000 in 2021, plus an extra $1,000 for those 50 or older and let your money grow tax-deferred. As of Jan. 1, 2021, you can make contributions toward your 2021 tax year limit until the 2022 tax day. Doing so reduces your taxable income for the year.Tip 3: Take advantage of tax-loss harvesting.This year-end strategy involves selling investments such as stocks and mutual funds to realize losses. You can then use those losses to offset taxable gains you may have had during the year. Selling them before year-end will provide losses to offset your gains. A few quick things to note: You can use up to $3,000 of excess loss to wipe out other income if you incurred more losses than gains.More than $3,000 in excess loss can carry over to next year.Mutual funds typically publish an estimate of their capital gains distributions in November or December, along with the date of the distribution. 


Tip 4: Identify more deductions.Lower your tax bill by tallying up those more deductions. You can deduct up to $600 (married filing jointly) and $300 (other filing statuses) per tax return of qualified cash contributions if you take the standard deduction.  Charities: You can contribute to any number of types of charities, such as animal, environmental, health, humanitarian relief, education, and arts and culture charities. Medical and dental expenses deduction: The medical and dental expenses deduction is an itemized deduction that you may take (within certain limits) for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses you paid during the year for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents. Consider itemizing rather than claiming the standard deduction. Many people take the standard deduction when they might be better off itemizing. If your qualifying expenses exceed the standard deduction, you may consider itemizing. In 2021 the standard deduction is $12,550 for singles filers and married filing separately and $25,100 for joint filers and $18,800 for heads of household.Tip 5: Check flex spending accounts and health savings accounts.Flexible spending plans allow you to put part of your pay into a special account to pay for child care or medical bills.You avoid both income and Social Security taxes on these, but you have to use them all by the end of the year. If you need to, plan to stock up on prescriptions, over-the-counter medications or get a new set of glasses to use up the funds in your account.


Health savings accounts (HSAs), on the other hand, also offer tax advantages and can help you pay for health care expenses — as long as you have a high-deductible health insurance plan. They are tax-deductible in the year you put money into them and they grow tax-free. As long as you use them for qualified healthcare expenses, you can't get taxed. Unlike a flex spending plan, however, there's no ""use it or lose it"" stipulation, so take advantage.Tip 6: Check your withholding.Were you stunned by your huge tax bill this year? If so, you may not have withheld enough from your paycheck. Take steps now so you don't have another not-so-welcome springtime surprise. The IRS's Tax Withholding Estimator can help you determine whether you need to fill out a new W-4 with your employer and increase how much in taxes you withhold from your paycheck. The IRS tool will handily tell you exactly how much you should withhold.Make Your Moves NowYou may need to make all of these moves — not just one or the other. If you're not sure whether you should defer income or check how much you've withheld thus far (it's so confusing, isn't it?) you may want to check with a tax advisor about your specific situation. This individual can help you make all the right moves at year-end and help you protect your income.

81,The Pandora Papers Reveals Where the Richest People in the World Are Hiding Their Money,"Oct 6, 2021",Kenny Herzog,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/the-pandora-papers-reveals-where-the-richest-people-in-the/389657,"
On Sunday, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) dropped a bombshell that made ProPublica's June reporting on billionaires' tax evasion seem quaint. Dubbed Pandora Papers, the ICIJ's dossier exposes the vast patchwork of offshore business dealings among world leaders, celebrities and other public figures. It's a successor of sorts to the Consortium's 2016 Panama Papers, which unlocked the machinations behind decades of offshore transactions that enabled industrial-scale corruption. Pandora Papers goes even further, pulling the curtain back on leaked records that detail how everyone from the King of Jordan to supermodel Claudia Schiffer have availed themselves of international tax havens. And in some instances, as with Jordan's King Abdullah II, while under scrutiny for allegedly abusing their power and contributing to worldwide inequity. Related: Decoding The Panama Papers: A Revelation That Shook India



The notion of wealthy individuals and business entities creating so-called ""shell"" corporations in countries far afield from their principal headquarters as a means of stowing less heavily taxed (or untaxed) assets is not new. It is, however, often opaque and abstract to the general public. And the Pandora Papers' aim, in its own words, is to provide ""unequaled perspective on how money and power operate in the 21st century — and how the rule of law has been bent and broken around the world by a system of financial secrecy enabled by the U.S. and other wealthy nations.""So, for example, New York-based ICIJ reporter Spencer Woodman dove deep into the newly leaked records and untangled how scandalized Roman Catholic order Legion of Christ continued investing millions around in global real estate transactions via discreet offshore trusts — all while the subject of numerous lawsuits alleging pedophilia and abuse perpetrated by its clergy. 


Elsewhere as part of the Pandora Papers investigation, Virginia-based ICIJ fellow Sean McGoey broke down how supermodel Claudia Schiffer has set up six lightly or untaxed companies in the British Virgin Islands, in addition to a trust earmarked for her family. Schiffer commented to the ICIJ that she was ""compliant with tax law in the United Kingdom."" Representatives for ex-Beatle Ringo Starr, whom the Papers uncovered has numerous companies and trusts concretized in the Bahamas and Panama, declined to comment to the ICIJ.Related: Tax Shelters to Steer Clear OfOther names flagged by the report — which, like ProPublica's aforementioned investigation, underscores the means through which ultra-rich and powerful global citizens can potentially dodge taxation in their home countries more than commit outright financial illegalities — include Sri Lankan power broker Thirukumar Nadesan and his wife, former Parliament member Nirupama Rajapaksa; pop megastar Shakira (whose attorney told the ICIJ that her offshore companies are declared and do not provide tax advantages); and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati. 


Speaking with the New York Times, Lakshmi Kumar, policy director at international watchdog Global Financial Integrity, said of the Pandora Papers' revelations, ""When you are that rich, and you are looking for a creative way to hide money, you cannot do it alone. You need a network of professionals to help you.""

President Biden's long-proposed plans to increase the top income rate, capital gains and corporate tax means that a well-thought-out strategy is more important than ever as we head into the end of the year. While not all of these proposals will be enacted, the best way to reduce their impact to potentially increase your financial burden is to update your tax plan. Increase in individual income taxesConsidering how long Biden has vowed to increase the top individual income tax rate? It's safe to assume that this will be passed at some point, likely through budget reconciliation. If passed as proposed, this would boost the current rate from 37% to 39.6%.Related: 5 Tax Tips Every Cryptocurrency Investor Needs to Know Now



Corporate taxes will increaseBiden has his sights set on increasing the domestic corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and while we can all agree that corporations need to pay their fair share, a significant increase in corporate taxes could push U.S.-based companies into other countries. It's important that America keeps its rate competitive to ensure businesses, and the jobs they provide, stay put. Nevertheless, some increase in corporate taxes, say to 25%, is likely.Capital gains tax is also a targetThis tax on the profit realized via the sale of a non-inventory asset is also likely to increase under Biden. In his proposals, the President hopes to nearly double the rate, increasing it from 20% to 39.6%. While we may not see the rate reach nearly 40%, it is more likely that there will be an increase of some amount, especially given that we already have a 28% capital gains rate for gold and collectibles.

The President has proposed that this deduction be phased out for those making over $400,000, in turn increasing the rate for those taxpayers. The good news surrounding the QBID is that this proposal has been a lower priority for Biden, so there's a chance it may not be impacted by future legislation. The one proposal that might have legs is to allow all businesses with income under $500,000 to receive the QBID while eliminating it for all businesses in excess of this amount of net income.Hurry up!If you wait until the last minute, you run the risk of not being able to find qualified professionals who have the capacity to take on your tax strategy.Without proper planning, the changes Biden is proposing could cost you a mint.

83,The Good and Bad of the New Tax Proposals for Your Finances,"Sep 27, 2021",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-good-and-bad-of-the-new-tax-proposals-for-your-finances/387055,"
The House Ways and Means Committee has released new tax proposals, many of which increase taxes for those making more than $400,000. The proposals include a variety of provisions that impact estate planning, real estate investing and small businesses. While there are increases, it's not all bad news. There are a variety of previous provisions that have been left out that could have had a major impact on your tax bill. Let's break down the good and bad news surrounding these proposals as it pertains to each category.Real estateThe first piece of good news is that there's no mention of eliminating the 1031 exchange, a tool used by many real estate investors. Also left out is the elimination of bonus depreciation. Under current law, owners of qualified properties are eligible for 100% bonus depreciation in the first year, so as it stands, this will remain untouched. The bad news is that real estate carried interests would only be allowed long-term capital gain treatment if the project is held for more than three years. This means that instead of a 20% rate, real estate carried interests could be taxed at a 39.6% rate like ordinary income. Additionally, it's proposed that IRAs will not be allowed to invest in syndicated investments such as multi-family projects.Related: Tax Saving Tips for the Rest of the YearEstate planningThe good news regarding estate planning is huge. While there had been a lot of discussion surrounding a potential capital gains tax at death, it was left out of the current proposals, maintaining the current step-up in basis. Additionally, there are no plans to tax lifetime transfers. Now for the not quite bad, but not great news. Up until now, with a defective trust, you've been able to transfer an asset, like ownership in your business, real estate or even stocks, out of your estate and still pay income tax on the asset. Under this proposal, this would be eliminated, and it would be out of your estate for income tax purposes. There's also a proposal to change valuations when it comes to marketable securities. If passed, you will not get a discount when you transfer them. The final change is a 50% reduction of the estate and gift tax exemption from $11.7 million to $6 million.Related: Tax Rules for Buying and Selling Bitcoin and Other Crypto



Small family-owned businessesUnfortunately, there is no good news for families that own a small business. In the new proposal, investment in a partnership that goes bad, which under current law would be an ordinary loss, will now be a capital loss. This change would be impactful as capital losses can only offset capital gains while an ordinary loss can offset any type of income. The proposal also reduces the Section 1202 gain exclusion from 100% to 50% if your income is more than $400,000. The Qualified Business Income Deduction, which is normally thought of as the 20% deduction for pass-through entities, would have a $500,000 limit or may even possibly phase out completely after $500,000 while it currently has no limits aside from the industries that qualify. Finally, the net investment income tax would apply to passthrough business income over $500,000.While we now have a better look at what may be the future of tax legislation, it's important to know that this is ever-changing. It's important that you begin your tax planning now while working closely with your tax advisor to monitor any additional changes that could greatly impact your taxes and your wealth.

85,Biden's Proposal to Limit Like-Kind Exchanges Impacts Small Business,"Aug 24, 2021",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/bidens-proposal-to-limit-like-kind-exchanges-impacts-small/377557,"
If you've ever owned real estate, you've likely heard of the 1031 exchange, also known as a like-kind exchange. Essentially, this allows business owners or investors to sell a property, acquire a new one and not pay tax on the property they sold as long as it is equal to or greater in cost to the property that was sold.While this opportunity has been available since 1921, past presidents have modified its use over the years. For example, in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, President Trump changed it to only apply to real estate. Prior to that, the exchange had been available on other kinds of property, such as machinery and equipment. Now, President Biden is looking to limit like-kind exchanges even further.Proposed limitsAs it stands, when completing a like-kind exchange, most taxes are deferred until the time you sell, which is typically many years later, and there is no limit to the number of times you exchange. The flexibility of this section of the tax code makes it very popular with business owners and investors as it's a legal way to reduce taxes on the sale and allows for greater capital to reinvest. Under Biden's new proposal, the 1031 exchange would be limited to the smallest real estate transactions. The proposal allows you to defer up to $500,000 in gains for single taxpayers or $1 million for married couples. This change on its own is a big deal but coupled with Biden's plan to increase capital gains tax, it would make it nearly impossible for small businesses to get ahead.



Related: How Do Wealthy People Get Away With Not Paying Their 'Fair Share' of Taxes?Small businesses are left with the billIf a small business owns its building, much of the owner's net worth is likely tied up in the property. For example, let's say that restaurant owner Bill owns his building. He bought the building years ago for $100,000, and it is now worth $750,000. Bill would like to relocate his business to a new neighborhood where he could do more business using a like-kind exchange. Currently, Bill wouldn't pay any taxes on the $650,000 gain, but under Biden's proposal, he would be taxed 39.6% on $150,000 of the gain, leaving him with a tax bill of $55,350.


Corporations can easily avoid capital gainsSo, how is big business impacted by this change? The short answer is they aren't. Instead of using like-kind exchanges, corporations use stocks as a tool to prey on smaller businesses. Every day, corporations acquire small companies and their property using stocks, which means they don't have to pay taxes. This is another example of how big business continues to take advantage of tax laws while Biden proposes changes that largely impact small businesses.Related: Tax Rules for Buying and Selling Bitcoin and Other CryptoMany people, including President Biden, believe that the 1031 exchange is a loophole, but it's not. It's a legal opportunity provided by Congress that can and should be used to further the economy. Limiting the like-kind exchange would not only have a big impact on small businesses, but also the liquidity of the real estate market. If you're a small business owner, you may be wondering, ""How can I protect my company from these potential tax changes?"" I'll discuss that and more in my next article on how to tax plan for Biden's proposed tax plans.

86,Every Brand and Business Person Should Do This to Ensure Their Credibility,"Aug 16, 2021",Kevin Roddy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/every-brand-and-business-person-should-do-this-to-ensure/377203,"
Imagine you've just walked into an expensive car dealership to buy a new sports car. It's the car you've always dreamed of — expensive, sleek and fast. But walking up to greet you is an unkempt, mumbling salesman, wearing a tattered suit with a tomato-soup stain on his tie.Whoa.It's obviously still going to be the same great car if you buy it, but do you really want to spend your hard-earned money with this guy? Is he going to make you feel good about doing business together? Are you going to trust him and take his advice? Or, does he actually give you second thoughts about buying your dream car from him?



We've all heard the adage, ""You only get one chance to make a first impression."" In business, however, the first, second, third — and every impression after that — counts in a big way. And while the way you dress, and whether you can sip tomato soup without spilling it on your tie, can be important ways to measure every impression, I want to talk about the kind of impression you make when you're sloppy in written communications — things like emails, texts, reports, presentations, social media, and even marketing materials. Carelessness like this is, in its own way, a tomato-soup stain on your brand and does real damage to the credibility of you and your business.Related: Treat Your Brand Like a Relationship: 8 Ways to Reignite the Romance


Quality countsIf you don't care about the quality of your work why should anyone believe you do quality work?There are lots of excuses for this kind of sloppiness and I've heard many of them. ""I'm so busy, I don't have time to double-check my work."" Or, ""I've got big fingers and am a bad typist."" Or, ""I hate doing that work so I just want to get it over with."" And even, ""Come on, you know what I meant to say. It doesn't really matter.""But the underlying excuse is plain and simple, ""I don't care.""This ""who cares"" approach to written communication is a lot more common than you think. And you need to know, people judge you by it.


Recently, as a favor to a friend, I had a phone call with an entrepreneur who was starting a business and wanted to know more about branding. About 15 minutes into the call, we got disconnected. He didn't call me back so I tried calling him, but it went directly to voicemail. I texted him with no reply, leaving me no choice but to give up and wait for him to reconnect with me.For about four hours, I heard nothing. Then, finally, I got a text from him. It was riddled with spelling errors, bad syntax, and I needed to read it three times just to decipher what he was actually trying to say.And if that wasn't bad enough, his excuse for being disconnected was that his phone died because he'd forgotten to charge the battery. Imagine that, he had an important call with someone who was doing him a favor, someone who could help him with something he needed help with, but he didn't bother to charge his phone. That, too, is sloppy business practice, but for another article.We went on to exchange several emails, each of his was poorly written and peppered with punctuation errors and simple misspellings. My entire opinion of him and, frankly, his business, was that of a tomato-soup-stained tie. I felt he was being disrespectful to me — not caring about my time and the effort I needed to make to get through his mess. All of it, to me, was a reflection on him and his ability to attend to details and care about quality. From that, I determined that I would never do business with someone who cared that little about his own business. Because if he can't care enough to simply re-read an email to ensure it makes sense, how could I ever trust him to care about anything else?


Don't make excusesThere is no reason, no excuse, for any mistake in written communication. It doesn't matter if it's a printed letter to an investor or an internal text to a subordinate, sloppiness is a bad habit. I'm not saying that you need to be a slave to the New Oxford Style Manual, or write like Ernest Hemingway. Instead, just ensure that your writing is clear and doesn't contain any unforced errors.The internet makes it easy to find correct answers with little effort. Spelling searches, grammar and syntax searches, simple questions about almost anything can be typed into a search bar and get you an answer in seconds. If you need more help than that, there are downloadable apps that act like an angel on your shoulder — an angel that knows how to write. Apps like Grammarly, Ginger, and others are easy to use and can pull you out of a simple mistake, or actually help improve your writing and make you look good.Whatever you do, however, don't simply rely on your computer's spell check to do your work for you. It can be helpful, but it's not always right and all it promises is correctly spelled nonsense. And sometimes not even that.Related: Why All Entrepreneurs Should Write


Don't let sloppiness define youAnother way to look at this kind of sloppiness is that, these days, poorly written communication has become a hallmark of scammers. I don't know about you, but when I receive a text from my bank, and the name of the bank is misspelled or there are other errors, I delete that text as quickly as possible. More and more, people are rightly becoming wary of errors like this and lumping them together with all kinds of nefarious schemes to avoid.Just the other day, I was on the website of a major padlock manufacturer. As I was reading I came across some misspellings that suddenly gave me pause — could a major company trying to sell me security actually be a scam? Did I get taken to a different site without knowing it? I mean, if they can't spell, and don't use proper grammar, maybe they aren't who they say they are and can't be trusted. So I left the site without buying anything.To be credible, you must never compromise excellence. Everything makes a statement about you and the brand you represent. You can give your reputation and your brand a ratty suit, or you can give it a beautiful, hand-sewn Italian suit that actually belongs behind the wheel of that incredible sports car.Your message is not only what you say, but how you say itThe truth is that the content of your message is not enough — it's also how you deliver it. So if you want to be heard, deliver your message the way you want it to be received.


Details matter. Do things to the highest quality, regardless of what those things may be. Take it beyond your writing and into the way you set up a room for a meeting, or the way you conduct a sales call. Everything. And yes, we're all human and we make mistakes, accidently letting something slip past us. It happens. But don't settle for that and let carelessness become a label you wear.You may be thinking this doesn't apply to you. You may be thinking, ""I'm not perfect but I'm not about to make myself a candidate for Sigmund Freud's couch, either."" Wrong. This isn't about being anal-retentive, it's about being professional. So invest a little bit of extra time to care about being perceived as a polished and credible businessperson or brand.Related: 3 Reasons You Need to Improve Your WritingIn the end, going to a little extra effort to ensure that everything you do is professional won't actually add credibility to you and your business because it's expected. It's table stakes. But not caring is a bullet that will absolutely wound your credibility. And consistent carelessness will have you bleed out. So wear Kevlar — and for goodness' sake, avoid tomato soup.

87,Tax Saving Tips for the Rest of the Year,"Aug 13, 2021",Michel Valbrun,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/tax-saving-tips-for-the-rest-of-the-year/378677,"
The year is already halfway over, but it's never too early to start thinking about ways to reduce your tax bill. Early planning can help make a significant difference in what you will owe come tax time. Here are some options to consider when preparing to reduce your taxes.Review your tax withholdingIf you work for an employer, you will have completed a W-4 form. This advises your company on how much in taxes to withhold from each paycheck. If your family or financial situation has changed or your tax bill was not what you expected, updating your tax withholding can help you to avoid surprises come tax time.Maximize your retirement account contributionsIf you are eligible to contribute to a retirement plan at work, consider increasing your contributions as much as possible. Contributions to your retirement account, such as a 401(k) or 403(b), directly reduce your taxable income — helping to reduce your tax burden.



Related: How Do Wealthy People Get Away With Not Paying Their 'Fair Share' of Taxes?Contribute to an IRAConsider contributing to an IRA to help supplement your retirement savings. There are two types of IRA retirement plans that you can contribute to: a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.


For taxpayers who earn below the IRS mandated threshold in 2021 ($140,000 for single taxpayers and $208,000 for married couples filing a joint return), you may contribute up to $6,000 to a Roth IRA every year (the limit is $7,000 for taxpayers over 50 years old). While these funds are after-tax dollars, the contributions are allowed to grow tax-free.Anyone with earned income may contribute to a traditional IRA. The amount of eligible tax deduction depends on your income and whether you are eligible for an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Similar to Roth IRAs, taxpayers may contribute up to $6,000 per year ($7,000 for taxpayers over age 50).Save for higher educationMany states offer a tax deduction for those who contribute to a college savings 529 plan. While several states offer a deduction for contributions to their own state-run 529 plan, there are a few states (Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana and Pennsylvania) that allow a deduction for contributions to any state's 529 plan. Review the regulations for your particular state to determine contribution limits and the amount of deduction for which you would be eligible.Related: You've Gotten Your College-Bound Student's First Tuition Bill. Have You Made the Right Tax Moves?


Flexible spending accountsIf you know that you will have expenses related to child care and certain medical care expenses, contributing to a flexible spending account through your employer can help you save ahead of time for these costs — while also saving on taxes.In 2021, you can contribute up to $2,750 for an individual plan or $5,000 for dependent care. Plan carefully when deciding how much to contribute to your plan each year as contributions do not carry forward from year to year and you could lose what you have saved.Planning for taxes can be complicated. Starting as early as possible can help you to find opportunities to reduce your tax liability. Working with a tax advisor can help you to implement a successful strategy.

88,You've Gotten Your College-Bound Student's First Tuition Bill. Have You Made the Right Tax Moves?,"Jul 22, 2021",Melissa Brock,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/youve-gotten-your-college-bound-students-first-tuition/378120,"
You've probably gotten a tuition bill from your child's college or university at this point if they will return to college in the fall. First-time college-bound families may look at this daunting bill as a major you may wonder what strategic moves you can make, tax-wise, when opening your checkbook or making 529 plan withdrawals. However, you can make some excellent moves prior to making that first tuition payment, which may affect your 529 plans and taxes. Take a look at how to take the bite out of high education costs if you'll have a college-bound student this fall.



It's Easy to Make Tax MisstepsWhen you have a child going off to college, you may think you're doing everything right, but you might end up making innocent missteps. Take a look at these tips.Tip 1: Use 529 plans for qualified educational expenses only. You probably already know that when you pay qualified educational expenses from a 529 account, you won't pay taxes or penalties on your withdrawals. However, you'll get hit with a penalty if you don't use your child's 529 plan for qualified educational expenses.


You can use the money to pay for qualified educational expenses at any college, university, vocational school or other postsecondary educational institution, as long as the institution can tap into the student aid program administered by the U.S. Department of Education.Let's talk through all qualified educational expenses (and check with the school to find out what's required in case you accidentally take a nonqualified distribution): Tuition and feesRoom and board, but the costs can't exceed the school's cost of attendance for financial aid and the costs must be the actual amount charged if your student will live in housing operated by the school. In other words, you can't utilize the 529 plan for more money than the school's estimates for room and board.Textbooks, as long as they are required reading for a courseComputers and related equipment and services, though equipment for sports, games or hobbies don't count. Keep your receipts and avoid expenses that don't qualify, like insurance, sports expenses, health club dues, and travel expenses. Here's what happens if you withdraw money for anything that doesn't meet the qualified expense criteria: It gets taxed as ordinary income and could also invite a 10% federal penalty. 


Tip 2: Know that 529 account funds may conflict with other tax incentives.The federal government offers additional tax incentives to help families combat the costs of college, but you can't use a 529 account at the same time you use these tax incentives. The IRS considers that practice double-dipping, so you'll want to factor in whether you'll claim the tax credit when you choose the amount to withdraw from your 529 account. A tax credit goes directly against your tax liability — not the same as a deduction. You can only claim one deduction per student each year.American Opportunity Tax Credit: Families of undergraduates can deduct the first $2,000 they spend on qualified education expenses and 25% off the next $2,000. Single taxpayers who have adjusted gross income between $80,000 and $90,000 and joint tax filers with adjusted gross income between $160,000 and $180,000 may get it. Taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeds the $90,000 and $180,000 thresholds cannot tap into the tax credit. The total credit cannot exceed $2,500 per tax year and the credit can be claimed for only 4 years.Lifetime Learning Credit: The Lifetime Learning Credit provides up to a $2,000 tax credit on the first $10,000 of college expenses. You won't face limits on the number of years you can claim this credit. Beginning in 2021, the income limits for the Lifetime Learning Credit may be claimed by people with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of up to $80,000 for single taxpayers and $160,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly.Is your income too high to get either the American Opportunity or Lifetime Learning credit? You may want to consider not claiming your child as a dependent and let your student claim the credit on his or her own tax return.Tip 3: Consider your state's 529 college savings plan.You might think this seems like advice that's too little, too late if you've already invested in another state's 529 plan for years. However, you can still opt to save in your own state's 529 plan. Many states offer state income tax deductions or credits on contributions to your state's 529 plan. 


However, did you know that the IRS allows one tax-free rollover of a 529 account per beneficiary in a 12-month period? If you violate the 12-month rule, you must treat the transaction as a nonqualified distribution and pay federal income tax and a 10% penalty on anything you've earned.Just note that when you roll over to another state's plan, some states require you to pay the state income tax on any contributions for which you've received a deduction.In this case, opt for a direct rollover and communicate with your current plan to move it from one plan into another.Tip 4: Check for tax-free savings bonds.Got some bonds lying around? You can benefit from any Series EE or Series I savings bonds issued after 1989: They're tax-free if you use it to pay for qualified college tuition and fees.


This tax break begins to phase out at $123,550 of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) for married joint filers and at $82,350 for single taxpayers.You cannot use this perk if you plan to claim other educational tax breaks, such as the American Opportunity or Lifetime Learning credits.Check Your Tax Options with a Professional's HelpConsider asking the right tax professionals to help you determine the right credits and deductions to give you the biggest tax breaks. They'll offer the right advice and tax credit options for your situation. Whether you have a simple or complex tax situation, you may want to tap into specific tax advice for students going off to college.Featured Article:  What is a Candlestick Chart?

89,Biden's Capital Gains Proposals Will Have Massive Impact on Businesses Earning More Than $1 Million,"Jul 10, 2021",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/bidens-capital-gains-proposals-will-have-massive-impact-on/376068,"
Small businesses play a vital role in America's economy given the fact that they make up 99.9% of all businesses according to the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy. However, the importance of small businesses has been diminished by President Biden's capital gains tax proposal which, if passed, would make America's rate nearly the highest in the world. With many small businesses still working to get back on their feet following the hardship created by the pandemic, this proposal could decimate small businesses across the U.S.What's being proposed?Currently, the long-term capital gains tax rate is 20% for single households with more than $445,850 in taxable income in 2021. Biden has proposed to nearly double the capital gains rate to 39.6% for those earning more than $1 million. In addition to the new tax rate, businesses must pay a 3.8% Medicare surtax bringing the rate to 43.4% before local and states taxes are factored in.Businesses lose bigSo, what does this look like for business owners? For examples sake, let's say a California business owner has a $100 million company that they'd like to sell keeping in mind that $11.7 million isn't subject to estate tax. Under Biden's proposal, the business owner would owe $43.3 million in federal income tax (capital gains and Obamacare tax), $13.3 million in state tax and $35.3 million in estate tax. In the end, this leaves this business owner with $8.1 million, effectively reducing their wealth by over 90% after taxes are paid.Second-generation businesses will struggle to surviveIn addition to increasing the capital gains tax, Biden has also proposed to remove the step-up in basis and instead carry over an asset's tax basis from the decedent to the next generation. This means that if you own a business when you die, your inheritors must pay income taxes regardless of whether or not they sell the business, saddling them with a huge tax bill that currently doesn't exist under today's policies. For example, let's say a parent owns a $10 million small business and passes it on to their child when they die. If Biden's proposal is passed, the child would now owe nearly $4 million in capital gains taxes that they likely can't afford as it's nearly half of the value of the business. If they can't afford the capital gains taxes they'll have to sell, but who can afford to buy the business? Big corporations. So rather than the family business continuing on and passed on for generations, larger corporations win in the end.Related: Cryptocurrency and Taxes: What You Need to Know



When it comes to initiatives posed in Biden's tax proposals, big businesses continue to receive a majority of the benefits. Why is that the case? We'll discuss why capital gains from real estate entrepreneurs and small businesses get hammered while big businesses can acquire companies without capital gains in my next article.

90,Have You Given Yourself a Mid-Year Tax Checkup?,"Jul 9, 2021",Melissa Brock,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/have-you-given-yourself-a-mid-year-tax-checkup/376846,"
Before you head to the mountains for a week of hiking or drive to the beach for a week of sand and surf, you might want to do something a little less exciting before you go. As boring as it sounds, you might want to do a mid-year tax checkup. After all, a few law changes have gone into effect and these could affect you big-time during next tax season. Take a look at a few things before you paddle out for the next bit wave on the California coast or ride away on horseback in Wyoming. It'll ensure that you actually enjoy the rest of your summer.



Why Do a Mid-Year Tax Checkup?Doing a mid-year tax checkup is like prepping for the holidays a few months early. You buy a few decorations, then start organizing your guest list early. In other words, you prepare in advance so you aren't surprised when Cousin Joey has planned to come (uninvited) as usual.  Same with your taxes. You can fiddle with your withholdings, entity structure and take a look at deductions as you need to. Remember, how much you earn and spend during the year affects your taxes. 


Checkpoint 1: Your WithholdingsHave any life changes affected how much you need to withhold? You might have gotten married, adopted a child, accepted a different job, among other moves. It could all impact your withholdings. Check with the tax withholding estimator from the IRS so you know how much you will underpay or overpay throughout the year.If your income has changed significantly, you might want to change your IRS W-4, Employee's Withholding Certificate and ask your employer to hold more or less of your wages.Checkpoint 2: 401(k) ContributionsNeed to deposit more into after-tax 401(k) contributions? Since you make 401(k) contributions pre-tax, you can reduce your taxable income. It's a great way to reduce your overall taxable income and build your retirement savings even more.   Remember: You can run up against the tax deadline for next year for IRA or health savings account contributions but not your 401(k).


Checkpoint 3: Retirement Account WithdrawalsDid you take a withdrawal from a retirement account during the pandemic? You can repay all or part of the funds within three years of the date you took the distribution, says the IRS.Consider paying the repayment now if you're in a position to do so — it can help you save more later.Checkpoint 4: Child Tax CreditNext week, millions of families will begin receiving monthly payments for the enhanced child tax credit due to the American Rescue Plan. The plan says that parents will receive $2,000 to $3,000 but goes to $3,600 for children five years old and younger. Families with higher incomes will see less. Those who file their tax return as a single person will start to phase out if their adjusted gross income goes above $75,000. It goes to $112,500 for head-of-household filers and $150,000 for married couples filing a joint return. If you have kids but know you'll have a hefty tax bill come April 2022, you can opt-out of the payments and receive a lump sum next April, as long as you don't think you'll earn more and get less. Check out the Child Tax Credit Update Portal on the IRS website.


Checkpoint 5: Quarterly Estimated Tax PaymentsAnyone self-employed or who operates a small business must make quarterly estimated tax payments. Late or insufficient payments may lead to fines, so try to accurately predict your income for the rest of the year as closely as you can. Use the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System courtesy of the IRS or mail-in checks. You should be able to easily remember the payment dates because they occur at even, quarterly intervals: First-quarter payment: April 15Second-quarter payment: June 15Third-quarter payment: September 15Fourth-quarter payment: January 15Check your state's quarterly payment requirements as well.Checkpoint 6: Review Certain Items (if You Have a Business)How well are you keeping track of your expenses and transactions? Keeping a complete record of your transactions throughout the season may mean you lose out on tax-deductible business expenses and may end up paying more in taxes. 


In addition, make sure you keep clear income records so you're ready for tax season. Checkpoint 7: Look into Your InvestmentsYou also need to review your investment allocations right now and determine whether you have a strategy in place that applies to your specific risk tolerance and future savings goals.If you haven't rebalanced your investment portfolio, recent gains may have pushed your allocation toward more stocks and fewer low-risk investments. You may need to sell some investments that have made money to offset some of your recent gains. 


Also, note that tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends did not change for 2021. However, the income thresholds adjusted based on inflation.In 2021: The 0% rate: Applies for individual taxpayers with taxable income up to $40,400 on single returns, $54,100 for head-of-household filers, and $80,800 for joint returns.The 20% rate: Begins at $445,851 for single filers, $473,751 for heads of household, and $501,601 for couples filing jointly.The 15% rate: For filers with taxable incomes between the 0% and 20% breakpoints.The 3.8% surtax on net investment income: Occurs for single people with modified adjusted gross income over $200,000 and for joint filers with modified adjusted gross income over $250,000.Get a Comprehensive CheckupIf you have any questions, you might want to sit down with an accountant to discuss how you can save money. A tax professional can also break down your tax situation, especially when things get complicated. Look for a trusted tax professional in your area — ask friends and family — and if you own a small business, ask other small business owners for suggestions.

91,5 Ways to Never Miss a Tax Deduction Again,"Jun 30, 2021",Vlad Rusz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-ways-to-never-miss-a-tax-deduction-again/375823,"
Small-business owners wear many hats. They tend to fill every role — from the chief executive to the janitor. Business owners also need to keep in mind their business taxes and the complexities involved in documenting the money moving into and out of the business. They have to know what to track and what is tax deductible.Unlike personal tax deductions, which are limited and listed by the IRS, knowing what a business can deduct as an expense isn't as clear-cut. An obvious tax deduction for some, such as the use of a personal vehicle to run business errands, may be something others hadn't considered.There are many lists online that offer examples of what business owners can deduct. Some deductions are quite creative such as renting your home to your business for the annual shareholder meeting while others are more obvious like the deduction for a home office. It's unlikely that business owners will remember these long lists, however, so here are five key tips to make sure you never miss a tax deduction again.



1. Use a business checking accountThe first thing any business owner should do is separate all business and personal funds. This is not just good business practice, it's also highly recommended — and usually required — in order to keep your business entity separate from yourself. When all your business transactions are in one place, you know they will be accurately tracked and deducted.2. Separate credit cardsIf you are new to business, getting a business credit card can be challenging. Sometimes you can't rely solely on cash and have to tap into personal credit cards. In this case, from a tracking and tax deduction standpoint, it's best to designate a personal credit card for strictly business use. This way you know that all charges on that card are business expenses, and you can simply pay the card from the business checking account.


3. If in doubt, track itIf you're unsure if a transaction has tax implications, it's best to track it and ask your accountant. You can always determine the tax implication at a later time. If you don't track the transactions, there will be no data to help you determine how to handle the transactions at tax time.Related: 75 Items You May Be Able to Deduct from Your Taxes4. Perform a litmus testOne simple way to think about business expenses and their tax deductibility is to ask yourself, ""If I didn't have this business, would I have incurred these expenses?"" If the answer is no, then it's likely that the expenses are deductible. If the answer is yes, they may still be deductible, but more scrutiny is required to determine this.5. Learn what's not deductibleWhile the list of tax-deductible business expenses is seemingly infinite, the list of expenses that the IRS does not allow is much shorter. It can be much easier to know what isn't deductible, like personal grooming and clothing, than what is.


Related: The Most Forgotten Tax Deductions Business Owners Should TakeThe best advice is to track everything. You don't need to remember all the tax rules: That's what a tax preparer or accountant is for. Most businesses lose out on a lot of tax deductions not because they aren't aware of them, but simply because they don't track everything. Remember that while it can be tedious, it will be worth it at tax time when the savings roll in.Related: 15 Small-Business Tax Deductions

92,Inherited an IRA? You Could Pay Major Taxes if You Don't Follow the New Rules,"Jun 30, 2021",Melissa Brock,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/inherited-an-ira-you-could-pay-major-taxes-if-you-dont/376143,"
Do you expect to inherit the contents of an individual retirement account (IRA)? If you are not the spouse of the individual who died and inherited IRA money, you want to know the new withdrawal rules. For example, if someone in your family (such as a parent, a grandparent, aunt, uncle, sister, brother, etc.) passes away and leaves you money in an IRA, you want to know the new withdrawal rules through the Setting Everyone Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act. The SECURE Act has been around for a little while — but long enough for people to forget all about this added rule.The IRS will levy huge penalties on the account your loved one leaves you if you don't follow the rules. Here's how to prevent that from happening and tips about inheriting IRA assets as a beneficiary (but not a spouse).Tip 1: You must take distributions within 10 years.Inheriting rules depend on your relationship to the original IRA owner and the type of IRA you inherit. You must take IRA distributions within 10 years following the death of the account owner. You can no longer pace your withdrawals to last over a long lifespan, such as 30 years. 



According to the SECURE Act, you won't have to take specific required minimum distributions (RMDs) during each of those 10 years. At the end of the 10th year after the original owner died, you must have an empty account. If the account isn't empty, the IRS will levy a 50% penalty tax on the money that remains in the account. Let's say a parent dies and leaves $1 million to his two children. The adult children, ages 50 and 53, can choose one of three options:


Option 1: Withdraw the entire balance of $500,000 (each) in one year.Option 2: Spread it evenly over 10 years by withdrawing $50,000 each year to cushion the tax impact.Option 3: Take various amounts each year based on their specific tax bracket in a given year.No matter what, the children must withdraw the entire amount by the 10th year. Tip 2: You can't roll money into an existing account. The IRS doesn't allow you to roll the money from an inherited IRA into one of your existing accounts. You must transfer your portion of the assets into a new IRA set up and formally named as an inherited IRA. You cannot make contributions to this account.Tip 3: Meet with a tax advisor. You want to talk with a trusted tax advisor because all money is taxed as ordinary income. This might mean taking withdrawals over multiple years to help you avoid rocketing to a higher tax bracket. A few options that your tax advisor might help you consider:Make a charitable donation: Your tax deduction toward the charitable donation could help offset the additional tax you owe on an inherited IRA distribution.Make a qualified charitable donation (QCD): A QCD is a direct transfer of funds from your IRA to a qualified charity. Amounts distributed as a QCD can count toward satisfying your RMD for the year, up to $100,000. You can only do this if you're at least 70 ½. No matter which strategy you choose, chat with your tax advisor for more information.


Tip 4: Roth IRAs work differently.Since you don't have to take out RMDs and withdrawing the money from a Roth IRA won't trigger a tax bill, a non-spouse who inherits a Roth IRA might consider waiting until the last possible minute to empty the account. You'll get another 10 years of tax-free growth before moving money into a taxable account. However, just don't forget about it. The money must be withdrawn at the 10-year mark.Roth IRA beneficiaries can withdraw contributions tax-free at any time. You can withdraw earnings tax-free as long as the account had been open for at least five years at the time the account holder died. If the account was less than five years old at the original owner's death, you'll owe taxes on the earnings you withdraw. Tip 5: Consider timed withdrawals. You may want to consider timed withdrawals, which means you spread withdrawals out over those 10 years. Just note that with a traditional IRA, each withdrawal counts as income and you will pay taxes in the year you make the withdrawal. Your tax advisor can give you more information about how these withdrawals will affect your tax bracket.


Tip 5: The 10-year rule doesn't apply to everyone. In several situations, you can use the old RMD method, which refers to the ""stretch"" RMD methods — that you withdraw based on life expectancy. The rule doesn't apply to:Minor children: You must take distributions but they're based on life expectancy. This only applies until you're 18 in most states. Once you turn 18, you must withdraw the account within 10 years.Those chronically ill or disabled: You can stretch IRA distributions out over your lifetime if you're chronically ill or disabled.Those not more than 10 years younger than the account owner: You can stretch withdrawals out over your lifetime.Tip 6: You'll face different rules for IRAs inherited by an estate or trust.Talk with your tax advisor about what you should do when an IRA gets inherited by an estate or trust. The account must be fully withdrawn within five years in most cases. Tip 6: Find out in advance whether you're someone else's beneficiary. When you find out that someone left you an IRA, you might have been surprised to learn that the deceased had considerable assets stacked up. If you have others who might list you as a beneficiary, find out now — don't wait for a surprise inheritance. It's the only way you can plan your financial life for the future (and talk with a tax professional as soon as you know about it).Know the New Rules and Talk with a Tax ProfessionalThe old rules stated that you could take out money over your entire life expectancy. Cumulative tax impacts could affect you more when it's compressed into a 10-year period, particularly when you put that together with your other income. Generally, your distribution is included in your gross income and will be subject to ordinary state and federal income taxes.


Consider all your options when taking RMDs and other distributions and talk to a tax professional to reduce your burden as much as possible.Featured Article:  What Does a Sell-Side Analyst Rating Mean?

93,Is President Biden Attacking Small Business on Purpose?,"Jun 11, 2021",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/is-president-biden-attacking-small-business-on-purpose/372954,"
With a new president, there are always changes. While some of these ideas and proposals may sound ideal, they come at a cost and the government must decide how they will be paid for. Often, the government turns to businesses to help fund these initiatives through new policies or tax increases, but what many don't realize is that small businesses can bear the brunt of these changes.Small businesses are the backbone of America. In fact, according to the Small Business Administration, there are more than 30 million small businesses in the U.S., and comprising 99.9% of all U.S. businesses. Despite playing a key role in the economy, many of the proposed policies currently being discussed will harm small businesses in America. Let's look at the first of many policies currently being discussed in Congress.Related: Tax Rules for Buying and Selling Bitcoin and Other Crypto



A push for unionsFrom the beginning of his campaign, President Biden declared, ""I am a union guy."" So, it can't be too much of a surprise that his American Jobs Plan, which supposedly is about infrastructure, includes the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act that was passed by the House earlier this year. The bill would expand various labor protections related to employees' rights to organize and collectively bargain in the workplace. In fact, the fine print puts employees in a predicament. Currently, more than two dozen states have right-to-work laws in place that allow employees the option to opt out of unions and not pay their dues. Under the PRO Act, unions can override the decision to opt out and force employees to pay union dues despite not wanting to join them.How are small businesses affected?As with many new policies, huge corporations have the funds and teams to combat nearly any change that could potentially harm their business. On the other hand, small businesses often don't have the financial ability to go up against the powers at be. The economy needs small businesses to not only survive but thrive in the post-pandemic world, and unions don't help their bottom line. The PRO Act would make it difficult to hire independent contractors, force companies to subsidize union business, and would make it difficult to fire substandard employees.


Is the President pro-big business?While Biden claims to support small businesses, many of the policies like the PRO Act penalize small-business owners while larger corporations walk away relatively unscathed. Small businesses can be fragile, and more regulations and restrictions on top of the recent pandemic closures could result in fewer and fewer successful small businesses. According to a new study by the Federal Reserve, an additional 200,000 businesses closed in the past year due to the pandemic. Successful small business owners are often lumped into the same category as billion-dollar corporations who can better absorb the increased costs.Related: Do the Top 1% Really Cheat on Their Taxes?We need small businesses to succeed now more than ever to continue to regain a strong economy. To do so, the public needs to understand the perspective of these business owners, including the struggles they've faced in the last year and Biden's proposed policies that could devastate them. We'll continue to discuss these topics and more in my next article on pandemic policies that fundamentally discourage small businesses.

94,Fast Track Your New Back-to-Work Smile with Byte,"Jun 3, 2021",Entrepreneur Deals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/fast-track-your-new-back-to-work-smile-with-byte/373559,"
Everyone wants perfect teeth, and while perfection is always out of reach, Byte can take you most of the way there in as little as three to four months. Unlike braces and even some other clear aligners, Byte is the shortcut to straighter teeth you've been looking for. It all starts with an impression kit. Marked down from $95 all the way to $25, Byte's impressions can be taken at home without the need to set foot in a dentist office. After you take a mold of your own teeth, simply send it in for scans and an orthodontist will review your case to evaluate whether Byte is right for you. You'll then receive a 3D model virtually demonstrating your treatment plan, and finally, Byte sends out your customer aligners, along with step-by-step instructions you'll want to carefully follow for a smooth treatment.At $1,895 — or $1,795 at its limited-time promotional rate, Byte's pricing falls directly in line with its competitors. With its flexible financing plans, that can be brought down to $83 a month. However, the company also offers a Byte At-Night aligner system option that costs $99 a month or $2,295 once. Whereas the original Byte plan requires you spend 22 hours a day wearing its aligners, Byte At-Night gives you the choice to wear them only while you're sleeping. The only differences are that it costs more and takes longer to complete.Either way, Byte is a great value, especially if you're in a rush to improve your smile before returning to the office. The company's exclusive HyberByte technology gives it a noticeable advantage over rival services, and its Byte for Life Guarantee ensures your teeth don't come out of alignment over time once you've finished the process. In terms of convenience, price, and quality of service, Byte can't be beat.At 75 percent off, the cost of a Byte impression kit is half that of Smile Direct Club, its closest competitor. Using the promo code 02BYTELINK100, you can also save $100 on aligners. Shipping is free, and the return shipping box for your impression is included. Dental correction has never been easier or more affordable than Byte.

95,The Tax Man Cometh -- Everything You Need to Know About Tax Day on May 17,"May 17, 2021",Euni Han,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/the-tax-man-cometh-everything-you-need-to-know-about-tax/372159,"
The IRS extended the federal tax deadline for individuals from April 15 to May 17th. So what does that mean? Pete Dunn, a.k.a. Pete the Planner of Carmel, Indiana, breaks it down on Fox News.What time are taxes due?Anytime on May 17. Your envelope has to be postmarked before midnight. Check your local post offices for extended hours. If you're e-filing then no need for that post office run. 



What else is due today? Contributions to retirement, health savings and education accounts for 2020. The IRS has more information here.   What if I miss the deadline (again)? You're going to get penalized if you owe money. The IRS will charge 5% of your unpaid tax bill for every month you don't file, and an additional 5% for each month you don't pay. The maximum penalty is 25%.  But interest also builds daily.  


There are no fees for filing late if you're expecting a refund, it just means your refund check will take longer.     What if I'm self-employed? The filing and payment deadline is the same. But, your quarterly estimated taxes from January through March 2021 did not get an extension. So if you haven't paid yet, you're subject to penalties.Is another extension possible? Yes but that deadline is also today. If you can't make today's deadline and you think you might owe money, Dunn says file an extension online for free. You'll dodge some penalties but will still have to pay late fees. An extension will, however, give you until October 15th to file. If you need more time for only state taxes, you can file for more time here.  Keep in mind that some states automatically exempt you if your federal exemption is approved.  


As for refund checks, Dunn says the IRS is experiencing delays which means refunds could take three weeks or longer. E-filing tends to be faster but either way, you can check the status here.  Dunn says just be sure to know the exact refund amount so you can track it.

96,5 Tax Tips Every Cryptocurrency Investor Needs to Know Now,"May 6, 2021",Tor Constantino,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-tax-tips-every-cryptocurrency-investor-needs-to-know-now/370396,"
This year saw the introduction of new words into the financial lexicon of many casual investors and small business owners. It seems like you couldn't click on a web article or social media site and not see something about Dogecoin, NFTs, Hodl, Ethereum, Coinbase and of course Bitcoin. While these terms, and what they each mean, might be new to casual investors, they are certainly not new to the IRS as the U.S. tax agency is focusing more resources and effort toward securing crypto taxes.During testimony before the Senate Finance Committee last month, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig stated that the U.S. government fails to collect as much as $1 trillion in revenue every year due in part to recent exponential growth and interest in cryptocurrencies. Related: Tax Rules for Buying and Selling Bitcoin and Other Crypto



According to CoinGecko the entire cryptocurrency category has a market cap of $2.3 trillion. Bitcoin is nearly half that amount on its own, making it more valuable than Disney, Home Depot and Exxon combined.Those types of numbers have drawn IRS attention and enforcement actions. In March, federal officials arrested six individuals in New Hampshire for alleged money laundering and tax evasion involving e-currencies. Last November, IRS agents were able to track down multiple cryptocurrency accounts on the Dark Web resulting in the seizure of $1 billion in digital assets - the largest cryptocurrency capture to date.


And the IRS is not just targeting criminals. In 2019, the agency issued a ""reminder"" to individual tax filers to voluntarily report past cryptocurrency transactions. ""In 2017, which was a very high-growth year for cryptocurrencies, prices went up tremendously and then dropped significantly in 2018. I saw taxpayers that had massive taxable gains in 2017 and then lost their entire portfolio the next year. Now the IRS is calling, and those individuals still must pay taxes on those earlier gains, but they don't have the funds. Proper planning and tax optimization services can help prevent that,"" according to Justin Woodward, a tax attorney who specializes in digital assets and is the co-founder of TaxBit.Wooward offers these five cryptocurrency tax tips to help plan for current and future tax seasons: The IRS currently classifies cryptocurrencies as ""property"" not securities. As such, that asset class is taxed at the short- or long-term capital gains rate depending on how long you've held an asset. ""If you hold a cryptocurrency for a year or less, the short-term tax rate for 2020 ranges from 10 to 37 percent depending on income and filing status. If you hold a digital asset for longer than a year the long-term tax rate applies, ranging from zero to 20 percent on profits,"" said Woodward.Another important consideration is understanding that you're not taxed only when you convert your cryptocurrencies back into fiat currencies such as dollars or euros. ""Taxable events can occur even if you swap a crypto asset for another token including stable coins such as USDC or DAI. A key determinate of the taxable amount for each transaction will depend on your initial cost basis, which was how much you initially paid for each respective token versus its price at disposition when you sold or converted into something else,"" he said.Woodward also noted that as with most assets, initially acquiring any given digital token is not usually a taxable event, neither is moving tokens to a different crypto exchange such as Coinbase or a digital wallet; however, disposition of a token at a loss or profit is a taxable event in most circumstances. ""Also, if someone sends you a digital asset in exchange for a product or service or you earn interest in the form of a cryptocurrency those are taxable the same way interest earned on traditional securities would be taxed,"" he noted.When it comes to tax minimization tactics, cryptocurrencies can be excellent tools to easily ""harvest losses"" if you're a high-income earner looking for some write-offs. Volatility is an inherent attribute of cryptocurrencies and smart investors can use that to their benefit. When wide swings happen, it's extremely wise to take a loss if you can. ""Say you have one Bitcoin that drops $5,000 in a day. You can legally exchange that for a stable coin or any other cryptocurrency and then immediately buy back that same Bitcoin within minutes. There is no repurchase waiting period as with other securities. This is a tremendous way to intentionally harvest losses by documenting the initial loss while also lowering your cost basis on the repurchase.""Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, tracking the tax impact of your cryptocurrency trades can be easier and safer than you think. Linking the exchanges where you make transactions and crypto wallets to some of the newer crypto-focused tax tracking software can fully automate the process for both individual investors and businesses — even for transactions dating back to 2014. Woodward noted that under recent tax changes, past losses can be carried forward indefinitely until they are fully claimed.Related: Ethereum Just Hit an All-Time High, Beating Bitcoin's Year-to-Date Gains


He added that if this is your first year dealing with the tax implications for cryptocurrencies, it's best to seek expert help by contacting a tax preparer or accountant with experience in digital assets – but don't wait. ""Many people mistakenly believe that taxes are completed only once a year, but it requires vigilance all year long especially when you're invested in cryptocurrencies. Once you file taxes for 2020, don't wait for the last minute next year – begin planning for 2021 now,"" said Wooward.

This week Kathy is stepping in to answer pressing small business tax questions.



Let's all take a deep breath Help! How do I conquer the anxiety of doing my taxes? I'm so overwhelmed with all of my business expenses, receipts, and the lack of organizing I did throughout the year. How can I make this less stressful now?We hear this often, in part because most small business owners start their business to pursue a passion, not to crunch numbers. Taxes, bookkeeping and accounting — they can all be stressful, especially when you're feeling unorganized and ill-prepared. Instead of worrying about what you should have done, change how you approach organizing your finances and documents going forward. For now, though, just get started. The simple act of getting started on organizing your finances, and not waiting until a tax filing deadline, can help reduce your anxiety.


As a first step, calculate how much income your business generated in 2020. How did you track that income? If you didn't use invoicing or bookkeeping software, like Wave, you likely have bank account records. And those same bank records likely also show your business expenses. If you already set up a separate bank account and credit card for your business, well done! You won't have to worry about untangling your personal and business finances when it's time to file your taxes. Going back through your bank records to separate personal from business income and expenses is tedious and time-consuming, but sometimes necessary. Unfortunately, this is something many first-time small business owners learn the hard way.Next, you'll want to lower your taxable income by deducting some of your business expenses. Make a list of everything you spent money on to get your business up and running. Reviewing your online calendar, emails, and texts can be a great reminder of client appointments, projects, and agreements that you made. After that, try to find matching receipts and records of those expenses. If you made specific business-related trips, you can now use GPS mapping software to reconstruct your mileage logs. Going forward, you might also consider one of the many apps that make it easy to scan and save receipts through your smartphone, then automatically add them to your bookkeeping program that we covered in the first step. That way, you don't have to keep track of all the loose paper receipts in your wallet, shoebox, or wherever else your receipts wind up.Related: Dear Brit: Should I Name My Company After Myself?To make things less stressful and more efficient, I highly recommend seeking the help of a small business tax professional. They can help you sort out your situation and set you up for success. Don't be ashamed to admit that you haven't kept the best records. You're certainly not alone. Look for someone who will take the time to help you lay the groundwork for keeping good records, how to understand a profit and loss statement, and how much to set aside for taxes. If you're not sure where to start, companies that specialize in small business taxes like Block Advisors can help small business owners like you succeed.


Whatever situation you're in, you're not the first to be thereWhat happens if I can't afford to pay the taxes I owe?My best advice is don't panic, but don't ignore the issue. Even if you can't afford to pay your taxes right now, you should still file your taxes by the deadline. If you file your business tax return and can't pay (or if your business still owes taxes from a past return), you do have options.First, make sure the taxes you owe are accurate, because mistakes can happen. Hire a tax professional to look at your return to make sure you are filing correctly, and that you're not missing out on any of the credits and deductions available to small business owners. If you don't file your tax return or make a payment arrangement with the IRS, they can eventually force you to pay. The IRS can file a lien that would harm your credit, and they can levy your bank accounts and income sources, such as payments from customers.Related: Dear Brit: 'How Do I Find Customers Who Will Spend Lots of Money and Gush About Me to Their Friends?'


Depending on your circumstances, the IRS offers payment options ranging from short extensions for businesses that just need a little more time to pay, to special agreements for businesses in financial hardship situations. A tax professional can help you find and evaluate which option will work best for your business, and your tax pro can even help work with the IRS to set up the agreement.You are not the first (and certainly won't be the last) small business owner in this situation. Take a deep breath, then take control. If you can start and run a small business, you can handle this too.Getting audited is not the end of the worldI have an irrational fear of being audited. What are the most common mistakes you can make on your taxes that could get you in big trouble?The word ""audit' is scary to a lot of people, but in many cases the fear of an audit is worse than the audit itself. It helps if you understand your rights as a taxpayer. When the IRS audits your return, it's basically looking to see if you correctly reported your information and paid the right amount of tax. If you look at it another way, it's just another level of IRS review, with the goal of keeping the whole system fair.


The chances of being audited by the IRS are relatively low, at nearly 2 percent for small business owners and 1 percent for individual taxpayers. If you're confident that your information is correct and you kept good tax records, you have nothing to worry about.Some common mistakes that can trigger small business tax audits include:Misreporting income: If you forget to report income for which you received a 1099-NEC, you may draw the attention of the IRS. The IRS compares the amount you report on your return to any 1099s or W-2s it receives.Disproportionate deductions: Claiming deductions that seem too high for your income level can also trigger an audit.Home office deduction: The rules governing the home office deductions are stricter than many small business owners realize. You can only take this deduction if you use part of your home exclusively and regularly for trade or business purposes. ""Regular use"" usually means that the location is your main place of business. ""Exclusive use"" means that there can be no personal use of the space.Even if you receive a letter from the IRS, it's no reason to panic. First, open the letter right away — don't set it aside in a pile of other mail. Second, review it for any actions needed or deadlines to respond by, and third, get some professional assistance.

99,Tax Rules for Buying and Selling Bitcoin and Other Crypto,"Mar 24, 2021",Mat Sorensen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/tax-rules-for-buying-and-selling-bitcoin-and-other-crypto/367764,"
When you buy Bitcoin and sell it for a profit you are subject to capital-gains taxes. This is the case whether you buy Bitcoin and sell it for dollars or whether you exchange it for other cryptocurrency for a profit. This is also the case if you buy Bitcoin, it goes up in value and then you exchange the Bitcoin for goods or services.The IRS has given guidance twice on cryptocurrency tax issues in IRS Revenue Ruling 2014-21 and 2019-24. The critical determination by the IRS in 2014 was that cryptocurrency is property, not currency, for federal tax purposes. This critical determination meant that crypto-trading profits will be treated similar to stock-trading profits, as stock and crypto are both considered property for tax purposes. Treating crypto profits like stock seems straight forward enough, but the rules are not so clear for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, since crypto can be purchased with dollars, go up or down in value and then be exchanged to buy a Tesla, pizza or even withdrawn for cash at a Bitcoin ATM. These exchange outcomes are not common in stock trading, and as a result the rules for crypto taxation are confounding.Related: 7 Things You Should Know About Cryptocurrency Taxes



Trading of crypto and short-term vs. long-term gainsLike a stock portfolio that you personally own, you will need to track the value of the crypto you buy, and then you'll also need to track the value of crypto when it is sold or exchanged. For example, if you bought Bitcoin for $30,000 and then sold it in exchange for $50,000, you'll have a gain of $20,000. This gain is subject to tax at either short- or long-term capital-gains rates depending on how long you held the Bitcoin. If you held the Bitcoin for more than one year, you get preferred long-term capital-gains rates of 0-20%. Essentially, the long-term capital-gains tax rate is 0% for low- to middle-income earners (generally less than $40,000 if single, $80,000 for married couples) is 15% for middle- to high-income earners (generally income up to $441,000 if single, $496,000 for married couples) and is 20% for high-income earners (generally income in excess of $441,000 if single, $496,000 for married couples).If you held the Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency for a year or less, then you are subject to short-term capital-gains rates, which vary from 0-37% based on your modified, adjusted gross income.  


Exchanging one crypto for anotherThe exchange of one cryptocurrency for another causes taxable gain. For example, if you bought $50,000 of Bitcoin one month and then exchanged it for Ethereum later worth $70,000, then you have a taxable gain of $20,000. This is the case whether you held the Bitcoin for one minute and traded it for other cryptocurrency or whether it was held for years.Using crypto for goods or servicesWhen you exchange cryptocurrency for goods or services, you are taxed on the increase in value that cryptocurrency has from the time of purchase until the time it is exchanged. For example, if you bought a Tesla with $100,000 worth of Bitcoin, you would need to track when that $100,000 in Bitcoin was purchased, and you would then pay tax on the increase. If that Bitcoin were purchased at a value of $40,000, then there would be a gain of $60,000 when that Bitcoin is then exchanged for the Tesla. If held for over a year, it will be a long-term capital gain and will be at preferred rates. If the Bitcoin was held a year or less, the $60,000 gain will be taxed at short-term capital-gains rates.Crypto lossesWhen you buy and then sell Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency for a loss, you are entitled to a tax loss. Losses can occur when selling crypto at a loss and when exchanging crypto for other cryptocurrency or goods or services at a loss. Losses from one crypto trade or exchange can be used to offset other crypto gains. Short-term crypto losses can offset short-term crypto gains, and long-term crypto losses can be used to offset long-term crypto gains. Crypto losses can also potentially be used to offset gains from stock or mutual funds. If crypto losses exceed crypto gains, as well as stock, ETF and mutual fund gains, then up to $3,000 of the loss can be used to offset other income such as wages or self-employment income. Any losses that cannot fully be used against income in the year incurred can be carried forward to future years and netted against future crypto or stock-trading gains.Crypto forks and airdropsIRS guidance in 2019 clarified two unique items that can occur on a crypto blockchain. The first is a fork. There are different kinds of forks that may occur, and what crypto owners need to know for tax purposes is that if a new coin result from a hard fork, those new coins are considered taxable as ordinary income to the recipient. The IRS also clarified in 2019 that an airdrop of new coins to existing cryptocurrency holders will be taxable as ordinary income to the recipient at regular income-tax rates. Airdrops are distributions of free coins or tokens to current cryptocurrency holders and are usually promotional.


Crypto mining and staking is ordinary income taxed at regular ratesCryptocurrency mining and staking income is ordinary income for tax purposes. Cryptocurrency mining, and its staking counterpart, is a service that computers provide to a cryptocurrency blockchain network. The owners of these computers typically receive cryptocurrency from the network in exchange for their services. So, for example, if I owned computers that provided cryptocurrency mining or staking, then I would typically receive crypto in exchange for these services and would pay tax on that crypto to the IRS. The payment in crypto is taxable income just the same as if I were paid in dollars to perform these same services to the network.The value of the crypto when it is received is the value to be used for tax-reporting purposes. If the value of the crypto increases after it's received, then you will pay capital-gains tax on the increase of value when the crypto is later sold or exchanged. So, for example, let's say you received Bitcoin worth $1,000 for crypto-mining services and that this crypto then increased in value and three months later was sold and traded for $1,500. The first $1,000 would be taxable as ordinary income. This income will be subject to regular income-tax rates, which range from 0-37%. The $500 increase in value in the Bitcoin after it was earned will be treated as capital-gain income.Record keeping and reporting is requiredThe taxation of cryptocurrency is complicated and requires diligent recordkeeping when buying, selling or exchanging. The responsibility to properly report this is on the crypto owner. There are numerous cryptocurrency-tracking applications that have been created to help cryptocurrency investors, users and traders properly track and report their taxes. CryptoTrader.tax and Cointracker.io are lading providers to investigate. There are around 10 companies that have an application to assist in tracking your crypto for tax purposes.The IRS requires the reporting of cryptocurrency gains and losses on form 8949. Form 8949 is filed with your personal 1040 tax return. The major providers of crypto in the U.S. report crypto transactions and trading to the IRS. This includes Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Cash App, PayPal and Binance.us. Whether the exchange you used reports to the IRS or not, you still have a reporting obligation.


But do not think that you can avoid taxation by using a company outside the U.S. You need to be wary, as this can result in additional foreign asset reporting requirements to the IRS. For example, the foreign bank account rules known as FBAR have a pending rule change that would include crypto holdings to fall under the definition of a bank account and would thus result in foreign bank account reporting of crypto assets. Additionally, crypto held with a provider outside the U.S. that exceeds $50,000 in value may also require the filing of a Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, or Form 8938. In sum, do not assume that trading and holding crypto abroad will exempt you from tax-reporting obligations. In fact, it makes it more complicated, and it does not reduce your tax obligations.Related: Cryptocurrency and Taxes: What You Need to KnowUsing an IRA to defer or obtain tax-free gains on crypto profits A Roth IRA can be used to invest in crypto and can grow and come out tax-free at retirement. When trading crypto with a Roth IRA or other retirement account, you can bypass the tracking and annual tax-reporting, as crypto profits in a Roth IRA or other retirement account are not subject to tax and do not show up on your 1040 personal tax return.Many early adopters of cryptocurrency who my company worked with found the tax rules and reporting of cryptocurrency gains to be onerous and expensive. These early adopters enjoyed dramatic value increases, and in turn saw significant tax bills when selling or exchanging that cryptocurrency. The Roth IRA became a particular favorite for those who perceived large gains, as it allowed them to invest and own cryptocurrency where the gains can grow and come out tax-free once they reach retirement age of 59 ½.


A self-directed Roth IRA is a more tax-efficient option to invest or trade cryptocurrency for the long haul. For those unfamiliar, the income and gains made by a Roth IRA are not taxable and they grow and come out tax-free at retirement. This is the case with stock you trade in your Roth IRA, and it is the case with crypto that you trade in your Roth IRA. When using a retirement account, you can also skip over the annual tax reporting on your 1040, given that the income in a retirement account is exempt from capital-gains taxes.In additional to Roth IRAs, you can also use traditional IRAs, HSAs solo 401(k)s and other retirement accounts to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Keep in mind that traditional IRAs and 401(k) accounts are subject to tax on the distributions from those accounts at retirement, but are not subject to tax year-to-year and grow tax-deferred until you take distributions from the account.It is important to realize that the funds in a Roth IRA or other retirement account cannot be withdrawn until the account owner reaches 59 ½. If the account owner takes a distribution of the gains on a Roth IRA before the owner reaches age 59 ½, they will be subject to early withdrawal penalties and taxes on the investment gains withdrawn.The usual broker dealers who provide retirement accounts do not allow you to invest and trade cryptocurrency in their IRAs and Roth IRAs. Instead, you will need to use a retirement account custodian who provides self-directed accounts. This is what my company and about 20 other companies in the so called self-directed IRA industry provide. These companies allow you to invest in real estate, private companies, and some allow for cryptocurrency. When choosing a provider for a crypto IRA or crypto Roth IRA, watch out for significant trading fees, make sure they are licensed and ensure that you are comfortable with the management team and services selected.

101,"6 Stimulus Bill Benefits You Need to Know About, Including Your $1,400 Check","Mar 11, 2021",Justin Chan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/6-stimulus-bill-benefits-you-need-to-know-about-including/366987,"
Earlier this afternoon, President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, clearing the way for many struggling families to receive up to $1,400 in direct payments. The coronavirus relief package, however, also provides a number of other benefits that most recipients are probably unaware of, as Tax Foundation policy analyst Garrett Watson recently told CNBC. Here are some things to keep in mind as the federal government prepares to roll out the massive initiative:The bill will extend unemployment benefits. Individuals receiving a weekly payment of $300 will continue to see that amount until, at the very latest, Labor Day. The bill will also extend two CARES Act programs until early September: Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC). The package will additionally extend Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation (which provides an extra $100 in aid to select workers with W-2 and 1099 income) until Sept. 6. There will be a larger distribution of the vaccine, which will hopefully accelerate the timeline for school reopenings. With Johnson & Johnson's assistance, the Biden administration hopes to provide enough of the vaccine so that schools can safely reopen five days a week by the end of Biden's first 100 days in office. To help meet that ambitious goal, the president recently announced that he would order 100 million more doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. It is unlikely, however, that those doses will be delivered to adults by the end of spring. The bill has several provisions intended to help small businesses. Under the package, the administration has authorized an additional $7.25 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program. Still, it is important to note that the bill does not extend the program, which is set to expire on March 31. Via the State Small Business Credit Initiative, the legislation also sets aside $10 billion for state governments so that they can make low-interest loans and other investments. Businesses in underserved communities should also expect to reap some benefits following the bill's passage— the stimulus will provide $15 billion in assistance through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan grants program. Moreover, the package will offer over $40 billion in financial help to restaurants, museums, theaters and concert venues — many of which were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.  Parents will get more financial support. The bill will expand the child tax credit, giving tax relief for every child a parent has under the age of 17. The credit can be refunded in cash if it is more than what the parent owes. The tax credit will also jump from $2,000 to $3,600 for children under the age of six. That's not all — qualifying parents will receive the full $1,400 for young children and get payouts for older dependents.Far more workers with no children will benefit from the expansion of the earned income tax credit. Depending on income and filing status, the credit for low to middle-income adults without children will now range between $543 and $1,502. This will especially help those who are earning low wages.For more information about what the stimulus bill means for you, check out our coverage below:Biden Signs $1.9 Trillion Stimulus Into Law, Americans to Receive Individual $1,400 Payments as Soon as This WeekendHere's How the Third Round of Stimulus Checks Will Differ From the Previous TwoWhen Is My Third Stimulus Check Coming?You can also find a roundup of stimulus-related news here.

1. Better bookkeepingGood bookkeeping impacts every area of your business and will impact your decisions and strategy.* Ask yourself: How many months are left to be updated? Do you have all your supporting documents ready or will you have to search for key supporting documents?


* Remember to make sure your bank reconciliation is also being updated with all amounts accounted for – both payments and receipts.* Ensure the Chart of Accounts  (how your business dealings are categorized) is current and properly reflects the various transactions of your company. Each type of transaction in your business will have varying tax rules and reporting requirements. When transactions are not reported in the correct category you risk losing key benefits or credits. When transactions are missing and not recorded in your business that will also impact the taxes paid. Each missing expense results in a corresponding missing credit or deduction depending on your rate. Setting up your business to ensure effective systems exist will seek to minimize your risk of missing transactions and paying more than you want (or need) to pay.

103,"Warren's Wealth Tax: How Much Bezos, Musk, Gates and Zuckerberg Would Pay","Mar 3, 2021",Grace Dean,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/warrens-wealth-tax-how-much-bezos-musk-gates-and/366466,"
US billionaires would have paid a combined $114 billion for 2020 under an ""ultra-millionaire"" tax that Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts proposed on Monday, according to two tax groups.The bill, called the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act, would apply an annual 2% tax on individual net worth between $50 million and $1 billion. Individuals would owe an annual 3% tax on net worth above $1 billion.Warren said that the tax would affect only about 100,000 American families and that the country's billionaires would pay about half of the total tax amount.



The nation's roughly 650 billionaires have a collective wealth of more than $4.2 trillion, Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies Project on Inequality said, basing their calculations on Forbes data. Their fortunes have increased by about 44% since March 2020, when the pandemic lockdowns in the US started, the groups said.Based on the wealth of American billionaires at the end of 2020, over a decade the wealth tax on them alone would fund about three-quarters of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, the two groups said.


And about a third of the wealth tax would be paid by the 15 richest Americans, who combined have a fortune of more than $2.1 trillion, the groups said.A separate analysis by the University of California at Berkeley, cited by Warren, estimated that the tax would generate $3 trillion in revenue over 10 years.Warren proposed that the new federal money would be invested in programs such as childcare, education, and infrastructure.Here's what Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg — the nation's four richest people at the end of 2020, based on data from Forbes — would have paid for 2020 under the wealth tax proposal, according to the ATF and IPS' calculations.


Jeff Bezos: $5.7 billionBezos.Image credit: Alex Wong/Getty ImagesThe departing Amazon CEO would have paid $5.7 billion in wealth taxes for 2020, the ATF and IPS said. At the end of 2020, he had a fortune of $191.2 billion, per data from Forbes.Washington legislators have also proposed a tax on the state's billionaires. Bezos would pay almost $2 billion a year under this tax.Elon Musk: $4.6 billion


Musk.Image credit: Maja Hitij/Getty ImagesMusk, the tech billionaire behind Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, would have paid $4.6 billion for 2020 under Warren's proposal, the ATF and IPS said.At the end of 2020, Musk's real-time worth was $153.5 billion, after his wealth increased more than sixfold in 10 months, per Forbes data.Bill Gates: $3.6 billionGates.Image credit: Dursun Aydemir/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesGates, who had a fortune of $120 billion by December, per Forbes, would have paid $3.6 billion in wealth taxes for the year, the ATF and IPS said.


Mark Zuckerberg: $3 billionZuckerberg.Image credit: The Asahi Shimbun via Getty ImagesThe Facebook CEO would have paid about $3 billion in wealth taxes for 2020, the ATF and IPS said. As the end of 2020, he was worth $99.9 billion, according to Forbes.Momentum for a wealth tax has grown during the pandemicAn Oxfam report found billionaires' wealth increased by $3.9 trillion from last March to December globally. The increase for the world's 10 richest billionaires could pay for everyone to get vaccinated and stay out of poverty, Oxfam said. In the second half of 2020, meanwhile, 8 million Americans fell into poverty.Oxfam suggested wealth taxes could be a good option to reverse this. In December, academics published a study of 50 years of tax cuts for the wealthy that suggested ""trickle-down"" economics made inequality worse and didn't lead to economic growth and employment.


""Skyrocketing billionaire wealth in the midst of a health and economic crisis weighing down millions of Americans is one of the best reasons for enacting the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act,"" Frank Clemente, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, said.""This legislation will narrow the nation's destabilizing wealth gap while raising trillions of dollars from billionaires and the other superrich.""Argentina became the first country to respond to the pandemic with a one-off ""millionaire tax."" Fewer than one in 100 earners will pay the tax, which the government hopes will raise $3.78 billion to help pay for its pandemic response.

I've owned and managed businesses for over a decade and been around business owners for even longer than that. Some businesses drown in paperwork while others exist with a debit card and a wallet full of cash. One business can produce copies of a year's worth of receipts in minutes while the other needs hours at the bank just to generate a summary.While some may argue that too much documentation isn't a bad thing, it can detract from time otherwise spent on productive business activities. So how do small business owners find the balance? How much paperwork is too much or maybe not enough?The overall number of printed records has declined drastically in the last few years. Most checkout systems at brick-and-mortars will email you a receipt; but let's face it—we mostly shop online anyway! Most of the files and documents that small businesses need to save are already conveniently emailed to us or available for download. The problem most small businesses face is in determining what is worth keeping and what can be discarded.



Related: How Does the New Stimulus Package Affect You?To start, don't try to save paper copies of any documents. As soon as they land in your hand, scan and upload them to the cloud. Organization is streamlined when all your documents are on the cloud. As you prepare to close out last year, here are the documents that you should save:


Bank statementsMost banks give access to online statements for years and years, however, that access is revoked when you close the account. Instead of trying to remember to save years of data before you close an account, make saving all your statements a year-end habit.Checks and bank depositsNot all bank statements contain copies of checks and deposits. If your statements don't include this information, download the images at year-end. Most banks don't keep this type of information online forever so be diligent about saving these often.All tax documents and lettersThe IRS and most state tax agencies will communicate almost exclusively by mail. Although these documents are already printed, scan them in as soon as you receive them. And remember to also keep copies of anything you mail in.Related: 7 Tips for Keeping Receipts Organized for Tax Time

Sometimes you trade in one car for another or finance a large purchase. The purchase and loan documents are crucial to filling out tax forms correctly.

105,Coronavirus Stimulus Checks: How Delaying Paying Your Taxes Could Help You Get More,"Feb 23, 2021",Aman Jain,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/coronavirus-stimulus-checks-how-delaying-paying-your-taxes/365942,"
Filing taxes early is always good, if you are expecting a refund, so that you can get it sooner rather than later. This year, however, some taxpayers may gain by delaying their tax filing. Specifically, delaying taxes this year could make some taxpayers eligible for more cash in the third round of coronavirus stimulus checks.Income Limit Determines Your Check AmountMost Americans would benefit by filing their 2020 return quickly, but this is not true for everyone. In fact, some might benefit by delaying their taxes. For some, filing 2020 taxes could make them ineligible for the stimulus checks, or reduce the amount they may get.The third round of coronavirus stimulus checks, which are yet unannounced, are part of the $1.9 trillion plan put forward by the House Budget Committee last week. Congress is expected to vote on the proposal soon. If all goes as per the plan, the first checks could start going out sometime in the second week of March.



Similar to the first two rounds, the third round of stimulus checks would also have income limits. As per the proposal, the full $1,400 payment would go to those with AGI (adjusted gross income) of less than $75,000. On the other hand, those with AGI of more than $75,000 but less than $100,000 will get a reduced amount.For married couples, the income limit is above $150,000 but under $200,000, while for Head-of-household filers the limit is higher than $112,500 but less than $150,000.


These income limits mean you won't get any money if you are a single filer making $100,000 or more, or couples earning $200,000 or higher, or Heads of household with an income of $150,000 or more.Coronavirus Stimulus Checks: How Does Delaying Taxes Help?To determine your eligibility for the stimulus checks, the IRS would look at your most recent tax return. It is more likely that you witnessed a drop in earnings in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Thus, you might qualify for a larger stimulus check on the basis of your 2020 tax return.However, there will be some Americans who made more money in 2020 than in 2019. It could be because of gains in the stock market, high demand for essential businesses and more. If you belong to this group, then it is recommended that you delay your tax return for a few weeks.Suppose you're a single filer with AGI of $74,000 in 2019, but your AGI jumped to $102,000 in 2020. If you filed your 2020 tax return early, then you may not qualify for the stimulus check at all. But, if you delay your 2020 tax return, the IRS would refer to your 2019 tax filing to determine your eligibility, and thus, you would get the full $1,400.


So, we recommend that you hold off your 2020 tax filing until the agency sends you the stimulus payment.

106,Democrats Have Control of Washington. What Does That Mean for Taxes?,"Feb 22, 2021",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/democrats-have-control-of-washington-what-does-that-mean/363894,"
Historically, Democrats are usually in favor of raising taxes, specifically for high-income earners. With President Biden now in office, the House of Representatives controlled by Democrats, and a split Senate, it's no surprise that many entrepreneurs are wondering if Biden's big plans for taxes will come to fruition. Here's what tax changes are likely in store during the Biden presidency.Understand the balanceTo better understand what initiatives of President Biden's might get passed, it's important to understand the balance of power in Congress. While the House has a 10-person Democratic majority, the Senate is an even split and most tax bills require a 60% vote. This means that each individual legislator has the power to stop a bill from passing, so even though Democrats have control this doesn't guarantee that every initiative will be passed. In addition, any changes won't be immediate as Biden's focus is currently on another round of pandemic relief.Rate increasesMost of the focus surrounding Biden's tax proposal was on rate increases for income, corporate and estate tax. Any significant increase in the estate or corporate tax rate is unlikely to pass as it won't create much new revenue unless President Biden and the Democrats feel a strong need to send a message and they can convince some of the moderate Republicans that it makes sense. An increase in income taxes seems a bit more likely. As it stands, Biden plans to increase the tax rate on annual income over $400,000 from a top rate of 37% to the old top rate of 39.6%. Knowing this in advance is an opportunity to revamp your current tax strategy. By understanding and utilizing the tax law, you can work with your CPA to reduce your taxable income to below $400,000 legally.

While some incentives will remain the same under Biden's presidency, notably real estate and oil, there will be new opportunities in clean energy. In addition to supporting restoring the full $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit and enhancing incentives for carbon capture, use, and storage, his plan to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement shows that he intends to focus on clean energy and climate control. Connect with your tax advisor to understand what incentives would work best in your tax strategy and how to maximize them.


Potential deduction for state taxesOne change that many haven't considered is a potential lifting of the limit on the deduction for state taxes. New Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, both from high-tax states, have been pushing for state taxes to be deductible on federal returns. It's possible that with Democrats in control, this could become a reality. The challenge in getting this passed is the cost, especially since it primarily benefits high-income taxpayers.Generally, taxes aren't going to decrease in the next few years, but the increases may not be as substantial as some believe. In this situation, the best offense is a good defense. An ongoing tax strategy that you continue to adjust and revisit often will be the key to reducing your taxes while Democrats have control of Washington.Related: Using Tax Preparer to File Taxes May Delay Your Coronavirus ...

107,How to Give Yourself a Tax Cut,"Feb 15, 2021",Bruce Willey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-give-yourself-a-tax-cut/363769,"
It's been one of the most tumultuous, uncertain years in modern history, and yet – at least in my line of work – we now have some form of certainty just in time for tax season.With Democrats owning a voting majority in Congress for the next two years at a minimum, small- and medium-sized business owners can look to Joe Biden's proposed tax plans from the campaign trail for what to expect.I, as well as many others, anticipate higher taxes.Related: How Will the Biden Tax Plan Affect Your Small BusinessIt's not a done deal, however. The majorities are slim. And with more coronavirus aid expected to pass a Democratic legislature, some of the loftiest tax code changes may not pass. After all, it's a fiscal fact that funding relief has to come from somewhere.



That said, business owners can — and should — prepare for significant changes to tax rates in the very near future. I went into this business because I want to see business owners keep as much of their hard-earned money as possible, regardless of what's happening in Washington or elsewhere.My recommendation? Don't wait for politicians to give you a tax break. Find ways to give yourself one.Here's what I'm telling small and midsized business owners to start thinking about as we head into 2021: Consider your corporate structureParticularly for the smallest businesses, consider how you've incorporated your business.


If you're a single-member LLC, your business and personal finances are going to mingle come tax time. This not only increases your chances of an audit but makes it more difficult to parse out what can legally be deducted as a business expense.If you haven't already, investigate becoming an S-corp. This opens up your options for deductions, ensures a cleaner tax record, and is likely to save you thousands, if not tens of thousands, of dollars in the long run.You should undergo a review with your financial and legal advisors now, at the beginning of the year, to see how you might benefit from a change in how your entity is designated.Related: Regulations and Taxes: What's in Store for 2021 


Be ready for auditsSome, including myself, believe the Biden administration will raise tax revenue by clamping down on existing rules. This could come in the form of an increase in internal auditors at the IRS.While I always preach maintaining clean books and being prepared for an audit, this potential rise in auditors clearly increases the chances of receiving one of those envelopes with the dreaded ""Internal Revenue Service"" return address in the corner.That means taking some small measures, like ensuring you always retain the original receipts for deductible purchases (not just the credit card receipt). And some bigger ones, like being honest with your advisors and taking care of anything from the past that might surface. Credits are your best friendFinding ways to get more deductions is one thing, and your accountant will be happy to help, but tax credits are the holy grail. That's because tax credits result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your overall tax bill instead of a percentage knocked off. In the end, it means more money in your pocket at the end of the day.


One such credit to explore with your tax advisor is the Research and Development tax credit.Related: 8 Tips to Squeeze More Savings from Your Home Office Take advantage of pre-tax optionsWhether it's tucking money away in a 401(k) until the political winds blow back toward lower tax rates or taking advantage of HSAs and FSAs, there are many ways small- and medium-sized businesses can ease tax burdens by utilizing pre-tax funds.Medical bills could be a big one. They add up quickly. If you know medical expenses are coming, ensuring your FSA program is up to snuff helps ensure you're not using post-tax money to pay for them.


There are plenty of other legal avenues to ensure more pre-tax dollars will allow you to retain and expand your business resources, but they can get more complicated. That's another question for your advisor. It's all about planningGiving yourself a tax cut is perfectly doable and entirely legal. Just take every measure possible to research the complexities and nuances.The future is never certain — 2020 proved that — but planning your businesses' tax strategy makes it less uncertain. And as 2021 comes into focus, the time to start planning is now.
