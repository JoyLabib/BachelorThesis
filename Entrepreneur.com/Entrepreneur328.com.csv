  He Took His Side Hustle Full-Time After Being Laid Off From Meta in 2023 — Now He Earns About $200,000 a Year: 'Sweet, Sweet Irony'

        Goodfriend turned his passion for food tours into a business with some encouragement from his friends. 
      


        The business made about $30,000 a year before Goodfriend was laid off from Meta and went full-time with the venture.
      


        Goodfriend appreciates being able to ""pursue something I love and earn a salary from it.""

Scott Goodfriend. When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? I moved to New York from Los Angeles in 2011. I always loved traveling and getting lost walking through different cities. When I moved to New York, I was fascinated by the ability to visit anywhere in the world by subway, even neighborhoods that were far away. I researched different restaurants and then started thinking, well, maybe I can eat at a few different places, so I started planning walking routes to different eateries on Google Maps. My friends found out I was doing this and wanted to join.



Eventually, the word spread. My friends and family from out of town started calling me when they came to visit New York. They would tell me about a neighborhood they wanted to explore and ask if I could plan a food tour. I enjoyed the challenge and was happy to do this, and I probably ended up planning 50-100 tours over seven or so years.Related: TV Shows All Entrepreneurs Should Be Watching


During this entire time, I was a broke freelance TV producer living in the East Village who lived off a fair amount of $1 pizza. I lived close to Chinatown and figured I could probably take a short walk and find something better. I not only found delicious food but also discovered the variety, depth and complexity of Chinese food, which I became obsessed with. I started doing tons of research into the regions, cuisines and history and the Chinese experience on the Lower East Side. I started taking people to Chinatown, and they fell in love with the tour. They told me to do this as a business, and I always poo-pooed the idea, saying I didn't want to build a website or do the marketing (sweet, sweet irony — but more on that later). My friend encouraged me to put my tour on something called Airbnb Experiences. I posted the Chinatown tour on Airbnb in 2019; it got to the top of Airbnb in a short timeframe. Then, Covid-19 hit, which shut my operations down for over a year.In 2021, I reworked the tour and put it back on Airbnb, and it got to the top of the ""Activities to do in NYC"" list. People started asking me what other tours I had, so I wrote more. Eventually, I had to hire people to help run the tours and help with the marketing. It got overwhelming because I was also working my dream job as an augmented reality producer at Meta, but then….I was part of the Meta layoffs in 2023! I had a decision to make: Go work for another company I really loved and respected, or pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I decided to pursue Ultimate Food Tours full-time. It's been great, and I've learned so much doing it. I am really glad I made the jump.Related: This Dad Started a Side Hustle to Save for His Daughter's College Fund — Then It Earned $1 Million and Caught Apple's Attention


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?The biggest challenge while building my business was deciding where to focus and invest my time. You need to be strategic about what parts of the business you invest in and focus on. Since entrepreneurship doesn't have a playbook, the answer is often to go for it, analyze the results, learn from it and do better next time.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?Ultimate Food Tours evolved tremendously over the last few years, and I'm lucky enough for it to be my full-time job now. Before switching to this as a full-time role, I was making around $30,000 a year. I probably saw consistent revenue between the second and third years. At this time, I was only pursuing Ultimate Food Tours on the weekends, so I was making around several thousand dollars a month.What does total annual revenue look like now?Currently, I generate around $200,000 a year and have seen the brand grow by about three times year-over-year.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


What do you enjoy most about this side hustle? I love being able to leverage my passions and turn them into business strategies. A great example of this is our content marketing. I come from a family of foodies, and I have always loved history and making videos, so I created a social series called Origin Stories, which tells the history behind New York's famous foods and the best places to eat them. We have three seasons and plan to begin long-form content soon. I am so proud of this because we get to use our platform to drive traffic to local restaurants while simultaneously building our own brand. It's conceptualizing and executing these win-win strategies that really got me excited about running a business.Being an entrepreneur is a lifestyle! When I first started, I was putting in around 20 hours a week. Since making my side gig my full-time job, I probably work between 50-60 hours a week. Combining my passion with my livelihood allows me the flexibility to pursue something I love and earn a salary from it. I also utilize outside technology that helps streamline my finances and save me time to focus on my business and personal life.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Stay organized! It's easy to get overwhelmed with various spreadsheets and different numbers flying around. Using an accounting sofware helps free up time on my schedule, allowing me to turn my attention to other areas of the business like marketing and developing additional tours.Whatever idea you have, whatever your big dream is, take that first step now! Buy that domain name, make that social media post, whatever it is. Just do one small thing a day, and the rest will fall into place. Make it part of your routine, and you'll see a return.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


If you're working a full-time job, try to bite off what you can chew and plan your side hustle schedule around your current commitments. You'll be able to see if it has room to grow, and if you do think you want to make it your full-time thing, start putting things in place that prepare you to make the jump when you feel ready.Network and talk to other entrepreneurs! The most valuable thing I found was talking to other people who started businesses and food tour companies of their own. They knew what needed to be done and were able to fill in a lot of the gaps in managing my time and gave me the insights needed to successfully launch my own business.

As post-pandemic travel continues to ramp up, airports are booked and busy.In fact, a new report by the Airports Council International released on Monday found that 2023 saw a total global passenger footprint of roughly 8.5 billion people, up 27.2% year-over-year and a recovery rate of 93.8% from pre-pandemic rankings in 2019.The report revealed the preliminary rankings of the busiest airports in the world for 2023, and a new international hot spot has worked its way up to No. 2.



After gathering data from over 2,600 airports in over 180 countries and territories, the No. 1 busiest airport in the world is still Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Atlanta has held down the top spot for over 20 years, thanks to high passenger volume and Delta Airlines being headquartered in the city, catering to over 104.6 million passengers this past year.Related: What Are the World's Busiest Airports?

The second spot went to the Dubai Airport, which saw a 31.7% increase in passenger volume year over year, bringing through an estimated 87 million passengers in 2023. Last year, Dubai was ranked No. 5 on the list.Travelers crowd a departure area in Dubai International Airport on March 06, 2024, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.Photo by Horacio Villalobos Corbis | Getty ImagesThe third spot goes to the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, which saw 81.75 million passengers in 2023, followed by London's Heathrow Airport (79.18 million passengers) and Tokyo's Haneda Airport (78.72 million passengers.)


""Global air travel in 2023 was chiefly fueled by the international segment, propelled by several factors. Among these were the anticipated benefits from China's reopening and a growing inclination towards travel despite macroeconomic conditions,"" ACI World Director General Luis Felipe de Oliveira said in a company release.Of the top 10 busiest airports internationally, five were located in the U.S., with Denver International Airport coming in at No. 6, Los Angeles International Airport at No. 8, and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport at No. 9.Related: Delta Most On-Time Airline, Air Canada Least: 2023 ReportThe Top 10 Business Airports in the World, According to the Airports Council International Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport104.6 million passengers in 2023Dubai Airport87 million passengers in 2023Dallas Fort Worth International Airport81.75 million passengers in 2023London's Heathrow Airport79.18 million passengers in 2023Tokyo's Haneda Airport78.72 million passengersDenver International Airport77.84 million passengers in 2023London Heathrow Airport79. 18 million passengers in 2023Los Angeles International Airport75.05 million passengers in 2023Chicago's O'Hare International Airport73.89 million passengers in 2023New Delhi Airport (India)72.21 million passengers in 2023

Tobin and his wife in front of the Taj Mahal.I first learned about Safrans du Monde, the luxury French tour operator and travel agency, from an article in Travel + Leisure that came out last spring. When I first saw that article, I sent it to my wife, sort of along the lines of This is ridiculous, who could do this. This is epic but so over the top. We laughed about it and thought how cool it sounded, then sort of forgot about it. Then, about six months later, I realized our 30th wedding anniversary was coming up, and maybe we should do something big because 30 years is a long time she's been suffering with me, and that article came back to mind.

I was drawn to it because it's such an interesting and painless way to cross off so many items on your bucket list at once. The trip we went on was the Grands Classiques, so we saw Machu Picchu, Easter Island, the Taj Mahal and so many other iconic places. At one point a few years ago, we looked into getting to Easter Island, and just getting there is no small feat. And that was just one of the stops that you could do on this 22-day excursion. We had been to Sydney twice before because my brother lived in Australia for 15 years, but otherwise all of the destinations were new. Seeing the Taj Mahal was just so impressive and a little surreal to suddenly be there, particularly when we had been in Cambodia the day before, and witnessing that as the sun rose was incredible. It's something I'll never forget. From a destination standpoint, I was also struck by Bora Bora and just how beautiful it was.Related: The Young Founder Behind a $100 Million Luxury Travel BusinessImage Credit: Courtesy of Safrans du MondeTickets for our trip cost $75,000. There were 52 passengers total on our vacation, and there was a French-speaking group and an English-speaking group. Our sort of subgroup was about 15 English-speaking people, and we had our own guide who stayed with us the entire time. She was on the plane from day one until the end and took care of everything — from visas and collecting passports before we went to certain destinations to letting us know what was happening next. We had a local guide for just our group who met us at each destination and stayed with us from the time we arrived until they dropped us back at the airport. The ability to have all of these experiences with no planning on our part and very little thinking about what we needed to do — hotels, transportation, meals — was remarkable and stress-free.

But the Ship Will Never Set Sail — Here's How the Big Dream Sank.Image Credit: Courtesy of Safrans du MondeThe plane itself had plenty of room; you have your own seat for the entire 22 days. You have the same flight attendants, the same pilots, the same chef. It was a little inverse of a normal trip where the plane flight could be sort of taxing. Getting to the destination was very relaxing, but you did have to hustle a little bit to see things on the ground. My wife and I joked a little bit that it was like the Amazing Race: One morning, we're looking at the Easter Island statues, and that afternoon, we're landing in Tahiti. But they did have a nice break scheduled in French Polynesia. We were there for four days, and it was much less planned, so we could relax a little bit more. There is a lot packed into that trip in a fairly short period of time, and I was grateful that we did it at a point where we still had the energy and mobility to do things like that.Related: Going on a Family Vacation? This Popular U.S. Destination Is the Most Expensive in the World.Image Credit: Courtesy of Safrans du MondeIt's not an inexpensive trip, but when you look at the value provided, it's completely worth it. The logistics of getting to these places are very difficult when you fly on commercial airlines and have to make various connections. So logistically, it was so much easier. It was so much more pleasant not having to think about all of the planning and just be well taken care of the entire time. It made it both more cost-efficient and more enjoyable when you add up all the things you got to see.

      Key Takeaways    



        The Masters is this week. You know what that means: an opportunity for attendees to buy merch.
      


        Items with the Masters logo have become elite status symbols.
      


        If you went to the Masters and didn't buy a mountain of swag to show off, did you truly go?
      



















Christian Petersen via Business Insider
Patrons at the Masters lug around multiple bags of merch, which can include the hottest item of them all: the Masters garden gnome.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. When the Masters golf tournament started this Thursday, those watching on TV were treated to the usual assortment of visuals: lush green grass, immaculate flower beds, and the world's greatest players putting on a show.



But an even fiercer competition will be raging behind the scenes: the battle for authentic Masters merch.Sure, seeing superstars like Tiger Woods and Scottie Scheffler in person is cool. But so is loading up on gear emblazoned with the Masters' famous yellow logo, which has become a cultlike beacon of status.


I had the good fortune of attending a Monday practice round for the Masters and could see the merch fervor up close and personal.When I showed up at Augusta National Golf Club with my family (shout-out to my dad, who secured the tickets after a decade-plus of lottery attempts), I quickly noticed the number of people already heading for the exit. They each had six to eight bags stuffed with shirts, hats, and towels, and many had the most highly sought-after item of them all: the Masters garden gnome.A close-up of the highly sought-after garden gnome. Christian Petersen via BI


The tournament allows for one reentry a day, so it's possible those people were going to drop their merch off in their car. But it wasn't lost on me that they might be part of a legion of resellers who make thousands marking up and flipping authentic items. To get an idea of how lucrative that can be, check out this 2023 Masters gnome listed for $1,200 on eBay. (Original price: $50.)Once we made our way further up the entry path, we saw the start of the line. It stretched back 50 feet from the actual entrance, which was followed by a series of winding metal gates reminiscent of a TSA checkpoint. Directly in front of the entrance, there was a sea of people standing shoulder to shoulder, trudging along, trying to make their way to the actual course. It reminded me of going between stages at a music festival. I would've snapped a picture of the hubbub, but the Masters' no-phone rule made it difficult to document the journey.Being in the main line feels a lot like waiting for a ride at Disney. Once you enter the building, there's a huge room and corridor with gates snaking around. The line seems to extend at every turn. What's another 20 minutes when that sweet merch is within grasp?After roughly 45 minutes, we made it to the actual shop. The final step is to wait for about five minutes in an entryway before they let in a new flood of shoppers.


Once you're inside, the mania is overwhelming. There are separate alcoved sections for men, women, and kids. A giant houseware display sits in the center of the store. Countless shirts and hats are displayed on the wall and busy workers rush to fetch items from bins stacked high with various sizes.There are several checkout lines, each with at least five registers on either side. The cashiers crank through piles of merch, run credit cards, then move on to the next. It's an impressive assembly line of capitalism.I ended up purchasing a polo shirt, a T-shirt, a hat, and a cup. Compared to almost everyone else around me, it felt like a meager haul, and I wound up toting around just a single bag for the rest of the day.A sea of people near the entrance of the Masters golf shop on Tuesday. Ben Jared via BIThe whole experience left me feeling like the Masters has become a retail juggernaut that just so happens to put on a golf tournament. And the numbers bear that out: The 2022 tournament raked in $69 million in revenue from merch, per Forbes, which was far more than it made from tickets and concessions.Attendance figures aren't made public, but the consensus is that about 40,000 people attend the tournament each day, which works out to each visitor spending an average of $246 at the merch store.But that assumes endless supply. A guy I met at my hotel said that last year, the store had to stop selling merchandise by Friday because of depleted inventory. It's also possible people are less merch-obsessed from Thursday to Sunday when the actual golf tournament is going on, so the Monday-through-Wednesday practice-round crowd could be driving up that average.


It seems more likely that the typical patron is ponying up even more than $246 — the people carrying six bags were surely toting five figures worth of swag.So in the end, what's it all for? The answer is pretty straightforward: street cred and status. Golf is already an expensive sport largely played by the affluent. For one to stand out in that already elite crowd, extreme measures must be taken. Lines must be waited in, and hundreds (thousands?) must be shelled out.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to head to the store wearing my new Masters hat.

4,5 Ways to Maximize Your Returns at Live Conferences,"Apr 12, 2024",Lena Grundhoefer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/maximize-your-roi-at-live-conferences-with-these-5/472055,"
Conferences are among the most important marketing avenues for my consultancy, and I'm not alone. The global live event industry (which includes live sports and concerts, corporate events, and conference and exhibitions) surpassed $650 billion last year and is projected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2032.Of course, it's worth mentioning that conferences aren't guaranteed success. E3 was once the most important annual video game event, but it struggled to remain relevant after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and inevitably shut down permanently in December. Although sad, it's an anomaly in a recovering industry–events like CES, SXSW and ComicCon bounced back and continue to prove their value for major brands and professionals alike.Major players like Apple, Amazon and Coca-Cola have robust live event strategies, so clearly, the return on investment is there for planners, buyers and exhibitors from the top brands in the world.



The average trade-show budget for exhibitors was $1.4 million last year, an increase even from pre-pandemic levels. Add-ons like panel and stage participation, awards and strategic advertising throughout the event increase costs. However, calculating the ROI of these expenses can get complicated.Related: How to Network at Events Like a Pro and Watch Your Startup SoarThrough working countless events and putting many hours behind the upsides and even pitfalls, here are five tips to maximize your ROI at events.1. Lean into your brandingBranding is perhaps the most important factor for attending, sponsoring or exhibiting at a major event. In fact, research found conferences can increase brand recognition by up to 76%, although 85% of exhibitors say their primary reason for attending is to generate leads and sales (covered in the next point).To maximize this benefit, be sure everything you bring with you to the show improves your branding down to every detail. This includes what your team wears to the event, any merch you plan to hand out, marketing materials, brochures, clipboards and pens used, and more. These events fly by fast, with a lot going on at once, and it's important to make a lasting impression quickly for the best possible results.2. Nail a clear call to actionAs mentioned above, sales leads are the lifeblood of any business, and conferences can make or break your company. That's why it's necessary to have a clear call to action in all of your branded materials. If you forge a strong connection with a potential prospect, you need to close the sale before they talk to someone else and forget.


Conferences last from a couple of days to a week, and you'll meet hundreds or even thousands of potential prospects in that time. You should have a highly polished elevator pitch (30 to 60 seconds) that easily highlights the selling points of your business, and it needs to end with a simple and intuitive CTA to ensure you complete the necessary sales to guarantee an ROI.And following up a week or two after the event is equally important in closing the deal.Related: 5 Ways to Make the Most Out of an Industry Conference3. Leverage satellite eventsEveryone assumes the business happens on the trade floor, but little do they know the handshakes happen in intimate settings. Every conference has satellite events, and these typically happen at the various venues surrounding the main event venue. Decision-makers often attend these get-togethers to network, and these side events are where it's at.


These side events are also a great way to benefit without a ticket to the main event. It's not unusual for aspiring entrepreneurs to lurk outside the main convention to learn more about side events happening after hours and stake those out to meet potential investors and clients. A handshake deal after hours can make the difference between a win and a loss at the event.4. Tag teaming makes the dream workOrganization is the best way to ensure success, and conferences are best handled with a team of three or more people. Throughout the event, the exhibition floor remains active, and there are plenty of conferences and panel discussions happening simultaneously. It's impossible to be everywhere at once unless you have a team willing to divide and conquer.Set up a time and place to meet at the end of the day, and keep two-way radios on hand, as event Wi-Fi can be spotty. These small radios have about a six-mile radius, which is more than enough to keep you in contact throughout any major event. Staying in contact with each other ensures you maximize potential opportunities throughout the event without doubling up on each other's efforts.Related: 5 Tips to Networking at Conferences as an Introvert


5. Have fun!Above all else, it's important to have fun when attending conferences. Although it's a business trip, these events can be a fun place to meet up with people you've only worked with virtually. Getting to know other people and learning new things can help you build your community, even if you don't close the deal.ConclusionConferences are a cornerstone of business, and even at the height of pandemic lockdowns, live virtual events came through. If you're looking for a way to elevate your business to the next level, attending a live conference or conference can be the way to go.It's not guaranteed, though–these events are expensive, with tickets that can cost thousands of dollars and exhibits and sponsorships that easily cost seven to eight figures. Without careful planning, it's easy to waste money without any tangible ROI. Some people even find success offsite without ever buying a ticket to the main event.Be sure you have a solid plan and execute on it for the best possible outcome. If you do it right, you can easily land the deal that makes up for the cost of the event and creates sustainable long-term success for your business.

With long lines and busy crowds, some Disney parkgoers lie with fraudulent claims of disability and special assistance needs in an attempt to beat the system.Now, the parks are cracking down on those who have been untruthful by overhauling the rules and regulations around Disability Access Services — namely, by instating a lifetime ban on those found to be lying about having a disability.""A lot of [content creators] abuse it because standing in line isn't good content,"" one Reddit user wrote.

Affluent travelers could have a pretty cushy vacation on Royal Caribbean's giant Icon of the Seas cruise ship.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Are you looking to ball out on your weeklong vacation aboard the world's largest cruise ship? Get ready to pay $200 for dinner and $100,000 for a cabin.Vacations-at-sea can be a fairly affordable vacation option. With most cruise lines, your base fare already includes accommodations, unlimited food, endless activities, and the opportunity to see several destinations in one go.



But as more ""pay-to-play"" amenities show up on board, the more pricey these floating vacations could become. And there's likely no better example of this than Royal Caribbean's new world's largest cruise ship.Forget tiny interior cabins and dinners at the buffet. On the 9,950-person Icon of the Seas, affluent travelers could have a vacation that rivals even the most luxurious small-ship cruise.


Guests interested in luxuriating in one of Icon's 179 suites will be paying a minimum of $4,614 per person for a weeklong sailing.Suites are furnished with high-end toiletries from Malin and Goetz. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderThe mega-ship's high-end suites range from 402 to 2,523 square feet, balconies included.Some come with sweeping views of the AquaTheater. No need to scramble for the best seats when you can watch the show's divers, synchronized swimmers, and aerialists from your couch.


Others, like the floor-to-ceiling window-lined Icon Loft, are spread across two floors.The Icon Loft, shown in a rendering, is 656 square feet, not including the balcony. Royal Caribbean InternationalGuests in the most luxurious suites also get Starlink WiFi, laundry services, the best seats for on board shows, and a ""Royal Genie"" to help plan their trip.But few compare to Icon's most expensive cabin, the 2,523-square-foot Ultimate Family Townhouse.The Ultimate Family Townhouse can accommodate up to eight guests. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderGuests in the three-floor floating mansion get to wake up to sweeping ocean views and coffee on one of the three balconies.The bottom floor has an open-air patio that opens into Icon's Surfside neighborhood.The two bedrooms — one with a bunk bed — are back inside on the top floor.Looking to watch a movie or flex your karaoke skills? Slide down to the second floor, where you can do just that at one of the several lounges.A spokesperson for Royal Caribbean told Business Insider that travelers have been 'quickly' reserving the giant cabin for an average of $100,000 a week.The townhouse's balcony wraps around the living room. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderBut a cruise ship worker stationed at the Ultimate Family Townhouse in January told BI that some guests have been snatching up the multilevel townhouse for a whopping $200,000 a week, noting that the playground-like cabin was mostly booked for 2024.


The keycards to these plush suites also open up another exclusive side of the ship: the Suite Neighborhood.Guests who've booked a suite have access to the ultra-exclusive Suite Neighborhood, shown in a rendering Royal Caribbean InternationalOnly guests staying in suites can access the 60,924-square-foot retreat and its two restaurants, sundeck, hot tub, pool, and bar.The list of exclusive restaurants doesn't end there, of course.Affluent travelers could splurge on grilled lobster, fish, and shrimp at restaurants like Hooked Seafood. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderMore than half of the Icon of the Seas' 28 eateries come at an extra cost.Some are more affordable, like Izumi at the Park's grab-and-go sushi window. For $10, hungry travelers can pick between seaweed salad and edamame, plus two choices of sashimi, nigiri, and rolls.Cruisers craving a formal, upscale dinner could instead reserve the rabbit-slinging $200-per-person Empire Supper Club.Empire Supper Club features live music and a cocktail pairing. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderThe price is comparable to high-end, on-land Michelin-starred restaurants.Empire Supper Club's American fare dinner flexes eight courses, a cocktail pairing, and live jazz. Appetizer options include butter-poached langoustine with Osetra caviar. For the main course, the aforementioned rabbit leg and loin could be a bun-tastic choice.The latter will be paired with a New York Sour — not a hoppy beer.


There are 18 other places to drink on the ship. As usual, none are complimentary.Caffeinated cocktail-slinging Rye and Bean is located next to the AquaTheater. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderExpect to front New York City prices without a beverage package: The popular Rye and Bean bar serves coffee and tea-infused cocktails ranging from $12 to $14.Looking for a pampering? Like alcohol, spa treatments are rarely complimentary on cruise ships.Travelers can rent one of the colorful casitas for a day. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderVacationing can be stressful. At the mega-ship's spa, guests can unwind with an almost $150 25-minute facial or a nearly $180 50-minute Swedish massage.Or, book one of the exclusive casitas to relax with unobstructed ocean views.A spokesperson for Royal Caribbean did not immediately respond to BI's request for casita pricing on Icon of the Seas. But for context, a casita on the cruise line's older Symphony of the Seas mega-ship can cost about $360 per day during a sea day.


Amenities like the six-slide waterpark and mini-golf course are complimentary to all guests.Crown's Edge is not for travelers with a fear of heights. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderBut the same can't be said for Crown's Edge, one of the ship's most distinctive amenities.Travelers must don a bulky jumpsuit and harness before they face their fear of heights at the thrilling agility course.The half-walking, half-ziplining route, which leaves its sweaty-palmed participants dangling 154 feet above the ocean, could be completed in a minute or so.That's $49 down the drain in one minute.And why stop there when you can splurge during port days too?Royal Caribbean has invested $350 million into Perfect Day at CocoCay. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderIcon of the Seas will dock at Royal Caribbean's Perfect Day at CocoCay private island for all 2024 sailings.As expected, the Caribbean getaway is full of upcharged activities.Travelers with young children might want to drop $100 per head for an afternoon at the waterpark.Royal Caribbean launched Hideaway Beach, the new adult-only section of its private island, Perfect Day at CocoCay, in January. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderMeanwhile, those without kids can pay between $39 to $89 per person for a boozy day at the adult-only Hideaway Beach.Nearby, the more exclusive beach club could be almost triple that cost.A weeklong trip on the new world's largest cruise ship could quickly become an ultra-luxurious vacation.Amenities like the six-slide waterpark are complimentary. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderBut even travelers looking to spend modestly might be shocked by the new ship's prices.Jason Liberty, president and CEO of Royal Caribbean Group, told investors in 2023 that Icon's inaugural season had commanded more bookings at ""materially higher rates"" than any of its previous ship launches.Patrick Scholes, a lodging and leisure research analyst at Truist Securities, told BI in late 2023 that new cruise liners generally command a 20% to 50% pricing premium.Icon of the Seas is sailing out of Miami throughout 2024. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderThree months before Icon of the Seas' launch, he estimated the new vessel was priced at a premium of ""at least 50% if not more.""At the time, the least expensive 2024 itinerary had started at $1,820 per person for an interior cabin.Pricing has since increased by $17. That's $262 per person, per day, for a windowless stateroom.And no, it doesn't come with access to the Suite Neighborhood.

      Key Takeaways    



        Millions of tourists are expected to boost economies in Texas and New York during the eclipse.
      


        Hotels, an eyeglasses manufacturer, and even skydiving companies are preparing for increased business.
      


        One study predicts that the eclipse could benefit the US economy by nearly $1.6 billion.
      



















NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio
A map shows where the moon's shadow will cross the US during the April 8 total solar eclipse.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. As millions of Americans get ready to watch the total solar eclipse on Monday — an event NASA has described as rare and ""spectacular"" — the phenomenon also stands to lift local economies.Various industries are poised to benefit from the millions of tourists flocking to cities in Texas, Ohio, and New York, which are on the eclipse's ""path of totality"" and offer the best views of the ring around the sun.



According to NASA, this year's eclipse is set to last three to four minutes, longer than the last solar eclipse in 2017. People who miss this one will not be able to see another in the contiguous US until 2044 or 2045, the agency said.Up to 3.7 million people are slated to travel to the path of the eclipse, joining the 31 million people already living along the stretch, according to predictions by eclipse-tracking website Great American Eclipse.


Visitors are expected to spend big: They'll shell out up to $1.6 billion on lodging, activities, food, and gas, Texas-based economic consultancy Perryman Group estimates.Here are some of the industries seeing big boosts from Monday's eclipse.Hotels and Airbnbs book outThe budget hotel chain Super 8 has over 300 locations within the path of totality, per the New York Times. About 100 of these hotels are sold out for Sunday or Monday, according to the hotel chain's website.One two-star Super 8 branch in Grayville, Illinois, is advertising rooms between $765 and $949 from Sunday through Tuesday. On most days, the rooms typically cost $80, the Super 8 website shows.


Higher-end hotels are also seeing similar spikes. A JW Marriott in Dallas listed a standard room for $1,039 for Sunday night. It typically costs between $355 and $482, the website said.Visitors are flocking to Airbnbs, too. As of March 25, occupancy rates for April 7 soared to 88% across 110,000 active listings on the path of totality, according to vacation-rental data company AirDNA.The biggest glasses manufacturer has sold outPeople can permanently damage their eyesight by looking straight into the sun during an eclipse, so NASA recommends specific solar-filtering glasses.Former President Donald Trump looked up at the solar eclipse without glasses during the last eclipse. Jabin Botsford for The Washington Post via Getty ImagesThe eye-protection guidelines translated into huge sales for some glasses manufacturers.Tennessee-based American Paper Optics, the country's largest producer of protective eclipse eyeglasses, has seen a big jump in sales, compared to the last total eclipse in 2017.The company started taking eclipse orders two years in advance, John Jerit, the company's founder, told NPR on Friday. The glasses sold for $1.50 to $2 a piece.


""We've shipped already about 70 million glasses, and I suspect I'm going to approach right at 75 million by the time next week comes,"" Jerit said.American Paper Optics sold out of glasses this year, after producing about 30 million more glasses than it did for the total solar eclipse in 2017, according to a sales figure on the company's site.Eclipse skydiving attracts thrill-seekersSome adrenaline junkies seeking a novel vantage point are planning to jump during totality to enjoy the darkness from the sky.A group of 30 skydivers plans to jump in northern New York on Monday, Fox News reported. Tickets for the dive, hosted by local company Skydive the Falls, sold out in seven minutes after they went live in January.


""We're going to jump one minute prior to totality, so we can enjoy totality in full under our parachutes,"" Jason Berger, the co-owner of Skydive the Falls, told Fox News.A similar event in Dallas sold out its $249 eclipse skydive tickets, too.For sun observers on the ground, restaurants are making the most of the celestial phenomenon with eclipse menus and specials. Establishments like Smoothie King, Applebees, and Sonic are offering special eclipse-themed smoothies, margaritas, and ""blackout"" drinks to mark the occasion.

9,Billionaires Are Getting Ready for Summer With Wildly Spectacular Superyachts,"Apr 2, 2024",Madeline Berg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/billionaires-and-their-superyachts-are-ready-for-summer/472036,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. For many wealthy boat owners, a private spa is a must-have on board. A sauna is a nice touch. A Jet Ski or two makes days at sea way more fun. And if you don't have someone on board who can whip up a Michelin-star-worthy meal, you might as well stay on land.In the world of massive yachts, there's no such thing as too much. After all, if someone spends eight or nine figures to design the vessel of their dreams — or at least $500,000 a week to charter one — more is more.



""Yachting. It's not rational; it's emotional,"" Ralph Dazert, the head of intelligence at SuperYacht Times, told Business Insider at the Palm Beach International Boat Show, where dozens of superyachts — often defined as vessels over 30 meters in length — were on display.And while there are certain classic features, such as jacuzzis and bars, what superyacht owners want is evolving, insiders at the show said. That might mean more crew members, more space for helicopters, or more water toys, but might also include manicure salons and putting greens.


The massage room aboard the Talisman C, a $60 million superyacht for sale at the Palm Beach show. Courtesy of Burgess Yachts via BI""The bar of what is the baseline expectation has increased exponentially just over the last four or five years,"" Anders Kurtén, the CEO of brokerage Fraser Yachts, said. Clients are ""spending more time on the boat and really wanting to extend the lifestyle they lead on the shore.""A lot of this can be chalked up to the pandemic. Superyacht purchases and charters spiked as life and luxury travel on land screeched to a halt. While the market has moderated slightly, the number of superyachts on order — 1,166 as of September, according to Boat International's Global Order Book — is still above pre-pandemic norms.


""What the pandemic really showed is that the appetite for being out there at sea, sort of living the marine lifestyle, is still as valid as ever,"" Kurtén said.That means there's a lot of money on the water. The total value of the 203 superyachts over 30 meters delivered last year was $6.4 billion, according to data from SuperYacht Times. New custom builds from the world's most prestigious shipyards — Lurssen, Feadship, Oceanco, Benetti — can run into the hundreds of millions. Even used superyachts at the Palm Beach show cost as much as $75 million.And it's not just traditional buyers like retired wealthy couples looking for a place to relax or celebrities looking for a place to party away from the paparazzi. New clients are often younger and have families, so want areas to work and watch movies. They also want pricey water toys, access to fitness equipment, or even pizza ovens for picky eaters.The gym aboard the Nero superyacht has 360-degree views of the water and a number of cardio and weight machines. Courtesy of Burgess Yachts via BI""This would've never happened in the nineties,"" said Giovanna Vitelli, the vice president of the Azimut Benetti Group, the world's biggest producer of superyachts. ""You would go with your beautiful woman, Champagne — the idea of yachting was much more showing off with your jacuzzi and things like that.""Pure opulence has made room for function.When Benetti's Nabila set sail in 1980, its 50-person crew, gold-and-diamond-encrusted interiors, and lavish parties captured headlines and even inspired the Queen song ""Kashoggi's Ship.""(Seven years later, Donald Trump bought Nabila for $30 million, renaming her the Trump Princess.)""Life on board was considered very formal — big formal dining rooms, boats were high on the water, you would be segregated from the rest of the world,"" Vitelli said, remembering another client who insisted on a replica of the Sistine Chapel above the dining table.


The Nabila yacht, which launched in 1980, was emblematic of a more opulent era of superyachting. Courtesy of Azimut Benetti Group via BIBut the ostentatious, palatial-like interiors that used to be highlighted in yacht brochures have made way for lists of more functional features.Rather than esoteric novelties like an extra-large safe for rifles that one builder had to construct per a Russian yacht owner's request, the superyachts on display at the Palm Beach show featured basketball courts, saunas, and ice baths.


Owners want elevators and luxury gyms. Pampering options, be it a massage room, manicure station, or a professional-grade facial machine, are a dime a dozen. Some bathrooms have fancy Toto toilets, which can cost around $20,000.Sterns (that's the back of the boat) used to be built high to guard guests' privacy. Now, they're built as ""beach clubs"" — an open swim platform.The roomy bathroom of the Triumph, which costs $650,000 per week to charter, includes a steam room. Courtesy of Breed Media via BI


And what good is a massage room if no one on board can give one? Many superyachts can hold twice as many crew members as guests, if not more. One broker, representing a boat that didn't have a masseuse, said it could be quite a ""tricky"" issue because if a charter wants one, they have to find someone who can massage guests and ""pull their weight with the crew.""""It's not uncommon to look for a deckhand who can also mix a martini, play an instrument, maybe entertain the guests with singing, and ideally even give a massage,"" Kurtén said.Of course, a crew comes at a cost. Most are considered full-time employees, requiring salaries and benefits like health insurance. Captains, first mates, and chief engineers often make six figures a year. That's without tips; a charter guest will typically spend six figures on gratuities for the crew who worked during a weeklong vacation.


The Grateful, which costs $15.9 million, exemplifies the open feel of today's superyachts — particularly its ""beach club."" Courtesy of the Azimut Benetti GroupFor the superrich, there must be room for toys.It's not just the onboard amenities that count. What's known as ""toys"" in the industry — water slides, eFoils, Jet Skis, and underwater scuba diving jets — are popular, and costs range from merely hundreds of dollars (banana boats) to millions (submersibles, which are still popular despite the recent tragedy).""Tenders and toys, the sky seems to be the limit,"" Kurtén said. ""More is more.""If you can't fit all those toys in the yacht's storage space, you can just use another boat. Jeff Bezos' support yacht is a superyacht in itself, measuring 75 meters and costing tens of millions of dollars. (His main yacht, Koru, cost a reported $500 million.)


Support yachts are also faster, meaning the crew can get to a destination first and set up the Jet Skis, seapools, and the like, Dazert said. ""By the time the owner arrives on the main yacht, everything's set up, and he can go and have fun.""Modeled after J.P. Morgan's yacht, the Nero is available to charter for about $500,000 a week. One of its custom tenders is also pictured. Courtesy of BurgessEven tenders, the smaller vessel that brings guests from the ship to the shore, are getting glow-ups. The Nero, a 90-meter beauty available to charter for about $500,000 a week and modeled after J.P. Morgan's 1930s ship, has custom-built tenders to match the design. The most expensive ones often cost seven figures. Nero has three.


""It used to be a tender was a tender,"" Jeffrey Beneville, who handles yacht insurance at NFP, told BI. ""Now they're called limousine tenders. Think of an incredibly luxurious gondola that's got a hard top so nobody's hair gets mussed when they're being dropped off at the Monaco Yacht Club.""One thing that clearly hasn't changed in superyachting: showing off. If the boat next door at the marina has an indoor-outdoor cinema, it's natural to want one too. Ditto a wine cellar or helipad.""It's a bit of a celebration of your success in life, of wealth,"" Vitelli, whose company is behind the Lana yacht Bill Gates chartered for a birthday party three years ago, said. ""You push it a little more.""And that's a boon for yacht makers and brokers catering to the super-rich.""Our job is to make clients' dreams come true,"" Kurtén said.

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2008, Vaccarella needed a better, practical beach bag — so she decided to create one herself. 
      


        The bags flew off shelves at a local boutique, but disaster struck after she invested her kids' college savings in more pieces. 
      


        Hurricane Sandy ""unexpectedly opened a door,"" leading to donations and increased interest in the bags. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Kim Vaccarella, founder of Bogg Bag, which offers a ""lightweight, durable, washable collection"" of bags and is on track to see $100 million in revenue this year, per the company. Image Credit: Courtesy of Bogg Bag. Kim Vaccarella. Did you have a 9-5 when you started the business? Yes, I spent 26 years in commercial real estate before fully dedicating myself to Bogg in 2018.



When did you start the business, and where did you find the inspiration for it?It seems like a lifetime ago. The idea came to me in 2008, born out of a practical need for a better beach bag. I envisioned the ultimate mom bag: durable and sturdy, with non-collapsing sides, large enough to carry everything we needed and washable at the end of the day. The catalyst was a trip to the Jersey Shore and a serendipitous encounter with EVA material, which I realized was the perfect material for crafting the perfect beach bag.Related: The Remote Side Hustle a 43-Year-Old Musician Works on for 1 Hour a Day Earns Nearly $3,000 a Month: 'All From the Comfort of Home'


What were some of the first steps you took to get Bogg Bag off the ground? How did you come up with the ""Bogg Bag"" name?As a full-time working mom with no experience in bag sales, the leap into launching Bogg Bag was huge. The idea came to me as a necessity, and despite the challenge of stepping into unfamiliar territory, I was determined to give it a go.The goal initially was to patent the Bogg Bag concept and sell the idea, avoiding the complexities of manufacturing. After facing numerous rejections, I realized the only way to see my vision come to life was to do it myself.Naming the bag was simpler than you'd think. Reflecting on water, frogs and lily pads, I played around with words until Bogg stuck. It felt right, signaling a fresh start — Bogg, it's the new bag!You used your kids' college fund to bring the dream to life. What happened next?After our first batch hit a small local boutique, they flew off the shelves. At first, I wondered if it was just friends and family showing support, but I chose to believe it was genuine love for the product. Encouraged, I doubled down and ordered 600 more. Those sold out too. Feeling bold, I invested my kids' college savings into over 1,000 pieces. It was a major moment, unloading a full container in our storage unit's parking lot under the night sky. But as we unpacked, my heart sank — every piece was marred by black streaks, unsellable to the high standards I dreamt of for Bogg.

We found a new purpose for these imperfect bags. The storm had wreaked havoc on our community, so we repurposed the flawed bags as emergency kits filled with essentials for those affected by the storm, distributing them to families in need. It was a heartrending experience, but providing aid gave a new meaning to our efforts.Initially, I thought this marked the end of Bogg's journey. However, about a year later, our Facebook page lit up with messages from those recipients. Beyond their thanks, they wanted more bags — for themselves, for family, as gifts. That overwhelming response reignited my resolve. I knew then that Bogg had to make a comeback.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bogg Bag


What were some of the additional challenges you faced while building your business, and how did you navigate them?After leaving my steady job in 2018, the pressure of succeeding on my own was immense. Having been accustomed to a regular income for 26 years, the shift was daunting. I set an ambitious target: $1 million in sales for 2018. Miraculously, we hit it. Then 2019 began promisingly until Covid brought the world to a standstill. Like everyone, we were in uncharted territory with no playbook on how to adapt.While many brands shifted to online sales — a logical move in such uncertain times — we chose a path less traveled. We stayed in close touch with our retail partners, sharing in their hardships and looking for ways to support them. The Bogg Bag's unique selling point — its washability — unexpectedly became its strength during the pandemic. Hospitals purchased them for healthcare workers, schools for teachers, and stores filled them with goods for contactless pickups and deliveries as Easter approached.This approach may not have been the most profitable in the short term, but it was the right thing to do. Maintaining these relationships was more important than immediate gains. To this day, I'm grateful for the support we were able to provide during those tough times, a sentiment echoed by our partners whenever we meet at trade shows.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? What does total revenue look like now?Even in the early days of 2014 and 2015, we began seeing monthly revenue come in, albeit modest, but steady and growing.

This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Step aside, Hollywood, there's a new nepo baby in town.Joshua Crawford, a 23-year-old who works at a grocery store in LA and recently graduated from college with a degree in marketing, calls himself an ""airline nepo baby."" The son of an employee who has worked for United Airlines for over 30 years, Crawford can fly for free, get upgraded to business class, and book last-minute vacations to destinations like Tokyo.



Crawford shared a glimpse of the travel perks he enjoys in a February 28 TikTok that has over 4.8 million views.Rules for relatives of employees vary from airline to airline. At United Airlines, children of airline employees usually lose their privileges when they turn 26. But that won't apply to Crawford, as he's listed as his father's primary companion.


""I'm very grateful for that,"" he said.Flying on standby isn't as risky as you'd thinkIn 2016, Crawford started to realize how lucky he was when planning a trip to Coachella, the music festival held in the California desert.According to Google Flights, flights to Los Angeles or Palm Springs from New Jersey, where Crawford grew up, can run as much as $450 roundtrip — a price he and his sister didn't have to consider.""We have an aunt that lives in California, so we just stayed at her house,"" he said. ""We were like, 'Wow, all we have to do is pay for the wristband, and we're going to Coachella.'""


Crawford flies for free domestically because he travels on standby, meaning he doesn't have a seat assigned until close to the flight's departure time.Crawford has booked cheap last-minute vacations to Sydney and Paris, thanks to his status as an ""airline nepo baby."" Courtesy of Joshua Crawford via BICrawford said he doesn't always get on the flights he wants. There are times he's had to wait at a gate for a later, emptier flight when previous ones were fully booked.


But Crawford maintains that those situations rarely arise because he's learned to avoid certain routes and major airports during high-peak travel seasons.Instead of flying direct from LA to New York during the December holidays, Crawford usually does a layover in Denver to ensure he gets a seat.""If you learn your route, essentially, you will realize you have a lot of other options,"" he said.It also doesn't hurt that Crawford's dad is privy to handy behind-the-scenes information like how many seats are left open on flights months before departure.


""I'm usually not enlisting on a flight where I have a high chance of being booted off to the next one,"" he said. ""It also really depends on your seniority with the company. My dad's been with United for quite some time now, so I'm definitely a higher priority — and very grateful for my father.""Last-minute jet-setting to destinations like Sydney, Tokyo, and ParisThese days, Crawford takes longer-haul trips — often without much pre-planning. He can book anytime, though he said he isn't given an ""official"" reservation until around a month before travel.Over the past year, Crawford said he's booked last-minute trips to destinations including Japan, Australia, and Europe.Learning the best flight routes has helped Crawford avoid the risks of flying on standby. Courtesy of Joshua Crawford via BI""I went to Australia a couple of months ago by myself,"" he said. ""I did like a little solo trip, and I probably planned that about two weeks before I went.""More recently, Crawford said, he celebrated his birthday with a quick trip to Paris booked just a week before takeoff.Crawford does have to pay taxes when he books flights out of the country. However, they're normally a fraction of the cost of the ticket.""It depends on the country,"" he said. ""For example, I was leaving Japan, and it was like $70 to get back home.""Perks extend to business-class upgradesPaying almost nothing to fly isn't the only benefit Crawford gets as an airline nepo baby.Given how long his father has worked for United, Crawford said he's also a high priority when free upgrades to business class are available.Known as Polaris, the premium cabins feature spacious pods with seats that can be turned into lie-flat beds and amenities like eye serums, facial sprays, and hand creams.


On some occasions, Crawford has received free upgrades to United Airlines Polaris business class cabin. Courtesy of Joshua Crawford via BIAccording to Crawford, the upgrades help alleviate his jet lag.""I flew to Sydney from LA, and that was about a 16-hour flight. There and back, I was in Polaris,"" he said. ""There's such a big difference when you're in that economy middle seat versus when you've got upgraded on your flight.""


As a recent college grad, he said he couldn't afford to fly business class otherwise.""Round-trip prices for business-class tickets for a long-haul flight can range upwards of $15,000,"" Crawford said. ""Coming out of college — as someone who has student debt and is trying to find a job — it's crazy to me. $15,000 — I could do so much with that.""In his TikTok, Crawford also said he breezes past security and immigration when he leaves and reenters the US.Speaking to BI, he said these benefits — Global Entry and TSA PreCheck — weren't ""completely free,"" but he got a discount on the application fee (normally $100) because of his dad's job.

For remote workers seeking a change of scenery, Virgin Voyages may have the answer.The adults-only cruise line, which is owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group, has unveiled the ""Scarlet Summer Season Pass,"" giving cruise-goers a full month (with options available in June, July, August, and September) to sail the Mediterranean aboard the company's Scarlet Lady ship — all while keeping our day job.Related: Richard Branson: Create Something Special, Money Will Follow



""Take a vacation away from your monotonous work-from-home setup, and start taking calls from your private balcony overlooking the Mediterranean Sea,"" the company said in a release. ""With the fastest at-sea internet on the high seas in the [business], it'll be a breeze hopping on your morning video meeting as you feel, well, the literal ocean breeze.""Prices start at $9,900 for two and include laundry service, ""premium"" Wi-FI, a dedicated concierge service, and a $10 daily coffee credit.


Each ship will explore different routes and stop at nine ports (two times each) in select locations on the coast of Spain, France, and Italy. All four voyages will depart from Barcelona, which means U.S. remote workers will need to fly to Europe to begin their journey.""I've never thought of work and play as two different things — it's all just living,"" Branson said in a release. ""We want to give sailors that same opportunity, so we came up with this idea to have them travel the world while working aboard our beautiful ships — though this sounds like a lot more fun than my houseboat.""Related: These Are the Best Cruise Lines of 2023: ReportVirgin said that there are a limited number of rooms available and that interested attendees must fill out a form online and will find out within 72 hours if they've been selected.

19,'My Back Already Hurts': Critics Think Southwest Airlines' Newly Redesigned Seats Are Too 'Thin',"Feb 8, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/southwest-airlines-debuts-new-thin-seats-no-video-screens/469481,"
Southwest Airlines is feeling discomfort after facing social media backlash over its newly redesigned seats.Last week, the airline unveiled in a press release its newly redesigned RECARO seats that include a ""multi-adjustable headrest cushion for enhanced head and neck support"" and aim to provide ""ultimate comfort while maximizing seat width and overall support.""However, customers are skeptical of the comfortability factor and are calling the seats ""thin"" and potentially ""rock hard.""Related: Southwest CEO: Holiday Disaster Won't Happen AgainThe new seats also give passengers a place to store personal electronic devices for in-flight entertainment, which will be needed as photos released by Southwest show there are no video screens on the back of the new seats.



Southwest's new RECARO seats will include a place for passengers to put their personal electronic devices (Southwest Airlines)""Our redesigned cabin interior significantly enhances our inflight Customer experience and will complement the amazing service that our Crews provide,"" said Tony Roach, senior vice president and chief customer officer at Southwest Airlines, in a company release.But customers aren't so sure.In a video that's been viewed over 5.3 million times, a TikToker named Nuha showed a preview of the new cabin.@devotedly.yours Southwest Airlines debuts their new interior and I'm not sure anybody is excited for their smaller and thinner seats #southwest #delta ♬ Spongebob Closing Theme Song Music - Ocean Floor Orchestra""Never in my life did I think I'd see a video from an airline showing us their upgraded interior and it would make me want to book a flight with a completely different airline,"" she tells viewers. ""You made smaller and thinner seats. I'm sure Southwest spent a lot of money on these upgrades but … this has completely backfired.""Naturally, other customers and potential passengers weighed in, even comparing the new seats to ""sitting on a park bench"" while in the air.""My back already hurts,"" one person wrote alongside a crying emoji.""The seats make it look like it would be more comfortable to walk to my destination,"" another joked.Related: Southwest Develops Software Fix to Prevent Travel MeltdownsSouthwest finished 2023 with a net income of $498 million, though it reported a Q4 2023 net loss of $219 million.As of Thursday afternoon, the airline was down just over 13% year over year.

20,An International Airline Is Starting to Weigh Passengers on an 'Anonymous' Basis,"Feb 8, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/airline-to-weigh-passengers-with-carry-on-before-boarding/469469,"
One European airline is taking a controversial approach to ensure its flights have not exceeded the maximum allowed weight.Finnair, which is based out of Finland, announced this week that it would begin weighing passengers and their carry-on luggage in a trial run from now through May for passengers departing from the Helsinki Airport in an attempt to recalculate weight capacities for flights.Passengers can opt-in to be weighed in a ""voluntary and anonymous"" matter, noting that the airline will not collect or share any passenger's personal data nor ask for the name or ticket number of the passengers that volunteer to hit the scale.



Related: Finnair Asks Passengers to Be Weighed Before Flying""We weigh volunteer customers together with their carry-on baggage. In the measurement, we do not ask for personal data, but the total weight of the customer and carry-on baggage, the customer's age, gender, and travel class are recorded in the database,"" said Satu Munnukka, Head of Ground Processes at Finnair, in a company release. ""No information is collected that would allow participants to be identified.""


The airline said that the area where customers are to be weighed will rotate during different departure gates in Helsinki and explained that it would deliver the average weight calculated to Traficom (The Finnish Transport and Communications Agency) during July and September of this year and use the results to help calculate appropriate aircraft balance for 2025 through 2030.The airline first opened a voluntary weighing trial period in 2017, the last time that Finnair was required to report updated data about the average weight of its passengers and their carry-on luggage to the Civil Aviation Authority, which the airline must do every five years.Finnair isn't the first international airline to make such a decision.In August 2023, Korean Air began anonymously weighing passengers in a trial period to collect plane weight data, giving passengers who did not wish to be weighed the option to decline the request by telling an airline staff member.


Air New Zealand did the same from May 2023 through July 2023 on long-haul international routes (including those headed to New York) leaving from Auckland International Airport.""We know stepping on the scales can be daunting. We want to reassure our customers there is no visible display anywhere. No one can see your weight, not even us,"" said Alastair James, Air New Zealand's load control improvement specialist, in a release at the time.Related: One Airline Wants to Know How Much You Weigh. Can You Opt Out?According to a review of standard passenger weight by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in 2023, the average European male passenger weighed about 181.2 pounds while the average European woman weighed around 148.8 pounds. The study also found that male passengers on average take more carry-on luggage than their female counterparts.

21,Visiting Disney Can Be So Complicated That People Are Taking Classes to Get 'a Grip' — But This Simple Mistake Will Derail Even the Best Planners,"Feb 1, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/genie-plus-complicates-disney-visitors-take-classes-to-plan/469123,"
These days, planning a successful trip to Disney is no longer a walk in the park.Increasingly, visitors have to learn new lingo and strategies for optimizing their experiences amid an ever-evolving system at Disney parks, and some of them are even enrolling in classes to make it easier, The Washington Post reported.Related: Disney Is Suddenly and Without Warning Cracking Down on Third-Party Tour Guides, Some of Which Have Operated For Decades and Help Curate Park Experiences for Disabled Visitors



That's what Rob Kayris and his family of six did last year for a trip to Disney they were ""dumping a boatload of money on,"" according to the outlet. They took a class about the new ride reservation system Genie Plus — a paid service that opens up ""Lightning Lanes"" for visitors seeking speedy access to select attractions — not once but twice.""I feel like if you don't know how it works, you're going to waste probably two to three days before you have a grip on what's what,"" Kayris, a copy machine salesman who lives outside Philadelphia, told the Post.


Learning how to navigate a Disney vacation, which recently saw price hikes, can mean even more spending. Although some influencers and bloggers offer their insider tips for free, VIP tours at the parks can range from $450 to $900 an hour depending on the season, per Disney World's site.Genie Plus, introduced in 2021, replaced Disney's free ride reservation system with a cutthroat model that requires park-goers to begin reserving rides at 7 a.m., according to the online forum planDisney, which is run by Disney's team of advice-givers.Related: 'I Listen To You And To Our Guests': Disney Is Bringing Back Free Parking for Disney Orlando Hotel Stays, Plus Other PerksBut it's not just enough to know the rules — other factors, like slow Wifi, can throw a wrench into even the best-laid plans.

23,One in Ten People In this Area Are Small Business Owners. Here Is Why It's Become a Magnet for Entrepreneurs.,"Jan 19, 2024",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-entrepreneurial-spirit-reigns-supreme-in-victoria-canada/470414,"
Victoria, BC, is only a 15-minute plane ride from bustling Vancouver, but it feels like you've entered another universe. With its beautiful gardens, fashionable shops, and mom-and-pop restaurants, the city offers visitors a chilled-out blend of old-world charm and modern-day comforts.This is a place where you can have afternoon tea at the 110-year-old Fairmont Empress Hotel and then escape for hydrotherapy at an outdoor spa in the harbor.Perhaps this is why Greater Victoria has become a go-to spot for entrepreneurs drawn to the Canadian city for its community spirit, quality of life, mild climate (it rains less here than Seattle), and economic opportunities.



""Victoria has long been home to small business owners,"" says Jason MacIsaac, co-owner of Sheringham, a local spirit brand and distillery. ""It's always seemed to embrace creativity and the encouragement of growth.""According to government statistics, small businesses account for 98% of all businesses in British Columbia. That means 1 in 10 British Columbians are entrepreneurs of some kind in a province with 5.2 million people.


Visitors to the area are the beneficiaries of all this entrepreneurial ingenuity, enjoying quality products and services unique to the area.Next time you find yourself in the area, here are some independently-owned businesses to check out.Sea Cider Farm & CiderhousePhoto by Alexia Foster


This 10-acre farm grows over 50 varieties of certified organic heritage apples used to make delicious ciders with names like RumRunner (which tastes like rum) and Bramble Bubbly (which tastes like a spiked fruit bowl).Since buying the property in 2002, Sea Cider founder Kristen Needham has worn every hat in the business, from tree pruner and apple picker to yeast whisperer and lab technician. After five years of preparation, she sold cider to her first customer in 2007.""I continue to be fascinated by the alchemy of crafting cider and am grateful for the collegiality of the cider industry,"" says Needham. ""I love that my job allows me to build community through cider.""Visitors to the Ciderhouse can sample a flight of ciders while feasting on an Artisan lunch plate filled with local ingredients. Complimentary tours of the orchard and cider-making process are also offered.

It was founded in 1957 by entrepreneur Paul Artsen as Paul's Motor Inn—a hot spot for the Rat Pack when they were passing through town. Paul married his bookkeeper, Artie, and together, they developed the property to become the Inn at Laurel Point. After Paul died in 1997, Artie ran the business until she was 94.With 200 water-view rooms, guests are guaranteed a panoramic glimpse at the harbor, brimming with whale-watching boats and seaplanes.The hotel recently opened the Aura, which blends Japanese and European flavors with fresh, local ingredients from Vancouver Island.For more information, visit LaurelPoint.comIthaka Greek Restaurant     View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Ithaka Greek Restaurant (@ithakagreek)When he was a kid, Dimitri Adamopoulos remembers watching his mother, Maria, wait tables at a local Greek restaurant called Millos.

Later, he would work as a busboy, learning the ins and outs of restaurant work.Now, Adamopoulos owns the restaurant where Millos once stood. He renamed it Ithaka, and his mom still works there, making dishes with recipes passed on through generations.

24,'They Are Broke or Homeless': 3-Year Cruise Passengers Yet to Receive Refunds Are Pursuing Fraud Charges,"Jan 17, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/life-at-seas-3-year-cruise-passengers-pursue-fraud-charges/468451,"
After the abrupt cancellation of Life at Sea's three-year cruise in November, more than 100 passengers are still awaiting refunds from Miray, the Turkish cruise company behind the venture.Now, they're seeking fraud charges — and navigating dire financial straits, The New York Times reported.Related: People Sold Their Homes to Board a 'Never-Ending' Cruise Around the World. But the Ship Will Never Set Sail — Here's How the Big Dream Sank.



On Tuesday, 78 intended Life at Sea cruise passengers sent a letter to Markenzy Lapointe, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, requesting an investigation into Miray. They allege the company pocketed an estimated $16 million to purchase a new ship it failed to obtain.At the time of cancellation, Life at Sea admitted that the delays and relocations were due to its failure to purchase the AIDAaura from AIDA Cruises, and promised to disburse refunds in monthly installments from mid-December through late February, CNN reported.


Many passengers had to relinquish jobs, liquidate assets and drain life savings to afford what was pitched as the odyssey of a lifetime. Most paid tens of thousands of dollars to reserve their cabins, priced from $90,000 to $975,000 for a suite. But as deadlines for repayments came and went for over a month, only four passengers received partial refunds, per the NYT.""Some people put in everything they had and now they are broke or homeless or wandering from cruise to cruise like tumbleweeds because they have no other place to go,"" David Purcell, a 78-year-old retired lawyer from St. Louis, who sold his house and car to book the trip, told the outlet.Related: I Sold My House to Work Remotely on a Cruise Ship for 3 Years — and I May Stay Aboard Even Longer. Here's What My Life Will Look Like.Miray's ownership's narrative differs, attributing the refund delays to bank blockades resulting from a slew of credit card chargeback disputes. However, many passengers refute this, per the report, claiming that their chargeback requests were a last resort after repeated refund disappointments.

25,S&P 500 Companies Spent $65 Million on This Ultra-Luxe Executive Perk in 2022 — Fueling Concerns That Shareholders Are No Longer the Priority,"Jan 16, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/sp-500-companies-spend-65m-on-executives-personal-flights/468390,"
Despite increasing attention on corporate accountability and fiscal responsibility, one executive indulgence has taken off with renewed vigor in recent years: personal travel aboard the company jet.In 2022, S&P 500 companies collectively disbursed a staggering $65 million for the perk — a substantial 50% leap compared to the pre-pandemic era three years before, The Wall Street Journal reported.Related: These Are the Most Hated Airlines in the U.S., According to a New Report



Executive data firm Equilar pinpointed a 14% surge in the number of companies embracing personal travel on company jets since 2019, boosting the tally to 216 in 2022, with the number of executives benefiting from the luxury soaring by 25% to 427.While advocates of the perk contend flying private can be safer and more efficient for certain executives, critics are quick to point out the symbolic excess it represents, raising concerns about the eagerness of corporate boards to please their C-suite executives at the expense of shareholder interests.


In 2019, chief executives from the Business Roundtable, including the leaders of Apple and JPMorgan Chase, argued that shareholder value is no longer ""the purpose of a corporation"" and instead emphasized the importance of other factors such as investing in employees, The New York Times reported.Related: Founders' Salaries Are Shockingly Humble, New Report FindsMeta Platforms is one of the biggest spenders on private employee travel; the company funneled $6.6 million into personal flights for CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his former second-in-command, Sheryl Sandberg, in 2022 — up 55% over 2019, per WSJ.And the tech giant's not alone. Casino company Las Vegas Sands spent in excess of $3.2 million on four executives' personal flights, more than twice its annual spend in any year since 2015, and energy conglomerate Exelon spent three times as much on the luxury as it did in 2019, according to the outlet.

26,5 Business Travel Tips for CEOs and Leaders,"Jan 15, 2024",Kimberly Zhang,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-business-travel-tips-for-ceos/468351,"
For numerous businesses, travel plays a critical role. Despite the rise of technology and the prevalence of virtual meetings which aim to bridge distances, there are instances where only in-person meetings can effectively achieve certain objectives. Many executives often view this as an obligatory burden, given its high cost, time commitment, and potential for inducing frustration. Here are five business travel tips for CEOs and leaders.Establish a Definite Schedule and PlanCreating a detailed itinerary is essential if you plan a business trip with a valid reason. This step can help you avoid unnecessary issues that may result in more than just monetary loss. The absence of a well-defined itinerary might lead to delays, causing you to be late for your meeting, potentially losing a crucial business deal.Related: 6 Ways to Make Your Next Business Trip More Productive



Consider booking with the travel booking websites to ensure you adhere strictly to your schedule. Additionally, having a backup plan is advisable if there are any hitches with your lodging or if there's a sudden rescheduling from the other party.Dress the PartIt's essential to project a professional and traditional image in your appearance. No matter how relaxed your company's atmosphere may be, it's crucial to dress formally for client interactions. If you appear in casual attire for a meeting, your clients may not regard you with seriousness. However, when traveling, business casual clothing is suitable. A single outfit can be adequate for a one-day journey, but multiple outfits will be necessary for prolonged trips.


Always Prioritize SafetyPutting health and safety first, as well as planning for potential emergencies, will be beneficial in your new environment. Identifying all possible exit routes, protecting your personal items, and being mindful of what you eat can increase your sense of control and comfort during your travels.Related: 4 Tips for Affordably Mixing Pleasure Into Your Next Business TripTaking these precautions essentially combines several business travel tips into one. It's advisable to check the weather predictions before setting off on your journey, familiarize yourself with airport storm shelters, and stay alert to and rehearse evacuation procedures at your hotel and meeting venues.Carry Just What's EssentialThe belongings you take with you can either enhance your comfort and ease of movement, or hinder it. If you plan a five-day visit to Paris, ensure you have additional luggage room for relaxed attire and gadgets like your laptop.


Conversely, if you're heading out of town for a potential weekend gathering, it's advisable to pack lightly. Although being prepared is beneficial, overpacking can lead to unnecessary complications throughout your journey.Take Pleasure in the Small DetailsIt's unrealistic to maintain a serious demeanor throughout your entire business trip. This is a chance for you to step away from the confines of your workspace and explore the broader world. Once your scheduled tasks are completed, immerse yourself in the local culture as much as possible by trying out local cuisines and indulging in self-care.Procure souvenirs from local stores and engage in dialogue with the residents. Be open to all experiences across your path, and you may return with more than just business contracts and investment arrangements.EndnoteThese pointers should ideally improve your next travel experience when it's time to take a trip again. Bear in mind, regardless of the extent of your planning and preparation, it's impossible to prepare for every eventuality, so be resilient and handle unexpected situations as they occur.

      Key Takeaways    



        The billionaire Mark Cuban bought the ghost town of Mustang, Texas, in 2021 for about $2 million.
      


        Cuban has never been there and said he has ""zero plans for it"" in an email.
      


        I drove to visit Mustang, population zero. I found no buildings but an intriguing history.
      



















Alcynna Lloyd/Business Insider
A street sign pointing toward Mustang and its neighboring town, Angus.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. I recently learned that Mark Cuban, the billionaire and former owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA team, bought an entire ""ghost town'"" called Mustang for about $2 million in 2021.Mustang is about an hour away from the part of Dallas I live in. But until now, I had never come across it — and almost nobody in my circles had, either.The Census reports that Mustang's population is zero, so maybe that makes sense.Typically, I would file away this newfound knowledge in the recesses of my mind — an unusual story I could later impress my friends with over coffee or dinner.



But my curiosity refused to wane.Numerous questions crowded my thoughts: Why would someone be interested in buying a town without people? Is it genuinely abandoned? What might be worth saving there?I even reached out to Cuban by email to get some answers. He had little to say about it.""I bought it to help out a basketball buddy who was dying of cancer, he needed it for his family,"" Cuban, who Forbes said has a $6.2 billion net worth, told me. ""I have zero plans for it, I haven't ever been there.""


I did some reading. NBC News, who spoke with Mike Turner, a real-estate agent who brokered the deal, said that Cuban bought Mustang from the principal owner, Marty Price, a Dallas attorney and a devoted Mavericks season-ticket holder. The New York Times reported the reason: Price, who died in August 2021, apparently didn't want to leave his wife and children a hard-to-maintain ghost town.I wanted to know more, but Turner didn't call me back.In such moments, a saying often comes to mind, ""The cure for ignorance is curiosity.""So I went to Mustang. Yes, I hopped into my car, opened up Google Maps, and drove from my downtown Dallas apartment to a remote town that wasn't even on my radar until last week.


Here's what I found.Mustang is approximately an hour's drive south of Dallas, a major city packed with buildings — even its suburbs are dense. But Mustang is surrounded by roads with no buildings.A back road in Angus, the town that neighbors Mustang. Alcynna Lloyd/Business InsiderIn rural Texas, you often see large, open pastures with cows and horses. When I got close to Mustang, I wasn't surprised to see cattle ranches lining the roads.Cows graze on some of the undeveloped land near Mustang. Alcynna Lloyd/Business InsiderAs I exited Interstate 45 and neared Mustang, I was excited to see a highway sign pointing toward the town. I thought I must be close.Highway sign for Mustang and Angus. Alcynna Lloyd/Business InsiderThe excitement turned to confusion as I drove around for 30 minutes. I couldn't pinpoint where Mustang and the adjacent town, Angus, began. Angus has 458 people, while, according to the most recent Census, Mustang has zero.Google Maps screenshot of Mustang and Angus. Google MapsSource: US Census BureauI tried driving down the few roads Google Maps has marked. They were unpaved, and I saw knocked-down signs and warnings to stay away. I saw a few houses, but no people.This sign felt like a metaphor for my quest. Alcynna Lloyd/Business Insider


Feeling frustrated, I asked a man working on the side of the road for directions to Mustang. He also had no idea but recommended checking out Stuckey's, a longtime gas station and convenience store in Angus. But even the store's clerk hadn't heard of Mustang.Stuckey's, a gas station in Angus. Alcynna Lloyd/Business Insider I next approached the cashier at a grocery store in Angus, who was aware of Mustang. Victory! But all she could tell me was that it was deserted, with its most notable features being a now-demolished strip club and a fire station.The grocery store in Angus where I asked for directions. Alcynna Lloyd/Business InsiderAt this point, I was desperate. I showed up at Angus' city hall unannounced. Government officials would have answers, right?Angus' fire station and city hall are in the same building. Alcynna Lloyd/Business InsiderAt the city hall, I met Trina Kelley, a secretary who did not share her age — and refused to let me take her picture — but said she has lived in Angus since she was 9 years old.The sign in front of Angus' city hall.

This photo is from 2006. LM Otero/Associated PressIn 2006, the Associated Press described Mustang as ""carved from a pasture in 1973 to sell alcohol so a beer run was no longer a 60-mile drive to Dallas."" The town was ""broke, withering and down to about 50 residents,"" the AP reported.Kelley said that the two cities became independent entities a few days after the disannexation.A photo of Aubrey Smith, the mayor of Angus during Mustang's disannexation. Alcynna Lloyd/Business InsiderThe 2006 Associated Press story described Mustang as having ""two dusty streets, a strip club, a boarded-up country western bar, one trash bin and a dilapidated trailer park where the entire population lives."" It also had a shed for Mustang's volunteer fire department, the Dallas Morning News reported.News reports say that pretty much everything has since been razed.I couldn't find the strip club, Wispers Cabaret, which the Independent reported closed after ""a 2008 murder in which a clubgoer was beaten to death that made headlines across the state.""


Kelley said Mustang has remained desolate for many years, never truly sustaining a substantial number of residents or buildings.Mustang has been on the market multiple times in its history.

29,"I Went on a $4,800 Ultra-Luxury Cruise. This Is What Makes That Price Worth It.","Jan 5, 2024",Brittany Chang,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/i-tried-regent-seven-seas-cruises-new-luxury-ship-photos/467922,"
My favorite part of Regent Seven Seas Cruises' newest ultra-luxury Grandeur ship wasn't its large cabins with walk-in closets, peaceful pool deck, or even the chandelier-lined lounge.Instead, it was a feature offered across the brand's entire fleet — all-inclusivity.After spending three nights on the Seven Seas Grandeur, I now understand why this alone could make the ship worth its expensive starting 2024 fare of $4,800 per person.



Most people probably won't pay nearly $5,000 for the average weeklong cruise.The pool on the Seven Seas Grandeur was surrounded by two decks of lounge chairs. Brittany Chang/Business Insider via BI


A nearly $5,000 cruise is expensive — but when you compare that to the typical cruise, you have to consider that most operators use a different pricing model from Regent Seven Seas Cruises, which is owned by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings.Some other cruise lines often mimic that of budget airlines: Charge a cheap base cruise fare and pile on opportunities to upsell through food, beverage, and entertainment.However, luxury cruise lines like Regent Seven Seas take the opposite approach by going ""all-inclusive.""All of the cabins have private balconies. Brittany Chang/Business Insider via BIAnd unlike competitors like Explora Journeys, Regent Seven Seas is truly all-inclusive.The fare includes roundtrip flights to and from the ship (business class if it's an intercontinental journey), a one-night pre-cruise hotel stay, transportation between the airport and ship, and excursions.After sailing on the Seven Seas Grandeur's three-night ""christening"" sailing, it's easy to understand why wealthy travelers pay more for this luxurious and convenient option.Nighttime programming includes a DJ in the Grandeur Lounge. Brittany Chang/Business Insider


Regent Seven Seas comped my stay on this non-revenue sailing attended by other journalists, travel agents, and the cruise line and its parent company's employees.I organized my own flight there and back, which was a logistical headache when booked according to the embarkation and debarkation times — an issue traditional guests wouldn't have with this all-inclusive model.Regent practically plans its guests' vacations door-to-door, not including transfers between the travelers' homes and their origin airports.The Sports Deck has a putting green. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderLike any all-inclusive resort, food, beverages, and onboard amenities are also included.No need to pull out your wallet during your time at sea (unless you want a more expensive bottle of wine, a special paid excursion, or a spa treatment).Guests receive a welcome bottle of champagne. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderUnlike sailings with mass-market operators like Royal Caribbean, none of the menus I saw had the elusive additional dollar signs next to more premium dishes.


Instead, no matter where or what I ate or drank, I knew I wouldn't have to pay extra — even if I ordered filet mignon or lobster.The beef tenderloin at French-inspired Chartreuse was topped with luxuries like seared foie gras. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderAs someone who eats to live and lives to eat, the all-inclusive food was the best part of the luxury cruise.No more roast beef that's been drying out for hours — the restaurants aboard the Grandeur, of which there are five, served up options like escargot, duck, and fish and steak tartare.Pan-Asian Pacific Rim serves up options like vegetarian pad thai and fried lobster. Brittany Chang/Business Insider""Girl math"" would decree that these all-inclusive meals are basically free.There was black truffle, sturgeon caviar, and foie gras on almost every menu, all without the dreaded supplementary fee.Chartreuse served dishes like beef tartare with sturgeon caviar. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderIt turns out there is such a thing as ""too much caviar"" — I, a greedy diner, was tired of it by the second day.At the one-day themed Italian lunch buffet, cured meats, cheeses, raw oysters, and freshly prepared tuna lined the open-air counters.The poolside buffet had an afternoon ""Italian Buffet"" with several seafood options. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderUnsurprisingly, it was the best cruise ship buffet I've ever gorged on (even better because it felt financially guilt-free with no extra charges).


Travelers who drink will be pleased to hear that the wine, beer, and cocktails flowed as freely as the buffet food.Waitstaff shuttled drinks from the bar to guests lounging by the pool. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderEvery bar was an open bar, and empty wine glasses at the dinner table were a rare sight throughout my three nights at sea.Even the café's snacks, coffee, and espresso-based drinks were included.Coffee Connection served various espresso-based brinks and light bites. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderAnd so were the beverages in the guests' cabins.""All-inclusive"" also entails access to the Grandeur's spa facilities.Access to spa facilities like the sauna and cold room are included in the fare. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderThis includes the sauna, cold room, aromatherapy room, and a small room with various water jet settings.However, the latter was confusingly ineffective, and the cold room wasn't truly that cold.I avoid paying for extra supplements and packages when I cruise for work.The new ship has 503 chandeliers, including one in its atrium. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderIn the past, this has limited my dining options. To save money, I've even passed on shore excursions.But for the first time, I didn't have to think twice about my budget aboard the Seven Seas Grandeur: There was nothing for me to spend cash on.Afternoon tea included a sizable dessert spread. Brittany Chang/Business InsiderEven smaller fees like gratuities, WiFi, and laundry are included in the fare.

30,"These Are the Most — and Least — On-Time Airlines of 2023, According to a New Report","Jan 3, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/delta-most-on-time-airline-air-canada-least-2023-report/467835,"
These days, air travel can feel more chaotic than ever before, between exorbitant prices, lengthy waits, unruly passengers, and more.Sometimes, people can regain control of their airport experience with travel hacks, like bringing a collapsible water bottle to save on expensive purchases and veering right at TSA when most passengers go left.Related: These Are the Most Hated Airlines in the U.S., According to a New Report



But, generally speaking, the on-time arrival and departure of the aircraft itself is completely out of their hands — left up to the airport or carrier to navigate.And it's not always smooth: In July 2023, ticket-selling airlines reported an on-time arrival rate of 69.6%, decreasing from both the rate of 71.3% in June 2023 and the rate of 74.9% in July 2022, per the Bureau of Transportation.


But which ones do the best job? Aviation analytics firm Cirium examined more than 600 real-time information sources spanning airlines, airports, global distribution systems, civil aviation authorities, and more to find out.Related: These Are the Top 10 'Mega Airports' in North America, According to a New ReportCirium defines an ""on-time"" flight as one that arrives within 15 minutes of the scheduled gate arrival and an ""on-time"" departure as one that leaves within 15 minutes of the scheduled takeoff.According to the report, Delta clinched the top spot for the most on-time airline in North America and took the Cirium Platinum Award, which honors a ""commitment to operational performance and minimizing passenger disruption,"" for the third year in a row.

32,A Travel Hack Beloved By Airline Passengers Nationwide Is On Its Way Out,"Dec 28, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/american-jetblue-among-carriers-rewarding-spend-over-miles/467678,"
The once-fervent annual practice known as the mileage run, where travel enthusiasts strategically fly to accrue airline miles for elite status before the year's end, might not be around much longer.For years, those mileage runs allowed air travelers to secure elite status for the next year and unlock practical benefits such as seat upgrades, lounge access and priority services. But now that's changing.As 2023 draws to a close, many major airlines have shifted their loyalty programs to value dollars spent over distance flown, effectively altering the landscape of travel hacking, The Wall Street Journal reported.



Related: Business Travelers: Is Loyalty Dead?American and JetBlue exclusively reward customer spending, per the outlet. And while United and Southwest still record the number of flights a customer takes, both primarily consider dollars spent for rewards.


At United, the fastest way to earn elite status is to buy more expensive tickets — and use the airline's credit cards, NerdWallet reported.Delta Air Lines, once a holdout in the shift, faced backlash after it amended its SkyMiles program earlier this year, but then walked the decision back.Related: 'This Is a Terrible Day': Delta, American Express Limiting Access to Sky Clubs, Customers Lament 'Brutal' and 'Outrageous' Changes""No question, we probably went too far in doing that,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said at an event at the Rotary Club of Atlanta in September.

BewWanchai via Business Insider
Daniel George has lived in hotels full time with his partner for the past three years.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. My wife and I have been digital nomads living in hotels for three years while working remotely.We've traveled to 25 countries, have spent less than we did living in San Francisco and New York, and haven't changed our bedsheets or taken out the trash in years.



My partner and I are computer scientists working on artificial intelligence applications. I was a vice president and machine-learning scientist at JPMorgan from September 2020 to August 2023. Before that, I'd been at Google's X as an AI research scientist since 2018. We started working remotely in early 2020 because of the pandemic.The swap to remote work allowed us to travelHalfway through 2020, we moved from San Francisco to New York City. By the end of the year, we were tired of being trapped in our apartment and our lease was about to end.


We could work from anywhere, so we began traveling around the US in early 2021. We thought we'd travel for a few months and then settle down in another city apartment. Traveling was more fun and less exhausting than we'd thought, and we started booking international trips.Over the past three years, we have traveled all over the US, as well as to England, Scotland, Italy, France, Netherlands, Greece, Switzerland, Spain, Iceland, Portugal, Mexico, Morocco, Turkey, Colombia, Peru, Dubai, India, Sri Lanka, Iceland, and Japan.By the end of 2022, we missed our friends and coworkers. After nearly two years on the move, we got an apartment with a rolling lease in New York. We were bored within two months and set off again.Booking a hotel and flight every few weeks was our new normal. After years on the move, we no longer found travel stressful. The plan is to keep traveling before we start a family.


We work New York hours while travelingWe work New York hours during weekdays and explore the cities on weekends and in the evenings or mornings, depending on the time zone. We travel or move hotels only during weekends or holidays.In places such as Europe and Morocco, we work from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. Places in Latin America, including Mexico, are pretty much in the same time zone as New York.If we choose somewhere with an extreme time-zone difference, such as Japan, we use our vacation days for those trips. When we went to Japan, we took three weeks of vacation because we would have had to start working in the middle of the night.We had issues in the beginning with WiFi at Airbnbs. One of the reasons we decided to stay at large hotel brands — besides credit card points — was that they had better facilities for work.


We don't plan more than booking a one-way flightWe don't plan our trips. We just snap up the best deals we can get for business-class flights using points. We then choose the places we're interested in visiting, book one-way tickets and a hotel for the first couple of weeks, and go from there. We spend two to three weeks in each place so we can enjoy our surroundings.We return to the US once a year, from Thanksgiving to the Christmas holidays.We have member status at Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, and IHG. There's usually at least one of these hotel chains in every city we've visited. If not, we use Booking.com or Airbnb.Costs of living in a hotel versus renting full-timeBefore we started traveling constantly, we spent about $36,000 on rent a year — $1,500 a month per person. I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area from 2018 to mid-2020 and New York City until early 2021. We would spend about $200 on utilities each month. On top of rent, we'd have to pay for hotels when we went on vacation.


Staying in hotels has cost us on average less than $150 a night over the past three years. In expensive cities, we sometimes pay up to $300, while in cheaper cities, it could be less than $100 a night.The average expenses per person a month work out to roughly $1,500 for hotel fees, $1,000 for food, and about $420 for things such as Uber rides, shopping, phone bills, and tours.The food costs and other expenses are similar to what we spent before we started traveling. Neither of us cooked, so we used to eat out or order Uber Eats a lot.We've earned the highest-tier hotel statuses with Marriott, Hyatt, and Hilton. We get free upgrades to luxury suites, free daily breakfast, and access to lounges with snacks and drinks, along with the normal housekeeping, gyms, pools, saunas, and spas. We haven't had to clean rooms, change bedsheets, or take out the trash in years.


In 2022, I spent 333 days abroad and became a nonresident. This meant I wasn't liable to pay capital-gains taxes because I'd been in the US fewer than 31 days that year.Points systems make hotel living cheaperWe earn roughly 16% of our accommodation costs directly from hotel points. For example, because we have a Titanium Marriott membership, we earn 17.5 points for every dollar we spend — each point is worth about $0.01.We also get 6% to 8% back in credit-card points when we book hotels.For example, Amex Green offers triple points, with each point worth $0.02. Marriott credit cards offer six times the points when booking a hotel with each point worth $0.01, and Hyatt credit cards offer four times the points, worth $0.02 each. Rakuten's booking portal offers 3% back in Amex points for every hotel booking made through its site.


These methods add up to roughly 25% back per dollar spent on hotels.Using these points systems, we pay for eight months of hotel fees and get about two months free. We don't have to pay rent for the remaining two months each year since we spend up to four weeks at work conferences and about six weeks visiting our families.Our total cost for accommodation for a year is about $36,000.We maximize credit cards' sign-up bonusesAlso, we earn an extra 100,000 points every couple of months by opening new credit cards. We charge the cost of our hotels on these cards to meet the spending criteria.


We mostly use sign-up points to fly business class on all the long-haul flights or hotel rooms.We earned about 170,000 points after signing up for two Hyatt credit cards with combined annual fees of $300. We redeemed the points for a week's stay at the Andaz Mayakoba hotel in Mexico in a $400-a-night room. We were upgraded to a $700-a-night suite because of our Hyatt Globalist status.Similarly, a 150,000 sign-up bonus from an Amex Platinum Card paid for our business-class flights to Japan, worth over $8,000.We downgrade each card to a free version without annual fees after exactly one year, instead of canceling it, so that it doesn't affect our credit score much.


Even after opening 10 credit cards each in the past three years, we have credit scores above 780. As long as you pay off your entire balance every month, your credit score should increase in the long run.A lot of these credit cards come with free travel insurance.How we manage our home address and taxesOur only legal permanent residential address is my wife's parents' home. It's where we spend a month of our year during the holidays, store some of our belongings, and have our mail and bills sent.We don't stay anywhere longer than a month or two to avoid personal tax liabilities. We get digital-nomad visas when possible, which exempt local taxes. We don't spend enough time in any other US state to establish residency there.


I quit my job to be a founder and continue to travelI left my job at JPMorgan in August to launch an AI startup. I had saved enough to reach financial independence earlier this year.My partner and I will continue to travel while I run this new endeavor.

35,Don't Get Too Comfortable on Your Next Cruise — This Personal Item Could Get You Booted in a Foreign Country and Banned for Life,"Dec 12, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/cruises-passengers-banned-booted-at-ports-for-cannabis-use/466836,"
Passengers who plan to consume cannabis products on their next cruise vacation might hit some turbulent waters.Amid the growing legalization of marijuana in 24 states and Washington D.C., cruise lines remain steadfast in prohibiting cannabis in all its forms — from flower to edibles — on board their ships, aligning with federal law and the cannabis regulations of popular cruise line destinations, The Wall Street Journal reported.Related: Carnival Cruise Line Bans Woman for Life Who Tried to Bring CBD Gummies on Board



Companies such as Carnival Cruise Line are deploying drug-sniffing dogs and issuing repeated pre-voyage warnings to enforce these restrictions, but inconsistent administration has created a climate of fear and confusion among passengers, per the outlet.In August, a Texas woman received a lifetime sailing ban from Carnival for CBD gummies found in her luggage, and in September, a 25-year-old TikTok influencer was asked to disembark in Jamaica after getting caught smoking marijuana. Despite this, online cruise forums buzz with covert strategies for sneaking substances on board.


Royal Caribbean Group, Norwegian, Virgin and Disney Cruise Lines all prohibit CBD products and recreational and medical marijuana, The Miami Herald reported.The stringent policies aren't just about complying with the law; they may also have a financial undertone. Given that alcohol sales are a key profit stream for cruises — which similarly impose restrictions on how much alcohol passengers can carry on — defense lawyers for those charged with possession contend that the cannabis ban conveniently eliminates competition for on-board beverage consumption, per the WSJ.Roughly 62,000 drinks are consumed during a 7-day cruise, which averages 33 drinks per week, or 4.7 alcoholic drinks per day, per passenger — adding up to more than $20 million in revenue annually per ship, according to cruise review site Cruiseline.Related: Carnival Cruise Is Phasing Out a Ship Amenity That's Beloved By Some — and Completely Unknown to Others


However, the cannabis issue resonates beyond legal liabilities to customer experience. Carnival's Chief Communications Officer, Chris Chiames, told the WSJ that state-level legalization has confused passengers, but insists that the main concern is about the safety and satisfaction of all guests.""When a guest cannot enjoy their balcony because neighbors are smoking marijuana, this becomes a customer-service issue,"" he said.

36,'Turn Left at the TSA Line' and 8 Other Travel Hacks That Will Save You Time and Money,"Dec 11, 2023",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/9-travel-hacks-that-will-save-you-time-and-money/466716,"
For even the most frequent traveler, tackling busy air travel can be an exercise in extreme patience and frustration. Having an arsenal of airport and airline flight hacks can be the difference between a smooth and turbulent journey.So we spoke to Megan Gougeon, founder of the Portable Professional, a popular YouTube travel vlog with 102,000 subscribers. Gougeon has taken more than 300 flights and worked remotely from 50 countries, so she knows her way around airports and an airplane.""My videos are all about helping travelers feel confident and capable so they can turn every aspect of their trip, from packing to airport navigation to the flight itself, into an enjoyable and stress-free experience,"" she says.



Here are nine travel hacks to make your next trip cheaper and hassle-free.Related: 6 Secret Tools for Flying First Class (Without Paying Full Price)


1. Turn left at the TSA lineWaiting in long lines to clear security can be a hassle. Some services allow for expedited airport security, such as TSA PreCheck or CLEAR, but they cost money and require you to complete a lengthy application beforehand. Savvy travelers know that another solution to avoid longer lines is to always turn left at the security checkpoint. Why?""Most people are right-handed and tend to veer to the right naturally. This means the left line might be shorter and faster,"" Gougeon explains.2. Don't buy water at the airportAfter clearing security, many thirsty travelers feel compelled to buy bottled water at the airport to manage the dry cabin air — a big mistake. Thanks to a monopoly by certain water companies at airports, the cost of a 20-ounce water bottle can be anywhere from $2.50 to $5.Gougeon suggests bringing a collapsable water bottle and filling it up for free at water fountains after passing through security. Another trick: You can ask the staff at Starbucks or one of the coffee shops to refill your water bottle.


3. Wear layersWhat do you do if your carry-on luggage is too large or heavy to take on the flight? Gougeon recommends wearing heavier items on the flight and then stashing them away in an overhead compartment if you're too warm. Another hack is to pack an extra shopping back in your luggage. Use it to carry additional items you must remove from your bag. Most airlines will let you board with a carry-on, backpack and shopping bag.4. Mark your luggage as ""fragile"" Putting a ""Fragile"" sticker on your luggage encourages baggage handlers to treat it more carefully. ""This might also lead to your bag being placed on top of others, potentially resulting in it being among the first to come out at baggage claim,"" Bougeon says.Related: Boomer Women Are Leaving Their Husbands Behind to Travel Solo — Here's What's Behind the Unprecedented Trend5. No power? No problem.We've all been there. We get to the airport, and our phones or computers cling to 8% battery power. Most airport waiting areas have charging stations with USB charging ports. But what if you forgot to pack a charging cord, or it's in the bag you already checked? Gougeon recommends you head to the airport's lost and found. ""Travelers leave their chargest behind all the time, and they probably have one you can borrow,"" Gougeon says.


6. Don't book an Uber or Lyft from the airport""It's often more expensive to book an Uber or Lyft directly from the airport due to additional airport service charges. Walking a short distance from the airport before booking your ride can help you avoid these fees,"" Gougeon says.7. Check these sites before you travelAccording to Gougeon, you should check several sites before traveling to get the most bang for your buck.SeatGuru offers detailed airplane seating advice specific to the exact plane you are flying on.Sleeping in Airports is excellent for finding airport amenities, gates and the best sleeping spots.Expert Flyer provides real-time notifications on seat availability, which is especially useful for those looking to snag a more comfortable seat or wanting to monitor the availability of flights for potential changes or upgrades.8. The best seats for working and sleepingIf you want to sleep, try a window seat at the back of the plane, Gougeon says. ""It's usually quieter and less crowded there, so you might get more space or even a whole row to yourself. Plus, the window gives you something to lean on."" She recommends picking the side of the plane that matches where you usually rest your head to sleep.If you plan on working during the flight, Gougeon suggests an aisle seat in the middle of the plane. It's smoother flying over the wings, and you can stretch your arms into the aisle to make working on your laptop easier.


9. Get access to airport lounges for cheapMost major airline hubs in the U.S. have airline lounges that offer ample seating, plenty of desk space and free food, coffee and WiFi. Some even had showers and napping spots. However, access to these lounges can cost anywhere from $99 to $499 a year. Some credit cards offer complimentary or discounted lounge access, so double-check yours. Gougeon also suggests ""looking for discounted lounge passes on online marketplaces like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist.""Related: I Tried the Semi-Private Air Carrier That Lets You Arrive 20 Minutes Before Your Flight.

Traveling home for the holidays can be costly for college students, but this year Amazon is making the journey easier by offering flights for just $25.Amazon teamed up with StudentUniverse, a website that helps students find discounted flights, hotels, and car rentals, to offer 3,000 airline tickets exclusive to Prime Student members.Students can snag the $25 tickets on select domestic flights for travel between mid-December and early January by visiting the Prime Student x Student Universe page. The first batch of 1,000 tickets dropped on Tuesday at 6 a.m. PST and already sold out, according to Fox Business.

""As travel costs continue to rise, we're happy to help make flying more affordable for Prime Students who want to spend this important time with family and friends,"" said Amazon Vice President of U.S. Prime and Marketing Tech, Carmen Nestares, in a company announcement.The deal comes after a November 2023 survey from Credit Karma that found that 32% of Gen Z Americans won't be able to travel home for the holidays due to the financial burden of student loan repayments.Meanwhile, 66% of Gen Zers said they would take on debt during the holidays, and one-third say their holiday spending will be used to travel to see family and friends.RELATED: Some Flights Are as Low as $29 Right Now as Airlines Rush to Fill Seats Before the End of the Year

""While the holidays are often considered to be a happy time of the year, they can cause a lot of financial stress to those struggling to make ends meet.""

But a public WiFi network is only one of the gateways for hackers to sneak into your device.Designing a security checklist should be an integral part of your travel planning. You must ensure hackers lurking in the airport can't sneak into your phone and ruin your trip. The tips in this list will help you shut the door in hackers' faces.

With its perfect weather, lush landscape, and excellent food and wine, Santa Barbara has been called ""The American Riviera.""

More recently, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle evacuated their palatial digs in England to set up shop in Montecito, a tony community in Santa Barbara County.But despite its billionaire status, Santa Barbara still possesses a homey, laid-back vibe that seems a million miles away from its bustling neighbor to the south, Los Angeles. Visitors can find a variety of restaurants, shops, culture, and activities at all price points while soaking in the SoCal sun.Ready to explore all the best sights, hotels, and dining options in one perfect day in Santa Barbara? Here's a 24-hour itinerary for your next trip.Related: These Earth-Conscious Entrepreneurs Are Making a Profit with Purpose in California's Central CoastBike the BeachNo matter what the season, Santa Barbara's expansive beach is a must-visit for any traveler. Rent an e-bike through Santa Barbara's first bike share program, BCycle. There are plenty of stations on the waterfront (cost is $8 per 30 minutes). Or you can rent a Segway at Wheel Fun Rentals. Start your journey on The Cabrillo Bike Path, about four miles from Santa Barbara Harbor to Butterfly Beach. Some highlights include the 150-year-old Stearns Wharf, the Andree Clark Bird Refuge, and the stunning Santa Ynez Mountains dotted by Colonial Spanish-style buildings. If you visit on Saturday, check out the Fisherman's Market for fresh fish.

Santa Barbara is famous for its restaurants, so finding a bad meal is hard. In nearby Goleta, the Santa Barbara Fish Market is a new restaurant serving local and sustainable seafood. The SBFM Lobster roll and the Petrale sole sandwich are not to be missed. For vegetarian, farm-to-table fare, Satellite is the place to orbit. The eclectic, astronaut-themed restaurant uses uncommon locally-grown ingredients. Founded by ""Winestonaut"" Drew Cuddy, Satellite also boasts a natural wine shop inspired by Cuddy's experience working on organic, biodynamic vineyards across Europe.

The nine-block stretch has been closed to car traffic since the outset of the pandemic. Pura Luna Apothecary is a few blocks away on Chapala Street, a fascinating hybrid between a salon and an alternative herbal superstore. The black, queer, women-owned wellness shop sells medicinals, products, and gifts made in-house or by other women-owned/minority-owned ventures. Idyll Mercantile is an independent, brick-and-mortar plant shop that offers a beautiful assortment of plants, plant care products, mugs, prints, earrings, stained glass, and greeting cards. Also off the beaten path is Funk Zone, a former 19th-century manufacturing hub transformed into artists studios, galleries, and wine-tasting rooms. Pura Luna ApothecaryTake a Lovely Sunset WalkIf you haven't consumed too much wine, take advantage of the many hiking spots in Santa Barbara that offer spectacular sunset views. The Santa Barbara Botanic Garden is a 65-acre wonderland of native California flora that overlooks the Pacific Ocean. You can also take walks along the scene bluff-top parks such as Ellwood Mesa or Douglas Family Preserve. For a two-hour sunset cruise, climb aboard the Double Dolphin sailboat, which offers views of the Santa Barbara's coastline and maybe even dolphins and whales.

Silent film icons such as Charlie Chaplin fell in love with the area, so much so that he opened a hotel for all his fancy friends to stay. Built in 1928, Montecito Inn has all the glamour of early Hollywood with the modern amenities of a 21st-century boutique hotel. The hotel is also home to an outstanding French restaurant called Coast & Olive, which offers farmers' market fare, fresh fish, and seasonal specials.

After nearly a month of departure delays, Life at Sea's intended passengers are saying farewell to the years-long cruise that never set sail.Life at Sea Cruises announced the cancellation of its ambitious three-year cruise around the world, citing an inability to secure a suitable ship and a sudden withdrawal of investor support, per CNN.Image Credit: Finnbarr Webster | Getty Images. AIDAaura.Related: People Are Selling Their Homes to Board This 'Cruise That Never Ends' — and It Might Cost Less Than Your Monthly RentThe news comes after weeks of silence from the company, which promised a trip of a lifetime departing from Istanbul on November 1. Shortly before that date came, the departure was pushed to November 11 from Amsterdam in the Netherlands, then to November 30 from Amsterdam, before being called off altogether on November 17.



The cost of joining the cruise in one of the 111 cabins ran up to hundreds of thousands of dollars — a price many deemed worthy of the unique experience.Life at Sea's would-be passengers upended their lives to join the voyage; some even sold their homes ahead of the expedition. Keri Witman, founder and president of digital marketing firm Clever Lucy, was one of them. Entrepreneur spoke with Witman about her plans to work remotely on board — and potentially extend her journey past the three-year mark — in September.""These last few months have been a whirlwind of excitement and change, readying for the three-year Life at Sea work/life cruise,"" Witman told Entrepreneur following the cancellation. ""While Miray Cruises, which owns Life at Sea, has been very communicative about recent business challenges that led to the cruise cancellation, I remain hopeful to be part of a long-term, residential cruise in 2024. I am also very grateful for the community of people who I have connected with over the last few months (who would have been my new neighbors). Many of us are in touch and collaborating on a 'Plan B' together."" Ultimately, Life at Sea admitted that the delays and relocations were due to its failure to purchase the AIDAaura from AIDA Cruises, per CNN. The lack of a vessel and financial backbone unraveled the company's plans, and their ensuing legal troubles only compounded the issue.

Courtesy of Leslie Keeler Saglio


This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Leslie Keeler Saglio, a TEDx speaker and master coach focusing on women's empowerment. As a young adult, I didn't have much international experience. I was born in Los Angeles, California to parents of Filipino descent, and aside from a study abroad stint in Shanghai for business school, I didn't have the opportunity to travel much. After l graduated, I got started in the entertainment industry. I landed a job at Warner Brothers Pictures; it was a very corporate environment, but it was exciting for me, living in LA and getting a behind-the-scenes look into how the industry works.But a few years in, I realized I was working a lot of hours — 50-60 per week. I worked in the company's international department and interacted with people from many different cultures. It made me think, Wouldn't it be interesting to actually be able to travel to these places and experience life much differently than I was raised? Around the same time, one of my good friends, a real estate entrepreneur, asked me if I'd come on board with his business.



Related: Want Success? You Have to Take Risks. 4 Benefits of Risk-Taking.I took a calculated risk and left my very comfortable position at Warner Brothers. I knew that surrounding myself with people who shared my entrepreneurial spirit and had the lifestyles I aspired to have would motivate me to take even more risks and do things outside of my comfort zone. During that time, in 2005, I met the man who would become my husband online; he lived more than 5,000 miles away in London, but after a nine-month long-distance relationship, he proposed, and I said ""yes.""


""I realized I didn't want to live a life of regrets. We wanted a better lifestyle.""Because I was younger and earlier in my career and had always wanted the chance to work and live abroad, we decided it made sense for me to join him in London. I moved there in 2006, and our two children were born there: our daughter in 2008 and our son in 2010. But after about a decade of living in London, we were ready for another change — we were tired of the city's wet, gray weather, and after going back and forth to California to visit my father during his battle with brain cancer, I realized I didn't want to live a life of regrets.We wanted a better lifestyle — less stress and more sun and Vitamin D. So we decided on Barcelona. My husband is French, and our children were attending the French school in London, so we looked at the French school in Barcelona, figuring it would take a year or so to find places, but it took just four or five weeks. Just a few months later, we made the move.Related: 7 Ways to Improve Your Life in 7 Days | Entrepreneur


It wasn't long before we began to see the differences in lifestyle and parenting approaches. Those in the U.S. and London are relatively similar, but the further you go south, toward the Mediterranean, the more relaxed it gets. In Spain, the kids eat later; the days are longer — sometimes, my husband and I find it a bit too relaxed. We're like, ""Wait a minute here, we need our kids to have a little more structure.""""Without the pressure to have a 5-10-year plan, they're able to just have their adolescence.""But it's all about finding a balance. Here, there's less pressure on schooling — that whole, ""Where are you going to school, and what kind of job are you going to have?"" We don't want that pressure on ourselves or our kids. We had that to an extent growing up, and we didn't want that for our children. So we do have structure, but we also appreciate that kids can be kids here. Without the pressure to have a 5-10-year plan, they can have their adolescence, which is important.Related: Parents Who Praise Kids This Way Hinder Their Future Success


Although our kids started in the French school here, we switched them to the American International School because we wanted to instill the individualistic outlook that's common in the U.S. We want our kids to know that yes, you can be about the ""we"" and the collective, but you also have to think about your strengths and take accountability for yourself. Whenever I travel back to the U.S., I'm reminded of how American that approach is, and I think it's beautiful.""Our children speak several languages and are citizens of the world — the world is their oyster.""We encourage our kids to pursue their interests. Our son is in competitive tennis; he's very dedicated to the sport, and I think that's great. Our daughter is in student government. It's a beautiful part of American culture: Speak up, speak out and have a voice — which is why I've also tried to keep them very aware of what's happening in the U.S. and the world.Related: How to Raise Entrepreneurial-Minded Kids | Entrepreneur


My husband and I are both entrepreneurs, and we'd be happy if our children pursued that path as well, though we do want them to finish school, too. Education is so important. Even though AI might make some jobs obsolete by the time they graduate, education is more than just where you study; it's the people you meet and the experiences you have. Our children speak several languages and are citizens of the world — the world is their oyster, really.

50,Carnival Cruise Found 'Negligent' for 'Lethal' Covid Riddled Voyage Where Over 600 Passengers Fell Ill,"Oct 25, 2023",Sam Silverman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/carnival-ruled-negligent-for-2020-cruise-600-people-got/464283,"
Carnival Cruise Line was found to have been negligent by an Australian judge in a class action lawsuit for embarking on a voyage that spread Covid-19 to over 600 passengers. The lawsuit included more than 1,000 people, per Reuters.Per the lawsuit, the Ruby Princess ocean liner, owned by Carnival and its subsidiary Princess Cruises, set sail from Sydney, Australia to New Zealand on March 8, 2020, with 2,671 passengers aboard, despite growing health risks in the early days of the pandemic, per ABC News.On the voyage, 663 passengers contracted the coronavirus and 28 died. What was supposed to be a 13-day cruise ended up returning two days earlier than anticipated due to Australia's closing borders.



RELATED: 'Blood-Curdling Scream': FBI Investigating 'Stabbing' on Carnival Cruise ShipAustralian Federal Court Justice Angus Stewart ruled that Carnival failed to take proper safety precautions and protect passengers from the risks of Covid.


Before setting sail, Carnival had experienced Covid outbreaks on the Grand Princess off California and the Diamond Princess off Japan in February, according to the judge. Additionally, just one day after departing from Sydney, on March 9, Carnival offered free cancellations for all cruises worldwide with no explanation to customers before suspending all cruises on March 13.""The respondents knew or ought to have known about the heightened risk of coronavirus infection on the vessel and its potentially lethal consequences and that their procedures for screening passengers and crew members for the virus were unlikely to screen out all infectious individuals,"" Stewart said, according to the outlet.RELATED: Carnival Cruise Phasing Out Beloved, But Underused Amenity""To the respondents' knowledge, to proceed with the cruise carried significant risk of a coronavirus outbreak with possible disastrous consequences, yet they proceeded regardless,"" he added.


The lead plaintiff in the class action lawsuit, Susan Karpik, sued Carnival for over AU$360,000 Australian dollars ($230,000). She was awarded AU$4,423.48 ($2,823.28) for her medical expenses with the judge noting that Carnival had refunded all passengers' fares. Those who had more severe health issues as a result of the cruise could be entitled to more financial compensation. It is unknown when the total compensation will be announced.Karpik told reporters she was ""pleased"" with the outcome.Following the ruling, Carnival reps said they were considering the details of the judgment in a statement obtained by AP News.""The pandemic was a difficult time in Australia's history, and we understand how heartbreaking it was for those affected,"" Carnival stated.

      Key Takeaways    



        MSC Group's new Explora Journeys has seen ""one record week after the other"" for 2024 bookings, its CEO said.
      


        The new luxury brand says its most expensive 2024 itinerary will sail at $90,050 per person for the largest cabin.
      


        Take a look around the Explora I complete with the first Rolex store at sea and a $190 tasting menu.
      



















Brittany Chang/Insider
Itineraries on the Explora I range from $3,000 to $90,050 per person in 2024.


This story originally appeared on Business Insider. If you've only sailed with the likes of Carnival or Margaritaville, you might not think of cruise vacations as the pinnacle of luxury travel.But for high-earning globetrotters who know where to look, cruise vacations can feel like a step below traveling on a superyacht (albeit shared) or in a floating luxury hotel.



One of the newest luxury cruise lines to hit the market, Explora Journeys, is trying to offer just that. Just be ready to shell out at least $500 per night per person in 2024 for its only vessel, the Explora I.Michael Ungerer, the CEO of Explora Journeys, called the Explora I a ""boutique-style resort on the water.""Explora I began revenue sailings in August 2023. Brittany Chang/Insider via BIThe new cruise line isn't the only one pursuing this concept. Competition could be tough: Popular luxury resort brands like Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, and Aman are also building out their own luxury floating hotel portfolios.However, there's one considerable differentiator between Explora and these legacy hotel giants: ""We come from the maritime side,"" the company's CEO said.The Explora I has four pools. Brittany Chang/InsiderExplora is owned by MSC Group, a 53-year-old European cargo shipping giant that already operates a 23-cruise ship fleet under MSC Cruises.Since the ship began revenue sailings two months ago, ""word of mouth"" has pushed the cruise line to have ""one record week [of 2024 cruise bookings] after the other,"" Ungerer said.MSC's emblem can be spotted throughout the ship. Brittany Chang/InsiderItineraries in 2024 start at $3,000 per traveler for a six-night January sailing from Miami to Cartagena, Colombia. This price ranges up to $90,050 per person in the largest 3,014-square-foot Owner's Residence on the 25-night cruise from Bridgetown, Barbados to Los Angeles.


Unlike the giant cruise ships that have been flooding the market, the Explora I is smaller and more intimate.The new ship is 813 feet-long and 107 feet-wide. Brittany Chang/InsiderRoyal Caribbean says its upcoming 1,198-foot-long Icon of the Seas will have 2,805 staterooms for 7,600 travelers.To compare, Explora's 813-foot-long vessel has 461 cabins, all suites. At double occupancy, this ship can sail with 922 travelers.


These ships, luxury or not, generally have the same baseline amenities: a pool, a buffet, restaurants, bars, lounges, and entertainment.There are 12 bars aboard the Explora I. Brittany Chang/InsiderBut with luxury vessels like the Explora I, these all have an opulent flair. Think lounges with sleek and contemporary designs, infinity pools over the ocean, complimentary access to the spa, and a buffet with raw seafood and lobster tails.If you interpret ""quiet luxury"" literally, Explora I offers just that.Even the least expensive cabins have balconies. Brittany Chang/Insider


There's a reason the average demographic of its travelers falls in the 50-year-old range: The ship doesn't have any amusement park-like rides filled with screaming children or flashy virtual reality arcades.Instead, this is where wealthy travelers go to unwind, take in the views from their private balconies, and indulge in fine cigars and rare whiskeys.For guests who need a relaxing getaway, access to the spa — but not its services — is included in the fare.Access to the spa is included in the fare.Brittany Chang/InsiderThis includes crystal-infused water, a sauna, a steam room, and a hydrotherapy pool (as if the ship's four other pools weren't enough).If you prefer indoor swimming holes, the Explora I has one under a retractable glass roof as well.The pool with a retractable glass roof resembles a typical cruise ship ""solarium."" Brittany Chang/InsiderYou might not have to fight any ""pool chair hogs"" — there are 64 cabanas throughout the ship.Besides the spa services, one of the only other amenities that's not included in the base fare is dinner at Anthology.Anthology has indoor and outdoor seating. Brittany Chang/InsiderThis 70-seat dining venue is helmed by rotating guest chefs, some of whom have led kitchens with Michelin stars. At eight courses with luxurious dishes like cuttlefish tagliatelle with Calvisius Oscietra caviar, the meal will cost an additional $190 or $265 with the wine pairing.


Having only one restaurant with an additional fee isn't the norm for the non-luxury cruise industry anymore.Explora I's buffet has seafood items like grilled lobster tails. Brittany Chang/InsiderSome cruise lines have been introducing a growing number of specialty restaurants on their new ships. Guests dining at these venues have to pay extra, increasing the ships' onboard revenue.But that's not Explora's business model.There are several lounge chairs in and around the ship's four pools. Brittany Chang/Insider""I'd rather have a few empty beds and get the right guests at the right price. And most of [amenities] are already included so we don't have to upsell,"" its CEO said.This doesn't mean Explora I's other dining rooms aren't high-end either.Sakura serves up sushi and ""pan-Asian"" food. Brittany Chang/Insider


The menu at Sakura includes wagyu tataki. At Mediterranean-inspired Med Yacht Club, travelers can chomp down on grilled octopus. And at steakhouse Marble and Co Grill, the cooks serve up plates of aged prime rib and potatoes with caviar.This doesn't include the breakfast room service, which can be ordered the night before using a door hanger.Even the buffet is more upscale than the average cruise.The buffet has a sushi bar. Brittany Chang/InsiderInstead of self-serving tongs, workers behind the counter fill up travelers' plates with cooked-to-order handmade pastas, sushi, and crab legs.While most cruise ships are centered with a liminal space-like atrium, the Explora I has a ""Lobby Bar"" designed to look like a high-end hotel bar.The Lobby Bar is surrounded by onboard shopping. Brittany Chang/InsiderMusic from the overhead self-playing piano fills this space. All of the pianos on the ship are made by Steinway and Sons, which has a partnership with the luxury cruise line.


On high-end vessels like this one, onboard shopping no longer means buying a bottle of booze or some cruise line merch.This Rolex store at sea carries some inventory. Brittany Chang/InsiderBesides the legendary piano maker, Explora also has a partnership with Rolex, making its cruise vessel the first in the industry to have a floating Rolex store.If Swiss watches aren't your thing, you can pick up some items at the neighboring Cartier store instead.


This list of flashy partnerships continues on: Explora Journeys is also partnered with Technogym.There's a sports court next to this small outdoor gym. Brittany Chang/InsiderIts indoor gym is supplied with equipment from Technogym's Artis Line where a treadmill will set buyers back $20,250 and an elliptical $15,500.The smaller outdoor gym also has equipment from the company, including exercise bikes that face the ocean.


Almost all cruise staterooms have a bed, storage, bathroom, and additional seating.Suites start at $500 per person per day in 2024. Brittany Chang/InsiderThe cheapest of these cabins often have no windows.But with Explora, the least expensive cabin is still a suite. A sizable one at that.Literature on the shelving unit separates the bed from the living ""room."" Brittany Chang/InsiderUngerer says the ship's smallest 377-square-foot staterooms are the largest entry-level accommodations in the luxury cruise market.This ""small"" floating hotel room is decked out with a balcony with lounge seating, a walk-in closet with a seated vanity, and binoculars.This walk-in closet has hangers, organizers, and a vanity. Brittany Chang/InsiderThere's even an espresso machine hidden in a pull-out shelf and a Dyson hairdryer stored in its own molded drawer.Similar to luxury cruise lines like the Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, travelers are greeted with a ""complimentary"" bottle of Veuve Clicquot in their cabin.It wouldn't be a luxury cruise without some expensive champagne. Brittany Chang/InsiderThink Veuve Clicquot is too cheap for you? Book a higher-end suite instead. There, you'll receive a bottle of Dom Perignon Vintage 2013, perfect for the wealthiest of cruisers.

      Key Takeaways    



        We're excited to join this brand-new venture that's shaped, in some ways, by the participants. 
      


        It's a legitimate investment — those managing the community on board have our interests and theirs at heart. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Martin Buggy and Melissa Edyvean, owners of Australian company Bondi Chai Latte and future residents of the MV Narrative's Storylines community. As the owners of Australian company Bondi Chai Latte, we've had many opportunities to travel and spend time on cruise ships over the years. We were so enamored of the cruise ship lifestyle — though perhaps, sometimes, not of the company we were keeping on board.Image Credit: Courtesy of Martin Buggy and Melissa Edyvean



So, we began to look for ways we might live on extended cruises. We're interested in living on a ship with like-minded people, not necessarily from the same socioeconomic background, but those who share a certain worldview — because it takes a certain type of person to want to live the way we're going to live.We originally came across a ship that was already sailing, MS The World. We were excited about the prospect of joining that ship; we proceeded down that path and spoke to the ship's Australian salesperson. We were looking forward to the day we would ultimately sell our business to purchase a cabin on The World.


""We were very excited about the prospect of joining a brand-new venture that was, in some ways, able to be shaped by the participants.""We discovered Storylines, the innovative residential community aboard the MV Narrative ship set to sail in 2026, purely by chance. For some reason or another, we continued exploring other ship options and happened to stumble upon The Narrative. That was on a Wednesday afternoon, and by Saturday morning, we'd signed up for an apartment on the ship — we put down a $10,000 refundable deposit for a 12-year lease that begins once we can access the ship. We were one of very few early adopters offered this lease term; now, there are only life-of-vessel leases available.Image Credit: Courtesy of StorylinesRelated: I'm Working Remotely on a Cruise Ship for 3 Years, Maybe Longer


We wanted to secure our spot so badly. Having spoken with the salesperson, we knew there was no ship yet, but The Narrative will have 530 residences with many amenities, including 20 restaurants and bars; a vertical farm; an organic farmer's market; a bowling alley; a marina with watercraft such as jet skis; a 10,000-book library; a movie theater; and more. We were very excited about the prospect of joining a brand-new venture that was, in some ways, able to be shaped by the participants. The people who joined early became Founders Circle members with an opportunity to be included in some of the decision-making, and the deeper we got into it, the more excited we got.Image Credit: Courtesy of StorylinesSomebody once said, ""There's nothing more exciting than somebody who's in pursuit of a dollar who believes they have a good chance of catching it,"" and this apartment became a much more real option for us. We didn't have to wait until we could sell our business and fund our retirement. We could even continue running our business from the ship if we wanted to, so that was a real bonus.""We can rent out our apartment when we're not using it.""The Narrative's residences, which range from $1 million to $8 million for the lifetime of the vessel, are anywhere from 237 to 1,970 square feet — so from a shoebox to a three-bedroom, two-story apartment. We're on the lower end of the scale but not in shoebox territory. We can rent out our apartment when we're not using it. That's giving access to so many more people who can buy a residence as an investment and spend some time on it themselves but get help paying for it by renting it out. In the early days, while our business is still growing, we'll probably spend three months on the ship, then three months off.Image Credit: Courtesy of StorylinesRelated: Digital Nomads Are Changing the Entrepreneurship LandscapeIt's a legitimate investment. It's being managed by people on board the ship who have our interests and their interests at heart. So we've both got skin in the game when it comes to renting the apartment to the appropriate person, which is very important to us. We rent property around Australia already and know the value of having good managers running your properties for you when you can't. We've got properties up and down Australia that are five- to six-hour flights away, and there's no way we could fix things if they need fixing or make sure that the tenants are doing the right thing when they're in there. So that side of our investment is very important to us, and we couldn't be happier with the fact that Storylines' office will be on the ship's top deck.


""Basically, you're traveling from home, which is really, really appealing.""In addition to being a financial investment, joining Storylines is an investment in how we travel. We love cruise ships, but typically you're up early and off the ship as quickly as you can be alongside thousands of other people, and then you've got a tight itinerary to get back on the ship before it leaves to go to the next port. So you never really get to see anywhere you visit. You've got maybe six to ten hours at the most. The Narrative will be in port for three to five days in many places.Image Credit: Courtesy of StorylinesSo there's no rush. If you don't feel like getting off one day — if you've got something else you want to do — you stay home. And that's the thing: You stay home. You've got your toothbrush. You've got your wardrobe. You don't have to try to pack and decide what you need. If it's suddenly cold and should have been hot, you'll have the clothes you need anyway. Basically, you're traveling from home, which is really, really appealing.


Image Credit: Courtesy of StorylinesRelated: How to Plan a Luxurious Trip Without Breaking the BankWe also look forward to spending time with our fellow Storylines residents. We recently traveled to Spain to meet some of the other Founders Circle members, and it was a real test for us: These are the people we'll be living with on The Narrative. And it was just fabulous. We met people who were younger than us. We met people who were older than us. We met people who are world travelers — we consider ourselves well-traveled, but some of the people on the trip live with a backpack on; they're basically permanently living out of their suitcase. We've already made great friendships with people.

55,'Resort Fees' and Other 'Junk Fees' May Soon Be a Thing of the Past—Here's Why,"Oct 12, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/everyone-is-over-resort-feesincluding-the-us/463579,"
Nothing in life is free, and hidden charges in the form of ""resort fees"" and other added costs are irking many travelers.Now, new legislation aims to ban the use of ""junk fees,"" citing their impact on consumers' expenses.These fees include mandatory charges applied by places like hotels (to cover amenities such as gym access and internet), event companies (service fees on concert tickets, for example), and airlines (bag fees, etc.).



Resort fees (and additional fees imposed by airlines and event tickets) are typically not included in the initial price when booking online, making it challenging for consumers to compare prices effectively. A 2017 report from the Federal Trade Commission found that since resort fees are presented separately from room prices, it can make the consumer search for the best price more complicated and ""difficult to comparison shop.""Only six percent of hotels charge resort fees, according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association, per The New York Times. Still, those fees can add up — a separate 2018 report from Bjorn Hanson found that resort fees generate $3 billion annually for hotels.


Related: 'The New Norm': Viral Document Exposes Hidden Charges on Restaurant Bills, From Service Fees to 'Health and Happiness' FeesThe Biden Administration's Junk Fee Prevention Act and Hotel Fees Transparency Act would require businesses to display the full price upfront, including fees, to prevent the uptick in surprise charges, and face monetary penalties if failing to comply. It would also require businesses to be upfront about whether the fees in question are refundable.The proposed rule has been approved by the FTC for Federal Register publication and, once posted, consumers can issue comments for 60 days. But not everyone is on board.Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement on Wednesday that he believes the legislation would actually hurt consumers.


""Every minute of every day, Americans engage in close to 400,000 transactions, buying and selling goods and services,"" Bradley said. ""It is baffling that the administration believes it is going to help consumers by regulating how businesses price all of those transactions.""Related: How to Avoid Sneaky, Hidden Travel Fees

One guest's stay at the adult-only Hotel La Semilla, a Design Hotels partner of Marriott located in the Mexican resort town Playa del Carmen, took a turn for the worse before it began when the hotel couldn't find the reservation — that was prepaid.The guest, a Reddit user with the handle ""turtlerush,"" claims that they got an email from the hotel giving them the option to prepay with PayPal to receive a slightly discounted rate and welcome drink upon arrival, TheStreet reported.Related: 11 Strategies for More Efficient Business Travel | Entrepreneur



There was no record of that reservation when the guest called to confirm. When they forwarded the email chain with proof of pre-payment to the hotel, the hotel said they were hacked, then stopped responding altogether after multiple follow-ups, according to the user.Digital travel scams are on the rise. In 2022, there were 65,135 reports of travel-related scams in the U.S., which cost people $105.1 million in losses, according to Fodor's Travel.


More details about the alleged victim's experience came to light when the travel site View From the Wing followed up: ""The guest booked a room on Marriott's website. They also made a second reservation at Booking.com for a lower rate, and emailed the hotel asking them to match the price for their 'book direct' reservation."" That's when the guest received the hotel's offer and made the $505.95 pre-payment on PayPal.Related: This Is What Travel Will Look Like in a Post-Pandemic World""I'm inclined to believe that there may have been a bad actor at the hotel, possibly even someone at the front desk,"" the guest wrote on Reddit.Because the guest has all the communication in writing, they'll likely get their money back, per View From the Wing.

58,How a Side Hustle Taking People on 'Urban Hikes' Became a Lucrative Business,"Oct 10, 2023",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/an-urban-hikes-side-hustle-becomes-a-lucrative-business/463378,"
Back in 2018, Lisa Peña heard a podcast about an entrepreneur in San Francisco who ran a business leading hikes across San Francisco. The concept was simple: Instead of taking hikes along nature trails, urban explorers were trekking through alleyways and winding city streets.""I got that excited feeling that I've only had a couple of other times in my life, and I knew that I had to bring urban hiking to Kansas City,"" Peña told In Kansas City.The Kansas City native launched Urban Hikes KC the following year as a side hustle, charging customers $28 to take guided tours with her on foot around the city she loved. Today, that business is a profitable, full-time endeavor that offers ten different hiking routes with a staff of 6 guides. Here's how she put Urban Hikes KC on the map.



 A passion for travelLike many successful entrepreneurs, Peña took an activity she had a passion for and figured out a way to monetize it. A former Peace Corps volunteer and backpacker, she loved to explore internationally and locally. Peña applied that same curiosity to her hiking business, taking tourists and locals to sights off the beaten trail.


After hearing the podcast interview about UrbanHikerSF, she contacted the company's founder, Alexandra Kenin, and asked her questions. Peña spent the next year researching routes, establishing a social presence, getting insurance, building a website, and figuring out a payment system.Starting off as a side hustlePeña launched her business in 2019 while working for Girl Scouts of NE Kansas & NW Missouri. Her first hike was the Crossroads Westside Urban Hike, which weaves in and out of alleyways in the city's Arts District.Photo by Urban Hikes KC


""I started it out as a side hustle,"" she told Marketplace. ""I didn't know how much money I was going to earn. I literally was starting from scratch. There was no other urban hiking sector in Kansas City.""Interest was so great that she added another tour to her business and then another. Soon, she realized she'd have to quit her full-time job if she wanted to scale.""That was a scary leap,"" she says.One of her first moves was upping her price from $28 a head to $38.Slow burnPeña concedes that she made no money in the business the first few years. Her expenses included insurance, her guides, and other bills associated with the business and life.


But in the summer of 2020, she started getting more guides and routes, and the business began to boom. ""It was a great thing to do during the pandemic since we are mostly outside and can be socially distanced,"" Peña told In Kansas City.By 2021, over one thousand customers took hikes with her company. By 2022, she had so much business she had to hire additional guides and add more routes.As for profits, she's doing just fine now. ""Finally I am making an income that is a sustaining income,"" she said on Marketplace.What guests can expectPeña says urban hikers can expect to see a side of Kansas City they've never seen, ""even in neighborhoods they think they know. We learn about the history and stories of people who made a difference in Kansas City, and see different types of outdoor art, including murals, walk-up hidden stairsteps, bridges, alleyways, and parks.""

59,Planning to Book a Carnival Cruise? You Might Be in for Sticker Shock Soon — Here's Why.,"Oct 6, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/why-you-might-be-paying-more-for-your-next-carnival-cruise/463273,"
The travel industry's made a strong recovery post-Covid, but cruise lines welcoming passengers aboard in droves have another problem: skyrocketing fuel prices.Miami-based Carnival Cruise Line posted its first profit post-pandemic last week, but it anticipates a significant fourth-quarter loss amid rising fuel prices. Chief financial officer David Bernstein said the company is looking at instating higher prices rather than fuel surcharges in response, The Wall Street Journal reported.Related: Carnival Cruise Line Under Fire Over Veteran's Disappearance



Diesel prices in the U.S. have jumped about 11 cents over the past month to around $4.56 a gallon, partly because traders are concerned refineries will not be able or willing to sell enough fuel to meet global demand, per The New York Times. Carnival implemented a fuel surcharge, or temporary extra fee tacked onto goods or services when fuel prices spike up, to combat high prices in the past. Fuel reached $148 per barrel in 2007, and customers were ""very accepting"" of the cruise line's surcharge, Bernstein told the WSJ.


Current prices sit around $90 per barrel, and Carnival doesn't intend to introduce a surcharge. ""What we think about [with surcharges] is, will that get us more money than just raising the price, because if you can get future people to pay more, you're probably better off,"" Bernstein explained to the outlet, adding that the company hopes to make its fleet more fuel efficient, too.Related: Carnival Cruise Phasing Out Beloved, But Underused AmenityThe company is also trying to pay down the debt it accumulated during the pandemic. Earlier this year, Carnival Corporation sold a $1.31 billion leveraged loan and $500 million in junk bonds to replace that debt and reduce interest costs, Bloomberg reported.

This story originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gianna Alexis, a former crew member of Disney Cruise Line. The following has been edited for length and clarity.I was three years old when I sailed on my first Disney cruise, and I thought it was the coolest thing. It was the best vacation ever, so I went every few years after that.



I had always been excited about the idea of working for Disney, so I applied for a job at Disney Cruise Line in 2017. When I found out I got the job, I was so excited I cried.Before work started, Disney took us through training that was designed to get us excited about the work. On the last day of training, we were told to get ready at 4 a.m. Then, the company had a sniffer dog to smell our suitcases, which I didn't expect at all — it all seemed so different because the only experience I had embarking on a cruise ship was from a guest's point of view.


I was first hired as a merchandise person to work in the shops, and then the company moved me to the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, which was a total dream of mine. This boutique is the place where kids between three and 12 get makeovers — we do their hair, makeup, and nails.A lot of girls that I did hair for would come back the next day just to see me. In their eyes, I was like their fairy godmother — that made me feel it was the most magical job that I've ever had.In addition to that job, I also helped workers bring food, merchandise, and toys to the shops. I didn't know the job would be physically demanding — I thought I would just be doing kids' hair, makeup, and nails.I quit after just four monthsAs a young 24-year-old, I went into this job blindly and wasn't fully prepared.


I worked from 8:30 a.m. until 9 or 10 p.m. Before starting this job, I didn't, or couldn't, conceptualize what an 80-hour work week without a day off would look like at all. There was no work-life balance.I had so little time to myself. In my downtime, I didn't even want to watch TV or movies. Once I got 30 minutes into watching, I'd rather just sleep because I was so tired — sleeping had become my priority. The only ""me time"" I would have for myself was a quick sheet mask in my room, and that's all. My room was so small that I could nearly touch both walls with outstretched arms.I got a stress fracture in one of my feet from standing 80 hours a week in my costume shoes — it got so hard for me to stand. With a normal job, you can call in sick if you're not feeling well. But for me, if I didn't show up to work, my manager could come downstairs from the shop to see me what was wrong, how long I would need off, and if I needed medical attention or if I was faking it.Working on the cruise ship meant my living space was also my workspace. Managers and coworkers could spot us whenever we were out at night. I had to be ""on"" a lot of the time, and it played a big role in how quickly I burned out.


In the fourth month of my contract, I felt defeated and exhausted to the point where I decided to quit.The Disney Dream cruise ship at sea. David Roark/photographer via BII was making less than the minimum wage I worked a minimum of 70 hours weekly and got paid $423 a week, so it was about $6 an hour. There was no overtime rate at all.


We did receive benefits, including shipboard medical care, complimentary Disney theme-park admission, discounts at selected resort hotels, and Disney merchandise at worldwide Disney locations.Many cruise members come from all over the world. They're making US dollars and sometimes even making more than doctors or lawyers in their home countries. One girl from Portugal had worked on the ships for 10 years. She loved it because she was making a great living for herself and for her family overseas — she regularly sent them money.The cruise life was totally worth it to her, but for me, there were other higher-paying jobs I could have easily applied to. Some crew members on the ship thought I was taking a job from someone for whom it could have been more beneficial, like someone who needed to support their family in another country.We don't eat the same food as the guestsThe crew members eat in the crew mess, a large cafeteria where breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served. There is a small salad bar and some cooked options. For breakfast, I usually ate hard-boiled eggs. For lunch and dinner, I ate veggie burger patties (I was a vegetarian at the time). During holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, we had specialty food items like cake and ice cream.


Sometimes, the company threw parties for us. For example, if our service got high marks on guest surveys and feedback, that's when we got to have the better-tasting guest food. I remember they brought jalapeño poppers one time.The Buena Vista Theatre inside the Disney Dream cruise ship. Matt Stroshane/photographer via BINot everyone on the ship has the same freedomsNot everyone has the same freedoms in what they can do or where they can go on the boat. Everything above the deck we lived on was a ""privilege"" — we weren't allowed to roam the ship freely.


If we wanted to go to spots like the movie theater, we had to call our manager beforehand and get it approved in writing. If the cruise was very full, we might need to free up room for guests. I worked in the shops, and our team was a small group of 30 crew members. We were able to go to more places on the ship easily.Typically, the larger teams weren't able to get clearance. The dining-room team, for example, is a 300-person team. If their manager gave everyone on that team permission to roam the ship, guest areas would become too crowded.I had a friend who was a server in the dining room. She wasn't able to go to the movie theater or the pools like I could. She was only allowed on the floor that she lived on and a spot called ""Deck 14,"" which is a small outdoor smoking deck.I left the boat and was almost put on Disney's 'no rehire' listWorking on the ship for a few months took a mental toll on me. One week after giving my 30-day notice, I told my manager that I'd get off the boat the next time we ported.


I remember being told that leaving before the 30 days might mean I wouldn't be able to work for Disney or any of its affiliate companies like ESPN and ABC.That was a scary thought because Disney was the only company I'd ever worked for as an adult. But my foot pain and burnout were so severe that all I cared about at that point was getting off the ship. So I left after four months.Working on the cruise ship wasn't all badWorking at the boutique was so much fun. I also had a wonderful roommate and made great friends with the people living in my hallway. It felt like living in a college dorm, and we all became close friends in a very short amount of time.The unique cruise line experience was a bonding opportunity that brought us all closer. Those who haven't lived on a cruise line just wouldn't understand. In all, I cherish the friendships I formed with my coworkers.


Disney did not respond to a request for comment.

For this Leadership Lessons episode, I was excited to talk to a fellow life-long entrepreneur who is transforming the way people take vacations. Over the past two decades, Brent Handler — co-founder and CEO of Inspirato, the world's first luxury travel subscription brand — has pioneered the industry. Under Handler's leadership, the company established itself as a leading luxury hospitality company that provides access to a portfolio of luxury vacation homes and other vacation options, including an innovative subscription model.Related: The CEO of Whole Foods Shares the 9 Tips That Help Him Run His Company for the Greater GoodHere are 10 valuable lessons this driven leader shared with me during our conversation.



1. Build your business on something you care about""Go be interested in whatever you're going to be interested in, and be obsessed,"" Handler advises others who want to be entrepreneurs.2. Find a massive market and attack it with innovationTravel has always been and will continue to be a massive market. Handler co-founded Exclusive Resorts and served as its president from 2002 to 2009. There, he set the standard for the burgeoning destination club industry by delivering tens of thousands of vacations and amassing more than $1 billion in real estate assets.

Balance the right speed with the right level of controlMost people get upset at work over one of two things: consensus or bureaucracy. The same person can complain about both simultaneously, even if those impulses are contrary. As CEO, you need to find a way to balance both to compensate for this.

62,These Great-Grandparents Booked 51 Back-to-Back Cruises Because It's 'Cheaper Than a Retirement Home',"Oct 2, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/retired-couple-books-51-back-to-back-cruises-sails-for-2/462984,"
Many people dream about a relaxing retirement — and one Australian couple took it up a notch.Retirees Marty and Jess Ansen set sail on their first cruise post-Covid on June 16, 2022, and they've remained aboard since, booking 51 back-to-back trips so far, Australian outlet A Current Affair reported.The Ansens have been at home on Princess Cruises' 2,000-passenger Coral Princess for nearly 500 days and plan to stay for two years total before moving to the cruise line's larger Crown Princess ship for an additional year, per the outlet.



Lengthy around-the-world cruises have made headlines recently. Life at Sea, which initially offered a three-year voyage starting in November, rebranded itself as ""the cruise that never ends."" ""It's a cost-effective way to see the world,"" Life at Sea future passenger Keri Witman told Entrepreneur. ""I don't have to spend $1,700 on a plane ticket and pay for hotels, having to go back and forth and take time off work.""Related: 'Cruise That Never Ends' May Cost Less Than Your Monthly Rent


That's a sentiment that resonates with the Ansens, too. The great-grandparents say journeying on the Coral Princess is ""cheaper than a retirement home."" It also affords them a carefree lifestyle: days filled with prepared meals, a cleaning service, ping-pong, dance lessons and more.Cruise fares vary based on itinerary, number of nights, cabin type, amenities and cruise line, but a seven-night Caribbean cruise in November generally costs approximately $424 to $1,158 per person, according to U.S. News & World Report.Related: I'm Working Remotely on a Cruise Ship for 3 Years, Maybe LongerAnd to the people who can't fathom the Ansens' lifestyle choice?

63,People Are Eager to Go to Europe. But a 'Strange and Humiliating' Requirement Is Derailing Travel Plans.,"Sep 27, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/lengthy-short-term-visa-waits-are-derailing-european-travel/462317,"
As travel demand continues to surge post-pandemic, so does the chaos surrounding it.People who need short-term visas to visit Europe are encountering monthslong delays that threaten their travel plans, The New York Times reported.Although most travelers from the U.S. don't require visas to enter Europe's Schengen Area — the border-free zone permitting free movement among 27 European countries — for up to 90 days, citizens of Turkey and several other countries, including India and China, must apply for visas for shorter stays, per the Times.



Starting early next year, all U.S. tourists visiting Europe will need a travelers visa called the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). It will be a requirement for tourists from Canada, Australia and New Zealand as well.Related: 11 Strategies for More Efficient Business Travel | Entrepreneur


Since 2009, Schengen states have relied on third-party processing companies like BLS International and VFS Global to conduct initial screenings of candidates before completing the final step of issuance themselves, according to the outlet. But the available resources aren't enough for soaring demand.""Revenge tourism,"" where higher flight and hotel costs don't faze eager post-pandemic travelers, was in full swing this summer, AP News reported, complete with two-plus-hour waits to visit the Acropolis in Athens and crowds so thick around St. Mark's Square in Venice that the city's bridges are backed up even on weekdays.Thirty-six-year-old Duygu Yildirim, an assistant professor who holds a Turkish passport and lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, told the Times she'd applied for at least 10 Schengen visas in recent years — so is all too familiar with the cumbersome, expensive process. Each application costs about $85.Related: This Is What Travel Will Look Like in a Post-Pandemic World


After Yildirim received an official invitation to a workshop in Belgium, the country's consulate asked her for additional financial documents, including tax forms. ""I am going on an invitation and they want to see my monthly bank statements?"" Yildirim said. ""They want to be sure that I'm not illegally immigrating there, just because I'm Turkish. It feels kind of strange, and humiliating, to ask how much money do you make.""

Keri Witman


This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Keri Witman, founder and president of digital marketing firm Clever Lucy. I've always taken every opportunity I could to travel. In college, I did an overseas study program; I backpacked around Europe by myself. But as you get older, those opportunities aren't always there. You're wrapped up in obligations. A few years ago, I decided to freelance and travel the world. Being a digital nomad appealed to me, so my friend Sara Sartarelli and I mapped out a plan to start a digital marketing agency. We landed our first client and decided on our business's name, Clever Lucy. But as business started to pick up, my idea of being a nomad kind of fell by the wayside.Then, three months later, Covid hit, so no one was traveling at that point. And our business just kept growing. But this past March, I was having dinner with a friend, and we were talking about travel, wondering if they have cruises that go around the world, just fantasizing about what that would be like. When I got home, thanks to the magic of marketing, I was served up an advertisement for Life at Sea's around-the-world cruise. I clicked on it and went down the rabbit hole that night. It was like a lightning bolt: Oh, this is what I have to do.



Related: 'Cruise That Never Ends' May Cost Less Than Your Monthly RentStill, it seemed crazy. But I made an appointment with the salespeople at the cruise company. Then, on the double, I called everybody I could think of, including my parents, who always tell me I'm doing something crazy — and they didn't tell me it was crazy. I called my co-founder and business partner next. I didn't want to jeopardize our company. But she told me to go for it. Then, I checked with some clients and called my financial advisor. Nobody told me not to do it, so two days later, I put a deposit down.


""I won't have to pay for food or medical insurance...everything's included.""Since Life at Sea had just started marketing, I lucked out with early bird pricing. Double occupancy costs $38,000, but I had no interest in having a roommate in a small room, especially one I don't know — although many people are doing it. So technically if you have a solo room, you pay double that, minus the 15% discount I had. I met with my financial advisor and did the math: Between my mortgage, car insurance, utilities, et cetera, the cost of the cruise was almost a wash, and I won't have to pay for food or medical insurance because they have a doctor on board. Everything's included.    View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Life at Sea Cruises (@lifeatseacruises)So it all just made sense. I've always loved to travel, and our clients are all over the country. Plus, there was nothing connecting me to Cincinnati other than the friends I care about. And it's a cost-effective way to see the world; I don't have to spend $1,700 on a plane ticket and pay for hotels, having to go back and forth and take time off work. I can integrate it with my work.


Related: 5 Tips for Surviving as a Digital Nomad | EntrepreneurI grew up in the corporate world: 9-5, you had to be in the office, and I usually stayed until 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. My business partner taught me how to be more flexible. She integrates work into life; at the beginning of our work relationship, she'd be booking a hair appointment at 2 p.m., and I was like, ""What are you doing? This is a work day."" She's pulled me out of that corporate environment, and so many of our freelancers work that way, too. We believe that when we and our team can pursue our passions and do the things that make us happy outside of work, we're bringing way more value and productivity to work."" As crazy as it sounds, I could see myself continuing to cruise.""I had to do a lot of things to prepare for my departure. A fantastic group of friends helped me pack up the house I'd lived in for 12 years. I also needed a new permanent address, so I got a digital mailbox; they scan all my mail so I never have to get a piece of paper again. I had to figure out which vaccines and visas I needed; I even spent a week in New York getting a Chinese visa. I sold my house and am living in an apartment with my cat, who I've found an excellent home for (and will be able to FaceTime from sea).


The cruise will leave from Istanbul in November. I'm particularly excited to see Morocco and the Galapagos and the places we'll visit in Asia because I've never been. Also, Life at Sea announced it's giving passengers the option to extend after the three-year mark, and as crazy as it sounds, I could see myself continuing to cruise. But I might want to take a break because being away from family and friends is the most challenging part.For founders who want to take a similar leap and keep running their businesses, I think the most important thing is having a supportive team. I never would have done this if my team felt undue pressure on them to pick up the slack — because it will take the whole team to make it work. We've had to talk about what will happen if there are outages with my WiFi and how we might have to reallocate duties to ensure the clients are always first. If I have to wake up at 4 a.m. for a conference call with a client in Arizona, I will do it. I might have to stay on board to work and miss some places on the itinerary, too.Related: How to Manage People in Different Time Zones | EntrepreneurWe've also been looking at how we can incorporate my trip into our work and keep our team and clients involved. We're even planning on having a Clever Lucy team meeting somewhere in South America.

68,Carnival Cruise Is Phasing Out a Ship Amenity That's Beloved By Some—and Completely Unknown to Others,"Sep 18, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/carnival-cruise-phasing-out-beloved-but-underused-amenity/459209,"
If you're a remote worker taking cruises on the regular, your office at sea may be disappearing.Carnival Cruise Line is gradually phasing out libraries on its ships, TheStreet reported. John Heald, the brand's loyalty ambassador, responded to concerns about the line axing libraries on his Facebook page, explaining that new ships are no longer designed with libraries to make room for additional bars and restaurants.""We have stopped building new ships with libraries,"" Heald wrote. ""The reason is so we can have other bars, restaurants etc there and the reason is also that, well, the amount of people who want to borrow a book and sit, in library silence on their Fun cruise was we saw getting less and less.""



The post, which has garnered over 3,000 comments, had a mix of passengers saying they'll miss the libraries, not only for reading but also as a quiet place to play board games, while others said that they ""never knew it was there,"" and that if they want to read, there are many other places on the ship to do so.""I think there should be some space for games and reading that is not in the middle of all the action,"" one user commented. ""I read constantly on a cruise, but not in the library. There are so many quiet, lovely spaces in which to indulge my habit!"" another wrote.


New Carnival ships won't be built with libraries, and as for the old ones, they'll be renovated into additional bars, restaurants, casinos, or even an extension of more seating area to adjacent venues, Cruise Hive reported.Related: Carnival Cruise Wants Passengers to Have Fun in the Sun — But Do This, and You'll Get Burned With a New $500 FeeEntrepreneur has reached out to Carnival for comment.However, if you're a cruise-lover who looks forward to hiding away in a ship library, Royal Caribbean offers libraries and game rooms, with some ships even featuring hidden libraries, such as the Oasis of the Seas. Celebrity Cruises, Oceania Cruises, and Regent's Seven Seas Explorer all have libraries on ships where you can dive into a good read at sea among shelves of books.

70,"'Day-Trippers' Will Have to Pay a Fee to Visit Venice, Italy Starting Spring 2024. Here's What You Need to Know.","Sep 6, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/venice-italy-to-charge-5-euro-enter-fee-for-day-tourists/458617,"
If you want to spend a day in the historic canal city of Venice, Italy, it will cost you an entrance fee.On Tuesday, the Venice city council announced that starting in spring 2024, the Italian city famous for its canals, gondola rides, and vibrant festivals, will begin a trial spanning roughly 30 days, wherein visitors 14 years or older will be charged a day-trip fee of 5 euros ($5.35) to enter.""The goal is to discourage daily tourism in certain periods, in line with the delicacy and uniqueness of the city,"" the council wrote in the press release.In the coming weeks, the council will establish a solidified calendar with the fee-required dates, focusing mainly on spring and summer weekends.As far as what the implementation will look like — whether day trippers will be lined up at gates like Disney World, or if they can purchase passes online or only in person — remains to be announced.



However, one thing the city did clarify is that the initiative is ""not a tool for making cash,"" and the 5 euro day trip fee simply covers the cost of carrying out the admission experiment.

In 2019, Venice garnered 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in tourism revenue, of which 30% was from day trippers. However, day-trippers constituted the majority of tourists, accounting for 70% of the total visitors, per Bloomberg. ""The message we want to put across is that Venice is open, but visitors must understand that we need proper planning to manage the balance between residence and tourism,"" councilor for the Venice economy Michele Zuin, said in a statement, per CNN.The proposal was initially discussed in 2019 but faced delays due to the pandemic.Exemptions to the entrance fee include residents of Venice, employees (both salaried and self-employed), commuters, students at local schools and universities, minors, and family members of those who've paid the local property tax (IMU). Additional exemptions include overnight tourists within the area, residents of the Veneto Region, children under 14, individuals needing care, participants in sports events, on-duty law enforcement officers, spouses, cohabitants, and relatives up to the 3rd degree in areas where the Access Fee applies.


Further exemptions, such as days affected, fee timeframes, and value (initially set at 5 euros) will be determined after final city council approval in the coming weeks.Related: Carnival Cruise Wants Passengers to Have Fun in the Sun — But Do This, and You'll Get Burned With a New $500 Fee

71,"'Some Things You Can't Replace': 65% of Jobs in Las Vegas Will Be Replaced By Robots, According to a New Report","Sep 5, 2023",Dan Bova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/las-vegas-bartending-hotel-jobs-replaced-by-robots-report/458535,"
If you want to toast to the end of human usefulness, head to Las Vegas and have your drink of choice poured by a robot bartender.As NPR reports, the Tipsy Robot, a bar inside Planet Hollywood, is currently tended by robot servers (with a little human supervision to deal with spills and knocked-over glasses.) While it sounds fun, it is an ominous sign of what's to come for humans working in the hospitality industry.Per the Nevada Independent, between 38 percent and 65 percent of these kinds of jobs will become automated in the next decade or so. That represents between 500,000 and 860,000 gigs disappearing by 2035. As a robot would say, holy bleeping bleep.



     View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Tastemade Travel (@tastemadetravel) Some have tried to put a rosy face on this development, like the University of Nevada, Reno economist Frank Fossen. Fossen told the Nevada Independent that these occupations ""will actually be restructured"" so that there's a ""new division of tasks between human workers and digital algorithms.""""This can actually make workers more productive because as they use these new technologies to become more productive, they could see higher wages and less unemployment,"" he said. ""So some occupations are impacted a lot by A.I., but that doesn't mean the workers will lose their jobs.""Related: Dog-Like Robots To Make Deliveries Around UT Austin CampusThe Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 service and hospitality workers in Las Vegas and Reno, isn't quite so cheerful.Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the union, told NPR: ""How do our folks make sure that the jobs that remain, that we can work them? And that we're not thrown out like an old shoe? We're not going to stand for that.""""We'd like to say we're going to be able to get an agreement. But if we have to, we're going to have a big fight and do whatever it takes, including a strike on technology,"" he added.Related: Why You Shouldn't Be Afraid of Artificial Intelligence


But aside from the economic impact, what about the impact on vacationers? Is it the same thing to order a round of shots for your bachelorette party when they're served up by a fancy toaster oven?""We have a lot of guests that are regular guests, and they come for the personal interaction. They don't come for the technology,"" Holly Lang, a cocktail waitress at the MGM Grand, told NPR. ""There's some things you can't replace.""Of course, as experts point out, service jobs aren't the only thing being taken over by emerging technology. Will AI start taking over financial, marketing, and real estate jobs in Vegas? You can bet on it.

72,People Are Selling Their Homes to Board This 'Cruise That Never Ends' — and It Might Cost Less Than Your Monthly Rent,"Sep 5, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/cruise-that-never-ends-may-cost-less-than-your-monthly/458536,"
Cruise lovers who want to see the world from a ship on somewhat of a budget — indefinitely — now have the chance.Life at Sea, which bills itself as the only ""affordable"" option for long-term cruising, will launch a three-year voyage aboard its MV Lara ship in November and give passengers the option to extend for additional three-year stints, CNN reported.Related: This Remote Worker Spends 300 Nights a Year on a Cruise Ship



Initially, the MV Lara was scheduled to end its journey at the three-year mark, but Kendra Holmes, CEO of Life at Sea parent company Miray Cruises, told the outlet that the idea for ""the cruise that never ends"" came when enthusiastic potential customers couldn't make the original departure date.""Once the ship was announced in May there were a lot of people who wanted to come, but November was too soon to sell their homes, make plans and pack up their lives,"" Holmes said.


The cruise will set sail from Istanbul on November 6 and plans to visit seven continents, 140 countries and 382 ports over the next three years, per the company's site. According to Holmes, Life at Sea will continue to add new locations as well.

Nowadays, it feels like every step at the airport takes longer, including boarding the plane.In fact, it tends to be one of the more aggravating and arduous parts of air travel — but airlines have figured out how to monetize the process, and they're not eager to overhaul it anytime soon, CNBC reported.Related: A 'Very Frustrating' Issue Could Thwart Your Summer Air TravelIt took about 15 minutes to board a plane in the 1970s; now, it takes 30 to 40 minutes to board roughly 140 passengers on a domestic flight, according to research by Boeing, The New York Times reported.And airlines are cashing in on longer boarding times thanks to loyalty programs, which often allow passengers to board ahead of those without priority. The share of revenue generated by loyalty programs increased to 16% in 2021 from about 12% in 2019, Reuters reported.Last year, Delta saw $5.7 billion in cash sales from American Express and other partners, and American Airlines raked in $4.5 billion in cash payments from its partners including Citi and Barclays, according to the outlet.""The different boarding groups that we see today have emerged because people value their priority in boarding,"" Kerry Philipovitch, former senior vice president of customer service at American Airlines, told CNBC.

Hurricane Idalia touched down right outside Orlando's Disney World, but the storm didn't stop the park from opening for business.The Category 3 storm hit Florida's Big Bend around 8 a.m. yesterday, which is just a couple hours by car from the family-friendly park. Despite the inclement weather, Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, EPCOT, and Hollywood Studios remained open on Wednesday.However, the storm did temporarily close down Typhoon Lagoon Water Park, Winter Summerland Miniature Golf, and Fantasia Gardens Miniature Golf. All three attractions were operational on Thursday.



RELATED: 'The Actual Most Magical Place on Earth': Disney Employee Reveals Secret Discount Store Only Available to Disney Cast MembersAlthough the Magic Kingdom was up and running, Disney waived change and cancelation fees for those with check-in dates of Aug. 28 through Sept. 5 and offered guests currently at the resort to extend their stay until Aug. 31 to compensate for the weather, according to a statement from the park. Disney also offered 50% of a hotel stay for Florida residents who evaluated the storm and first responders.


Despite the offers, the park still garnered several patrons who appear to be unbothered by the rain, according to videos shared on social media. In several clips from park-goers, people can be seen enjoying the Magic Kingdom while wearing rain ponchos and stepping through wet conditions.RELATED: People Run for Cover, Wade Through Water as Mass Floods Wreak Havoc on Disney World@natalielupe Floridians dont let a storm stop them #disney #magickingdom #orlandoflorida #lakebuenavista #annualpassholder #hurricane #idalia ♬ Disneyland and DCA ride songs - Kelly@lbvtvtiktok Hurrican Idalia at Disney World #Disney #DisneyWorld #DisneyTikTok #DisneyParks #DisneyTok #DisneyAdult #DisneyFamily #DisneyTips #DisneySecrets #DisneyFan #DisneyLife #Hurricane #Rain #HurricaneIdalia #Idalia #Storm #DisneyPrincess #MagicKingdom #Disneyland #DisneyVacation #DisneyTrip ♬ Monkeys Spinning Monkeys - Kevin MacLeod & Kevin The Monkey@urlovev Hurricane Idalia Vlog at Magic Kingdom Guys this was actually so much fun!!!

Like many young couples, Austin Andrews and Jori Kerr wanted to travel but couldn't afford the sky-high expenses. Then Kerr stumbled upon a blog post touting the benefits of pet sitting.""I discovered we could stay in amazing homes around the world for free, caring for great animals,"" she recalls.They paid an annual fee (around $130/year) to join a service called Trusted House Sitters and waited for a response. After a few months, the couple from Bend, Oregon, got an invitation to go down to Grenada in the Caribbean for 14 days to care for a few pets.



The trip was magical, with endless sunsets, long walks on the beach, and free lodging.""That set our path. After that, we just knew that was what we wanted to do,"" says Andrews.


Two years later, the couple has made their love of travel and caring for animals a full-time job. Their company Nomads and Pawpads is a content marketing business that chronicles their adventures pet sitting in 11 countries in 5 different contents. In addition to staying in luxurious homes around the world for free, they earn up to $22,000 a month.Nomads and PawpadsRelated: These Dog Walkers Are Making $100,000 a YearStarting as a side hustleBefore launching Nomads and Pawpads, Andrews and Kerr were content just traveling the world taking care of pets as a side hustle.


Kerr worked at a brewery in customer service, and Andrews was a landscaper. They traveled during the winter when Andrews wasn't working, and Kerr could work remotely.Although their rent was free, they weren't getting paid to pet sit. Visa restrictions do not allow international house sitters to get paid for their work. House sitting is a free exchange. They occasionally received money to pet sit around the U.S., but international travel excited them. They needed to figure out a way to make it work.The solution: Write about their travels using affiliate marketing and social media collaborations to monetize. The couple uses their website, Instagram, and TikTok to market their pet-sitting lifestyle, offering advice, resources, and paid links to house exchange platforms such as Trusted House Sitters.Other popular pet-sitting sites include:HousesittersAmerica.comRover.comMindMyHouse.comAs content marketing revenue increased, they could quit their other jobs and take on full-time pet sitting. They now spend about 6 to 9 months out of the year abroad.


Some of their most memorable experiences include trips to the beaches of South Portugal and stays in Singapore and Hanoi.Most of the requests are easy—walk and feed the dog and/or cat, change the litter, give them fresh water, and light grooming. They're also asked to take out the garbage and collect the mail, simple requests that leave them plenty of free time to explore their location.But sometimes, pet owners require something a little out of the ordinary. Recently, they were asked to walk a cat in a stroller. They also had to feed a bearded dragon named Athena.""That was definitely one of our most exotic pets,"" says Andrews. ""But she was super easy.""Related: Do You Love Animals? Here Are 5 Ways You Can Turn Your Passion into Real MoneyIs pet sitting right for you?Pet sitting may sound like a fun and affordable way to see the world, but it's not for everyone. Andrews and Kerr believe there are a few traits you need to possess to make it work.You have to be an animal lover. Both Andrew and Kerr are big animal fans. Kerr grew up on a game bird farm with dreams of being a veterinarian. ""But I couldn't really handle the sad part of that,"" she says. ""Pet sitting is perfect because I still get to be around animals, and, you know, there are some stressful moments for sure.


You have to be flexible and creative. Travel schedules change, so you need to be willing to adapt. You also have to be creative about your going pay your way. Remember, international pet-sitting jobs only cover your housing costs. So you'll need to figure out how to pay for the rest of the trip. One bonus about Europe, says Andrews. ""It's much cheaper once you get there. It's like $60 to fly from Rome to Paris.""You have to be a good communicator. Make sure you're in good communication with the pet owners. Leaving your home and pets in the hands of strangers can be stressful. ""You wanna make sure everyone's comfortable and on the same page,"" says Andrews. Nomads and Pawpads

Airline passengers sick of cramped economy seating are paying up to enjoy more room and other perks up front.Now, some of the biggest carriers are trying to meet that demand by spending big on aircraft seating upgrades — a $2.6 billion market that's still growing, per AeroDynamic Advisory, CNBC reported.Related: A 'Very Frustrating' Issue Could Thwart Your Summer Air Travel



Delta, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines, American Airlines, Finnair and Lufthansa are among the airlines that have recently revealed ""upgraded first-class seats, suites with sliding doors or premium economy cabins,"" according to the outlet.Singapore Airlines and Emirates are two carriers going above and beyond: The former boasts newer first-class cabins with full-height doors, joining beds for travel companions, and the square footage of a small hotel room, and the latter features an onboard shower for first-class passengers on some aircraft, per CNBC.


Of course, the price difference can be stark. A Delta business class ticket between New York and London leaving September 15 and returning the next week starts at $3,787. The economy version of the same route begins at just $449.The Big Four domestic airlines, American, Delta, Southwest and United, have shrunk legroom pitch anywhere from two to five inches and seat width two inches since the 1980s, Condé Nast Traveler reported.And travelers, who are already paying exorbitant prices to fly, have had enough.Natalie Rasmussen, an application scientist who lives near San Jose, California, told CNBC that she refuses to fly economy on long-haul flights and recently paid $500 to upgrade on her Delta flight home from Europe.

Air travel became an even more unpleasant experience during the pandemic — with unruly passengers making headlines left and right.But cases of bad passenger behavior are down 80% since their peak in 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said, per NPR.The FAA recorded 5,973 cases of unruly passenger behavior in 2021 — and just 1,117 episodes in 2023 as of Monday.Related: Man Arrested At JFK Airport For Allegedly Peeing On PassengerThe incidents that unfolded between December 2021 and April 2023 included physical assault, yelling and cursing, vaping, refusing to remain seated, sexual misconduct toward flight attendants and sexually assaulting other passengers, including minors, and 22 of them were reported to the FBI.Some experts attribute the decline to relaxed Covid protocols and reduced stress levels. Others suggest that ""an overall increase in a feeling of self-entitlement"" and desire to assert authority post-pandemic mean that these kinds of incidents are here to stay, NBC News reported.Of the more than 5,000 disobedient passenger episodes in 2021, roughly 72% of them were traced to conflicts over masking rules, yet FAA data also reveals that such incidents remain relatively high, even with loosened mandates and lower incident rates overall, per the outlet.Related: Delta Pushes Airlines to Create a National 'No Fly' List of Unruly Passengers""Unruly behavior poses serious safety concerns for passengers and crew alike, which is why we are addressing this issue aggressively,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said, per NPR.

A United Airlines traveler had quite the turbulent trip when his excitement over receiving a first-class meal while in Economy Plus quickly turned sour. The incident turned into a confrontation with the cabin manager, who hinted at the possibility of adding the passenger to a no-fly list, Business Insider reported.The passenger, who was identified as Sam for privacy reasons, shared with Insider that his August 3 journey commenced in Madison, Wisconsin and ended in Seattle, with a layover in Denver.As a devoted United Airlines customer and a Premier 1K member of the MileagePlus frequent-flyer program, Sam was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to first class for the initial leg of his voyage. However, first-class passengers on his flight to Denver weren't given a meal due to a catering oversight. Still, the flight took off seamlessly, and Sam began to chat with one of the flight attendants.



For the next leg of his journey to Seattle, Sam was seated in the Economy Plus section on the same plane with the same cabin crew. On a whim, he playfully asked the flight attendant he had previously interacted with to save him a manicotti meal for the upcoming leg, if available.""At no point did I actually think she was going to do it. And if she did do it, great,"" Sam told Insider. ""I shot my shot.""Related: Viral Video Shows Passenger Punching Flight Attendant, Opening Emergency Exit DoorSam boarded the plane following a brief layover, and upon spotting the same flight attendant, he reminded her of his request. However, the cabin manager overheard their conversation and ""very rudely"" confronted Sam, he told the outlet, telling him that he could not receive a first-class meal in an economy seat, citing United's policy.However, the flight attendant discreetly brought him the manicotti and a fork after the first-class meal service concluded.""It was very discreet. She dropped it down, winked at me, and I said, 'Oh my gosh, thank you so much,'"" Sam told Insider. ""And that was it.""Nonetheless, the enjoyment was short-lived as the cabin manager confronted him once more.In a tone that was ""condescending"" and ""unprofessional,"" the cabin manager proceeded to ""verbally berate"" Sam, adding that she was writing him up, which could lead to being put on a no-fly list.But the manicotti fiasco continued: The cabin manager informed the captain of the situation. Following the flight, Sam took the initiative to approach the captain to explain. The captain extended an apology for the unsettling episode.Sam shared his experience on Reddit, garnering more than 450 comments with responses ranging from shock at the cabin manager's behavior — with some calling it ""ridiculous"" and ""disappointing"" — to others questioning Sam's perceived breach of airline rules.


""You wanted special treatment in economy and thought it would be ok to eat a first-class meal in front of other people who are not allowed to or am I missing something?"" one user wrote.Sam sent a three-page email detailing the series of events to United Airlines, and the airline's response was an apology and an assurance of an internal investigation involving the in-flight leadership and corporate security team.

83,How I Turned My Love for Travel Into a $50k a Month Business,"Aug 9, 2023",Nick Loper,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-i-turned-my-love-for-travel-into-a-50k-a-month-business/457143,"
What if your passion project could become a full-time income source in a few years?That's what Shelley Marmor did when she started her travel blog as a side hustle. The former corporate worker and travel magazine editor turned her Travel Mexico Solo and Travel Blogging 101 websites into a thriving online business.Today, Shelley's ventures generate over $50k monthly in revenue. She talks about it on a recent episode of The Side Hustle Show.Related: A Taylor Swift-Inspired Side Hustle Is Making People Tens of Thousands: 'Paid More Than My Full-Time Job' Origin storyDuring the spring of 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Shelley was at a career crossroads. She'd been working 15 years in corporate America and felt ""chewed up and spit out"" by her job.



Around this time, she'd been traveling solo in Mexico. She joined Facebook groups for travel bloggers, noticing that some were still earning good money with affiliate marketing during the pandemic—getting paid commissions by Airbnb when readers booked long pandemic getaway stays. She registered the domain in March 2020 and launched the site a month later.Early learningsInitially, Shelley wrote posts about her travels in Mexico. But she soon realized, ""Nobody cares about me traveling around Mexico. They care about how I can help them travel around Mexico.""On advice from other successful bloggers, Shelly invested in blogging courses to learn SEO and decided to focus just on Mexico.


She realized: ""I can't compete with 15-year-old sites like Nomadic Matt's. But in a niche, I can cut to the front of the line and find unicorn keywords with high search volume but low competition.""Shelley focused on questions and keywords travelers search for when planning Mexico trips, such as where to stay, what to do, is it safe, and packing tips. She didn't earn money in 2020 but started seeing profits in 2021.Affiliate marketingShelley didn't rely on ad revenue as her primary source of income. She focused on affiliate marketing commissions.She now has three sites on Mediavine and Raptive (former Adthrive). These are two premium ad networks for sites that offer industry-leading RPMs (revenue per thousand impressions).


By leveraging multiple ad networks, Shelley benefits from competition between the platforms and diversification. If one network's RPMs decrease or they lose major advertisers, she had a backup flow of ad revenue.Shelley uses Affilimate, an affiliate management plugin for WordPress.""I started making money before I had much traffic. The income came first, then traffic grew over time,"" she says.In fact, she never had a viral ""traffic explosion"" moment. Instead, it was many small wins that compounded.


Keyword researchFor keyword research, Shelly uses KeySearch. For new sites, she suggests filtering for competition levels below 30.If monetizing with affiliates, Shelly will optimize for buyer keywords even if it only has ten searches per month. She ranks quickly for high-ticket tours that pay $500 commissions.Shelley has written 180 posts, focusing on topic clusters such as ""things to do in Cozumel with kids / at night / when it rains.""Shelly says you have to ""crawl before you walk."" Ranking #1 for any keyword builds momentum faster than waiting for significant keywords. Traffic and income grow through small, compounding wins.


Related: 8 Things I Wish I'd Known Before Starting Affiliate MarketingGrowing her teamAfter about a year and a half, Shelly hired writers to help create content. She now has a team of 4 writers, an editor, and a blog manager.Shelly focuses on writing content herself for Travel Blogging 101, where she shares firsthand experiences and reviews products she uses.Travel Mexico Solo is now three years old. It has about 180 published articles and gets 300K monthly pageviews.Shelly estimates that's about 1 article per week on average over three years. She advises starting with what you can sustainably write yourself without burning out. Do just one quality post every two weeks if that's your limit because the articles compound over time.


By creating content tailored to specific audiences, you can recommend affiliate hotels that perfectly match their needs. ""The riches are in the niches,"" Shelly says.Here are the top affiliate opportunities in the travel space:Travel toursHotels/accommodationsTravel InsurancePhysical productsCar rentalsLink-building strategiesEarly on, Shelly did many guest posts to build backlinks, even though many avoid it because it seems like extra work for little payoff. Backlinks signal authority and trust to search engines like Google. The more reputable sites linking back to you, the higher you'll rank. Writing guest posts got her backlinks from established sites, essentially ""voting"" for her site.


Email marketingFor email marketing, Shelly has about 8,000 subscribers total across her sites. Her travel blogging list of 1,500 subscribers is more monetized than her Mexico travel list so far.Shelly has multiple opt-in offers tied to specific guides and content topics. A generic opt-in hasn't generated as much success for a vast region like Mexico. Opt-ins designed for specific niches deliver better conversion rates.Shelley has seen tremendous success through her weekly email campaigns. She structures her emails with a 50/50 split – delivering free, helpful tips to readers as well as promoting relevant products.This balanced approach keeps her community engaged while also driving revenue (She recently generated $3,500 in sales from a single product launch to her list).


The travel niche tends to be ""one and done"" visitors from Google. But email subscribers engage ongoingly regardless of algorithm changes.Google rolls out hundreds of updates per year. If your website gets caught in one, your organic search traffic could vanish even if you did everything right. You may never know exactly why.Facebook adjusted its algorithm years back. Facebook pages went from reaching all followers to only reaching a fraction without paying.Pinterest updated its algorithm, and bloggers lost massive amounts of traffic literally from one day to the next. These weren't spammers or low-quality sites; Pinterest simply deprioritized their content.While social and search algorithms are out of your control, Shelley emphasized email marketing as the most direct audience connection.Collecting emails from website visitors allows ongoing communication regardless of future algorithm changes.

""Maybe they could have a list … for how to take them up into the plane and secure them down into the plane,"" Loerzel suggested to the outlet of how airlines can improve transporting such items. ""Some wheelchairs, they have hooks and they could just hook it in, and that's how they keep it safe.""Bengston-Loerzel also suggested that special cargo needs to receive extra attention from staffers.

89,'Unprecedented Demand' for a Travel Essential Is Upending Summer Plans — and Costing People a Lot of Money,"Jul 10, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/unprecedented-passport-demand-costs-people-plans-money/455554,"
If you have international travel on the horizon, you'll want to renew or apply for your passport well in advance.But even that might not be enough: Summer plans nationwide are being thwarted by what the State Department is calling an ""unprecedented demand for passports,"" NPR reported. And to make matters worse, refunds aren't a guarantee.Related: Southwest CEO Got a 75% Pay Bump Before Travel Nightmare



One Maryland woman told the outlet she was hoping to surprise her 9-year-old daughter with a vacation to the Bahamas. Despite filing for her daughter's passport in March, it never came, leaving her ""emotionally drained"" and scrambling to figure out if she can get a voucher or credit for their flights.Another woman told NPR she'll be out $2,500 if she remains unable to acquire her passport and her second attempt to see her husband, who is deployed overseas, falls through.


Their predicaments are all too common. Although the State Department said the standard processing time for a new or renewed passport was 13 weeks in March, hopeful travelers are waiting much longer.Part of the issue? Skyrocketing interest in international travel post-pandemic. The State Department saw a record-breaking 500,000 applications per week between January and May, and that figure was still high at approximately 400,000 applications each week as of July, according to NPR.Related: United CEO Apologizes for Private Jet Use Amid Flight DelaysAmericans and others abroad are also facing an uphill battle.

Have you joined the growing number of people taking ""hush trips""? (Don't worry, we won't tell anyone.)A hush trip is a vacation that you take without telling your bosses — or using any precious PTO days. And it is an under-the-radar practice in today's work-from-home and hybrid landscape.Related: Here's Why Every Employee Should Have Unlimited Vacation Days



The hush trip trend was illuminated by a recent study conducted by Price4Limo.com, which surveyed 1,010 full-time employees working in America to find out their vacation habits, favorite destinations and time spent getting away from it all.The most interesting part is that last bit. ""Getting away from it all"" has taken on a new meaning these days. Forty-five percent of those surveyed said they have recently been on a ""workcation,"" which means they left home for a sunnier destination but sat on the beach building spreadsheets rather than sandcastles. Sounds fun, right?


The top three reasons respondents gave for taking a workcation were:Visiting family or friendsNeeded a change of sceneryWanted an off-hours vacation while maintaining productivity at workThese reasons, the study writers say, ""underscore Americans' desire for a better work-life balance."" (Working through vacation days doesn't sound very balanced to us, but we're not here to tell anyone how to live their lives.)Related: 3 Steps to That Unplugged, Peace-of-Mind Vacation People Talk About These workcations come with an agreement between employers and employees (""Yes, I will be away and yes, you can pester me with emails all day long."") But hush trips? That's a whole different deal.


Hush vacations involve pretending to work from home while you are actually swimming up to the pool bar instead.Experts that Price4Limo.com consulted say that hush trips are problematic for many reasons, primarily the possibility of losing trust or getting canned if your superiors find out. Is it worth the stress knowing you could easily get busted if a volleyball game breaks out behind you during a Zoom call? We have to believe that if you are taking a hush trip, you're probably not very invested in keeping your job, so stress might not factor in too much.Related: I Worked From Vegas Without Telling My Boss.

93,5 Tips for Keeping Business Travel Simple and Stress-Free,"Jun 23, 2023",Par Chadha,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/5-tips-for-keeping-travel-simple-and-stress-free/454017,"
Back in 1977, I took my first airplane ride — internationally. The economy seats barely moved, and I sat in an aisle seat. Whenever the person on the inside seat wanted to get up, I had to get up. For 23 hours, there was nothing to do.Fortunately, this isn't how business travel by plane works today, but airline travel still has its kinks. As a professional traveler, I've learned many strategies that can smooth out many of them.Related: 7 Tips for Successful International Business Travel



1. Prepare your wardrobe for worst-case scenariosI once flew to Prague just before Christmas. The airline lost track of my bags. I could survive most everything as I was, but you can't survive winter in Prague without a hat. I got a really nice one made with fur from a wolf from Siberia. Apparently, my experience is common enough in that part of the world that people saw my hat, knew what had happened and forgave the rest of what I was wearing.Since then, my wife and I have lost our bags many times. We finally decided to change our wardrobe to be completely multi-weather, business athleisure. Rain, cold, heat, exercising, meetings — we have all the tools we need to be professional and stay fit. Everything we bring collapses, works in layers, rolls into small packages and doesn't have many creases when we pull it out to wear.


2. Get a sturdy but lightweight carry-on you can organize wellThe last thing you want when you are pulling your suitcase through the airport is for the wheels on your bag to break. Investing a little more in something lightweight and durable that meets the airline's regulations is better. You'll be more comfortable, and if anything happens to your other bags, your carry-on can hold all the necessary items you need to get by.Once you've got a bag that works well, taking five minutes to separate what's essential makes it easy to show personnel what you have. Your electronics, wires, toiletries and liquids should be easy for security to check. Being prepared means there is less chance of being pulled for a secondary bag check, or worse, your stuff going home with someone else.Related: Will Business Travel Ever Return to Normal?3. Do your researchIf I go to London, what's the fastest way to get into the city from the airport? (I've learned it's the train.) Will the hotel send a car for you? (I know now that it can be expensive, but the cost can be worth it to avoid getting lost.) Get familiar with your travel destination so you know the basics of what to expect, and find out how you can handle the trip's logistics.


One area people often forget to research is what scams they might run into. In Stockholm, Sweden, for instance, many taxi drivers are freelance. They don't have the regulations you might be used to in New York City or other parts of the world. They will simply quote different prices — one driver might charge you $30, while another could charge you $100.4. Be prepared to go slow on languageLearning the spoken language of the country you are visiting isn't feasible. If you're in a country where English is not the primary language, I have found speaking slowly and using hand gestures is the best way to communicate. If you try to speak at your normal language speed, people may not be able to decipher you. Additionally, there are many easy-to-use digital language translators now that can help. I love gadgets, so I even plan to get one for my next trip. But communicating has never been a handicap.In my experience of traveling to around 30+ countries, I've found it is rare for people not to find some way to communicate with me in English.5. Stay rested, fed and hydratedMost of the stress of travel comes from being hungry, thirsty and tired. To beat these common problems, I bring food with me — especially if I know I will not like what's available on the plane. We all know what they say about airplane food. I also buy sparkling water or use a refillable metal water bottle.


Once you've had some snacks and water, try to get some rest, if possible. No matter how long your flight is, a nap after you have had something good to eat or drink ensures you arrive refreshed and ready to go.Related: Travel Trends Every Company Should KnowIt's not perfect, but you can make it much betterThere will always be stressful parts of travel you cannot change — the airport may always be crowded, and a baby may always be crying, but you can greatly reduce your stress by being proactive in the core areas outlined above. Other strategies like taking advantage of frequent flyer programs to reduce cost, booking in advance, carrying a good quality noise canceling headset and using airline wifi to get a headstart on business, can also reduce tension and friction. Whether you are traveling for business or pleasure, preparation is key to ensuring a smooth and successful journey.

97,"'Revenge Spending' Is Showing Signs of Cooling — Good for Inflation, Bad for Some Businesses","Jun 14, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/what-is-revenge-spending-how-does-it-impact-the-economy/454120,"
The pandemic upended our day-to-day norms (and spending habits). As the lockdowns swept the country, people saved money on categories that were closed or restricted, such as dining out, traveling, or going to the movies.However, when restrictions cooled and the world opened up again, so did millions of wallets — enter: ""revenge spending.""Typically used by economists, revenge spending happens after an ""unprecedented economic event"" (like the pandemic), which in turn causes an increase in consumer spending beyond normal levels as individuals feel an urgency to spend to ""make up for lost time,"" according to the Corporate Finance Institute.



When vaccine mandates were lifted and the lockdown ended, a spike in recreational and travel spending ensued, which in turn caused an increase in demand and, of course, prices (notice higher than normal airfare lately?).While there has been a confluence of factors that contributed to the rampant level of inflation of the past year, revenge spending didn't exactly help keep it in check.


""People want to get back out and do things they haven't done for the past two years,"" Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, told CNN in April of 2022 when revenge spending was running rampant. ""They will complain about prices but they are still going out to spend.""Related: What Causes Inflation? Everything You Need To Know.Is 'Revenge Spending' Slowing Down?However, as recession fears loom and the economy remains uncertain, revenge spending is cooling, and so might inflation, the New York Times reported. If the slowdown of revenge spending continues, it could help bring down inflation in the same way it contributed to an uptick in prices for certain services.""We see some slowing in so-called revenge categories,"" Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior U.S. economist at BNP Paribas, told the outlet.Omair Sharif, the founder of Inflation Insights, added that he doesn't anticipate the same surge in prices for airfare and hotels compared to last year.""We're just not getting the same kind of pop any longer,"" he told The Times. ""Airfares have pretty much stalled out.""In May, average airfare dropped by nearly 13% compared to the same period in 2022, and hotel prices rose at a significantly lower rate (3%) year-over-year, as compared to the nearly 19% year-over-year increase from 2021 to 2022.Related: 'We're All Worse Off': Top Economist Says People Need to Accept That Everyone Is Poorer in Today's Economy

Cigarette use among U.S. adults has declined in recent decades, but roughly 12% of Americans say they're smokers, per the CDC.Although fewer public spaces accommodate the habit today, the casinos aboard some major cruise ships have been a safe bet — until recently.

If you're flying to a vacation destination this summer, you might want to prepare for the worst (travel experience, that is).Air travel will be impacted by ""very frustrating"" supply chain issues this year, Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, told CNBC.Related: Report: One U.S. State Is Contributing to Widespread Flight Delays, CancelationsAccording to Walsh, engine part shortages will be especially felt — which could then hold up the delivery of new aircraft from manufacturers. A lack of air traffic control staff introduces yet another challenge, he added.There's a high global demand for planes and not enough of them to go around, Reuters reported last month. Airbus and Boeing are seeing billions of dollars of new orders extending past 2030 as interest in air travel continues to surge, per the outlet.Just like last year, people are embracing travel formerly derailed by the pandemic: Flight searches are up 25% with a significant interest in international destinations, according to Expedia.Related: Swarm Of Bees Takes Over Airplane, Causes Three-Hour DelayThe plane and staff shortages are ""outside of"" airlines' and airports' control, Walsh said, but he remains ""optimistic"" for the industry, which is set to return to profitability this year.

If you think putting your checked bag on a scale is overwhelming, imagine stepping on it yourself.Air New Zealand announced on Tuesday that it is conducting a survey to find the average weight of travelers on international flights. The carrier said it conducts the survey every five years.""For safety reasons, we need to know the weight of all items onboard the aircraft,"" the airline said.



One's weight can be an incredibly intimate thing to share (especially in a public place), so if you're imagining your weight being displayed on a sprawling overhead screen before getting onto your flight, don't fret. The carrier added that the scales don't display the weight, but rather the number is immediately ""fed into a computer"" and ""recorded anonymously.""Related: These Are the Best and Worst Airlines of 2023 So Far, According to a New Report


It's worth noting that the process is voluntary, and passengers can simply skip the scale if they choose. Passengers will be weighed before they reach their gates, and the airline said the survey will ""not delay flights."" Air New Zealand aims to obtain weights of at least 10,000 passengers, according to NPR.""We weigh everything that goes on the aircraft — from the cargo to the meals onboard, to the luggage in the hold,"" Alastair James, a load control specialist for Air New Zealand, told the outlet.

104,American Airlines and JetBlue Ordered To Cease Partnership in the Northeast U.S. By Justice Department,"May 22, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/american-airlines-jetblue-ordered-to-end-northeast-alliance/452627,"
American Airlines and JetBlue must break their Northeast Alliance partnership., U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin ruled in Boston on Friday.The ruling comes five months after a multi-week trial that began in September 2022 and concluded in December. The Justice Department originally sued the airlines in September 2021 to block the partnership, stating that it increased airfare and caused a reduction in choices for Americans in several domestic markets.""Today's decision is a win for Americans who rely on competition between airlines to travel affordably,"" said attorney general Merrick B. Garland in a statement. ""The Justice Department will continue to protect competition and enforce our antitrust laws in the heavily consolidated airline industry and across every industry.""



Related: American Airlines Sued After Teen Dies of Heart Attack Onboard Flight to MiamiSorokin ruled that the airlines have 30 days to cease their partnership.


""We believe the decision is wrong and are considering next steps,"" American Airlines told Entrepreneur. ""The Court's legal analysis is plainly incorrect and unprecedented for a joint venture like the Northeast Alliance.""JetBlue said it is ""disappointed in the decision"" in a statement to Entrepreneur and added that the company is ""studying the judgment in full and evaluating our next steps as part of the legal process.""What is the Northeast Alliance?The Northeast Alliance launched in early 2021 and combines JetBlue and American Airlines operations at four major airports (Boston Logan, John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty) through codesharing (offering seats on each other's flights) and slot swaps (pooling their gates as well as takeoff and landing times).The partnership was intended to offer more options for flyers in the Northeast through broader schedules and expanded perks to consumers such as frequent flyer reciprocity and loyalty benefits that can be used between the two carriers, according to the airlines.


However, according to the original complaint, the Justice Department claimed it would cause ""hundreds of millions of dollars in harm"" to American travelers and that fair competition is ""essential"" for consumers to travel ""affordably and safely.""The complaint also stated that one aspect of the partnership (where the two airlines traded information such as flight schedules, routes, and which planes to use for each flight) was an ""unprecedented combination"" and would cause an uptick in prices and a decline in options.

108,How One Leader Has Persevered Through 20 Years of Change in the Travel Industry,"May 16, 2023",Jason Nazar,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/one-travel-exec-shares-his-9-best-leadership-tips/450545,"
For this episode of my Leadership Lessons series, I had the chance to talk to the CEO of the world's leading provider of online travel about how to lead through uncertain times and survive a downturn. The amazing Glenn Fogel, president and CEO of Booking Holdings, is one of the most engaging, charismatic and thoughtful folks I've ever hosted.With products and services available in more than 220 countries and territories, Booking Holdings — the parent company of Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK and OpenTable, as well as subsidiary brands including Rocketmiles, Fareharbor, HotelsCombined, Cheapflights and Momondo — operates in more than 40 languages across Europe, North America, South America, the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and Africa.Related: One Founder's Super-Sized Side Hustle Is Helping Small Businesses — and It's On Track to Generate More Than $50 Million This Year



Fogel joined Booking Holdings (then known as Priceline.com) in February 2000 after stints as a trader at a global asset management firm and an investment banker specializing in the air transportation industry. Two weeks after he joined, the stock market peaked and the dot-com bubble burst. Soon after, the September 11 attacks happened, hampering people's desire to travel. And when the 2020 pandemic hit, the industry was shattered yet again. So there's no better leader to get advice from than this one.Below are nine essential lessons from my conversation with this inspiring and gifted leader:


1. As bad as things can be, they will get better. Be resilient.Fogel has time-earned wisdom. He's been at Booking.com over the most tumultuous periods in recent American history, so he's seen the ebb and flow of markets with great clarity. Despite spikes in post-Covid ""revenge travel,"" Fogel reminded me that travel will always be top-of-mind for people because most of their fondest memories are on vacations or trips. Plus, traveling to someplace new is always on someone's bucket list. So the industry will always rebound after a downturn.2. Keep employees happy and challenged, and they'll stick around.If they like what they're doing, they probably won't think about leaving your company. Life is short, so there's no justification for them to stay somewhere they dislike.Related: What Has This 100-Year-Old Business Done to Ensure Its Longevity? Its CEO Follows These 7 Leadership Principles.3. When it comes to M&A, always consider the value and the pitfalls.When thinking about acquiring a company or merging with one, be cautious. Most deals don't work out for the buyer. You need to dive deep into if the deal will create value and help the customer, and also how it could go wrong.


4. If you acquire a company and its existing employees are necessary to run the ship, make sure they're incentivized to stay.Like a marriage, Fogel says, both sides have to want to be in it after the wedding.5. Every day is a fight if you want to keep succeeding.People will always come up with new ideas to do the things you're doing in different ways. For travel, there are so many alternatives now. The best defense against newcomers is to make sure you're providing value so that people still feel the best way to do this transaction is through your company.Related: 'Everyone's Got a Story of How the Healthcare System Has Fallen Short.' This Founder Is on a Mission to Change That.6. You'll always have a chance to improve.Your lifespan will include many ""lives,"" so a career is never definitive. In the end, you're just as human as the next person, and your story will be a long one. You'll have opportunities to do better.


7. Work hard but efficiently.Remember that no matter how hard you work, you will likely never feel the job is finished. But at least if you do it efficiently, you can spend more time with the people you love to make that work worthwhile.8. As with most things in life, always ask yourself WHY before making a decision.For example, if your goal is to be a CEO, figure out why you want to be one first. Make sure it's for the right reasons, and be prepared to constantly strive to do better.9. Make things more convenient for the customer, and you'll have fans for life.Everything should be easier with technology, but that's not always the case. Customers yearn for a simple all-in-one experience, like local travel agents used to offer before the internet disrupted that method. Fogel says his company rectifies that need by offering ""a connected trip.""For more from my hour with Fogel, watch the full webinar here.

109,"Despite Recession Fears and Skyrocketing Airfare, Americans Are Traveling at Record Rates, According to a New Report","May 15, 2023",Madeline Garfinkle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/memorial-day-travel-expected-to-be-busy-despite/452181,"
Despite inflation and ongoing fears of a looming recession, Americans are projected to travel beyond pre-pandemic levels on Memorial Day weekend, which may signal an upward trend for the rest of the summer.According to a report by automotive and travel organization, AAA, 42.3 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more this Memorial Day weekend — about 2.7 million (or 7%) more miles than last year.The federal holiday unofficially marks the start of the summer season, and travel stats from the long weekend typically signal what's ahead in the coming months, AAA reps said.



""This is expected to be the third busiest Memorial Day weekend since 2000 when AAA started tracking holiday travel,"" said Paula Twidale, senior vice president of AAA Travel, in the report. ""More Americans are planning trips and booking them earlier, despite inflation.""AAA's booking data also shows that airfare to top destinations for Memorial Day rose 40% this year, but 3.4 million Americans will still fly to their destinations — an 11% increase from 2022, and beyond pre-pandemic levels with an increase of 5.4% compared to 2019.


Related: These Are The Busiest Airports In The World — And Half Are In the U.S.""This summer travel season could be one for the record books, especially at airports,"" Twidale added.Still, with gas prices lower now than last year, many travelers will also be hitting the road. About 37.1 million Americans will drive to their destinations, according to the AAA report, an increase of over 2 million compared to 2022. Additionally, transport on trains and buses for the upcoming holiday weekend is expected to increase by 20.6% from 2022.The AAA travel forecast comes nearly a week after Airbnb reported record-high bookings in the first quarter of 2023, with cross-border bookings increasing by 36%. According to a survey in February by the U.S. Travel Association, 23% of Americans plan to travel for leisure in 2023, with about 52% intending to go somewhere in the next six months.
