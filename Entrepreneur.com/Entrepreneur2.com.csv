0,Your Service Should Go Way Beyond Sales. 4 Ways to Build Long-lasting Relationships With Distributors and Retailers,"Apr 24, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-to-build-long-lasting-relationships-with-retailers/472800,"
Business partnerships can make or break your company's success. Strong business partnerships lead to enhanced efficiency, innovation and staff retention, driving long-term success.I've witnessed my brand become among the top ten in RTD spirit sales across the US despite only selling in eleven states. Much of our 'unprecedented' success isn't unprecedented at all. It stems from a hardline focus on investing in building meaningful business relationships. We launched in 2019 and flourished even when most restaurants and bars couldn't stock our products. While many other factors saw us through those uncertain times, our thriving business relationships proved vital.While no one can predict the future, it is important to build pillars to help your company remain stable and scale during uncertain times. To build robust foundational success for your startup, small business, or freelance endeavors, read the four tips below on building long-lasting business relationships.



Related: Why These 5 Characteristics of Self-Reliance Will Guarantee Your SuccessTip 1. ""Expect Ingratitude."" — Dale Carnegie.My first tip could seem counterintuitive to the untrained eye. Yet, my years of trial and error have opened my eyes to the truth about the famed Dale Carnegie quote, ""Expect ingratitude."" This first tip is the foundation for my remaining suggestions, and it's a notion all professionals and entrepreneurs must appreciate and grasp. Expecting ingratitude isn't as pessimistic as it may appear. It's pragmatic and realistic, preventing disappointment because you won't over-inflate your expectations.


Managing expectations goes hand in hand with business success. In doing so, there won't be any blame game when things go wrong, as they inevitably do. There will only be a streamlined focus on solving the problem, taking full ownership of our actions, and driving the business forward. Instead of facing a string of disappointments, insightfully managed expectations strike a balance between unbridled ambition and remaining grounded, keeping your trajectory upward. Stay grounded but aim high, ensuring a win for everyone involved when outcomes exceed expectations.Related: Successful Businesses Have This One Thing in CommonTip #2: Take accountabilityIf something is not working, take ownership of the result. For example, while many across the sector complain distributors and retailers don't do enough for sales, at my company, Carbliss, we take a different approach.Our philosophy is the reality: Distributors provide logistical services to transport products from 'A' to 'B,' while retailers offer the platform to sell. It's not our partners' job to move the products off the shelves; it's ours. When products don't sell, we don't point fingers at our partners. Rather, we look inward and ask how we can improve. We take ownership and accountability for product sales.


Removing these burdens from our partners' shoulders has enabled us to cultivate a symbiotic relationship with them. We support them by letting them do what they do and expecting nothing more, and they support us by doing their job and then some. It's collaboration at its purest and most productive. Stay accountable to increase your collaboration.Tip #3: Offer substance instead of empty gestures.Strong business partnerships don't require glamorous dinner parties or appreciation galas. Perhaps it can mean elbow grease, facetime and handshakes. Be involved beyond emails and phone calls. Insert yourself into the action to prove you're a partner willing to roll up your sleeves and get involved, not just ""another brand.""Your business partners care far less about being wine and dined. Like our distributors and retailers, they'll respond best when you make them feel supported, valued, and part of something bigger.Tip #4: Be honest and transparentHow can your business prove its commitment to your partners' success? It starts with honesty and transparency about your offerings and expectations. Setting expectations immediately and sticking to them builds trust and respect. These efforts often yield pleasantly surprising positive outcomes. Even when outcomes don't get met, keep your business partners involved and stay honest, and this will pay off in the long run. These efforts go far in building lasting relationships.


Related: Stop Lying and Start Being Radically Honest With Your TeamWhen your products can double as commodities, the partners bringing them to market (e.g., distributors and retailers) are as pivotal to your success as your customers. Thus, your partners require a brand experience similar to what you offer customers. Try these suggestions to build thriving business relationships, cultivate loyalty and foster success.

1,More Companies Are Rushing to Hire A Chief AI Officer — But Do You Need One? Here's What You Need to Know.,"Apr 23, 2024",Mike Murchison,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/more-companies-are-rushing-to-hire-a-chief-ai-officer/472366,"
This spring, the U.S. government took an unprecedented step: requiring every U.S. agency to appoint a chief AI officer. This follows on the heels of companies across diverse industries adding similar roles to their leadership ranks.This is a move in the right direction for companies seeking to integrate AI, but it's not enough on its own. Yes, every company must become an AI company. But expecting a chief AI officer to get the job done alone is shortsighted.When businesses are confronted with a major technological shift, often their knee-jerk reaction is to stick with what they know: Putting a new executive in charge and hoping they can solve everything. But for AI to truly take root in a company, people at all levels of the business need to get their hands on it and start innovating, not follow orders from a gatekeeper in the C-suite.



In fact, the fastest way to integrate AI into a company, in some instances, maybe to skip the chief AI officer role altogether.Related: The Future Founder's Guide to Artificial Intelligence


Why having a chief AI officer might not make senseCompanies appointing a chief AI officer have good intentions as they seek to avoid getting disrupted by the technology. But they may not need this role, and any business adding it should assume that it's temporary.A useful comparison is the stampede in the middle of the last decade to appoint chief digital officers to oversee the digital transformation to internet and mobile technologies. In hindsight, that looks quaint.Experts pronounced CDO the next big executive title, but it often turned out to be little more than window dressing — especially when digital skills became table stakes for most employees. In recent years, companies have been ditching the role or folding it into other jobs. In digitally native businesses, it doesn't exist at all.Google, for instance, never had a CDO directing how employees use web technology. Instead, they empowered employees to explore tools on their own through initiatives like 20% time, setting the stage for innovations such as Gmail.


Likewise, AI-native companies don't have an executive overseeing AI. That would be redundant. At companies like mine, the technology is embedded from day one across the organization rather than siloed in a single role.By default, we all leverage AI. Our marketing team uses it to better understand our customer base, our engineers deploy it to help write code, and our customer support leans heavily on AI agents. AI is written into every role, much like digital literacy now is at nearly all companies. Of course, there are areas of our business where we could use AI more and better, but making that happen doesn't call for a specific job title. It's everyone's responsibility.A better way to usher in an AI transformationBut I realize that not every company is built from the ground up on AI. So, how can legacy companies make real strides in integrating the technology?In place of the top-down response to organizational change, consider a bottom-up approach. For a company that wants to usher in an AI transformation, the first step is to look across the roles you're already hiring for and pick a few where AI agents can do the job today.


Customer service is an obvious place to start — today's AI agents can now address most issues at least as well as humans. AI sales development representatives (SDRs) are also making an immediate impact, automating much of the toil involved in pursuing prospects. Another promising area — junior data analyst roles, which often consist of pulling information from reports. Then there's coding. Autonomous software engineering agent Devin and OpenDevin, its open-source rival, can step in here.Choosing the right technology partner to provide AI tools is equally important. When it comes to customer service, for example, companies should look for a vendor whose AI agents have a track record of resolving most issues without human intervention. Rather than following a script, they should have some ability to reason, drawing on past interactions and the conversation at hand to determine the best solution for each customer's unique problem.Then, it's important to treat your agents more like employees than like a piece of software that will work straight out of the box. Onboarding, measuring and coaching — the same steps you'd take to develop any new hire — are essential to get the most out of AI tools.The upside here is having team members experiment with AI begins to build AI expertise inside the company. For example, my company works with a financial services firm where AI employee manager has become a key position. Former customer support specialists there now teach AI agents new skills that add value throughout the business — thus making themselves an indispensable member of the team.Companies can even make driving productivity gains via AI a criterion for career advancement. To get promoted, an employee must show their manager how they're applying AI to deliver results for the business.Related: How Generative AI is Revamping Digital Transformation to Change How Businesses ScaleThe next stage: Those departments grow into mini centers of excellence that spread AI knowledge and best practices throughout the organization. Team members educate the rest of the business on how to hire and coordinate AI labor. AI becomes integrated into day-to-day business operations in a way that's hard to achieve with an exclusively top-down approach.


Of course, there's no one best way to take a company through an AI transformation. For legacy industries and large enterprises, a tandem approach — combining top-down and bottom-up — may prove a better fit.At the very least, organizations that want to get the transformation right should think about how they can help AI bubble up through the ranks, rather than just rush to hire a chief AI officer simply because others have taken that step. As AI permanently changes companies from top to bottom, it's just a temporary solution.

2,How Startups Can Boost Team Morale and Drive Success Through Recognition,"Apr 23, 2024",Mike Szczesny,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-boost-team-morale-and-success-through-employee/472802,"
The art of celebrating team milestones has evolved into a crucial leadership skill. A recent study by Nectar, an employee recognition software company, found that nearly 84% of employees say that recognition affects their motivation to succeed at work, and nearly eight in 10 people admit that they'd be more productive if they were recognized more frequently.The benefits of a high-recognition culture extend beyond mere statistics. Teams that feel valued and acknowledged tend to exhibit higher levels of innovation and ownership — attributes that are indispensable for a startup's agility and adaptability.For new ventures, the first few years are a time of intense growth and inevitable challenges. It's during this formative phase that the seeds of company culture take root. Establishing a tradition of recognition early on can have a profound effect on shaping the team's dynamics. Startups like Slack and Airbnb have integrated milestone celebrations into their operational rhythms, acknowledging sales and funding successes as well as product launches, positive customer feedback and team members' personal growth achievements.



Related: The Importance of Recognizing Your EmployeesAcknowledgement needs to be genuineCelebrating milestones is not just about recognizing the past or present; it's about inspiring for the future. It serves as a motivational carrot, guiding the team through the next series of goals and challenges. By publicly celebrating milestones, startups also craft their narrative in the broader industry context, signaling success to potential investors, partners and future employees.


However, the approach to recognition must be genuine and aligned with the startup's values. Hollow gestures or a one-size-fits-all approach can backfire, leading to cynicism and a disengaged workforce. Tailoring recognition programs to fit the unique culture and individual achievements of team members ensures that the act of recognition is both meaningful and reinforces the desired company culture.As such, the entrepreneurial journey demands more than just financial savvy and strategic planning; it requires a keen understanding of human motivation and team dynamics. Recognizing milestones is a way for leaders to show that they value their team's contributions, creating a sense of belonging and shared purpose that can propel a startup toward sustainable growth and innovation.Recognition fuels motivation and engagementWithout a doubt, recognition serves as a critical motivator that enhances employee engagement and drives performance. For entrepreneurs and startup leaders who'd like to improve their recognition capabilities, here are a few considerations:1. Set clear milestonesThe act of setting clear milestones is rooted in the principle of Management by Objectives (MBO), a widely endorsed management philosophy proposed by Peter Drucker. MBO emphasizes the importance of aligning individual objectives with the overall strategic goals of the organization, thereby ensuring that every team member is working toward a common endpoint. By setting clear and achievable targets, startups create a focused and energized workforce.


Setting milestones goes beyond just establishing objectives, however. It's about creating a narrative for the startup's journey. This narrative helps team members visualize their path to success and understand how their contributions move the company forward. Milestones act as chapters in the startup's story, each with its own set of goals, challenges and opportunities for growth.Incorporating behavioral insights into milestone setting can also enhance effectiveness. According to the Goal Setting Theory by Locke and Latham, high performance is linked to specific and challenging goals. Startups that effectively communicate these targets create an environment of high achievement. For example, Twitter, during its early growth phase, made use of specific user growth targets as milestones, which were instrumental in driving the company's product development and marketing strategies.Related: 5 Goal-Setting Guidelines That Drive Success2. Celebrate achievements publiclyPublic recognition leverages the innate human need for social status and belonging, tapping into intrinsic motivation that can elevate performance and foster a strong workplace culture. When a startup takes the time to spotlight its team's successes, it sends a message that each member's work is valued and impactful. This is particularly powerful in smaller organizations, where individual contributions can have a substantial effect on the company's trajectory.


Celebrating achievements in a public forum, such as through social media or industry events, extends the reach of this recognition. It transforms internal milestones into opportunities for branding and networking, positioning the company as a thriving and supportive environment. This external recognition can be pivotal for startups looking to attract top talent and can often lead to increased interest from potential investors who are keen to back a winning team.Additionally, public recognition provides an authentic narrative for the company's progress and work culture. In the digital age, where employer review sites like Glassdoor and social media channels can heavily influence a company's reputation, authentic stories of achievement and recognition are valuable for the employer brand. When done right, these stories can resonate with the values and aspirations of prospective employees and customers.3. Incorporate meaningful rewardsBy rewarding employees after the completion of a milestone, you encourage the repetition of the behavior that led to the success. This strategy is aligned with the law of effect, a theory developed by Edward Thorndike, which states that behaviors followed by pleasant outcomes are likely to be repeated.The keyword here is ""meaningful."" For rewards to have the desired effect, they must resonate with the recipients on a personal level. This requires a nuanced understanding of the team's values and preferences. A reward that feels generic or disconnected from the effort expended can fall flat or even have a demotivating effect. For example, a trophy store might be able to create a special award that's a source of pride for one employee, while another might find an extra day off or educational opportunities more rewarding.


Adobe's Kickbox program is an excellent example of an employee recognition initiative that empowers employees to innovate and pursue their ideas. It does this by providing a physical ""Kickbox"" that contains everything an employee might need to brainstorm, develop and test a new concept, including a guide with six distinct levels designed to steer the ideation process from inception to pitch. The most notable inclusion in the box is a $1,000 prepaid credit card which employees can spend with no strings attached, enabling them to prototype or test their ideas without having to justify the expense or navigate through layers of bureaucracy.Related: Do Your Employees Feel Recognized? 10 Powerful Ways to Set Up Employee Recognition Programs4. Foster a culture of appreciationWhen appreciation is woven into the very fabric of company culture, it can transform the workplace into a hub of positivity and productivity. In September 2023, Workhuman and Gallup released a report that found that ""employees who strongly agree that recognition is an important part of their organization's culture are 3.7 times as likely to be engaged, 3.8 times as likely to feel connected to their culture, and half as likely to experience burnout than those who do not.""A culture of appreciation is particularly important in startups, where the pace is fast and the workload can be intense. In such settings, small gestures of acknowledgment can go a long way in making team members feel seen and valued for their contributions. For example, a platform that allows peers to give micro-bonuses to each other for day-to-day accomplishments can establish a sense of appreciation that comes directly from colleagues, not just from top-down leadership.


Remember, a culture of appreciation must be inclusive and diverse in its recognition practices. It should acknowledge the different roles, efforts and accomplishments across the company, ensuring that no contribution goes unnoticed. This includes recognizing the efforts of support staff, interns or remote workers who contribute just as significantly to the company's success.

3,How Mindset Plays a Role in Your Entrepreneurial Success,"Apr 23, 2024",Joseph Camberato,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-mindset-plays-a-role-in-your-entrepreneurial-success/472788,"
When you consider the different factors that contribute to your success as an entrepreneur, mindset may not be the first thing that comes to mind. Mindset may not seem important as you move from task to task, but it has a significant impact on how you run your business.Successful entrepreneurs have a different mindset than everyone else, and it affects how they run their businesses.Let's look at seven mindset shifts you must embrace as an entrepreneur and why each one matters.Related: Why Mindset Matters for Success1. Reframe failureMany people believe that failure is the opposite of success, but failure is actually a necessary step toward success. Failure is a part of every entrepreneur's journey — Walt Disney, Steve Jobs and Arianna Huffington all experienced significant setbacks. What matters is how you react to failure and turn it into something positive.



Look at every setback as an opportunity to learn something new and practice resilience. Failure is often the catalyst for innovation — research shows that companies that encourage risk-taking and try new ideas perform better in the market.2. Thinking bigSuccessful entrepreneurs have big, ambitious goals for their businesses. The best way to achieve more is to set higher goals and push yourself beyond what you believe is possible.Most people get into entrepreneurship because they are naturally big thinkers. However, it's easy to lose this mindset when you're focused on your business's daily operations. To some extent, this is normal — your employees have to get paid, and there are daily to-do lists that must be completed.But if you aren't careful, you can lose sight of your bigger vision for your business. Thinking big helps you break out of this mindset and see opportunities you might have missed otherwise.


3. Take calculated risksIt's impossible to start a business or launch a product without some degree of risk, so entrepreneurs need to get good at taking calculated risks. When you take a calculated risk, you accept a certain likelihood of failure because it can potentially move your business forward. It's an informed decision based on market data, not a haphazard choice based on feelings.The key is learning when it pays to take a risk and when it doesn't. Start developing a decision-making framework to help you lay out the facts, evaluate your options, make a decision and commit to seeing it through.4. Continue learningThe most successful entrepreneurs are known for embracing continuous learning. For example, Bill Gates is known for being a voracious reader and regularly shares thoughts on his favorite books. When he goes on vacation, he spends about three hours a day reading and taking notes as he reads.Continuous learning can take many different forms, such as reading, attending industry events or taking courses. Expanding your knowledge and honing your skills gives you an edge over your competitors.

Embrace a growth mindsetThe term growth mindset refers to an individual's belief that their skills and abilities can improve with effort. In comparison, individuals with a fixed mindset believe that their personality and abilities are fixed traits that don't really change.A growth mindset gives you the resilience to adapt and move through challenging situations. It allows you to learn from mistakes and find the necessary resources to grow your business.If you want to launch a new product, a growth mindset allows you to test and iterate on your idea. Instead of viewing negative feedback or slow sales as a sign you should give up, you can use this feedback to improve your product offering.


6. Focus on providing valueSuccessful entrepreneurs focus on providing value rather than just making more money. This can be a challenging mindset shift to make because we all need money to pay our bills and buy the things we want.But when you focus on making money as your end goal, it's easy to become short-sighted and make every decision based on maximizing your profits now. If your customers don't receive value from your products or services, you can't build a sustainable business long-term.7. ResourcefulnessWhen you're starting a business, time and money are almost always in short supply, and unexpected problems will arise. You have to learn to be resourceful and find creative solutions to problems.Being resourceful also means being flexible and willing to adapt to a constantly changing environment. For example, the most resourceful entrepreneurs were able to pivot during Covid-19, adjust their business strategy and identify new opportunities.

While those things are certainly important, it's easy to overlook the importance of mindset when you're starting or growing a business.Your mindset matters because it shapes your decisions and actions. By embracing the seven mindset shifts outlined in this article, you'll set your business up for even greater success.

4,7 Ways You Can Use AI to 10x Your Leadership Skills,"Apr 23, 2024",Gaurav Aggarwal,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/7-ways-you-can-use-ai-to-multiply-your-skills/472737,"
The number of AI-based tools is rising, and it has become difficult to keep track of the changes and updates happening daily in this space. New tools promise to optimize your day, with golden promises of making you a 10x version of yourself. Rightly so, but unfortunately, many employees are not using them to their potential. So, let us discuss how the best are having productivity boosts at their jobs.1. Speeding up grunt workAI-powered tools have become the ultimate sidekicks, seamlessly handling mundane yet crucial responsibilities. You can offload tasks like proofreading and summarizing to these AI models. While it is worthwhile going through scrolls of documentation, it is just tedious to write it down. The AI models can come into the picture here by taking a few ideas and making them into comprehensive documentation.Furthermore, you can be even more efficient by letting AI tools engage with data entry tasks. Just a search away is the plentiful repository of no-code or low-code tools that fill that Excel sheet for you. With the ability to swiftly and accurately complete these tasks, employees can redirect their mental energy toward more challenging and rewarding endeavors.

Employees can streamline their workflows by automating these processes, freeing up valuable time and mental bandwidth. No more time-consuming manual efforts; AI takes the reins, allowing professionals to focus on higher-level tasks that genuinely drive their organization forward. While all corporations and startups hurry to integrate AI into the curated set of tools they already provide, learning and implementing repetitive workflows has become increasingly easier.


3. Just-in-time learningThis is something a lot of people have realized AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini or any other generative AI tool you use have brought just-in-time learning to the center stage. You can now just learn the job while being at the job. The speed of interaction with these tools has become a great enabler, and it is thus a must to leverage and get ahead.AI-powered tools offer just-in-time solutions. Stuck somewhere? A simple consolidated answer is ready for you! providing you with the knowledge and skills they need precisely when they need them. No more going through endless modules or attending lengthy training sessions; AI curates the most relevant information, ensuring that you are equipped with the right tools at the right time.Related: The Importance Of Continuous Learning In The Era Of Artificial Intelligence4. Improve decision supportMany people talk about making their decisions on the overall hunch - a gut feeling that drives their decisions, even in the presence of the various popular data-powered decision tools available. It's primarily due to the hassle with the incumbent tools and urgency of decision making which requires a faster approach.


With so much competition, it may be a fatal flaw to move forward using just intuition. The AI tools have reduced the turnaround time between data interpretation and the time required for decision making thus enabling a data-driven approach to decision-making. AI excels at analyzing vast troves of data, getting insights and presenting visualizations that aid in informed decision-making.5. Personalizing interactionsCrafting personalized emails and providing tailored feedback are essential components of effective communication and employee development. AI tools can analyze vast amounts of data, understanding the nuances of each individual and their preferences. This invaluable insight can help employees craft messages and feedback that resonate deeply, fostering stronger connections and more productive collaborations. Not to encourage, telling your AI assistant to send all of your messages.Remember, it's still an assistant, and the other party also has access to the same tools. An unwanted scenario we are seeing is humans passing the task to an AI assistant, leading to merely the two AI assistants talking to each other in a to-and-fro fashion, one drafting and the other summarizing. While this may be the path of least resistance, the premium to be paid is exactly the opposite of what we intend, that is, loss of personal connection. A choice you need to make on the path you take. Hence use them wisely!Related: AI vs. Humanity — Why Humans Will Always Win in Content Creation


6. Streamlining interactions and feedbackIn the space of customer service, AI can become an indispensable assistant. By compressing customer reviews, inquiries, and feedback into a single, centralized pipeline, AI tools can help teams to identify and address customer needs swiftly. People usually scrape reviews and feedback and go through them. AI tools can go one step further by creating a funnel for the team to address them more effectively.7. Overcoming creative blocksA common problem is that most professionals can be troubled by creative blocks. The thought is right at the tip of the tongue, but it still can't materialize into something meaningful. AI tools have emerged as invaluable brainstorming partners, offering fresh insights, transforming abstract ideas into concrete words, and refining blunt concepts by chiseling them to their fullest potential. You can throw out some words, ideas or notes and see them transform into better-developed frameworks that help you get further.The landscape of business next is one where everybody has their assistant as support; thus, it's crucial to embrace these advancements with open arms. You can unlock untapped levels of efficiency, effectiveness, productivity and overall workplace satisfaction. However, it's important to remember that AI is not a universal cure. The point is that these collections of powerful tools must be used with skill. Striking the right balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and maintaining human intuition and creativity is key to truly optimizing productivity in the modern workplace.

5,8 Little Things That Make Remote Work More Efficient for Everyone,"Apr 23, 2024",Artis Rozentals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/8-ways-to-make-remote-work-more-efficient-for-everyone/472694,"
For the first time since we were all forcefully thrown into remote work in 2020, it finally feels like the debate surrounding it is settling down.Companies that wanted their teams back in the office have enacted relevant policies. Meanwhile, employees enamored with remote work have lots of options, with vacancies offering just that. Also, many workplaces have adopted hybrid ways of working to get the best of both worlds, with studies reporting more than half of working Americans having the opportunity to work remotely at least once a week.That means that for a majority of employees, remote work remains a core part of their day-to-day life because, even when you work fully in-person if you have a colleague joining from home, you inevitably get sucked into a remote work dynamic. For many, this continues to be a challenge — remote work has its own specifics regarding communication, collaboration and general etiquette, which don't come naturally to everyone.



So here are eight little things anyone can do to improve their remote work experience and that of their colleagues.Related: I Live in Hotels Full Time. It Works Out Cheaper Than Renting and I Haven't Changed My Sheets in 3 Years.


1. Make your availability knownAre you out for lunch? Picking up kids from school? Do you have irregular working hours? While remote work's flexibility is one of its best features, ensure your team is informed about when you'll be in work mode to avoid misunderstandings, missed messages and schedule clashes.For instance, if you start work later, it may be wise to indicate that somewhere so early birds know not to expect your input in the initial hours of the morning. This can be as simple as a relevant emoji on your Slack profile or a quick update at a weekly meeting.2. Document processesSince much remote work collaboration is asynchronous, try to document processes, decisions, and strategies so that anyone in the team can find their footing at any time. If you don't, there's a risk of confusion and repetition — teammates might miss updates, and managers might grow tired of explaining the same things to everyone individually to get people on the same page.If you haven't yet, one good practice to adopt is to send out meeting summaries and make a habit of it for other informal important discussions, too.


3. Don't forget about timezonesAmericans may be accustomed to time differences between coasts, but with the rise of remote work, your team may have added some international talent. Emilia from Finland won't be available for your afternoon catch-up because her day ended hours ago — and unless it's been previously agreed upon, you shouldn't expect her to be.Related: The Most Common Work From Home Problems -- Solved!4. Use the same software and tools as your colleaguesTo avoid constantly converting documents, downloading new software, or getting into protracted arguments about which tool is best, you must agree on a single set of tools that will be used company-wide. Larger enterprises typically already have an established tech stack, and smaller companies should follow suit.Remote work and communication necessitate a variety of technologies for collaboration, work, and management. If everyone starts using whatever they like, it'll sow frustration, impair cybersecurity and leave information scattered.


5. Don't browse social media during meetingsThat's it — that's the whole tip. You know it's counterproductive and affects the overall quality of the meeting and your information retention capacity. Will you stop doing it after reading this? Let's be real — probably not.So here's a pro tip and a fun read: to avoid getting into hot water, take off your glasses when you scroll social media during a conference meeting.6. Avoid common video conferencing issuesMute your microphone when you're not talking, test your connection and tech beforehand, show up on time, turn on your camera, be presentable and ensure your background is as well. By now, we all know these video conferencing best practices, but very few people take the time to practice them. As a result, it's extremely common for calls to get disrupted by basic tech issues, sowing frustration and impeding communication.7. Respect different working stylesEveryone has their own ways of working that suit them best. Some people are gifted multi-taskers who want to know everything that's going on and be constantly in the loop. Others thrive in deep work, and a single distraction can reduce their productivity.


Accordingly, while the former will be happy to receive a Slack message and engage in discussion, the latter may find it irritating and disruptive. Some people will be happy to jump into a quick meeting to get on the same page, whereas others would prefer an email.Respecting how others operate can maximize each individual's productivity. To do so, all you need to do is discuss it with colleagues.Related: How to Navigate Generational Differences and Hybrid Challenges in the Workplace8. Regularly celebrate winsIt's no secret that remote workers struggle with loneliness. One of the chief arguments against remote and hybrid work is that it hampers team bonding and the development of a healthy company culture.


But this isn't an inherent problem with remote work. Rather, fostering camaraderie and a healthy work environment demands more active effort in a remote setting than an in-person one. By putting in the effort, you can overcome the challenges of feeling and experiencing the realities of isolation.A great place to start is celebrating wins — develop a shared virtual ritual that involves the entire team and helps people connect.These eight tips will significantly boost your team's efficiency. But remember that for them to be effective, they need to become foundational to your operation. It's not a one-and-done kind of thing but rather an ongoing collective effort to improve everyone's working environment.

6,How to Align Business and Customer Interests for Long-Term Success,"Apr 22, 2024","Simin Cai, Ph.D.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-align-business-and-customer-interests-for-long-term/472729,"
It may be hard to hear for young entrepreneurs and small businesses with ambitious plans to scale, but not everyone is your customer. Differentiation starts with finding your expertise and your market, and then driving home the value you offer. In this sense, standing out is a matter of bringing more of your authentic self and your company to the table — not less in a bid to be all things to all people.The danger of the latter approach is getting lost in the crowd. The moment a company's product or service is benchmarked by the market, it has already become a commodity, which means you can only compete on price.Even established companies need to know when to pivot if their expertise is no longer aligned with their customers. Adobe shifted from a very successful business model providing its suite of graphic-design apps to a subscription-based model. It was part of a broader strategy to adjust to emerging customer behavior patterns in a cloud-based environment. After a torrent of early criticism, the subsequent numbers are impressive: Adobe posted record revenue of $19.41 billion in the 2023 financial year and now has over 33 million subscribers.



While Adobe's move may have originally been seen as risky, identifying the right customer for your business or remaining agile enough to move with customer preferences is the best way to build and maintain a sustainable business model.Related: You Can't Be Everything for Everybody, So Stop Trying


Know your expertise to deliver valueFake it til you make it is poor advice to new business leaders. Self-awareness is needed to understand your unique value proposition and align it with what the customer actually needs. This allows you to then focus on maximizing that value. Promising expertise you are yet to possess usually happens when entrepreneurs are chasing the wrong customer — but the right customer need not be elusive.Remember, it is one thing to invest resources in reaching out to customers who can afford your offering, but another to make sure they will actually pay for it. While that ought to be obvious, the next part is critical. Those same customers must see value in your product or service. The notion of value can be subjective, but that is exactly the point: The right customer is one who values what you can provide because you have differentiated it from the competition and met a tangible need or desire.Compare that to the temptation to chase big-name accounts in B2B marketing — it can become blinding. Of course, it is still true that we must appeal to customers' needs, arguably more than ever in a world that expects speed and convenience. But as CEO, when I visit a customer, I try to understand how we are going to align our interests to deliver value to them and gain benefit for ourselves. Aligning interests is a win-win for both parties.How to invest in sustainabilityWhen there is a natural affinity between what a business provides and what the customer needs, there is no sacrifice — only mutual benefit. Having a clear understanding of your own expertise gives you the confidence to say, ""I don't know,"" when asked to go beyond its limits. That can save you a lot of needless persuasion. A simple rule of thumb is if you have to chase or convince customers, they are probably not the customers for you.


Once you have aligned interests, reputation can become a business's own form of marketing, and staying true to the core values and expertise that got you there is branding. Apple, for instance, is renowned for turning its customers into evangelists. The tech giant avoids aggressively pursuing customers by constantly adapting to their needs and in some cases, becoming self-disruptors. They have built an identity out of challenging the status quo.So, don't allow the unique part of your value proposition to get lost the moment potential sales figures are flashed around. Stick to what you do well, and trust it can be iterated or evolved once a solid foundation has been laid. Instead of telling customers what you think they want to hear, stay true to your authentic self and values in order to build credibility over the long haul.Related: Not All Clients Are Good for Business. Here's How to Find the Ones Who Are.Align, refine, and double downWhen Amazon launched its first Kindle back in 2007, it sold out within hours. Its genesis was Jeff Bezos identifying books as one of five product categories with the most ecommerce potential. The online retail giant opened its popular bookstore in 1995, so by the time it had developed an e-reader, it had already established an eager market.


The first Kindle was clunky-looking compared to the devices of the time but Amazon has never wavered from its primary purpose: to serve people who love reading. Now, the new-generation Kindles come with the X-ray feature, which allows readers to learn more about a character, topic, event, place or any other term. Other functions like vocabulary-building flashcards show how Amazon has kept innovating to create the best reader experience.In other words, play to your strengths but don't overplay your hand. The founder of the outdoor apparel brand Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard, says the 50-year-old company has thrived for so long because it does not pursue endless growth and is aware of the expectations of its customer base to model corporate responsibility. ""Building the best product while causing the least harm is at the heart of what we do,"" he says.Stop chasing, start buildingPatagonia's ""conscious capitalism"" is a great example of how to keep customer and business interests aligned for sustainability over the long term. It is not enough just to have a unique value proposition — you also have to be aligned with customer needs and expectations.Instead of seeing this relationship as one of pursuing customers to drive endless growth, businesses need to take a more collaborative approach. When interests are truly aligned, there is both deep satisfaction and profitability in providing an offering that is authentically yours and genuinely needed.

7,This Leadership Technique is the Secret to Optimal Team Performance,"Apr 18, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/this-leadership-technique-is-the-secret-to-team-performance/472396,"
As a business owner, you may be focused on profit and loss. Just as important as marketing the company and knowing the numbers that drive margins is the company's foundation: motivating your team. Why? A McKinsey survey found that employee disengagement and attrition cost mid-sized businesses between $228 million and $335 million annually. In other words, even on a smaller scale, your company is losing money and inhibiting business growth by not properly motivating your employees.Leadership and motivation go hand-in-hand. As a leader, your job is to push people forward to achieve the company's goal. How you do that depends on various factors. As the CEO of Carbliss, I've never considered myself an inspiring leader. At least not in the way I have it pictured in my head — a Tony Robbins-esque figure standing on a stage, giving a long speech and firing up the crowd, that's not me. And you know what? That's okay. We all have our different strengths and weaknesses. Our different ways to approach leadership. Below are the key differentiators we use to maintain team engagement while also driving our margins.Related: You Won't Have a Strong Leadership Presence Until You Master These 5 Attributes The secret to leadership through motivationMany business owners spend years navigating leadership styles to find what works for them. Some become harsh bosses, dictating rules. That doesn't work. Others become too close to employees, and they end up losing respect for them as the company's leaders. Others look the other way and pretend they don't see the problem. That doesn't work, either.



Through my experience in business, I've found one particular leadership technique that works better than others. Using this approach has led me in the best direction – even though I'm not a charismatic type of leader. If I had to summarize my approach to leadership, it's this:Understand who someone is and use that knowledge to move them. Instead of a bold speech, help people move toward what they desire most in life. It's subtle but profound. By recognizing and helping individuals achieve their aspirations within the team, we create an environment where personal and professional growth go hand in hand. In a way, I'm just there to remind them of their goals so they can hold themselves accountable.Related: How to Motivate Your Unmotivated EmployeesLeading by example matters to company cultureOf course, this culture of accountability starts at the top. Transparency has always been a cornerstone of my leadership style. I'm honest and upfront, and I will call you on your stuff if it's necessary.


This honesty isn't intended to be harsh. It truly comes from a place of caring. My team knows that I genuinely care about them and the goals we're aiming to achieve. My commitment to openness extends to all aspects of our business, even during challenging times.For example, in the early days at Carbliss, we lost significant amounts of money. I decided right away that I didn't want to hide it. We laid it all out for the team, explaining that we had anticipated this phase and had a plan. By sharing this openly, we kept the team informed and helped them understand that the plan was to burn cash and that is simply another part of our journey, not a reason to panic.This transparency built trust and reinforced the idea that we're all in it together. It also created a culture of resilience, a trait that leads to another critical aspect of leadership: guiding teams proactively rather than reactively.Driving a team to the next levelMotivation isn't a one-time push. It's an ongoing driving engine that propels people constantly. When the time comes for the engine to rev up, leaders need to be able to find what it takes to push their team forward.


To be an effective leader, you must ensure that everyone's ""cup is full"" — that they have the resources, guidance, and motivation they need. You must be the one showing the way to success, not shoving them towards it. When a team knows their leader is invested in their success and well-being, their motivation and performance naturally rise.Related: How to Improve Employee Motivation to Increases Your ProfitsHire the best leaders from the startThe most effective way to lead a team to success is to hire people who are already leaders themselves – individuals who resonate with your vision and values. As a business, every person you hire is an investment in your company in some way. It costs you money if you are not pushing your company forward with that hire.We prioritize hiring hungry, humble, and smart people. These self-motivated individuals often require less external inspiration because their own goals and ambitions drive them.


Leadership still occasionally recalibrates direction. That's expected. When you have a team that mirrors your ethics, leading becomes less about rah-rah motivation and more about guiding self-driven individuals toward a shared vision.Effective leadership doesn't have to be the kind of speech-making drama we see in movies or TV. There are other ways to motivate and inspire people. You don't need to be an inspirational leader to still be effective. Find your confidence and succeed in a leadership style that suits your goals and objectives.

8,You Won't Have a Strong Leadership Presence Until You Master These 5 Attributes,"Apr 18, 2024",Don Weber,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-five-basics-you-need-to-master-to-develop-an-executive/472738,"
Consider the most impactful leaders you've encountered. What about them made you eager to trust and follow their lead? Perhaps they possessed a subtle yet unmistakable ""presence"" — a magnetic aura that commanded respect and instilled confidence.This intangible quality, often referred to as ""executive presence,"" is a potent force in leadership. This article delves into the essence of executive presence, its significance in today's competitive landscape, and actionable steps to cultivate it. Join me as we explore the vital components distinguishing ordinary leaders from those who inspire, influence and leave a lasting impression.Related: This Leadership Technique is the Secret to Optimal Team Performance



What is executive presence?Executive presence is the projection of authority and credibility, and your signature presence defines your personal and professional brand. It encompasses the unique blend of demeanor, communication style and demeanor that distinguishes you as a leader.Individuals with executive presence maintain a detectable, but undefinable, attitude about themselves. Although others might not be able to put their finger on why they want to follow these leaders, they will be more inclined to trust them.


David Roberts, CEO of Verra Mobility, recently defined executive presence as ""the total combined manner by which an executive ""shows up"" for the job of leadership. It's that unique combination of skills, style, actions and reactions in service to the goal of leading your employees forward and driving organizational results.""The strength of your executive presence can also be gauged by how others perceive and respond to you in professional settings. It influences how you are perceived by colleagues, stakeholders, and industry peers, ultimately shaping your career trajectory and your leadership's impact.How to develop executive presenceExecutive presence isn't a skill you're necessarily born with. Fortunately, that means anybody can develop this skill!It is crucial to remember that developing executive presence is both an inner and outer game. If you are a poor leader internally, you will be a poor leader externally. Executive presence involves cultivating the skills of a leader and projecting them strategically and consistently.


Related: How to Develop an Executive Presence and Earn RespectDeveloping inner executive presenceBefore we discuss the external features of executive presence, we must address the ""inner game"" of executive presence.This inner game of executive presence refers to self-awareness, or a profound understanding of one's values, emotions, and behaviors. This self-awareness forms the bedrock of emotional intelligence, enabling active listening, emotional agility, and controlled emotional reactivity. It's this internal alignment that radiates confidence, calmness, and composure in professional interactions.Recognizing that internal character incongruencies can inadvertently surface in external nonverbal communication, decisions, and actions is crucial. The stories of Adam Neumann of WeWork, Trevor Milton of Nikola, Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos and Rajat Gupta of McKinsey & Company serve as cautionary examples. While they initially exhibited high executive presence, their lack of ethics and integrity ultimately eroded their credibility.


The great news is we can always improve our internal selves and therefore benefit others through our external presence and actions. For instance, if you identify difficulty in managing stress, seeking coaching or therapy can foster healthier internal coping mechanisms that will reflect positively in your external demeanor and decision-making.Related: How to Develop Self-Awareness and Become a More Effective LeaderNow that we've explored the foundational aspects of building an internal executive presence, let's shift our focus to developing the following external attributes that will amplify your leadership impact and project a compelling executive presence.1. Positive body languageEffective communication begins with active listening and thoughtful responses. Letting others speak first, actively listening, and then speaking clearly and concisely demonstrates respect and authority. Thoughtful gestures such as nodding affirmatively and maintaining open body posture convey engagement and confidence.

AppearanceThe significance of appearance in leadership dates back to ancient civilizations, wherein attire signified status and authority. Research consistently shows that a well-groomed appearance commands respect and fosters positive impressions. Pay attention to grooming, attire, and personal presentation to align with professional standards and enhance your executive presence.Related: Five Tips to Optimize Your Appearance for Business Success3. ConfidenceConfidence is a learnable trait that emanates from within and is reflected in external demeanor. It's not just about physical posture — true confidence is about controlling your environment and projecting assurance through gestures, voice tone, and spatial presence. Walk purposefully, maintain eye contact, and use deliberate gestures to convey confidence and credibility.


4. Intonation and cadenceThe tone and cadence of your voice convey confidence and command attention. Speak with clarity, emphasizing key points with controlled intonation. Practice modulating your voice to convey authority and conviction while also maintaining a calm and composed demeanor.5. Trust through consistencyConsistency is essential for building trust and credibility. Ensure your actions and behaviors align with your core values and leadership principles. Consistent leadership fosters trust among colleagues and stakeholders, enhancing your executive presence and influence.Remember, executive presence is not merely a set of skills — it's a holistic approach to leadership that integrates authenticity, confidence and professionalism in all aspects of your professional journey. By honing these external attributes while nurturing your internal self-awareness and integrity, you can cultivate a compelling executive presence that inspires trust, drives results, and leaves a lasting impact on those around you.

10,Successful Brands Use These 4 Radical Practices to Attract Loyal Customers,"Apr 17, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-successful-brands-should-embrace-radical-transparency/472395,"
In today's marketplace, consumer trust has become paramount for businesses seeking lasting success. A study by Edelman found that 81% of buyers cite brand trust as a deciding factor in their loyalties and purchasing behaviors. With the proliferation of information sources, companies can no longer maintain opaque practices obscuring key details. They must operate in full transparency to earn customer confidence and allegiance.As the CEO of Carbliss, an alcoholic beverage brand, I've witnessed firsthand how radical transparency around all production and business operations drives powerful consumer loyalty and business growth. From our earliest days, we committed to an unwavering open-book approach that has helped cement valuable, long-lasting relationships with our customer base. Below are the four criteria and best practices we prioritize to maintain transparency and customer loyalty.1. Hands-on customer dialogueToday's empowered consumers can easily see right through that disingenuous smokescreen. What they crave from the brands they embrace is true candor about every key aspect, including the ingredients, sourcing practices, pricing rationale, regulatory challenges, and more underpinning the products they consume.



One key way I nurture this culture of authenticity is by being directly involved with a huge volume of customer inquiries myself. This past year alone, I answered around 8,000 emails from Carbliss distributors, retailers, consumers and fans.Ongoing candid dialogue is critical for comprehensively understanding how customers perceive our brand identity, product qualities, and customer service experiences in an unfiltered way.


Through raw, unapologetic honesty in these interactions, even when the facts may be unfavorable or unpleasant for the customer to accept, we actively cultivate invaluable trust. The simple truth is that you cannot build enduring customer loyalty through automated and impersonal responses or convoluted corporate jargon.Related: Don't Talk to Another Customer Until You Learn This Simple Customer Service Secret2. Shining light on complexitiesEmbracing this level of radical transparency means being prepared sometimes to face intense scrutiny from confused, perhaps deflated customers seeking simpler truths. We've found that the payoff is an extraordinarily powerful brand reputation anchored in truth that ultimately breeds sacred trust and loyalty.At my company, we willingly spotlight the very details that other brands may conceal or try to downplay, like our need to use ""artificially colored"" labels on cans despite the colors being derived from natural sources, like the brilliant blue of butterfly pea flowers.


We take every opportunity to explain the nuances of regulatory complexities that result in obligatory technical labeling jargon. We balance that by reaffirming our core principles of prioritizing high-quality ingredients that we legitimately consume ourselves and provide to friends and family without hesitation.3. A culture of authenticityAs you grow and scale, it's important to maintain transparency throughout your team. This can be in the form of understanding the intricacies of the product, the runway to profitability, or the purpose of their unique role in the overall strategy. Our employees, regardless of role, deeply understand the ingredients, sourcing, and production methods behind our products so they can convey that knowledge accurately and credibly in their customer-interactions activities.Our detailed FAQ content clarifies common misconceptions, from our avoidance of artificial colors to our premium pricing rationale based on operational costs and premium product positioning. While some buyers may be dismayed at certain realities we present, we insist on honesty because we've learned it's the only path to fostering long-term customer understanding, respect and allegiance.Related: How to Lead With Authenticity and Build a Thriving Workplace


4. Transparent best practicesFor companies in any industry aspiring to foster powerful brand loyalty by operating in total transparency, below are my personal principles:Be unconditionally open about all business practices by prioritizing clear, forthright communication with customers at every opportunityHave customer-interaction teams be prepared to personally respond to every inquiry with unvarnished candor, excluding no unpleasant truthsThoroughly educate and train all employees on the paramount importance of authenticity in all their customer-interaction words and actions.Embrace both positive and negative customer feedback as a welcome opportunity to demonstrate a real commitment to constant improvement.Ensure all marketing content and messaging accurately reflects the true nature of your products, services, and practices without ambiguity.Be unafraid to openly discuss your company's genuine challenges, as this humanizes the brand relationship.Related: 5 Examples of Companies Succeeding Through TransparencyWeathering backlash to cultivate loyaltyCertainly, this radical embrace of transparency sometimes means facing backlash from those who are displeased with newly revealed information that clashes with their expectations. Cultivated ironclad trust and loyalty far outweigh any short-term friction. When you deal truthfully and withhold nothing from your customers, you attract buyers aligned with your values who appreciate your courage and unwavering integrity.If you're ready to foster true customer loyalty and propel sustainable growth, it's time to embrace radical transparency across your organization. Don't complicate realities; shine a light on every aspect of your products, operations, and business practices. Deal in truth relentlessly, even when facing scrutiny. Your authentic soul and unwavering integrity will attract devoted brand advocates aligned with your values.

11,"How to Leverage Business Awards to Foster Innovation, Build Your Brand and Retain Top Talent","Apr 15, 2024",Mike Szczesny,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-leverage-business-awards-for-innovation-and-growth/472270,"
The traditional mechanisms of business recognition are undergoing a transformative renaissance. Today, as organizations navigate through the complexities of digital transformation, environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility, the criteria and modalities of business awards have adapted to reflect these new priorities. This shift underscores the increasing significance of such honors in promoting innovation, recognizing excellence and providing companies with a competitive edge that resonates with modern consumers and investors alike.A 2023 Pew Research Center survey revealed that a significant portion of workers see diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as positive, with variations across demographic and partisan lines. Such statistics can underscore the growing importance of DEI initiatives as integral components of business recognition and honors, highlighting how companies are being acknowledged not just for financial performance but for fostering inclusive and equitable work environments.Historically, business awards were often based solely on financial metrics and market share. However, the past decade has witnessed a seismic shift toward a more holistic approach. Awards now frequently incorporate criteria such as innovation, sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and social impact.



A prime example is the B Corp Certification, which evaluates companies on their overall social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. This recognition has spurred a movement toward more ethical business practices, influencing companies worldwide to reassess their operations and strategies.Related: Redefining Business In The Modern Era: The B Corp Movement And The Quest For Authentic Sustainability


Measuring the impact of awards on businessesThe evolution of business honors has had a profound impact on companies across the globe. For instance, being listed on the Fortune 500 has always been prestigious, but newer accolades like Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies list or Forbes' Just 100 ranking of America's best corporate citizens play a significant role in shaping corporate identities and consumer perceptions today. These awards validate a company's efforts in innovation and corporate responsibility but also enhance its reputation, attract talent and open doors to new partnerships and customer segments.Take the example of Patagonia, a brand that has been consistently recognized for its commitment to sustainability and ethical practices. This recognition has bolstered its brand reputation and been a key driver in attracting a loyal customer base that values environmental stewardship.Similarly, technology giants like Google and Apple frequently top the lists of most innovative companies, reinforcing their status as leaders in technology and design thinking. This recognition serves as a testament to their commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible, attracting top talent and securing their position at the forefront of technological advancement.Related: If You Want to Build the Next Patagonia, Here's What Not to Do: 'We Realized We Were Turning Everybody Off'


Finding new ways to show gratitude for excellenceYou don't have to be a big brand with a boardroom to leverage and implement innovative recognition practices across various aspects of business honors. As the owner and vice president of an awards company that creates a multitude of employee recognition products, I've seen a lot of creative ways to bring innovation into the equation. Here are a few places to start:1. Embed innovation into corporate culture:Encourage a culture of continuous improvement and innovation within your organization. Recognize and reward employees who contribute innovative ideas or improvements, regardless of their department or role. This can be through innovation-specific awards or acknowledgments during team meetings.To that end, choose to participate in awards that align with your company's strategic goals and values. Winning such awards can boost your brand's reputation in specific areas, whether it's sustainability, technology, customer service or community involvement. This alignment ensures that the recognition you receive advances your overall business objectives.


Digital transformation solutions provider UST is a great example of a company that has successfully embedded innovation into its corporate culture. Recognized by the Business Culture Awards for the fourth consecutive year, UST has demonstrated excellence in fostering a culture of sustainability and inclusivity, alongside innovation. They've won accolades for being the Best Large Organization in Business Culture and for their initiatives to build a culture of innovation. Additionally, their leadership and collaborative team efforts have been recognized, further underscoring their commitment to positive societal impact and corporate success.2. Create internal recognition programs:Beyond external honors, develop internal recognition programs that celebrate small wins and major milestones. This could range from employee of the month awards to innovation challenges. Internal recognition programs can motivate your team and foster a positive workplace environment.A standout company with an excellent internal recognition program is Cisco. Its ""Connected Recognition"" program is notable because it's funded at 1% of the company's payroll, which allows for substantial rewards as employees nominate their peers and managers for various accolades. This program showcases how peer-to-peer recognition can foster a positive work environment and contribute to a sense of community and appreciation among staff.


Make sure to involve your employees in the nomination process for both internal and external awards. This can increase engagement and give employees a sense of ownership and pride in their workplace, enhancing team spirit and collaboration.3. Reflect and build upon your wins:Use each award as a stepping stone for further improvement. Reflect on what contributed to the win and how you can build upon this success. This approach ensures continuous improvement while keeping your team motivated and focused on achieving more.There are organizations like the Management and Strategy Institute which issue Continuous Improvement Awards. These awards recognize individuals and organizations that demonstrate a commitment to the principles of continuous improvement. The Organizational Continuous Improvement Award, for example, is presented to organizations that not only streamline processes but also invest in change management, long-term strategies and professional development.


Related: How to Leverage Industry Awards in Your Marketing StrategyRemember, awards often offer networking opportunities with fellow nominees, awardees and judges. Take advantage of these opportunities to build relationships, share best practices and even explore potential partnerships. And try to stay updated on industry trends and new award opportunities that may arise. Being among the first to apply for or win a newly established award can position your company as a leader and innovator in your industry.The continuous celebration of excellence and innovation through these honors encourages organizations to strive for a higher standard, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and sustainable growth. In this way, business honors inspire a future where innovation, responsibility and excellence remain at the forefront of the corporate agenda. By adopting these strategies, companies can effectively leverage awards and recognitions to foster innovation, build their brand and create a positive work environment that attracts and retains top talent.

12,"This Emergency Room Doctor Has Seen It All — And in Moments of Failure, He Shares The 2 Things That Help Him Start Again","Apr 15, 2024",Jon B. Becker,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-a-trauma-doctors-death-ritual-can-change-your/471605,"
If you are an emergency room physician, death and the fear of failure are constant companions. A countdown timer starts when a patient arrives with a fatal wound or condition. If that timer reaches zero, the patient will die. If it is prevented from reaching zero, the patient will survive and live to fight another day.It is literally a race against the clock, and the role of the ER physician is to battle that timer directly through medical interventions that either solve the problem or keep the patient alive long enough for a trauma surgeon, interventional cardiologist or other specialist to solve the issue that is killing them.As you might imagine, when the ER staff wins that fight and saves a life, it is a fantastic feeling, but when they fail and lose a patient, it is devastating. Worse yet is when they lose a patient who could have been saved because they either made an error or did not have the required resources to save the person. Every ER Doctor has memories of the patients that they lost. In fact, a requirement for a long and healthy career in emergency medicine is the ability to find peace with this notion.



I recently had the opportunity to spend time with Dr. Dan Dworkis, an ER physician, Professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, Medical Director of the Mission Critical Teams Institute, Podcast host and the author of The Emergency Mind. Dan has spent his career working in emergency rooms. In fact, not just emergency rooms but a busy trauma center in Los Angeles.As you might imagine, Dan has seen it all and, as a result, carries the stories and memories that come with working at a hospital that is frequented by children who have been shot, traumatic car accidents and people with life-threatening injuries and illnesses.


Dan has spent a big part of his career studying how we make decisions under stress, how to operate in high-stress environments and how to create a culture of continuous improvement. Not surprisingly, I learned a lot from Dan. But, by far, the most profound thing I learned from Dan was a unique way to approach failure and, in the process, open ourselves up to growth and learning.Related: The 5 Key Qualities of a Good LeaderThe ritual: Learning by embracing lossAs you can imagine, trauma physicians see quite a bit of death. No matter how good a doctor you are, you will lose patients, and some of those people certainly could have been saved with different skills or different resources. It would be easy to simply block yourself off from these feelings, to harden your heart, and to put these bad experiences into a mental box that you lock away. While this might not be great for your mental health, it is certainly a seemingly easier thing than confronting these memories and feelings. Yet, Dan actually advocates doing the complete opposite, leaning into the failure and attacking it directly.When a patient dies, there is an awkward moment immediately afterward where the team that treated the patient must transition away from that fight and move on to another. Despite just a few minutes before waging a war to save their life, the team must move on from this person. Machines must be turned off, tubes and wires removed, and each team member must emotionally reset and get back to work.


It would be easy at that point to block the feelings and doubts that arise, place them in a box and move on to the next task while hoping never to think about those feelings again. But that is not what Dan does or advocates. Instead, he engages in a ritual that he was taught as a young doctor, which is to gather the team at the bedside of the patient, place a hand on the deceased patient, and utter the following phrase: ""Thank you for teaching me. I am sorry that all I could do for you today was learn.""This seemingly simple act and brief statement is more than just a ritual to clear the mind before moving on. Instead, it is a deeply profound approach to situations where we cannot succeed and lays a strong foundation for learning and growth.Related: 2 Phrases I Learned From a Senior CIA Officer That Changed My Leadership StyleEmbracing failureThe first significant thing that this ritual does is acknowledge and embrace failure. Rather than moving on and pretending that something profoundly negative didn't just happen, this ritual looks failure square in the eye and leans into the discomfort of the situation. It embraces failure and immediately triggers the learning process.


The first step to growth is the recognition and admission that what we currently do or know is not sufficient. To learn from others, we have to accept our own shortcomings, and this practice opens the door to that and to discovering something better. If we do not admit to our shortcomings, we cannot improve, and this is precisely the point of this ritual.Simply look at the phrase, ""Thank you for teaching me. I am sorry that all I could do for you today was learn."" By its nature, it says I failed you today, and I wish I had more to give. It doesn't say, ""It's too bad you died,"" or ""Wow, rough break you got."" It says, ""I am sorry."" It embraces that the team didn't have enough to save the person (and to be fair, no one may have been able to save them), but simply that acknowledgment doesn't go far enough. Rather, it says I ""learned from you."" It implicitly says, ""I will be better next time"" and ""I am growing and improving my skills."" It is active, not passive, and immediately takes the first step toward learning. ConclusionA profound lesson extends far beyond the medical field and this single ritual to all of us. Whether you are an entrepreneur, a business leader, or even a parent, creating a culture of learning from mistakes and continuous improvement is critical to getting better. We should never run from our errors or try to hide them. We should embrace our failures and view them as perfect opportunities to grow. By establishing a process that immediately addresses our failures or shortcomings, we also immediately focus our attention on how we can improve, where we have deficiencies and perhaps most importantly, we immediately begin the process of learning and growth.

The link between happiness and workplace productivityProductivity and job happiness have a proven relationship that is important to organizational effectiveness. Studies have indicated that contented workers demonstrate increased levels of involvement, innovation and efficiency.Individuals are more likely to perform at their peak in a supportive work environment that promotes independence, interpersonal relationships and a sense of purpose. Reduced stress, increased job satisfaction and enhanced morale all have a direct impact on productivity and are linked to the general pleasure and well-being of employees.


Promoting independence in the workplace is about empowering employees to make decisions and take actions that align with the company's goals and values. One effective strategy is implementing a decentralized decision-making process. This approach involves delegating authority to individuals and teams closer to the action, rather than maintaining a top-down hierarchy.Building strong interpersonal relationships among team members is another cornerstone of a thriving business. One tactic that has proven successful is fostering a culture of open communication and feedback. Encouraging regular, honest dialogue between employees at all levels of the organization helps to break down barriers, build trust and strengthen team cohesion.Instilling a sense of purpose in your employees is about connecting their day-to-day work to the larger mission and impact of the company. One way to achieve this is through storytelling. Sharing stories of how your products or services have positively impacted customers or communities can inspire and motivate your team. It humanizes the work they do, making it more meaningful and rewarding.Teams and productivity all increase when employers put their employees' health and welfare first. Investing in employee well-being benefits not only the employees but also the business overall, whether it be through chances for professional development, assistance with leadership or a happy work atmosphere.Building a positive workplace cultureEstablishing a joyful and productive work environment requires the promotion of a positive work culture. A positive work culture is characterized by open communication, mutual respect and a shared commitment to fundamental values. The first stage in the process is to have strong leadership that exhibits transparency, compassion and a genuine concern for the well-being of coworkers.Below are some of the other effective tactics business owners can implement to build a positive work culture:Recognition and appreciation:Acknowledge and appreciate employees' hard work and achievements regularly. Implement employee recognition programs to highlight outstanding contributions.Inclusive environment:Promote diversity and inclusion within the workplace. Create an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.Flexible work arrangements:Offer flexible work schedules or remote work options when possible. Support a healthy work-life balance for employees.Professional development:Provide opportunities for ongoing learning and skill development. Invest in training programs that help employees grow in their careers.Collaborative team environment:Encourage teamwork and collaboration among employees. Foster a sense of camaraderie through team-building activities.Social events and celebrations:Organize social events and celebrations to build a sense of community. Mark milestones and achievements with positive and enjoyable activities.Fair and consistent policies:Ensure that policies are fair, consistent and applied equally to all employees. Address issues promptly and consistently.Related: 12 Ways Happiness Increases Productivity in the Work EnvironmentThe importance of implementing well-being programsImplementing well-being initiatives and programs is a smart investment that comes with a lot of advantages both for businesses and employees alike. These activities, which range from fitness programs to mental health support, help promote a positive work atmosphere.Organizations can improve overall morale, lower stress levels and increase job satisfaction by placing a high priority on employee well-being. Tools like wellness seminars, counseling services and flexible work schedules show a dedication to the overall well-being of employees.


Furthermore, well-being programs frequently boost employee output while lowering absenteeism, which creates a more resilient and engaged team.Measuring and sustaining workplace happinessEnsuring employee well-being and organizational performance depends heavily on measuring and maintaining workplace happiness. Metrics like productivity, retention rates and employee satisfaction surveys can be used to gather important information about how satisfied people are in general.Business owners can quickly address complaints and come up with development opportunities when they have regular feedback channels in place. A happy and rewarding work environment is facilitated by the implementation of sustainable practices, such as professional development opportunities, flexible work schedules and recognition initiatives. Sustaining workplace happiness requires persistent efforts to promote transparent leadership, open communication and a supportive company culture.Related: 3 Ways to Establish a Positive Company Culture


Businesses can see gains in morale, engagement and productivity by implementing innovative strategies to foster a happy work environment. Happiness and productivity are related in so many ways, from developing a healthy workplace culture to implementing well-being initiatives.In the end, putting employee satisfaction first is not only a wise strategic move, but it is also a key factor in the success of the company as a whole.

14,The 3 Keys Needed to Improve Your Employee Loyalty and Retention,"Apr 12, 2024",Tripp Westbrook,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-keys-needed-to-improve-employee-loyalty-and-retention/472129,"
We recently won the Ad Age Best Places to Work award for the first time. After the shock, surprise and overzealous company celebrations, it got me thinking — how the heck did that happen? Well, looking back, it wasn't by accident.This award means so much to us because, unlike prizes for creatives, it comes directly from employees. To even be considered for the award (we were in the category of 200 employees or fewer), over 75% of people have to rate their satisfaction with pay, benefits, culture and leadership extremely high. To me, winning left no doubt that the people who walk the halls with us every day are feeling satisfied and fulfilled.Reflecting on our success, I recognized that it was a silver lining from COVID. At that time, we asked people what help they needed to get through the pandemic and then provided them with real support. But what we did next may underlie why we went from being placed in the top 25 the previous two years to ranking first in 2024: As we emerged from the pandemic, we kept asking questions, we kept listening, and have been doing so ever since.



Related: Is Your Leadership Team Failing Your Employees?1. Set up listening mechanismsThe lessons of this experience are worth sharing not just for the productivity gains of an engaged workforce but because these are the folks we put an arm around when they are having a tough day — we care about them. After ranking the top three to five things that mattered to our employees, we ended up giving stipends to set up home offices and covered mental health care completely. We also polled people on when they wanted to come back to the office and what form that should take — hybrid or completely remote.


We wanted our employees' participation because they were the ones who had to live the solution. As a business owner, assessing if we could afford the costs involved was a simple equation: Is it more expensive to provide for the people who work for us now or to replace them later? There are challenging and soft costs to training, recruitment and delays as work gets shifted while someone is replaced. Frankly, the decision was easy: We did what we could to make them happy.When leaders set up mechanisms to find out what employees need, people feel a sense of ownership in the outcome. We have since overhauled our parental leave policy so that birth mothers get 12 weeks and birth fathers get six weeks; we now cover adoption fees and give adoptive parents leave, too. Now, we ask human-centered questions on a regular basis. The design is to foster a culture where both employee and employer are looking out for the needs of the other.Related: How Listening Can Help You Build a Culture of Trust in Your Business2. Align communication and actionCOVID was a great wake-up call, particularly for larger organizations, that employers couldn't expect one-way loyalty. Culture, rather than compensation, is a much bigger predictor of turnover, so people need to feel heard, and leaders need to explain the thinking behind their decisions. Employees value leaders who listen and act substantively, not just performatively.


Of course, any action leaders take is not going to make everyone happy. So when you take steps to implement an initiative, be clear about the intention behind it — the benefits. We have also found that people ought to be reminded of how the company is helping them (""Don't forget to take advantage of x"") because they're not always top of mind.Our controller, Marla, keeps a running list of all the things we do for employees, big and small. If it's important enough to implement, it's important enough to record. But it doesn't end there. The other major piece of engagement is keeping an open line of communication and feedback.3. When in doubt, state your intentionAs a manager, don't view employees' raising issues as ""chirping"" — those issues matter to them. However, we do have to find a balance between entertaining their concerns and not enabling a culture of complaint. It requires knowing when you have heard enough of the same issue to escalate it for action.We also have to make sure we're really communicating, not just throwing information out there. To that end, we have put our leadership group through training focused on understanding personality and communication styles and showing how people receive and interpret information differently.


I'm a perfect example: A creative person by heart, I tend to be very off the cuff and feed off my audiences. But we have leaders who process information in a very logical, process-centered way. In the past, these differing styles may have produced misunderstanding, even conflict. The key is making it a practice to state the intent behind your communication at the beginning of meetings.If a leader states upfront, ""I intend to share my experience, not be critical,"" it defuses what might be interpreted as low-key criticism. This process allows people to give and receive grace for how they communicate. So, when in doubt, state your intention. While we have evolved this kind of transparent leadership over time, we are now enjoying the open, vibrant workplace culture it has created.Related: How to Build a Company Culture That Retains Loyal EmployeesBalancing the employer-employee relationshipThe dynamic between employers and employees has shifted often since COVID. Still, hopefully, we're coming to a place where people can find fulfillment at work while giving companies the resources they need. We have seen that a lot of the folks who prefer remote or contract work are starting to miss the in-person camaraderie and unscheduled moments that help us learn and be better. The irony is that creating an even better environment for that to occur was facilitated by the challenges of the pandemic. In our experience, if organizations listen well and find the right balance for both parties, the rewards will follow.

15,The Best Communicators Follow These 3 Rules When Talking to Those in Authority,"Apr 12, 2024",Darian Shimy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-3-modes-needed-for-good-communication/472223,"
Having the right framework is essential when communicating with managers. It allows you to establish clear boundaries and expectations, which improves your ability to advocate for what you need and often leads to better outcomes.The best frameworks are simple but effective. You need something people can internalize, memorize and repeat. I know this because I've developed one of my own: a three-mode scale that I've passed on to countless colleagues in the years since. Nearly everyone I've shared this framework with says it's been extremely useful for them.I call it The Three Modes of Communication for Managers. Here's how it can help improve your conversations with the people who oversee key activities and personnel at your organization.



Unclear communication leads to unfavorable outcomesThis idea originated from personal experience. Years ago, I was reporting to the CEO of a startup and mentioned some frustration I had with another team member. After I told my boss, he proceeded to talk to the team member in question about it — something I had neither expected nor explicitly asked him to do.I was immediately embarrassed when news of this eventually got back to me. I felt that my confidence had been violated, and I became upset. The next time I talked with my manager, I asked him why he had talked to the team member in question.


""Well, you told me about it,"" he replied.I was upset, but later, I realized that I shouldn't have been. The action my manager had taken wasn't what I wanted, but I had been ambiguous about what I was telling him and what direction I expected from him.Based on that incident, I devised three simple rules for streamlining communication with managers. These rules are extremely simple, but they work at virtually every level of management in any organization.Related: Why Middle Managers Are a Company's Hidden Superpower


The three modes of communication for managersThe next time I spoke with my manager, I explained that I had developed three distinct modes to help categorize the experiences I shared with him. I also explained that I would frame future conversations by identifying what mode I wanted him to apply in advance.The three modes are as follows:Mode One: I want you to listen but not do or say anything. You're just hearing me vent. I will tell you about something probably difficult that happened, and I need you to stay quiet. This allows me to verbalize my feelings while helping you understand my challenges and ensuring confidentiality.Mode Two: I want you to listen and give me your opinion without doing anything. I'll probably explain what happened to me and how I feel about it. I might even ask for advice or feedback, but I don't want you to take action on my behalf. This allows me to grow by solving my own problems and promotes resourcefulness, which is a key predictor of entrepreneurial success.Mode Three: I want you to listen, and I want you to act. In my experience, this mode is rarely used — I reserve it for situations where I know that a problem is beyond my ability to resolve alone.This last mode is the inverse of delegating a task to an employee. Instead, you are appealing to your manager for aid. It can be even more difficult, but it's just as important.Related: 5 Delegation Strategies To Help You Flourish With Less Stress


Clear communication requires courageWhen using this framework, the most important thing you can do as an employee is figure out what problems require mode three. When you have a problem you can't handle and need assistance, it takes humility and skill to recognize it. This can save a company — and I don't say that lightly.Knowing when to ""share up"" and ask for help is an art form. When I worked at Square, 180 people reported to me. I didn't have time to read every line of code they wrote, but I did need to understand if there was an issue with the coding and who was on top of the fix.It was important for the people who reported to me to take inventory of their problems and make sound judgment calls about which problems required my attention. It's like knowing when to see a doctor or a lawyer — you have to know when to seek professional help.Related: How to Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable, No Matter Your Age — Lessons for Entrepreneurs


When you're working at a senior management level, almost everyone has an ego, so this is even more difficult to do. But setting aside your pride takes courage, and I have always believed that venturing beyond your comfort zone is essential for personal growth.Remember: when you can be clear about the kind of communication you need, it's easier for people to say the right things and take the right actions. I've provided you with one possible framework for having these conversations — now it's up to you to put it into practice.

16,Feeling Overwhelmed at Work? Follow These Tips to Prevent It From Turning Into Burnout.,"Apr 11, 2024",Cyrus Claffey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/feeling-overwhelmed-at-work-heres-how-to-handle-it/472314,"
Running a successful business isn't just about finding a lightning-in-a-bottle idea or hiring a great team to surround yourself with; it's also about staying motivated and making sure you don't become too overwhelmed. Keep in mind, however, that acknowledging that you're overwhelmed isn't a sign of weakness but of great self-awareness.It's a skill to step back from a project and say, ""I'm swamped, and I need more help on this project or time away to regroup."" As a business founder and owner at ButterflyMX, I've learned that how you proceed after this acknowledgment is key to not letting your overwhelm turn into burnout.Related: Overwhelmed? These 10 Techniques Can Help You Cope With Uncomfortable Feelings.



Early indications of being overwhelmedIn order to prevent being overwhelmed from morphing into burnout, you have to first be able to detect it. This is hard because many early indications of being overwhelmed are subtle and can be mistaken for typical workplace stress. Still, keeping tabs on the indicators to see if they become persistent over time is a good way to become aware of overwhelm early.Here are a few key indicators that you're becoming overwhelmed at work:


Never-ending feelings of anxiety surrounding projects, meetings and deadlines.Consistently working extended hours that considerably disrupt your work-life balance.Feeling a continual decline in job satisfaction despite achievements.A focus on formerly routine tasks and deadlines as grueling and taxing.You feel like you're facing challenges you can't handle rather than healthily challenging yourself.Overall, when your focus at work shifts from the solutions you're finding to the problems you're facing, you're probably reaching a tipping point. So, it's important to face this issue head-on before it becomes unmanageable.What fuels the state of being overwhelmed?You've determined that you may be overwhelmed, which could very easily turn into burnout at work. What's next? Determining what's fueling your overwhelmed feelings could point you toward a solution.So, what fuels the state of being overwhelmed?


There are a handful of reasons one might become overwhelmed at work. The pressure to grow and climb the corporate ladder, the wish to be a linchpin member of your team or simply the desire to appease your boss and colleagues are all common reasons people become overwhelmed. Noticing that you've felt any or all of these things in conjunction with key indicators of overwhelm may mean that it's time for you to set more professional boundaries.Related: 7 Tips to Avoid Burnout When Growing a BusinessSetting professional boundariesWhen responding to feeling overwhelmed, you don't need to drop all of your responsibilities in order to avoid burnout. Instead, you can reassess your task management style in order to set more firm professional boundaries. When doing this, look at how you prioritize projects, how you delegate tasks and how you and your team members manage your time. You may think that you're doing all of these things well, but until you take a step back and really examine how you manage your tasks, you're unlikely to reduce your frustrations.But what exactly does setting professional boundaries look like? This varies from professional to professional, but most of the time, it starts with the same few things.


First, map out and clearly communicate when projects must be completed, so you and your team are on the same page about deadlines.Second, delegate tasks to your direct reports — and have them delegate to their own teams. Not only does delegating tasks immediately lighten your workload, but it also gives your direct reports the chance to challenge themselves by doing a task outside of their comfort zone. Just be sure to check in on their progress and offer helpful feedback on their work.Third, set professional boundaries to avoid being overwhelmed, which includes project prioritization. Do you have two projects due the same week and don't know which to start with? Consider which project will affect the largest group of people. If one project is a report due that needs to be completed before a larger project can move forward, and your other project is a draft that won't be published for several days or even weeks, start with the report. And if you ever need to push a deadline back in order to prioritize a more pressing project, inform those who will be affected well ahead of time to avoid surprises.Related: 7 Ways to Reduce Stress When You Are Overwhelmed and Need to Prioritize


Recovering from feeling overwhelmedOnce you've faced your feeling of being overwhelmed head-on, you need to apply long-term solutions to ensure that the same lingering threat of burnout doesn't plague your future. But how can you do this?Recognizing areas of imbalance at work is important, but the steps you take to achieve stability are even more important. Keeping a healthy balance of professional challenges, workloads and professional relationships is key to becoming a successful worker long-term.Remember, knowing that you're feeling overwhelmed and taking steps to improve is not an admission of defeat. It's a mark of self-awareness and dedication to the greater good of your company.

17,The Unseen Reason You Feel So Overwhelmed — and How It Impacts Your Business,"Apr 11, 2024",Joy Gendusa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-unseen-reason-you-feel-so-overwhelmed-and-how-to/472167,"
In 1998, when I started my business, PostcardMania, the first cell phone with a color screen hit the market. Facebook didn't exist, phones absolutely didn't fit in our pockets, and people still wrote checks in the grocery store.The internet was in its infancy, and we weren't saturated with tech to where it overtook our daily lives. It was new and fascinating but still relegated to a desktop.Just two decades later, and we can't go a single day without our smartphones in our hands, social media has replaced most personal interactions, and checks are obsolete with cash not far behind.



Between 2000 and 2018, studies show that the average American has nearly tripled their time online, going from 9.4 hours online per week to 23.6 in 2018 — and that was pre-pandemic. Some studies put the jump in pandemic screen time between 60-80% for adults. All this scrolling has us feeling some type of way: 46% of the respondents in one study said too much screen time was a major culprit of constant tiredness.Not only does digital overwhelm distract us — a study found that U.S. residents check their smartphones 352 times a day, affecting our productivity — but it can also lead to real health issues. Medical research concludes that too much screen time leads to insomnia, visual problems, decreased bone density and high blood pressure. Beyond physical ailments, digital overload has effects on our mental and emotional health, increasing anxiety and depression.


Some businesses see the solution as an outright cell phone ban at work. Yet this can lead to disgruntled employees who feel more like toddlers at daycare than entrusted adults. I've always found people respond best to autonomy — give them ownership over something, and their care factor increases.There is a better way to balance a modern workplace to maintain meaningful connections and accomplish our goals for success. All it takes are some intentional changes...Related: The Dangers of Digital Fatigue, and How to Prioritize Your Mental HealthCreate new opportunities for in-person connection at workThe pandemic reshaped the workplace when work-from-home rates tripled from 2019 to 2021, but it may have created disconnection for the sake of convenience. So how can you reforge those in-office connections?


Try replacing one Zoom meeting a week with in-person meetups, either at the office or even at a local coffee shop. Or host one large company-wide meeting once a week in person (like I do) so that the entire staff can see each other face to face across separate departments.Besides simply meeting about projects, start implementing fun, team-building events that create moments for genuine connection and creativity. Let each department in your company brainstorm and come up with these fun activities, like mini golf, going to an escape room or obstacle course. Even working out together a couple times a week could be a way to bring team members together.Improve staff performance with off-screen organization and productivity toolsIt probably doesn't surprise you that someone like me — the CEO of a multi-million-dollar direct mail company — would still enjoy checking the mailbox every day and fingering through the letters and cards to see what's there. But these days, I'm noticing more professionals putting their phones down and picking up paper and a pen.Whether someone is mailing a letter, writing in a journal or sitting down to plan out their week with a calendar book, there is something alluring about striking a smooth piece of paper with ink and marking our goals, thoughts and desires down.


The deliberate act of interacting with a physical object forces us to slow down, savor the moment and be fully present in the experience. Help staff members plan out their weeks and avoid digital distractions by giving them paper planners, desk calendars or journals. Consider investing in branded journals as well to improve company morale and pride.The benefits may trickle down to your bottom line — numerous studies show that reading comprehension, focus and memory can all be improved by switching from screen-based reading to something paper-based.Related: The Surprising Reason Why This Young Tech Entrepreneur Swears By Pen and PaperUse direct mail marketing to increase revenue and cover expensesCreating more in-person meetups and events as well as giving out more tangible tools for organization does have a cost. One way to increase your budget for these objectives is to drive up revenue with direct mail marketing.


The United States Postal Service partnered with researchers from Temple University's Center for Neural Decision Making to study the reason print holds more gravitas for us as humans. Turns out, after intense scientific study, the reason direct mail makes a greater impact is because of the way our brains respond to stimulation.Holding a physical advertisement activates our senses of touch, smell and sight and elicits an emotional response inside a specific neural area of the brain that allows us to recall the ad for a longer period of time. Ultimately, the study determined that print ads increased the desirability of the product as opposed to digital ads that were forgotten faster.Not only can direct mail make a great impression on your target audience and ideal customer, its response rate is up to nine times higher than that of email. In fact, in 2023, 74% of marketers agreed that direct mail delivers the best return on investment.Also, studies found that there was an 18% greater return on investment when the business incorporated direct mail in their multichannel marketing mix as opposed to relying on digital alone.


One of my clients, an RV and motor home flipper, mailed about 24,000 postcards and made $50,000 in revenue for an ROI of 590%. We have over 700 other direct mail case studies with even more eye-popping ROIs, some as high as several thousand.Related: How to Boost Your Business With Direct Mail Automation and Retargeting — a Detailed Beginner's GuideAfter making some of these adjustments, write down exactly how those changes affected your business and relationships.

18,Strong Leaders Use These 4 Strategies to Build Trust in Their Workplace,"Apr 11, 2024",Max Azarov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/good-leaders-use-these-four-strategies-to-build-trust/472051,"
More people are working remotely these days, and there are many tools that business owners can use to help their teams stay on track with their workloads, no matter where they are based. But the secret sauce to making a remote or hybrid team work well together isn't technology; it's trust.According to a 2023 study by WFH Research, approximately 13% of people employed full-time work from home 100% of the time, and 28% of this group of people split their time between home and the office. This remote work trend is huge in tech, finance and administrative office-based jobs.There's still some debate about whether everyone should return to the office, but most people agree that a mix of home and office work will probably become the norm. Why? Companies are seeing proof that amending their policies to allow people to work remotely can boost productivity and profits while keeping employees happy and balanced. It's a win-win!



Trust, not micromanagement, is the key to successBuilding trust is crucial for peak performance, whether your company goes fully remote, hybrid or follows another model. Research backs this up loud and clear.Studies by Paul J. Zak, a Harvard-trained neuro-economist, show that employees in high-trust workplaces are more productive, collaborative and loyal. They're also happier and less stressed, leading to even better results. This ""trust over surveillance"" approach is echoed by leaders like Dropbox CEO Drew Houston, whose company thrives with a 90% remote workforce.


Novakid, a fully remote international company, has achieved success by implementing specific strategies that foster trust between managers and remote staff. The following tactics can be used by any business leader who is establishing a thriving remote team.Related: 5 Ways To Establish Trust In a Remote Workplace1. Building trust is the secret weaponStudies show a clear link between trust (think of it as social glue) and strong economies – and that applies to companies too. But for trust to take root, leaders need to genuinely believe in it themselves. You can't build a trusting company culture (remote, hybrid or in-office) if you're constantly second-guessing your team.The key is finding the right balance. Trust your employees to be responsible, and empower them with the tools they need to do their jobs well (think project management software and clear communication channels). But don't be naive – some monitoring is essential to identify any performance issues.


Create a system where everyone feels accountable. It should be easy to flag unresponsive colleagues or missed deadlines. This can be done via workforce productivity and workflow management tools. Most importantly, this can be done by fostering a culture where everyone feels comfortable speaking up about concerns.2. Hiring for trust and autonomyJob interviews are a way to find great people who fit your company culture, especially people who thrive with the freedom that comes from trust.Sharpen your HR processes and interviewing skills. Learn to ask questions that tell the real story – can they handle a challenge, how do they deal with mistakes, are they team players? Look for both their skills and their personality – watch body language and see if their answers align with your values of trust and honesty.Once you find the right fit, onboarding should be smooth. Don't overwhelm new hires on the first day – explain their role, set expectations, provide all relevant materials they will need for their job and then step back. Trust them to get up to speed. They'll appreciate the freedom and responsibility, and it sets the stage for a trusting work style.


Related: 6 Ways to Encourage Autonomy With Your Employees3. Keeping everyone on the same pageBuilding a team that holds itself accountable is key, no matter your work style. Here's how:Set clear expectations: Make sure everyone knows what's expected of them.Open communication: Keep the door open – your team needs to feel comfortable talking to you.Regular feedback: Give regular check-ins to identify any roadblocks. Be honest and clear if something needs improvement.Accountability can be difficult to implement and manage within fully remote teams. The key is finding the balance: empower your team with autonomy, but don't be afraid to address performance issues. You don't want to micromanage, but some oversight is necessary. The bottom line is that if someone consistently underperforms, it's important to take action, up to and including firing them. This shows everyone that you take accountability seriously.4. Focus on results, not busyworkForget about micromanaging with time trackers or spy software. The best way to gauge performance remotely is to set clear job duties, deadlines and expected outputs.


Remote teams already use project management and workflow tools. These can show you if someone's falling behind, but constant monitoring isn't the answer.Tracking software can creep into employees' personal lives, and that's a big no-no. Trust your team to get their work done – let them figure out how to be most productive. Maybe that means working in bursts or outside typical hours. Micromanaging with monitoring tools just makes people unhappy and unproductive, and according to a Deloitte report, is fueling the ""quiet quitting"" trend.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""Are you stupid?""The words are harsh, even to look at. I could never imagine saying them to a member of my team.Yet, when I set out to write this article and asked everyone in my company to talk about workplace trauma, these were among their experiences: CEOs calling people stupid in a meeting; managers blowing up over small mistakes or lying about a promotion; feeling stressed and being yelled at every single day. Fifteen percent of my employees were willing to share their stories. Some were hard to believe.



Most surprising was how prevalent workplace trauma is. Not big ""T"" trauma that results from dangerous or criminal behavior, but rather ""little t"" trauma that still causes serious harm, but results from poor leadership. Toxic work environments leave people feeling unworthy, incompetent and unhappy, diminishing their potential contribution to a company. While it does take individual responsibility to work through trauma from one job to the next, leaders and managers can and should want to help empower them to heal.Related: How Managers Can Dismantle Workplace Trauma


The horror storiesTrust is easy to lose and harder to gain, but a history with toxic leaders can make that even worse. At every traumatic workplace, my employees reported hearing the same messages: ""We're transparent,"" ""a family"" and ""We trust you to do your work."" Then, the inconsistencies began. One described a former manager, who spread negative gossip and was hypercritical of even the smallest mistakes, as leaving her with PTSD. One called his particularly condescending former manager a ""nonviolent psychopath.""Even after leaving a toxic company, employees risk carrying that trauma to their next workplace. They may read articles on spotting a healthy culture, even join a new team, hopeful, but any signs of toxic behavior and they quickly lose that optimism. Many stay, feeling trapped without options or economic stability, but the more time spent in these toxic work environments, the deeper they instill fear and insecurity. Without healing, people carry that trauma with them, reducing the potential value they might contribute or desire to contribute to any future company.The impact of leadersLeadership behavior sets the tone for the entire organization. In my 30-year career, I have never yelled because yelling would be incongruent with my expressed beliefs that mistakes are opportunities for growth and continuous improvement. When words and actions are inconsistent, an employee who experienced trauma will be quicker to lose all trust in that company's leadership.While the vision and actions of senior leadership lay the foundation for a supportive workplace culture, daily experiences with direct management and coworkers have the greatest impact. As a CEO, I can equip managers with the tools they need to build trusting relationships and empower them to support healing, so we hired someone to package the insights and skills of our top-performing managers into a training program. By training them in effective communication, recognizing trauma and fostering an emotionally safe environment, leaders can help managers mitigate the effects of past traumas on the rest of the workplace.

Leaders and managers need to do more than talk about emotional intelligence and living company values — they need to visibly and consistently demonstrate actions that measure up with those words over time. One team member remarked how surprised he was that the CEO would email him to recognize his efforts only days after joining the team, but even more so that every ongoing experience with leadership since has aligned with that behavior.Start working to rebuild trust from day one. One person commented on the authenticity and transparency he felt in having his first interview with the CEO and how, after over nearly four years with us, that has continued. Most of my employees recalled smaller, day-to-day events making the biggest difference — supportive emails, free movie tickets and flexibility to handle last-minute emergencies. They also mentioned opportunities for team bonding over non-work topics, like our Vegas trip and book club, as helpful in releasing trauma by calming concerns that coworkers might cause similar problems.Plan, assess and improveThere is no magic way to heal people of their preexisting trauma, but regular check-ins are the best way to help. It can be uncomfortable speaking about toxic experiences, but one-on-one, managers can more easily draw out, identify and help resolve individual workplace challenges. Create a standardized process to ensure consistent experiences and leverage technology platforms to facilitate scheduling and clear communication.


HR can be valuable in supporting these check-ins: taking in employee feedback, assisting managers or participating themselves. When we hired an HR leader, she took over regular one-on-ones and her open-ended questions were incredibly successful in unearthing past workplace trauma. Her ability to make people feel comfortable garnered valuable feedback, which has built stronger relationships and done so much good for the company.When check-ins are successful, recognize and reward the efforts behind that success. One employee described the profound impact of a simple ""thank you"" on his trust in leadership and organizational commitment. By exemplifying and sharing stories of successful check-ins, leaders encourage an environment of supportive manager-employee interactions.Related: Career Trauma Is a Real Thing. Here's How to Recognize and Recover From It.Our positive resultsAt a social event in February, we invited everyone to send their coworkers Valentines expressing how special it was to work together. The next day, we received the messages others sent us and a second wave of positive feelings. Then, people took to social media and deepened the impact: ""Amazing to wake up and read all the love from our Influence Mobile family. Thank you for encouraging such an enjoyable and positive workplace environment."" That single spark of positivity became contagious.


No one can heal someone else's trauma, but leaders can do a lot to facilitate their healing journey. By fostering a culture of consistency and support between employees, managers and coworkers, we can build a work environment where people overcome past workplace trauma.

20,How to Establish and Maintain Effective Work Boundaries as an Entrepreneur (and Why It's Important),"Apr 10, 2024",Adam Markel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-establish-and-maintain-effective-boundaries-at-work/471565,"
The role of work-life harmony (not balance) in the life of entrepreneurs cannot be overstated since it is both a personal issue and an organizational concern. Business owners spend many hours and have to be highly engaged in the process of establishing and developing their businesses.On the other hand, failing to recognize the importance of boundaries can result in burnout, which affects decision-making, creativity and overall productivity. A healthy work-life integration (and harmony) recharges entrepreneurs, enabling them to be resilient and maintain productivity for a long time.These mindful activities far away from the workplace bring in mental and physical well-being, which prevents the negative effects of chronic stress. Harmonious living also fosters creativity and innovation, offering entrepreneurs the much-needed headspace to think strategically and make informed decisions.



Apart from individual gains, putting work-life harmony on top of the list will help the business prosper in the long term because a rested and concentrated entrepreneur is more likely to handle difficulties and make good managerial decisions. Finding the right mix is not simply a personal fulfillment issue, but an investment in the longevity of individuals and entrepreneurs.Related: 5 Expert-Backed Strategies for Setting Boundaries at Work


Identifying and communicating personal boundariesThe ability to identify and communicate one's boundaries is an essential component of self-awareness and healthy interpersonal relationships. It includes delving into one's values, emotional limits and personal needs.Personal boundaries are determined by introspection, that is, by reflecting on what feels comfortable and respectful in various situations. This self-awareness enables people to draw the line between what is acceptable and unacceptable, creating a basis for the establishment of limits. When these boundaries are identified, communication becomes critical.Communicating boundaries means identifying needs, expectations and limits openly and assertively. Communication enables people to stand up for themselves, establishing a relationship based on mutual respect. It is not only about setting boundaries, but it is also about clearly communicating them and ensuring that others are aware of them and respect them.This procedure encourages sincerity and makes it less likely to have misunderstandings or conflicts. The shared understanding of boundaries, open dialogue and active listening create a healthy environment where individuals are heard and respected. Essentially, the process of determining and articulating personal boundaries is a living process, granting people the ability to engage in relationships in an authentic, assertive and reciprocal manner.


Related: Why Setting Boundaries Is the Secret to Preserving Energy and Focusing on What MattersTools and techniques for boundary managementNavigating your personal boundaries means using various tools and techniques that give you the strength to keep a balance in your life.Self-awareness serves as a basic instrument, making people think about their values, emotional requirements and boundaries. This self-reflective practice allows one to identify their own boundaries.Assertive communication is an important skill that enables the communication of limits to others confidently.Priority management skills are crucial in setting boundaries, allowing individuals to have specific hours for work, personal endeavors and leisure.Realistic expectations, the ability to say no when needed, and prioritization are powerful tools to avoid the feeling of overwhelm and burnout.Mindfulness practices like meditation or journaling improve awareness and help identify situations where boundaries are being challenged.Helpful advice through the help of a professional or by interacting with a supportive community can also be an effective tool for boundary management.


Bringing together these tools and techniques, an integrated approach to boundary management, allows people to build a life according to their values and priorities, promoting better relationships and well-being.Achieving sustainable equilibrium for successThe key to long-term success is sustainable equilibrium, which relies on a broad and dynamic view spanning multiple facets of life. It includes not only prevailing professions but also personal health, relationships and self-development.The act of making self-care and mental health a priority provides a strong base, making people strong enough to face the challenges that come with the process of seeking success. Diligent goal-setting using time management techniques leads to long-term productivity that involves no compromises in terms of health or meaningful relationships.The development of a supportive network and finding a mentor help to maintain the process of continuous learning and support a person in overcoming failures. Flexibility is also essential because life changes and priorities do not remain the same.


Self-evaluation becomes a sort of navigator, which can be steered to accommodate changes in the environment. Hence, the right mix of short-term successes and long-term sustainability requires individuals to develop a sense of purpose for their actions to be aligned with their core values.Essentially, sustainable equilibrium is a continuous journey that ties professional and personal satisfaction, providing a robust and meaningful foundation for sustainable success.Related: Stop Splitting Yourself in Half: Seek Out Work-Life Boundaries, Not BalanceWork-life harmony is a cornerstone of success for entrepreneurs, ensuring sustained success and personal happiness. Without a healthy mix, entrepreneurs, who are often too busy managing their businesses, burn themselves out. Awareness of the need for integration not only preserves mental and physical health but also improves the quality of decision-making, creativity and overall productivity.


Going on vacations helps build resilience that prevents the negative outcomes of chronic stress. In the end, life-work equilibrium is not just about enjoying personal satisfaction; it is a strategic choice that empowers entrepreneurs to face challenges with clarity, ingenuity and long-term success in their careers.

21,Organized Labor Disputes Are on the Rise. Here's Why Leaders Should Pay Attention,"Apr 10, 2024",Jesse Meschuk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-leaders-should-pay-attention-to-the-rise-in-organized/471964,"
In 1919, the United States was gripped by two seemingly unrelated trends: a global pandemic (influenza) and a wave of labor unrest. Four million workers, or one-fifth of the labor force, went on strike that year.Flash forward a century, and history appears to be repeating itself. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and other multi-layered economic factors, labor strife has rocked a variety of economic sectors: automotive workers, nurses in multiple states, Hollywood writers and actors, and journalists all went on strike. Unionization movements within tech and other nontraditional sectors sprung up all at once. Could it all just be a coincidence, or is something more happening here?Any broad shift in dynamics between workers and management has implications for the present and future of employment in the United States. A deeper understanding of the forces at work could be valuable for a variety of businesses.



In analyzing the commonalities and trends from these recent examples, three lessons stand out:1. Rewarding labor for corporate successWhen business is booming, executives who hold an equity stake in the company are rewarded. Workers lower on the food chain typically do not see a similar boost in their paychecks. This phenomenon is nothing new; however, many workers were hit disproportionately hard in the 2008-2009 financial crisis and again during the recession stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Now that the economy has improved in several sectors, employees are looking to recover lost gains and receive what they feel is their fair share.


Questions like this motivated the United Auto Workers (UAW), which accepted lower pay for newer workers after the Great Recession. Business results for auto companies have significantly improved, and the UAW looked to recapture lost benefits and increase wages for all levels of workers. Their members, motivated by rising inflation and leveraging their collective power, successfully navigated a significant step change in compensation and massive increases in benefits. Similarly, Hollywood writers and actors have recently struck significant deals to navigate changing business models and protect livelihoods. The question is: did it need to be this difficult?The takeaway: today's labor force is increasingly aware of how their companies are performing and has significantly more transparency into what their peers and superiors are earning. They also have more avenues to mobilize. Work diligently and proactively to understand and design systems in which business success can bring increased rewards for your workers to avoid the need for protracted negotiations.Related: 75000 Kaiser Permanente Workers Strike, Demand Better Pay2. Disenfranchised employeesWhen HBO's streaming unit rebranded to ""MAX"" in 2023, it ceased crediting writers, directors and producers individually. That hit a nerve within the guild representing each faction. Fears of AI adoption — were addressed in the ultimate resolution to the writers' strike.


The sense of disenfranchisement among workers upset with the direction of their companies or their industries wasn't unique to the labor strikes in entertainment. Although the money at stake in Hollywood might have been greater, many fields of work run the risk of intrusion from AI in a way that threatens workers' livelihoods.The takeaway: Open communication from management about changes to company policies, practices and directions is essential. Businesses must evolve to stay afloat; the more transparent management can be about that evolution, the less likely workers are to feel disenfranchised. Engage with them directly in the process to think through how shifting technology can help, what concerns exist and how to navigate it together to retain key talent and keep engagement levels high. With AI in particular, consider what skills will be required as business models evolve and how you can properly support and train workers along the way so they can leverage these new tools to help your business grow.Related: Huge UPS Strike Could Wreck U.S. Economy and Benefit Amazon3. Investors and owners can be disconnected from workers' day-to-day realityThe increase in venture capital and hedge fund investments in healthcare and print journalism — to name two — drove pushes for increased efficiency and profits. This correspondingly made a number of employees, many of whom entered these careers with altruistic or public-service-oriented mindsets, feel like their companies were becoming increasingly disconnected from their day-to-day work and, in some cases, their values/reasons for working in the field. A number either left their careers or became disillusioned, feeling they had misaligned incentives between the purpose of their jobs and the processes they were now being asked to follow.


The takeaway: The more disconnected management is from its labor force, the more it invites the potential for misaligned incentives between the two parties. Bridging the gap is necessary as industries consolidate and pushes for efficiency continue. Narrow the knowledge gap between executives in the C-suite and workers on the ground. Understand what motivates employees to do their jobs well and involve them directly in designing more effective and efficient processes - it will drive improved results, engagement, and better change management as businesses evolve.Related: How Your Business Can Be Ahead of the Curve by Looking Backward and Thinking ForwardIn summaryHow can managers anticipate sources of labor unrest before they rise to the level of concern? The following practical considerations can help achieve one or more of the objectives outlined above.Structure incentives and compensation models so everyone wins as business results improve.Keep your employees informed about where business models are shifting (e.g., streaming, AI, etc.), and proactively think through potential employee concerns and how to address them.Involve employees directly in designing more effective and efficient processes and more transparently share your goals. Listen to their concerns and find a way to improve business results, but employee engagement and alignment are a strong part of the equation.Demonstrate the value of ""walking a mile in the employee's shoes"" - have leaders spend time doing the day-to-day work better to understand their thoughts, areas of opportunity, etc.Put in place a system of regular pulse checks with the entire organization to catch issues before they become significant.

22,You Need a Community With Shared Values to Find Long-Term Success — Here's How to Cultivate It.,"Apr 6, 2024",Megan Thudium,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/everyone-wants-long-term-success-heres-how-to-find-it/470976,"
Don't underestimate the possibilities of growing a purpose-led community. It's one of the most influential tools in the entrepreneur's toolkit to help guide your business toward longevity and long-term happiness.Because let's be honest — no one wants to be unhappy in their business. In this article, you will learn the importance of building a community of shared purpose and how it impacts the continued success of your business.Entrepreneurial success sits at the heart of purposeI would like to see more purpose-led businesses being built in the world.



Purpose-led businesses are run by entrepreneurs who lead from the heart and with the conviction that their business is doing good in the world. The business solves an important problem — maybe one that is societal or environmental. Purpose-led businesses aren't driven solely by profit but by the change the entrepreneur wants to see in the world.Surprisingly, my entrepreneurial journey didn't start with purpose. It began with the idea of starting a marketing agency and solving complex marketing problems. But as my business grew, I became less driven by profit and success. Over time, my main driver became purpose, or the value that I want to bring to the world. It doesn't matter where you are on your business journey. You can take the alternative path and refocus your business on purpose.


Building a community of shared purpose-driven entrepreneurs helped me forge this path of success. It was their inspiration, advice, and support in tough times that got me to five years in business. Remember, 2 in 10 businesses fail in the first year of operating. If you're past this point, you're thriving!When you forge a community of shared interests, you see more business projects aligned with your values, better collaboration opportunities and new service verticals emerging. Don't underestimate the power of collaboration and aligning with other business leaders on purpose. Nurturing this community is a successful ingredient to business growth — equally compared to organizational, marketing and sales tactics.Related: Why a Purpose-Driven Business Is the Real Key to SuccessIdentify your communityWho will you build your purpose-led community with? That question is answered by identifying your values and purpose as an entrepreneur.


Start the process by identifying the purpose of your business. It took me hours of reflection to narrow down my purpose and values, which then fed decisively into my business. Personally, my purpose is to forge meaningful connections, lead by example and support marketers and creatives on their path to climate work — and become an ecomarketer, someone who puts people and the planet at the center focus of all their marketing campaigns.Understanding my purpose has equipped me to identify a community of like-minded entrepreneurs interested in sustainability. It also helped me to connect with them on a deeper level. When you have a shared purpose, community connections go deeper, from transactional to building a world collaboratively for the better.Once you've identified your purpose, find your community. The LinkedIn community is a great platform to connect with entrepreneurs and to identify those who might share the same values as you. It's truly the largest business networking social media platform in the world with 1 billion members. You can use the search function to identify members sharing and talking about similar topics to yours.But being engaged actively in the community will help you identify those with common values. These individuals are pure gold and will help your business grow. They champion your ideas, connect you to opportunities and push your industry forward. Remember, identifying the group is only the beginning. As mentioned, your long-term success comes from fostering relationships with those having a shared purpose.


Related: 3 Reasons Why Purpose-Driven Businesses Can Help You Find Better Hires, Mentors and InvestorsHow to build a community of shared purposeOnce you've built the bridge, you can follow these three pathways to building a community of shared-purpose entrepreneurs.Change of mindset: Long-term — To build a community, you must have the right mindset. First, put personal gain aside and focus on the community. You will be surprised to see that the community-first mindset leads to more authentic connections that build long-term business growth. It also focuses your sights on the future, building connections that last years and don't stop at the end of a transaction.Step up: Contribute — Contributing is another important step toward building a community of purpose-driven entrepreneurs. You can't ask for value from others if you're not willing to step up and give the value yourself. Meaningful connections are made by giving a helping hand, passing along business opportunities to your community and offering collaboration opportunities. To build a community of shared purpose, you must embody your values and practice them openly.Pass the torch: Champion other entrepreneurs — Long-term entrepreneurial success comes from taking you out of the equation. Your growth goals, objectives and business strategy aren't the most important things in the entrepreneurial circle. Champion others' work, give referrals and forge meaningful connections.Find entrepreneurs with the same values and a similar journey as yours. Then, work on forging a community of shared purpose with those entrepreneurs. It's this one business tactic that will bring you longevity and long-term business success.

23,The Art and Science of Promoting Emotional Intelligence,"Apr 5, 2024",Ben Richmond,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-business-leaders-can-achieve-and-promote-emotional/472052,"
If the hope is to ensure individual and organizational success in today's dynamic work environment, emotional intelligence (EI) stands out as a critical employee management skill. And that term extends beyond just merely having strong social abilities; at the right levels, it directs the employee experience towards improved conflict resolution, decision-making, adaptability and team-building through an understanding of how to manage emotions effectively. It's also invaluable when addressing challenges concerning evolving market conditions and economic volatility, and facilitates more meaningful relationships. Lastly, it builds trust by contributing to a more positive and open environment, even during tough times.While technical skills are vital in order to succeed at most jobs, it's imperative for leaders to recognize the importance of the above-mentioned soft skills. In fact, according to Harvard Business School, EI is now one of the most desired interpersonal characteristics in the workplace, with a remarkable 71% of employers reporting valuing it more than technical capabilities when evaluating candidates. Data also reveals that 90% of top performers have above-average EI, and that individuals who work with leaders who have higher levels of that quality feel 50% more inspired than those who work with a leader notably lacking in it.Related: How to Leverage Emotional Intelligence and Empathy for Maximum Success



Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to lead teams of various sizes, backgrounds and experience levels, which has afforded me a multidimensional understanding of how varying personal experiences and levels of emotion impact both individual and team dynamics. I've strived to create a workplace that prioritizes empathy and understanding — recognize that triggers, for example, are different for every person and, in turn, influence their behaviors and emotional reactions.Also, as a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community, candor about my personal experiences — including coming out and navigating the child conception journey with my husband — has added an essential layer to both my EI and overall approach to leadership. By being straightforward and honest, I'm better able to build trust, reliability and more open lines of communication.


Related: 6 Ways to Support LGBTQIA+ Employees' Mental Health as a Business LeaderWhy emotional intelligence is more vital than everEmotional intelligence in the context of today's dynamic work environment takes on heightened significance due to recent external factors that often add pressure or stress to individuals' personal lives. Part of developing it well is an ongoing effort to understand and manage not only your own emotions but to adeptly read others'. Given the current climate — including volatile markets, labor concerns broadly and political unrest — a new level of empathy is required.Fostering an environment where diversity of outlook is both respected and encouraged is also vital to strengthening psychological safety — creating an environment in which individuals feel comfortable voicing information about personal challenges, triggers or other workplace concerns. According to McKinsey, 89% of employees believe psychological safety is essential, and workers who feel their identity and perspectives are valued by leadership feel more inclined to contribute to team effectiveness, achieve higher levels of learning, perform better overall and remain in their positions longer.In my experience, psychological safety also makes individuals more comfortable taking risks, which can help them readily admit to and learn from mistakes.Related: Psychological Safety in the Workplace is More Than Being NiceHow to foster emotional intelligence As readers likely know, the integration of generative AI into workflows is reshaping the job landscape, yet there remains an ongoing need for the human touch. A 2023 study found that employers expect to increasingly value soft skills that foster rich, people-centric company cultures, and 92% of companies report valuing these capabilities at least as much as hard skills. It follows, then, that focusing on their development is a pivotal step in forming better leaders. Here are various qualities/abilities that contribute to that:• Demonstrating social awareness through communication and empathy: Clear and concise communication is a critical aspect of fostering a team that values trust, understanding and active engagement. In order to be an effective leader, it's crucial to find a balance of both self-awareness and social awareness. The former is recognizing how your words or actions may emotionally impact other team members, while the latter describes an ability to recognize their unique emotions and perspectives. Because what might be a challenge or distraction for one teammate may not hold the same value or level of consideration for another.Related: How to Create Socially Aware Video Content Without Coming Across as Fake


Data points to the success of an empathetic leadership approach, as the majority (86%) of employees believe it boosts morale and 87% say it's an essential component to fostering a positive and productive environment.To become a more empathetic team lead, focus on practicing empathy in your everyday interactions. Take the time to slow down, and be deliberate in your own actions and motivations—always questioning whether there are alternative ways of approaching situations that could enhance the well-being of everyone involved. And this is especially important when problem-solving: Proactively think about how situations could impact individuals (either positively or negatively) to help avoid surprises or negative reactions.Another key consideration: When proposing approaches to problem-solving, assess whether a collaborative effort involving viewpoints from diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise would be more effective. This approach also fosters a sense of belonging and empowerment and encourages innovative thinking and risk-taking. Lastly, demonstrating empathy can inspire others to lead with the same intention, which helps to create a more collaborative and happy workplace.To get a sense of where you fall as a leader, try practicing active listening. For example, I initiate regular check-ins with team members to discuss their concerns, challenges, passions and anything else they'd like to impart. When meeting with subordinates, I ask if they have worries or concerns about current or future projects, allow them to propose solutions, then offer support wherever possible. I've also found that being vulnerable about my own experiences with colleagues, both personally and professionally, encourages open dialogue, trust and collaboration.


When it comes to more complex topics, it's helpful to establish ground rules for respectful conversations in both individual and group settings and provide educational resources if you think they will be of assistance.Related: Why You Shouldn't Wait Have the Hard Conversations With Your Employees• Leading by example: I've found that one of the key ways to foster a healthy work environment is to model the behavior I want to see from others. A workplace that prioritizes organizational success and employee well-being doesn't just have open lines of communication: it demands consistent actions by leaders.Doing this can be as simple as avoiding multitasking (including checking emails during team meetings), or making a point of attending workshops alongside team members to learn new skills. You can also recognize achievements, both large and small, among staff members. Another area in which I attempt to lead by example is taking time off from work for mental resets, and not disguising it. This is invaluable in improving well-being, enhancing creativity and increasing productivity. When I make a point of doing that, employees then feel more comfortable doing so, which helps draw healthy boundaries between work and personal lives.


• Fostering free expression and risk-taking: I also try to set standards for a positive culture where employees feel empowered to take risks, express themselves freely and advocate for what they believe in. A few years ago, for example, I was involved in the establishment of the first Employee Resource Group (ERG) for women at Xero in an effort to improve the company's overall inclusivity. This was aimed at breaking down barriers for women in various roles and allowed me to demonstrate an approach to leadership that supports diversity.Related: How to Leverage Employee and Business Resource Groups to Create a More Diverse and Inclusive WorkplaceThat ERG's continued success has, happily, earned me greater trust from colleagues. Its initiatives broadened my perspective and equipped me with skills to better understand and address the challenges or biases other team members may experience.Another way to ensure your leadership style and approach are developing is to solicit regular feedback from colleagues. In acknowledging that empathy and EI are skills that can be learned and strengthened, leaders will more likely regard feedback and challenges as opportunities for growth. Additionally, seek out external content such as books and podcasts, or work with an executive coach (I do all three). These can offer valuable insights into both better leadership and personal growth overall.

24,Prioritizing Your Employees' Well-being Is the Smartest Business Decision You Can Make — Here's How.,"Apr 4, 2024",Durana Elmi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/prioritizing-your-employees-well-being-is-the-smartest/466999,"
Employee wellness is more important than ever in today's fast-paced work environment. With my six years of experience leading the Cymbiotika team, I've learned employee wellness is more important than ever.Businesses prioritizing their staff's health and well-being see increased productivity, morale and overall job satisfaction, according to a 2016 article from the National Library of Medicine. Implementing wellness strategies is not only a smart move for the company's long-term success but is also a new standard to consider in a healthy workplace — so here are seven to take into consideration.Introduce meditation spacesMeditation is a powerful tool for managing stress and enhancing mental clarity. Recognizing this, companies have introduced dedicated meditation rooms, offering employees a tranquil space to unwind and refocus during the workday. These quiet areas serve as a physical reminder of the company's commitment to its employees' mental health. By encouraging regular breaks for meditation, businesses can help employees reduce stress and boost their productivity.



Related: This CEO Became a Better Leader By Harnessing a Practice Traditionalists IgnoreMake physical fitness a pillar of well-beingExercise is a key component of both physical and mental wellness. Many companies offer their employees access to personal trainers, encouraging them to incorporate fitness into their daily routines. This promotes physical health, helps manage stress and improves mental well-being. Such initiatives demonstrate a commitment to the holistic health of employees, acknowledging the strong link between physical activity and mental health.


Providing opportunities for exercise before or after work hours makes fitness more accessible and convenient for employees. It also creates a culture where health is valued and encouraged. Whether it's a group workout session or personalized training, the presence of a personal trainer can motivate and guide employees in their fitness journey.Incorporate culture-building events and activitiesPromoting holistic wellness in the workplace is about creating a supportive community. Many companies take advantage of this through internal wellness events, focusing on activities like breathwork classes and grounding exercises at the beach. These events not only celebrate the team in the office but also provide them with mental health and well-being tools. Such initiatives create a supportive environment where employees feel valued and their wellness is prioritized.In addition to these events, integrating regular wellness activities into the work routine can have a profound impact. For example, initiating yoga sessions or arranging informative talks on health topics provide a space for learning and relaxation. They also facilitate stronger connections among employees, fostering a sense of community and belonging. This approach benefits individual employees and enhances the overall work culture.Related: Workplace Wellness Isn't Just for Big Corporations. Here's How Small Businesses Can Build a Culture of Health.


Cultivate team spiritSocial connections at work are vital for a positive and collaborative work environment. Specialized team lunches provide a casual setting for employees to connect, share experiences and unwind. Such gatherings are an opportunity to build relationships and a sense of community within the team.These gatherings can be a platform for celebrating successes, sharing ideas or simply enjoying each other's company. They encourage open communication and a more relaxed atmosphere, leading to increased creativity and collaboration. Integrating social gatherings into the work culture strengthens team bonds and creates a more inclusive and enjoyable workplace.Boost morale with weekly raffles and wellness incentivesInnovative approaches to boosting morale, such as weekly raffles and wellness incentives, can have a significant impact. These activities add an element of fun and anticipation to the workweek. Raffles for wellness accessories or event tickets encourage employees to engage in activities that promote their health.These raffles and incentives serve a dual purpose: They reward employees and promote wellness-oriented activities. Participating in these raffles can be a motivational tool, encouraging employees to focus on their health and well-being. The excitement of winning and the benefits of the prizes contribute to a positive work atmosphere. This approach to employee engagement is a creative way to integrate wellness into daily work life.


Strengthen bonds with team building eventsTeam building is essential for creating a cohesive and collaborative work environment. Hosting multiple events each month is an excellent strategy for strengthening team bonds and improving camaraderie across internal teams. These events, from recreational activities to wellness workshops, provide employees with unique experiences that foster teamwork, offering a break from the routine and helping employees connect in new and meaningful ways.The nature and direction of internal events can vary in nature, but their impact on mental health and team dynamics is uniformly positive. Whether it's a group outing or an in-office workshop, these events create shared experiences that build trust, shared experience and understanding among team members. They also provide a platform for employees to showcase different skills and interests, contributing to a more dynamic and engaging workplace. Incorporating such events into the company culture can significantly enhance employee satisfaction and team cohesion.Related: Employee Morale Is More Than Pep Talks and High Fives — Here's How You Can Really Capture the Power of Team Spirit.Take employee fulfillment beyond the officeCommunity outreach is a powerful way to extend wellness beyond the office walls. Activities within your community, like a local beach cleanup, not only contribute to environmental conservation but also give employees a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Participating in these activities allows employees to connect with their community and with each other, fostering a sense of belonging and shared responsibility. This kind of involvement can be deeply rewarding, offering a break from the daily grind and a chance to make a positive impact.


Investing in employee wellness is a strategic move that yields significant returns. Businesses can cultivate a holistic approach to well-being, empowering employees to flourish both inside and outside the workplace. This translates to tangible benefits: increased productivity, enhanced morale and a more positive work environment, ultimately contributing to the company's long-term sustainability. Remember, prioritizing employee well-being has always been — and continues to be — a smart business decision.

In my late twenties, I worked as a government contractor at a subsidiary of Black & Decker. Without much warning, my division's contract was terminated, and I was given two choices: either work for the new employer at their proposed rate or leave the contract jobless.Rather than leaving us out in the cold, the leaders at Black & Decker showed compassion. They provided me and my colleagues with other opportunities and assigned an HR manager to help us search for positions at other locations and companies.Decades later, that experience has stayed with me. Amid industry-wide tech layoffs, I reflected on it often — particularly how I've woven the lessons learned from that difficult situation into the company I've spent the last 25 years building. Caring — not just empathy and compassion, but actually prioritizing the needs and well-being of employees — is something that I've tried to instill in my executive team and will serve you well when navigating layoffs as an employer.

Financial Prudence: We operate with a financially conservative approach, ensuring we have a buffer to weather economic downturns and support our team's development even during slow periods. This financial responsibility minimizes the risk of layoffs and shows our team we're invested in their long-term success.Don't Hire Too Quickly: We are committed to a strict policy not to expand the team unless we have the financial security to support those new hires. This approach ensures we avoid unnecessary employee turnover, which wastes valuable time and resources and deteriorates trust in our decision-making.Prioritize team Fit: We believe in finding the right fit — individuals who possess the necessary skills and align with the values, passion, and drive we bring to our work. This reduces turnover and fosters a more stable, engaged workforce that knows they can trust their colleagues and leaders to deliver.Focus on Long-Term Potential: We look beyond resumes and qualifications to assess an individual's potential for growth personally and within the company. Someone with aspirations and a desire to learn can make a far more significant impact than someone who just has the hard skills. These hires can evolve as our company does.Related: 3 Benefits of a Better Thought-Out Hiring ProcessBe an empathetic leaderWhen you care, your employees can feel and see it, and your culture will thrive because of it. Empathy is of paramount importance. The recent wave of layoffs across the technology landscape is a stark reminder of the human cost associated with financial decisions. The economic landscape will always be uncertain, but leaders who care about their employees will navigate hard decisions and challenging times by prioritizing emotional intelligence and empathy.While downsizing is difficult for many businesses, a strategic approach focused on empathy can significantly lessen the blow. Remember that empathy isn't just about grasping another's pain — it's about translating that understanding into action. It's also about recognizing the human element in everything we do.Losing the contract at Black & Decker was difficult, but it took just a little effort to help point my colleagues and me in the right direction, and that shining example has stuck with me for almost 30 years. As leaders, remember that our teams rely on us for direction and genuine support. Our team is our greatest asset, and empathy is the fuel that keeps them running at their best and can help soften the blow if a company has to navigate a downsize.


Related: 3 Prudent Hiring Practices to Acquire the Best TalentNever forget the value of your teamMy experience at Black & Decker left an indelible mark, shaping my approach to leadership and employee relationships today. While replicating their extraordinary efforts may not be universally feasible, the core message remains: empathy is a strategic advantage, not just a nicety. This lesson has become a cornerstone of my leadership philosophy, influencing every decision and interaction within the company. It taught me that leading with empathy creates an environment where employees feel valued and understood, fostering a priceless sense of belonging and commitment. Similarly, by being financially prudent, prioritizing long-term growth through strategic hiring practices and fostering a culture of trust, companies can minimize the need for layoffs altogether. This strategic blend of financial foresight, empathetic leadership and a commitment to the well-being of employees lays the groundwork for a resilient and thriving organization.This approach enhances employee loyalty and attracts top talent, who increasingly value corporate ethics and company culture when choosing a new position. Your employees are the foundation of your success — let's strive to create a business landscape where hiring for success and acts of compassion become the norm.

27,"Here's What You Need to Create a Dynamic, Innovative and Resilient Work Environment","Apr 2, 2024",Adam Markel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-create-a-dynamic-innovative-and-resilient-work/471671,"
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) is crucial for promoting innovation, satisfaction and success. To build a dynamic and resilient work environment, it is important to embrace different points of view and encourage inclusivity because such actions foster a positive culture, improve teamwork and draw in top talent.A change-proof mindset, on the other hand, is a strategic approach that promotes resilience and adaptability in the face of ongoing corporate change. A change-proof attitude is crucial for organizations to effectively navigate uncertainty and embrace innovation.These two concepts play pivotal roles in achieving innovation, something we will talk about in detail in this article.Related: Great Minds Think Unalike — 3 Ways to Drive True Innovation Through DiversityThe power of diversity in driving innovationThe power of diversity in driving innovation is immense and undeniable. In the realm of business and creativity, diversity acts as a catalyst for innovation, igniting the spark that leads to groundbreaking ideas and transformative solutions. It's not merely a matter of including different races, genders or cultural backgrounds, although these are crucial aspects. The essence of diversity's power lies in the amalgamation of varied perspectives, experiences, and ways of thinking and harnessing the collective wisdom that emerges when people with different viewpoints collaborate towards a common goal.



Industry giants like Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson credit part of their success to a diverse workforce, and they did it by harnessing the power of varied perspectives not just to drive innovation, but also to create products that cater to a wider range of needs.Embracing a change-proof mindsetEmbracing a change-proof mindset in business is akin to preparing a ship and its crew for a voyage across uncharted waters. It's about cultivating resilience, adaptability and an unwavering commitment to navigating the inevitable storms and uncertainties that lie ahead. This journey begins with leadership that not only embraces change but sees it as an essential ingredient for growth and innovation.Leadership must embody the change-proof mindset. This means demonstrating a genuine openness to new ideas, a readiness to pivot when necessary and a deep-seated belief in the power of resilience. Leaders must be the torchbearers of adaptability, showing by example how to embrace uncertainty rather than shy away from it. They must create a culture where failure is not seen as a setback but as a stepping stone to greater success. This culture encourages experimentation, where every attempt, successful or not, is valued for the lessons it brings.Embracing a change-proof mindset is about more than just surviving the storms of change; it's about setting sail toward new horizons with confidence and resilience. It requires leadership that inspires, a culture that empowers and an unwavering commitment to growth and innovation.


Related: From Passive to Resilient — These 7 Strategies Will Empower Your Team to Thrive Through ChangeSynergy of DEI and a change-proof mindsetThe synergy between Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) and a change-proof mindset is not just a strategic advantage; it's a transformative force that can redefine the landscape of any organization, propelling it towards unparalleled innovation, resilience and success.Diversity in thought and experience challenges conventional wisdom and pushes boundaries, leading to breakthroughs that would be impossible in a homogenous setting. Equity ensures that this diversity is more than just present; it's active, with every voice having the weight and the platform it deserves. Inclusion binds these elements together, creating a culture where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. This is the fertile ground on which innovation thrives.Now, when you infuse this DEI environment with a change-proof mindset, you amplify its potential exponentially. A change-proof mindset is characterized by resilience, adaptability and an unwavering commitment to growth and learning. It's about seeing change not as a threat but as an opportunity. This mindset ensures that the organization is not just surviving but thriving amidst change, leveraging the diverse perspectives and ideas that DEI brings to navigate and capitalize on the uncertainties of our world.


The synergy of DEI and a change-proof mindset creates an organization that is dynamic, resilient and innovative. One good example is the American multinational technology company, Google, because it promotes DEI and a change-proof mindset through its ""Unbiasing"" efforts, for example. This approach contributes to the creation of new products and services, such as AI-powered language translation tools.The same goes with IT and networking giant, Cisco, which exemplifies DEI and a change-proof mindset with its commitment to inclusivity through programs like the ""Conscious Culture Initiative."" Cisco encourages adaptability and innovation, which is largely evident in its networking solutions.Practical strategies for implementationWhat can organizations do to enhance DEI efforts? Below are some actionable steps that can be taken:Leadership commitment: Secure leadership buy-in for DEI, making it a strategic priority.Training and education: Provide regular DEI training to all employees that will help promote awareness and understanding.Inclusive policies: Review and update policies to eliminate bias and promote inclusivity.Diverse recruitment: Implement diverse recruitment practices to attract the best talent in the market.Employee resource groups: Establish and support employee resource groups for networking and support.Organizations that celebrate resilience, support ongoing learning and encourage flexibility can also aid in the promotion of a change-proof attitude. Establish a culture where obstacles are seen as chances for development and where staff members are encouraged to accept change. Emphasize the advantages of adaptability, quick thinking and forward-thinking behavior regularly. Give diversity in hiring and team composition top priority to connect DEI projects with a more comprehensive innovation strategy.Related: How to Promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Your WorkplaceOvercoming challenges and building momentumThe use of DEI and change-proof programs frequently encounter obstacles such as the necessity for ongoing education and unconscious biases that impact decision-making. A lack of quantifiable measures, imprecise communication and inconsistent leadership commitment can all impede success. It will take consistent work, open communication and a dedication to fostering an inclusive and flexible working culture to overcome these obstacles.To overcome resistance and build momentum, start with transparent communication regarding benefits. Encourage leaders to set an example, create inclusive policies and come up with measurable goals. Promote open dialogue between individuals, address concerns, and celebrate small wins to gradually shift attitudes and build sustained momentum for positive change.

28,How to Harness AI for a Competitive Edge in Marketing,"Apr 2, 2024",Rodolfo Delgado,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-harness-ai-for-a-competitive-edge-in-marketing/471647,"
Have you ever wondered how your favorite local spots seem to know exactly what you're craving or what book you'd love to read next? This isn't luck — it's the power of artificial intelligence (AI) at work. The digital era has ushered in a revolutionary shift, particularly for small businesses, enabling them to leverage AI for unparalleled personalization and engagement.Consider the local coffee shop that now knows to send a comforting note with a discount on your preferred latte during dreary Monday mornings or the family-owned bookstore that introduces you to your next favorite author, all based on your previous interactions. This level of personalization transcends traditional marketing, turning every customer interaction into an opportunity for connection.Related: Beware the Duplicity of OpenAI — 4 Strategies to Safeguard Your Brand in the Age of AI



Personalization with AIPersonalization is at the core of AI's transformative promise for small business marketing. It's about going beyond the one-size-fits-all approach, delivering experiences that resonate deeply with each customer. For instance, a boutique pet store might implement AI to remember not just purchase histories but significant dates for each pet, sending out personalized reminders and offers that perfectly coincide with these moments. This strategy transforms routine transactions into meaningful exchanges, fostering a sense of community among customers.By tapping into AI's potential, businesses not only survive in a competitive landscape but thrive, crafting experiences that convert customers into loyal advocates for the brand.


Building trust through transparency and the ethical use of AITrust is not just built on promises but on consistent, transparent actions. Small businesses leveraging AI have a unique opportunity to lead with transparency, setting a new standard in customer relations. Imagine a local health food store that uses AI to customize nutritional recommendations for its customers. By openly sharing how they use customer data to improve health outcomes and ensuring robust data protection measures, they deepen trust. This transparency transforms AI from a behind-the-scenes algorithm to a tangible benefit in customers' eyes.Many big brands, such as Amazon Fresh, have already made suggestions based on our previous shopping experiences. Small businesses, however, have the advantage of adopting new technologies quickly. The real opportunity for entrepreneurs comes from iterating technologies that improve their customers' experience — and they learn which are best by A/B testing quickly and efficiently.Related: How AI Can Help Small Businesses Do More in Less TimeLeveraging AI for enhanced customer engagementEngagement in the AI era transcends traditional marketing, turning every interaction into an opportunity for connection. A boutique gardening store, for example, uses AI to suggest plants and gardening tools based on the season and the customer's purchase history. Such personalized interactions do more than drive sales; they cultivate a community of gardening enthusiasts who feel seen and understood. Through AI, businesses can create a virtuous cycle of engagement, where each personalized recommendation strengthens the bond with their customers.


Customer experiences with AIInnovation through AI isn't just about automating processes; it's about redefining the customer experience. Small businesses can use AI to create interactive, immersive experiences that captivate customers. For instance, a small fashion retailer could use virtual try-on AI technology, allowing customers to see how clothes look on them through an app before making a purchase. This innovative use of AI enhances the shopping experience and bridges the gap between online and physical retail, offering personalized engagement that customers cherish.Related: How Small and Mid-Sized Businesses Can Leverage AI to Compete With Large CompaniesFostering a culture of continuous AI adoptionThe key to successful AI integration is fostering a culture open to continuous learning and adaptation. Small businesses thrive by staying nimble, and incorporating AI into their strategy should be an ongoing process, not a one-time effort. Encouraging a team mindset that values innovation and is not afraid to experiment with new AI applications can lead to discovering unique solutions that propel the business forward. Celebrating successes and learning from setbacks will create a resilient, AI-savvy organization.It's crucial to understand the impact AI has on the customer experience and the internal processes that power small businesses. Embracing AI technologies can streamline operations, from inventory management to customer service, freeing up valuable time for entrepreneurs to focus on strategic growth and innovation. This operational efficiency, paired with previously discussed enhanced customer engagement strategies, sets a solid foundation for small businesses to meet and exceed modern consumer expectations. In this era of rapid technological advancement, the integration of AI allows small businesses to remain competitive, agile and forward-thinking, ready to adapt to the ever-changing market landscape and consumer behavior patterns.


As the digital landscape evolves, so will the opportunities for small businesses to leverage AI. This promises an exciting future where technology and human creativity combine to create unparalleled customer experiences. The journey into AI-driven marketing is not without its challenges, but the rewards are boundless for those willing to embark on it.

29,"6 Principles for Nurturing a Healthier, Happier Workforce","Apr 2, 2024",Milind Pant,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-leaders-can-nurture-a-healthier-happier-workforce/471515,"
One of my favorite documentary series is Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones with Dan Buettner. I enjoyed it so much, I recommended it to all my friends and colleagues. I love how it helped uncover proven formulas that have been used for centuries for cultivating longer, healthier lives, including nutrition, daily movement, a sense of purpose and strong social networks within intergenerational communities.As a CEO of a global wellness company, it got me thinking: Is it possible to apply some of the learnings from these unique health regions in a business setting?While I've not had the chance to visit a Blue Zone myself (in fact, I was disheartened to learn that many of the Blue Zones are endangered), I have been giving a lot of thought to the role of the workplace in our health. I believe we have an opportunity, as business leaders and entrepreneurs, to nurture and grow environments where team members, customers and stakeholders can benefit from focusing on healthspan: not just living longer, but living better, healthier lives. But how do we get there?Related: 8 Ways to Foster an Environment of Employee Wellbeing



Designing a business Blue Zone Blue Zones don't just have to be defined as regions — companies, online communities and local workplaces can also be places that spark healthy aging. After all, many workplaces are communities with their own cultures and rituals that can either negatively impact our health or truly boost our well-being and longevity.The benefits of a healthy workforce are well documented: better morale, higher productivity, greater employee satisfaction, increased levels of retention and loyalty, and even better performance on the stock market.Here are six principles, borrowed from Blue Zones, that can inspire health and well-being in the workplace:


1. Providing nutritious food optionsWhile many companies provide snacks or lunches as a perk for their employees, more often than not, the foods on offer consist of highly processed junk and empty calories. Studies have shown that eating at work leads to increased weight and health risks, not to mention decreased productivity.Workplaces can encourage healthy eating habits by providing healthier (and tasty) food options and by getting creative with nutrition education and food that brings people together in workplace cafés and business meetings. At our business in China, for example, thousands of colleagues start the day by sharing healthy ""morning nutrition"" juices and smoothies.2. Instilling a sense of purpose in the workResearch has shown a connection between physical health and the ability to live out one's life purpose. And work can be a huge part of our purpose if we're able to find meaning in what we do. For business leaders, integrating purpose throughout the company's strategy and culture can provide opportunities for employees to connect with what matters to them, whether that's contributing to meaningful causes, working to improve their community or designing products and services that improve people's lives. For us, that means not only helping entrepreneurs succeed — but a shared goal of helping a billion people live healthier for longer.3. Fostering intergenerational connectionsOne thing many Blue Zones have in common is the ""village"" approach to life and work. Multiple generations care for one another and work together to achieve common goals — typically in multigenerational homes. But this concept can easily be replicated at work, particularly as the labor force ages. With five generations currently in the workforce, there's value in finding ways for all ages to connect and learn from one another, marrying deep industry knowledge and experience with innovation and new ways of thinking.


Related: 9 Ways Employees Can Stay Healthy at Work4. Encouraging community building and collaborationIn an era of remote and hybrid workplaces, forging genuine connections with colleagues and customers can be a challenge. But it is possible — and highly worthwhile. At our HQ, for example, we have a new ""Treehouse"" workspace that was designed to spark greater in-person connections and inspire collaboration among employees. But I've seen incredible results happen virtually as well — health and wellness entrepreneurs have created thriving online communities that are improving healthspan, thanks to a collective approach to healthy habits.5. Providing stress management resourcesStress at work is inevitable, but American workers are the most stressed in the world, according to a recent Gallup report. And high levels of ongoing stress are literally making people sick. Finding healthy ways to manage stress is crucial for improving our healthspan, and employers can do their part by providing resources and opportunities to practice stress reduction techniques. Personally, I'm a big believer in the power of exercise and mindfulness, but there's also a lot to be said for workplace wellness programs, health benefits and encouraging work-life balance.6. Modeling health yourselfAs a business leader navigating a demanding role running a global company, I've committed to a personal health journey inspired by many of the health and wellness entrepreneurs I follow online. And in the spirit of leading by example, I've chosen to share my journey every step of the way. My goal is to inspire others to explore healthier ways of living and working too, and I hope that more business leaders will join me in doing the same. The more we showcase healthy habits, the greater the impact we can have on improving people's lives — and our businesses.


Related: Don't Underestimate The Importance of Employee Wellbeing. Your Business Will Suffer The Most.Taken together, all of these factors make for a truly holistic approach to health at work. But keep in mind that even if you can only tackle one or two of these principles, you can still have a positive impact on people's healthspan.Designing businesses inspired by Blue Zones ultimately results in stronger companies run by healthier teams. And even if we don't live to 100, at the very least we're helping people live longer, healthier and happier lives. What could be better than that?

30,How to Avoid the Pitfalls of Collaboration – and When to Skip It Altogether,"Apr 2, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-avoid-the-pitfalls-of-collaboration-and-when-to/470724,"
Olympic relay races are the apex of collaboration. If one person falters, it impacts the whole team.When it comes to order, there's no hard-and-fast rule. Some teams put their fastest runner first, but others opt to put them last. According to USC's director of track and field, Caryl Smith Gilbert, sometimes you need someone ""hard-nosed"" like Usain Bolt (formerly the fastest man on Earth) to close the race. Just watch Bolt's final Olympic relay race and you'll understand exactly what Smith Gilbert means. ""It's anyone's race,"" says the announcer before the final handoff. But as soon as the baton is in Bolt's hand, the race is over. Jamaica wins by a long shot.Imagine if runners were less likely to participate in relays if they had to run last because they figured they'd get less credit. That's the case when it comes to publications in the field of economics. Researchers found that people were less likely to collaborate on articles if their surname was lower down in the alphabet — meaning they would be listed later in the byline. The reason is that when people think they're receiving less credit, they're less inclined to collaborate.

At the heart of Philadelphia's culinary legacy stands Pat's King of Steaks, a landmark synonymous with the iconic Philly cheesesteak.Frank Olivieri, the executive chef and owner, traces the origins of this beloved sandwich to a serendipitous moment when his Uncle Pat grew weary of the daily hot dog fare and improvised with ribeye trimmings.""One day my uncle Pat got so tired of eating hot dogs he said to my grandfather, go down to the butcher and see what trimmings he has from the ribeye and bring it back, and we'll make that sandwich that we always like to make,"" Olivieri told host Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media. That sandwich, cooked on the same open flat top as the hot dogs, became what we know now as the Philly cheesesteak.

32,Why Leaders Today Need to Foster a Blameless Culture to Boost Workplace Productivity — And How,"Apr 1, 2024",Mary Hubbard,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-leaders-today-need-to-foster-a-blameless-culture-to/471715,"
We have arrived at a nexus point in the relationship between employees and employers where two shifts are reshaping the traditional hierarchical leadership model. Thanks in part to the democratization of publishing through social media, young people feel more empowered over their careers than ever before. At the same time, these generations are confronting waves of fear and self-doubt. Business leaders must find intelligent and flexible ways to respond to this emerging reality because the old ways limit individual contribution and innovation.These two trends may appear paradoxical, but they are actually linked: As younger people increasingly realize they are more than their jobs, they are confronting an ingrained reluctance to challenge the status quo for fear of losing their job or being embarrassed in front of their peers. Yet these fears will not hold back change. In my role coaching and mentoring tech leaders, I have seen a push to create a more accessible and neutral workplace culture where everyone's opinion and participation are valued equally.This is crucial because the traditional leadership model will stifle the very innovation that Gen Zers, especially, are showing an aptitude for as digital natives. Leaders must establish a blameless culture that gives all generations the sense of safety to communicate openly and take risks. It starts with leading through humility.



Related: Why Every Leader Could Benefit From Adopting a Gen Z Mindset1. Own your own mistakes for greater trustIn traditional American corporate culture, executives can appear inaccessible and maintain an image of unquestioned authority. Issues arise when leaders are emotionally driven and illogical, so they end up negating their people or treating them poorly. Then, when employees come to me, they express insecurity about communicating in groups and fear a negative review or even getting fired. As a result, they don't escalate, challenge, innovate or show up for their team.


Recent research by the London School of Economics found that around a third of Gen Z and Millennial employees described themselves as unproductive due to a lack of support from their bosses. And where there was at least a 12-year gap between manager and employee, workers were almost three times more likely to be unsatisfied with their jobs. Results like these are symptomatic of a you-versus-me divide that has opened up between employees and leaders.To bring workplace culture back to a place of neutrality, managers have to convince people there will be no punishment for escalation or for promoting new ideas at the risk of failure. However, employees are more likely to believe a leader when they model the humility and transparency they want to see in others. That means owning their own mistakes publicly and showing employees they are willing to walk back changes when necessary. With 88% of managers admitting to concealing their mistakes to a Harvard Business Review study, there is work to be done as the old-school ideas about hierarchy in business continue to break down.2. Encourage people's self-worth for mutual benefitExecutives who fail to grasp the zeitgeist risk their company becoming a less desirable workplace. MIT Sloan Management Review research, for instance, found that corporate culture was the most reliable predictor of attrition. The failure to promote inclusivity and people feeling disrespected were two of the main factors contributing to a toxic work culture, which was ten times more relevant than compensation when forecasting turnover.There are always stories behind figures like these. My brother, for instance, felt the sting of being misunderstood when he won an award as a top representative at a major pharmaceutical company. Just as he was going to collect the prize, he was intercepted by the president, who took one look at his black suit and white Doc Martens and said to him: ""Those shoes are inappropriate. I never want to see you in them again.""


Without missing a beat, he replied: ""Well, I walked into over 150 offices in these shoes, outselling every other company rep."" My brother understood that today's leaders should encourage individuality and confidence when they are bringing demonstrable success. McKinsey agrees, with its research showing that the culture at leading innovators is full of creativity, excitement and optimism.The caveat is that younger generations cannot rely on a job to provide their self-worth. It is well known they want to work for companies driving social change, yet I have seen the desire for greater inclusivity create a false conflict between being direct and confident in their expertise and being kind. There is a shift happening, and I encourage employees to follow the lead of their contemporaries and own their skills and values.Related: If You Want Your Business to Succeed, Get Gen Z to Like You — How Gen Z Will Impact Business and Marketing Decisions in 20243. Align personal and organizational goalsIn my role with a large social media platform, I meet many creators and influencers, as well as reps from merchants and big brands. As a result, I have witnessed how the old employee contract is changing. So many of these young entrepreneurs started from nothing, and their stories are the same. They say, ""Instead of selling for you, I'm sourcing inventory and selling my stuff—I am the asset now.""


It is far from the world Boomers inherited when they were with companies for 20 to 30 years. Gen X still has the subconscious bias that if they work hard and stay loyal, the company will look after them. But in a global jobs market where people can literally work from anywhere, loyalty has become more transactional. For instance, Gallup described Millennials as the job-hopping generation and found that 60% are open to new opportunities despite being currently employed.So, my message to leaders is to let go of the mindset of owning employees and instead see your role as enabling their talents. Engage people in regular, constructive dialogue to align personal and organizational goals so they are seen as complementary. When employees know their value and feel safe to innovate, they are far more likely to become collaborative partners and make their personal value proposition a win-win for both parties.

33,What We Have to Gain By Talking About Grief and Loss At Work,"Mar 28, 2024",Cathy Thorpe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/what-we-have-to-gain-by-talking-about-grief-and-loss-at-work/471126,"
I was at my daughter's dance recital when I got the news that would change our lives: My husband, Harry, had cancer.Harry and I met in Germany when I had just turned 30. I had moved there for work and fell in love with him the first day I saw him. He had an infectious smile and a way of moving through life that both honored the little moments and created space for great adventures during our 19-year partnership.Harry was a planner, which made for a full life — but there was no amount of groundwork that could have prepared us for the last two years of his life, which were spent fighting cancer. They were the hardest years my family and I have endured, but they also taught me the most about love, hope and leadership.As the leader of a global company that supports seniors through at-home care, I'm accustomed to helping caregivers and families through loss, but losing Harry was a different experience entirely. I hit my rock bottom and learned a lot about how we show up and talk about grief.Death and grief are inevitabilities in life, yet even in my industry, we need to talk about it more. As awkward as it can be, the more we normalize conversations around death and grief, the better positioned we are to support those around us who are impacted by grief. Here's what my experience taught me:Related: Grief and Loss Can Seriously Impact the Ability to Work. Here's How to Create a Workplace That Supports Those Going Through It.



Being vulnerable builds better workplace relationshipsAs the CEO of a fast-growing company, I was accustomed to showing up to work with positivity to set the tone for my team. As I navigated the loss of Harry and the hardest obstacle of my life, however, I decided not to hide what I was going through from my team. Instead, I showed up to work exactly as I was.For me, the best way I could support my team and myself was to be honest about what I was going through. If I was sad one day, then I would let my coworkers know. I didn't want to be tip-toed around, and it was important my team felt comfortable looping me into workplace conversations. If I expected transparency, I had to lead by example.


Going through grief openly, I realized there was a deeper level of vulnerability I could tap into, and this made many of my workplace connections stronger. The more open I became with my team, the easier it was to find alignment.Being vulnerable at work has long been viewed as a weakness or unprofessional, but opening up to my team about my grief brought us closer together. It also gave us a more personal understanding of how we could better care for our customers and the caregivers who support them through their health challenges on an ongoing basis.There's a reason, the most leading research ties vulnerability to better team performance and a stronger sense of trust and inclusion within a company's culture.Supporting our ""whole person"" at work allows for better outcomesHaving survived one of the worst cards life could toss my way, after Harry's death, I started to re-evaluate what was important to me both in life and at work.Not only did my facade around putting my best face forward at work fade, but my conversations with my team changed. I had always taken an interest in my team as people, but acutely aware of our mortality, I became even more focused on learning about their hopes and dreams. I went all in on supporting my team and myself in reaching our truest potential both personally and professionally.


When you've been broken open and gone through the hardest obstacle you've ever faced, you realize you can get through anything. Rather than focus on rigid goals and outcomes, we honed in on what mattered most and trusted in our capabilities to reveal the best outcomes.As we became more focused and fulfilled in all aspects of our lives, we started to see incredible results. I started inviting anyone I wanted to build a greater connection with out for coffee or dinner, and if I had to pick my daughter up from school, I left work at 3:00 pm without feeling guilty.It's amazing what kind of life you can create when you put the right energy and focus towards it. As we made room for our personal goals, we thrived even more professionally — our caregiver net promoter scores rose from the low 60s to a world-class score of 74, and we saw significantly less turnover. Not only was there a renewed focus on fun, balance and achieving dreams, but we created more autonomy for each other to do our jobs.Related: 6 Ways Grief Can Transform Your Business and Mindset


Normalizing talk about death and grief at workWhen I engage in any kind of public speaking now, I make a point of talking about Harry. It can make people uncomfortable at first, but afterward, they always come up and thank me.When you normalize conversations around death and grief, you create space for people to heal, and in turn, you help those who are supporting them. At work, we're used to adhering to professional boundaries, and that's healthy, but there's a place for conversations around death and grief to happen within them.Dr. Brene Brown, widely known for her work on shame, vulnerability and leadership, suggests getting clear on the intention behind sharing vulnerable information like your experience with grief or death at work.For example, in our work, families and caregivers may be supporting someone with a terminal illness. Just acknowledging the conversation around death can lead to new ways of bringing happiness and joy throughout every stage of their journeys, until the end.


It's been nearly three years since I lost Harry. The experience has forever changed how I live and how I lead. I love the life I had when Harry was alive. And in many ways, my life is even more full now, because I have a greater understanding of how to live it — that's the gift Harry gave me.It's my hope that by creating a work culture where being open about grief is encouraged, my team will find more connection and support when faced with this inevitable human experience.Related: Being Vulnerable Is the Boldest Act of Business Leadership

34,"To Achieve Sustainable Success, You Need to Stop Focusing on Disruption. Here's Why — and What You Must Focus on Instead.","Mar 28, 2024",Alex Goryachev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/to-achieve-sustainable-success-you-need-to-stop-focusing/413421,"
There's only one word that is buzzier than ""innovation"" and ""digitization"" — one that strikes fear in the executive boardrooms of established companies, while also being used as the pitching mantra for the wannabe hottest startups around the world: disruption. Today, it feels like every new company wants to ""disrupt"" something, and many founders preach that ""disruption"" is what defines a successful new venture.I think this business philosophy is counterproductive and almost always results in failure.



Don't get me wrong — of course, disruption surrounds us, and the world has changed radically in the last two years. But just because disruption is taking place, it doesn't mean that a successful business strategy needs to be ""disruptive"" in response.The truth of the matter is that having disruption as a goal is often counterproductive and takes your company away from real opportunity. In the process of chasing disruptive ideas, founders and teams often lose touch with reality, focusing on the flavors of the month and missing out on real opportunities.


Related: Why Most Founders and Investors Are Wrong About DisruptionStop thinking disruptively. Start thinking pragmatically.When I think about cutting-edge pragmatic entrepreneurship, Dyson inevitably comes to mind.As I write in Fearless Innovation, Dyson products are known for several things: high quality, high price tag and designs unlike any other. Before Dyson, few people would have ever thought of buying a $400 hair dryer or shelling out $500 for a fan with no blades and a huge hole in its center. But here we are. And how we got here is the story of being pragmatic and executing in small, measurable milestones.In 1978, James Dyson came up with the concept of the bagless vacuum. The young entrepreneur realized that dirt and other debris can be sucked into a cone-like structure that would then be forced out to the edges of the canister, with no bag required. Dyson wasn't focused on disrupting the vacuum cleaning business. His idea came from solving a practical issue. One day, Dyson was fixing his vacuum cleaner and realized that the bag often gets clogged, and as a result, suction power gets drastically decreased.


Being a pragmatic innovator, Dyson created a cardboard bagless prototype on top of his Hoover vacuum. He pitched this idea to possible investors in the vacuum marketplace, looking to see if anyone would be interested in licensing, but every company he spoke to turned him down. They essentially told him, ""That's just not how we do things here.""The experience didn't deter Dyson and might even have inspired him. Over the next 15 years, he developed 5,127 prototypes before landing on the vacuum cleaner that has since become synonymous with quality, not to mention design, and made him a household name.Dyson's success is not in the disruptive technology or a brand-new concept of the vacuum (the patent for the ""pneumatic carpet renovator"" was filed by J. S. Thurman in 1899) but in his willingness to experiment with discipline and follow a process.Though the Dyson company has expanded and diversified, it all started with the need to fix a simple problem. Dyson took a pragmatic approach; with no plans to disrupt the market, he was simply looking to make a better product and innovating on top of it repeatedly.


Dyson's work was, and continues to be, pragmatic. When Dyson realized that their latest venture of building an electric car wasn't performing as well as he had hoped for, he cut his losses, learned from failure and moved on with full transparency.Dyson has a clear mission to design ""iconic reinventions that work, perform and look very different."" You won't see ""disruption"" in this statement, though you will note that ""reinventions"" is prominent, and in fact, Sir James's motto is ""Everything can improve.""And of course, Dyson, who as of 2021 was the UK's fourth wealthiest individual, worth an estimated net worth of $16.3 billion, did end up disrupting the market eventually, practically killing the vacuum bag industry, but he only got there by starting with the basics. Ironically, a few years ago, Hoover agreed to pay Dyson, £4m damages for infringing Dyson's patents when creating their bagless vacuum.Dyson's successes weren't about ""disruptive technology"" that was looking for a use case. It was about thinking pragmatically, being curious and executing with discipline and an open mind to solve a problem step by step.


Related: Innovation is an Incremental Process. Here are 3 Ways to Reach Your Big Idea.Start small and think pragmaticallyThe essence of successful entrepreneurship often lies in the ability to execute on a bold vision and strategy through small, measurable milestones. This approach might not capture headlines like the tales of overnight successes do, but it's the bedrock of sustainable growth and innovation. Starting small allows you to test assumptions, iterate quickly and refine your offerings based on real-world feedback without overextending your resources. Each small step forward is an opportunity to learn and adjust, minimizing risk while maximizing potential for success.For entrepreneurs, this means breaking down your overarching goals into actionable, bite-sized pieces. Instead of aiming to revolutionize the market out of the gate, focus on achieving specific, achievable goals that contribute to your larger vision. This could be as simple as validating a product feature, securing a certain number of customer sign-ups or achieving a set revenue milestone. Celebrate these victories, learn from the setbacks, and use each as a stepping stone towards your broader objectives.Embrace gradual progressReal entrepreneurship is rarely about making a splash with a single, disruptive innovation. More often, it's about the cumulative effect of small innovations and improvements. Embracing the process means understanding that each step, no matter how small, builds upon the last, propelling your business forward in a way that's both sustainable and adaptable.


This step-by-step journey is not just about reaching the market or achieving a particular metric of success; it's about building a foundation for your business that is robust, flexible and capable of withstanding the challenges that come with growth. It means investing in your team, your technology and your strategy in a way that allows for continuous improvement and iteration. It's about creating a culture where learning from failure is just as valued as celebrating success because both are essential to the entrepreneurial process.Work with disruption, not against itIn a world where disruption is a constant, the ability to adapt and find opportunities within the chaos is a critical skill. Instead of attempting to out-disrupt the disruptors or invest heavily in being the next big thing, focus on how you can leverage the ongoing changes in your industry. This means being acutely aware of the trends, technologies and shifts in consumer behavior that are shaping your sector and thinking critically about how your business can respond in a way that adds value.Identifying opportunities in disruption could mean pivoting your product to serve an emerging need, adopting new technologies to improve your service delivery or even rethinking your business model to better align with the market's direction. By staying nimble and being prepared to shift your strategy in response to the changing landscape, you can carve out a niche for your business that not only survives but thrives amidst the disruption.Related: 3 Ways Companies Can Leverage Disruption for Business Growth


Small steps, big impactUltimately, the path to enduring entrepreneurial success is paved with pragmatism, patience and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement. James Dyson's journey exemplifies this perfectly. By starting small, embracing the gradual process of growth and learning to work with the disruptions around you, you create a business that's not just looking to be a part of the market but one that's built to last and adapt through the ever-changing tides of industry and innovation.Dyson didn't set out with the aim to disrupt; instead, he focused on solving a practical problem with a pragmatic approach. This methodology led him to not only eventually disrupt the vacuum cleaner industry but also establish a brand synonymous with innovation and quality. Dyson's story underscores that real success comes from a focus on incremental improvement, understanding the landscape of disruption and leveraging it to your advantage. This approach may not be the quickest route to fame, but it is a proven pathway to building a resilient, adaptable and successful business.

35,Up to 90% of Startups Fail — But Innovation Accelerators Can Help Yours Succeed. Here's How.,"Mar 28, 2024",Jacobo Weizenblut,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-innovation-accelerators-are-shaping-the-future-of/470288,"
The globalized digital economy creates constant opportunities and requirements for startups. Unfortunately, the business environment that encourages the birth of startups immediately subjects them to a ruthless evolutionary process. Depending on who you ask, up to 90% of startups fail. Only 1% will make it to the big league to compete with unicorns like Uber, Zoom and other financial success case studies.Most startups that achieve initial seeding fail to raise a second round of capital. One solution to dramatically increase your chances of success is to enter an innovation accelerator and forge a strategic partnership with a major corporation.Innovation accelerators exist on a quid pro quo basis. In exchange for a small percentage of equity, they provide startup founders with a safe harbor in which to develop their new business. Innovation accelerators are structured programs, usually specializing in a particular field or sector. Entrepreneurs receive mentorship, resources and help from a powerful partner who has a direct interest in seeing them succeed. Innovation accelerators definitely work, but there can be drawbacks. You might be signing over a share of your business, and you'll be expected to play by the innovation accelerator's rules — and the initial admission process could be exhaustive and time-consuming.



Related: 12 Reasons You Should Join an Accelerator to Advance Your StartupInnovation accelerators are bridging the gapDespite the devastating attrition rates, there's no doubt that startups are shaping the future of business and are the single most dynamic vehicle for channeling new tech innovation into the digital economy. Major companies (at least the smart ones) recognize the potential of new startups and are keen to either integrate their new technologies into their own operations or to profit from them as investors.


Since 2005, we've seen a growing enthusiasm for corporate innovation accelerators that can simultaneously nurture and supercharge new startups. Founders can bring their new businesses into accelerator programs, either at a concept level or close to market, and benefit from the resources, expertise and professional networks that programs have access to. This may also include actual cash investments. Most founders are mature and experienced enough to welcome the professional assistance — and increased peace of mind — that accelerators deliver.Innovation accelerators subject applicants to some fairly rigorous and detailed scrutiny, but the best programs are open to unconventional ideas and disruptive concepts. Every startup is essentially a business experiment. Accelerator programs try to create laboratory conditions that will allow stakeholders to adapt the experiment, explore new directions and reinforce success — before the product goes to market. For viable products, time to market and development and marketing costs can be substantially reduced.3 leading innovation acceleratorsThere are about over 8,000 accelerator programs worldwide, more than half of which were founded between 2014 and 2020. The programs are competing to identify profitable startups and gain privileged access to technological innovations or products that can deliver shortcuts to market dominance. Even niche technologies that adapt or optimize existing processes can deliver a worthwhile return on investment.Companies and organizations across the entire financial and industrial spectrum are investing in their own programs and enabling thousands of new businesses annually. Three fascinating innovation accelerators in 2024 are featured here. They're not necessarily the biggest programs, but they offer valuable insights into what makes an accelerator punch above its weight.

Google for Startups


Google for Startups targets an entirely different segment of the new business spectrum. The program is focused on top growth-stage startups and offers a range of accelerators that specialize in overcoming specific technical challenges. The accelerators give founders access to Google's vast technological resources and expertise.Each Google accelerator accommodates between 10-15 startups and connects them to mentors and advisors, both from Google itself and from industry. Google's entry criteria are demanding and the program requires a commitment for ongoing technical engagement at a high level.Related: Everything You Need to Know Before Working With Accelerator ProgramsAccelerators shape corporate cultureThe skill and experience of each accelerator team and other stakeholders, the scale of their professional networks and the depth of their resources have a direct influence on the future structure of any startup that they mentor and nurture.

36,How To Improve Your Soft Skills and Emotional Intelligence in 7 Easy Steps,"Mar 27, 2024",Zamir Shukho,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-improve-emotional-intelligence-in-7-steps/471524,"
We are not born with certain skills, though it could be such a great default option, right? If we could choose the level of patience, emotional intelligence and empathy right away, we would overcome all life challenges much easier. So, what are soft skills? Can you learn them? Why can they add some extra points when you are networking or looking for a job?Soft skills are qualities and social abilities that show how well someone can interact with others. At work, they go alongside hard skills (practical job abilities), which are about what a person knows and can do in their job.In the fast-changing world of business (and not just business), success isn't just about what you know — it's also about how you connect with others. That's where soft skills come into play. They're the secret sauce that helps you communicate, lead and problem-solve your way to the top. In this article, I want to explore why soft skills are so crucial in business and how they can help you reach your goals.



Related: What are Soft Skills and Which Do You Need For SuccessHard skills vs. soft skillsToday, soft skills are all about how you interact with people — communication, empathy and adaptability. The last one is always tested when you are looking for a new job or moving to another country. Unlike hard skills, which you can learn from formal education, soft skills are more about intuition and experience. They're the qualities that make you a great listener, a supportive teammate, and a problem-solver who thinks outside the box.


What is the difference between a soft skill and a hard skill? Hard skills can be measured and are usually acquired through training, education and practice. They are the abilities needed to perform a specific task or job. For example, hard skills in engineering might include proficiency in coding languages, while hard skills in healthcare might include medical procedures or knowledge of pharmaceuticals. In many professions, hard skills are essential for completing tasks efficiently and effectively. Soft skills are behavioral and interpersonal skills that relate to how effectively people interact with others and handle situations.Soft and hard skills are important for success in most careers. However, the relative importance of each can depend on factors such as the nature of the job, the industry, the organizational culture and the specific requirements of the role. In many cases, employers value a combination of hard and soft skills, recognizing that individuals with diverse skill sets are often better equipped to handle the challenges of the modern workplace.Related: Why Prioritizing Soft Skills in Hiring is Crucial to The Modern WorkplaceSoft skills and businessFrom my experience, I can say that being a leader isn't just about giving orders — it's about inspiring and motivating your team. Great leaders know how to connect with their team on a personal level and create a positive work environment where everyone can thrive and achieve more.


Leaders (by that, I mean CEOs, Founders etc.) with strong soft skills are highly valued in today's professional landscape for several reasons. Firstly, effective communication lies at the heart of leadership, and soft skills such as empathy, active listening and clarity enable leaders to convey their vision and expectations clearly while also understanding and addressing the concerns of their team members.Moreover, soft skills are essential for building strong relationships within the team. Leaders who demonstrate empathy, interpersonal skills and a genuine interest in their team members' well-being can establish personal connections, inspiring loyalty and commitment. This ability to connect with individuals and understand their unique perspectives enables leaders to motivate and empower their teams, driving performance and productivity.Conflict situations in business are inevitable. Soft skills also play a crucial role in conflict resolution and problem-solving. Leaders with strong emotional intelligence can navigate disagreements and tensions within the team with tact and diplomacy, facilitating constructive dialogue and finding mutually beneficial solutions.Related: The 5 Soft Skills of Every Good Employee


Can you develop soft skills?Let's imagine you already have good soft skills, but there is always room for improvement. To broaden your skill set, you need to have an open mind and desire to develop personally and professionally. Various training and workshops are beneficial. Once you attend those trainings, you can practice your soft skills by getting feedback from your family, friends and colleagues and working towards their improvement. Sometimes, it's good to have self-reflection to identify your strengths and weaknesses and highlight points for future growth.Lastly, for valuable guidance, it might be a good idea to have a mentor, especially a seasoned manager in a company who has worked with hundreds of people, managed different teams and has experience in communications on different levels.Working with a mentor can help you improve your soft skills and your job performance and build better relationships with colleagues – this is a path towards a successful career. There is a framework that I follow when it comes to emotional intelligence or soft skills:#1. Show empathy. This means imagining yourself in other people's shoes and trying to understand them rather than trying to fix them.


#2. Assume good intentions from people. First, believe that people mean well and show them trust. Then, you can ask questions later, which helps build good relationships.#3. Try to pause before reacting to a situation or in communication you need to do. You know you need to stop, think and respond because emotions can often hinder the conversation rather than help it. So, don't rush into replying too fast – pause, take a deep breath and then continue with what you really mean and want to say.#4. Ask before assuming. Please let the other person explain what they meant, what they wanted, their worries, or their viewpoint on the situation because none of us are mind readers. Clarify any confusion by asking direct questions.#5. Keep your promises because they give your words a lot of credibility. It allows people to rely on you as a person, leader, colleague, or partner. Reliability builds trust and respect, which will pay off in the long term.


#6. Accept and own your mistakes. Admitting where you did something wrong shows strength and allows you to learn and move forward. When other smart people surround you, it's very appreciated that you act as an adult, understand that you also make mistakes, and be willing to fix them.#7. Be grateful and say ""thank you"" to people, appreciating their efforts.Using these simple but effective approaches will help a person in their business, in their life and in their relationships with others, and will be deeply appreciated by everybody around you.Want to see more stories like this?

38,5 Delegation Strategies To Help You Flourish With Less Stress,"Mar 25, 2024",Jessica Fisher,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-delegate-as-a-business-owner/471260,"
One of the hardest parts about owning a business is getting it off the ground and establishing it. However, once you make it a success, the responsibilities increase, and you have to let others take control of certain tasks to maintain the business' momentum.Delegation can seem terrifying to a business owner. Taking someone into your company and trusting them to do a job is a big leap for someone who's been handling every aspect of the business from day one. Fortunately, there are strategies you can implement to maintain smooth operations while letting go of control.Related: Want to Succeed? Learn to Say 'No'



1. Find someone who excels at the task at handIt's crucial to find the right person for the job. When looking at resumes, pay attention to employment histories with similar duties to those you seek. During interviews, ask questions regarding their past responsibilities and follow up on their responses by asking them to elaborate on how their skill set would translate to the type of work you need them to do.If you're stuck between two or more candidates, closely consider those who have experience that aligns with your field. Prioritizing skill over availability is always a smart move, especially when the work you require is specialized or imperative. The ideal person is likely to complete their duties more efficiently than someone who is less suited for it but more available.


2. Maintain a watchful but trusting eye on their responsibilitiesWhen a team is small, it's especially vital to stay aware of everyone's duties and daily work. While you must delegate tasks and loosen up control on certain aspects of the business, you also need to be in the loop, as errors and overlooked responsibilities can have a detrimental impact if you don't pay attention.For a business that includes sales or frequent client interactions, one way to stay on top of events is to have your staff BCC you on every email they send. This way, you are still trusting that they can complete their tasks, but you can also look over things should any questions arise and quickly jump in on any conversations.Reduce mishaps by having your team utilize email templates when writing people outside of the organization. A business that involves continual back-and-forth with others often follows similar patterns of conversation. Identify those themes and copy the proper responses into a shared document that workers can reference when they're responding to someone. Google Drive is an excellent tool for this type of collaborative work.Related: 10 Simple Ways to Build a Collaborative, Successful Work Environment


3. Recognize their skill and adapt accordinglyEven if someone seems like a good fit, they may struggle at first to learn their responsibilities and how best to complete them. If the company is smaller, their job may have a larger scope, with many small but cumulative elements that require time to master. When a team member seems ambitious and reliable but slower in the first few days, offer more guidance and support. Thorough training of an individual with talent pays off.If they seem to be still struggling with specific tasks later on, it can be helpful to eliminate those from their job duties and have them focus on what they are good at. Hand those tasks to someone else on the team or hire another person who is comfortable doing them. When outsourcing is not an option, resetting your expectations may be beneficial. The job might be done differently than you would do it, but it is still getting done.Related: 5 Invaluable Soft Skills to Seek in Your Next Hire4. Set clear expectations and define successTo do their jobs well, workers need to know what exactly you need from them. As workers settle into their position, help them understand what is important to you as their superior and what you expect to see from them. Outline specific goals, such as 'we want to increase sales by 25% this year' rather than 'we want to increase sales this year.' Providing tangible measures of success will enable them to create a plan to reach those benchmarks.


Timelines are also useful, preventing staff from spending too much time on one task or not enough time on another. Each project or assignment should have an expected due date, helping to establish priorities.Provide workers with resources for support so they know who or what to turn to in case anything goes awry. Examples include going to their manager for advice, looking at company email templates or giving them access to specific company information so they can problem-solve on their own.5. Keep an open line of communicationFor staff to effectively take charge of a task, they need to be able to speak with you or a manager without difficulty. Similarly, you need to be able to come to them when you have questions about any of their responsibilities.There is no shortage of ways teams can stay in contact. Google Chat is especially useful for businesses using Gmail as their company email. Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Discord are other chat apps popular with businesses of all sizes. Try to only utilize the chat feature for quick questions, and always hop on a video or phone call for clarity. Typed words tend to get lost in translation and can seem ambiguous.


Regardless of the method you choose, workers need to know they can always approach you for advice, information or general dialogue. A company's success is synonymous with its ability to communicate effectively.Mastering the art of delegation is a transformative chapter in a business owner's life. When you can confidently pass on responsibilities to a competent employee, you can establish a healthy work-life balance and focus on what you do best: growing the company. By choosing skilled, reliable workers, adapting to their abilities, setting clear goals, and fostering communication, you lay the foundation for a thriving business environment.

""We don't take this skin off when we go to bed, when we go to events, or when we're writing reviews.""


This dedication means Community Managers are a valuable resource for Yelp consumers looking to support minority-owned businesses. While the Yelp website and mobile app make it easy to filter searches using identity attributes, like Black-owned, following your local Yelp social media page and keeping up with the Community blog can help you find even more local gems. Community Managers often hold—and post about—events in partnership with Black-owned businesses looking to gain more traction in neighborhoods where they are racially or culturally underrepresented.During these events, Community Managers handle attracting and engaging customers so business owners can focus on what they do best: providing authentic and quality customer experiences.The events are also a great way to network with your community. At one event, B recalled connecting a business owner who raised children with epilepsy with a clinic owner who works with epileptic patients. This interaction opened up an opportunity for the business owner to make custom macaroons for the patients and share her story with the clinic's community.Hearing first-hand about this kind of impact is one of the most rewarding parts of the job. Community Managers are passionate about creating lasting connections and encourage business owners to connect with customers on a personal level whenever possible.


""You never know where that string is going to really connect and attach to somebody, and that's where we really create momentum [for businesses],"" B added.Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to StorefrontTo help businesses flourish in their communities, Erica always urges businesses to reach out to their local Community Manager, whether to host an event for Yelp Elites or score an Instagram feature on a Yelp-owned account. The Community team partners with entrepreneurs in a variety of areas, from restaurant owners to local artists, on initiatives that are entirely free to business owners. They've also taken the 15% pledge, dedicating at least 15% of their efforts to Black-owned businesses.In addition to the importance of building a strong small business community, Erica, B, and Anitra believe in:


Championing Black-owned businesses all year long. Don't feel like you need to restrict identity-related marketing initiatives to Black History Month. Many Yelp consumers are eager to support minority-owned businesses whenever they can.Having advocates you can see yourself in. Erica, B, and Anitra understand the opportunities and challenges that Black business owners have and are passionate about helping them navigate the small business landscape.Using Yelp to make connections. Reading and responding to customer reviews can help businesses improve engagement, customer service, and loyalty.

40,How This Family-Run Company Has Thrived for Five Generations,"Mar 25, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-al-capone-inspired-the-launch-of-a-95-year-old/471438,"
Creating our show The CEO Series has allowed me to sit down with some of the most innovative and inspiring business leaders in the world to get their insights on what it takes to launch, grow and sustain a meaningful business.This episode took us to Ozinga, the concrete and building material powerhouse. They're based in Chicago and if you're in the area, you're surely familiar with their iconic red and white trucks. They have approximately 2,500 employees and I got to have an amazing chat with the guy who oversees it all, Marty Ozinga, the fourth-generation CEO of this 95-year-old company.Below are some highlights of that conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. Watch the full video above.



His approach to leadership""It's not the people are working for you, they're working with you. That's the way I was mentored and taught. We all need each other. We all have different roles and responsibilities, but we're working with each other.""Related: Why Notre Dame's Football Coach Tells His Team to ""Choose Hard""


Ozinga's 95-year history""Our family came from the Netherlands in 1893, the year of the World's Fair here in Chicago. The family was always in the delivery business. Then in 1928, my great-grandfather was working with the Cook County Sheriff's Department during Prohibition and dealing with the hazards of Al Capone and all of that. He had five kids at home and decided, ""You know what? I don't want to fight Al Capone anymore."" So he started a coal delivery business. And then around 1950, ready mix concrete became the era's disruptive technology. Ready mixed means that it is batched for delivery from a central plant instead of being mixed on the job site. And so Ozinga became one of the first ready mix providers in the region.""Related: This Entrepreneur Started Making Short Videos to Share Her Passion for Cooking. Now Her Food Company Is a Global Powerhouse.On their iconic trucks""We've supplied concrete to iconic Chicago landmarks like Soldier Field and Wrigley Field, so it's fun to be connected to places like that. And we're really proud of our trucks' red and white stripes. I think it was a combination of this keen sense of marketing, but also of national pride. But there's also some joke that they were Dutch and very frugal and those were the two paint buckets in the garage. So I like both those stories.""The power of peacefulness""Our dispatch office is the nerve center of the business. It's where all the orders come in from our customers, and then where we dispatch the trucks. It is intentionally very quiet inside. We've tried to get it as quiet and peaceful as possible because historically the dispatch office is a very intense, chaotic, loud and crazy place.""


Building and sustaining a legacy""There's an emotional connection for my family and this company. We've been really fortunate that we get to embed ourselves in communities throughout the Midwest. We're committed to our employees and our customers — we want to be here for the next hundred years and longer. That's our intention. And while change is necessary so you don't get disrupted and die and go out of business, there are certain things that you shouldn't meddle with. Our core principles are the foundation for who we are and why we do what we do — that should never change.""Related: How Personal Passions Fuel Business Success for the CEO of Vivid SeatsCheck out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

Hiring the right person is often considered a mystical art. So much time and resources are dedicated to this process — tests, checklists and more. However, the past year's events in the recruitment market have demonstrated that very few of us have succeeded. I won't pretend that we have always made the perfect hire, but through entering new markets, expanding rapidly, navigating through world events and dealing with other challenges, we have learned many lessons when hiring the right person.Why do we all need to aim to hire the right person?Your biggest and best asset in any business is your people. Therefore, it's crucial to aim for hiring the right person. Of course, you want the best, but you also want the best fit for your specific business needs. It's important to choose those individuals who, with the right support and guidance, will thrive and bring value to your organization. The process of selection, rather than recruitment. It involves finding the right match between an organization's requirements and the skills, qualifications and character of the individual, ultimately ensuring that the organization hires the right person with the right attitude.

42,Mastering This Essential Business Skill Can Significantly Elevate Your Leadership Capabilities,"Mar 20, 2024",Chad Willardson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/master-this-crucial-business-skill-to-become-a-better-leader/471177,"
In my 22+ years of marriage, my wife and I have traveled around the world and experienced many different cultures and sightseeing excursions. We especially love scheduling tours with local guides who cherish their home country and know all the facts and stories to share with tourists. One specific memory was on a trip to Paris, France in a motorcycle with an attached sidecar.Most people traveling to Paris are focused on their classic picture in front of the Eiffel Tower, but this turned out to be more unique and memorable for one specific reason: Our tour guide's stories and communication style. On his own motorcycle, he rode in front of us, navigating through the side streets and unknown paths of Paris and its suburbs, stopping along the way to share stories and facts that brought the rich culture and history to life.He later shared that he also offered the same Paris motorcycle tour daily in French, German and Italian. This gentleman was able to overcome the language barriers and translate his love for France in a way that would connect with any tourist from any background. The fact that he could do this in four different languages fluently was not just impressive; it was a powerful reminder of the universal importance of great communication skills.



In business, the ability to communicate well transcends the need to master multiple languages. It's about conveying your message, vision and values in a way that resonates with people, regardless of their industry or background. While you may not all be learning to speak four languages fluently, enhancing your communication skills is pivotal for success in any business. As technology continues to evolve and advance, the fundamental skill of engaging effectively with others remains timeless and invaluable.Related: How Better Communication Skills Can Make You a Better Leader


Delivery is criticalThe essence of communication lies not only in what you say but in how you say it. The delivery of your message can dramatically affect its reception. Just as my Parisian guide chose his words and modulated his voice to captivate and educate, business leaders must also focus on their delivery. This involves the tone, pace and emotion behind the words.A well-delivered message can inspire, motivate and persuade, making it one of the most powerful tools in a leader's arsenal. Whether you're presenting to stakeholders, pitching to investors or leading your team, the way you deliver your message can be the difference between success and failure. Think of how often a text or an email is misinterpreted because you didn't capture the tone and intention as the sender intended it to be received.Keep your audience in mindUnderstanding your audience is crucial for effective communication. This means tailoring your message to meet their interests, needs and level of understanding. The motorcycle guide knew exactly how to engage his diverse audience, using cultural references and humor that resonated across different nationalities. He actually related things to us with some American humor and sarcasm.In business, knowing your audience can help you decide the best approach to take, whether it's in a marketing campaign, a business negotiation or even an internal team meeting. It's about connecting on a level that's both relatable and understandable, ensuring your message is not just heard but felt and acted upon.


Not all communication is effectiveEffective communication is about clarity, conciseness and coherence. It's about making your point without overwhelming your audience with unnecessary jargon or complexity. Simplicity is often the key to understanding, but achieving it requires a deep understanding of the subject matter and the ability to distill it into its most essential elements.Remember, it's not about dumbing down your message but about elevating it to a level where it becomes accessible and impactful. Like the guide who condensed the vast history of Paris into digestible, engaging stories, a skilled communicator can transform complex ideas into clear, compelling narratives.Related: 7 Leadership Communication Blunders That Could Make or Break Your CompanyEmbrace feedback for continuous improvementA crucial aspect of communication that complements the earlier points is the willingness to receive and incorporate feedback. Just as a guide might adjust their tour based on the reactions and interests of the group, effective business communicators must be open to feedback from their audience. This not only helps in refining the message but also in building stronger relationships.


Feedback provides insight into how your message is perceived and offers opportunities for improvement. By embracing constructive criticism and adapting your approach, you can enhance your ability to connect with others and make your communication even more effective. Ultimately, the goal is to foster an environment of open dialogue where ideas can be exchanged freely and innovation can thrive. This adaptability not only enriches your personal growth but also significantly contributes to the success and dynamic evolution of your business endeavors.Keep in mind that your career and success will depend on your ability to communicate well. This is a cornerstone of successful business leadership. It's a skill that enriches every interaction, from negotiating deals to inspiring your team. Like the art of speaking multiple languages, it opens doors to new opportunities and fosters connections that transcend cultural and linguistic barriers. As you navigate the ever-changing landscape of business and technology, let's commit to honing this timeless skill, for it's through the power of communication that we can truly lead, inspire and achieve greatness by turning ideas into action.Related: 5 Steps to Communicate Like a Boss

Authenticity and trust are the foundations of successful customer relationships.

Just one instance of perceived deception can unravel years of painstakingly constructed trust, leading to an exodus of customers and potentially irreversible reputational damage.Establishing trust and authenticity demands a proactive and firm commitment from businesses. It entails unwavering transparency in operations, ensuring that products and services meet the highest quality standards every time, and promptly and professionally addressing customer inquiries and feedback.

44,How to Build and Maintain a Truly Resilient Company Culture,"Mar 18, 2024",Roy Dekel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-build-and-maintain-a-truly-resilient-company-culture/470847,"
In business, resilience has emerged as a necessity rather than a regrettable afterthought. It's described as the ability to bounce back from challenges, whether they are based on adversity, conflict or failures.However, I believe resilience extends beyond personal capabilities. A truly resilient company cultivates collective strength as a culture, particularly beneficial for industries such as real estate with a cycle of unpredictable markets.At SetSchedule, resilience is not just a trait, it is an ideology woven into the fabric of our business strategy.Related: 8 Ways Successful People Master ResilienceRedefining strategic intent for fostering growth and reinforcementBeginning as a marketplace for realtors to meet and exchange leads, SetSchedule's scope was initially quite narrow.



As the company evolved, we noticed bigger challenges permeating the real estate industry. These challenges presented the opportunity to be more than just another real estate tech startup. Driven by a strategic intent for greater resilience, we recognized our duty to provide a more expansive solution for our clientele and the entire industry.Phil Rosenzweig adequately demonstrates the importance of strategic intent. In his book, The Halo Effect...and The Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers, he notes that reinventing strategic intent can guide companies as they adapt to fluctuating market conditions, growing needs and cultural evolution.We discovered this to be true on our journey to becoming a resourceful networking platform democratizing the real estate process.The challenges involved during the transition contributed to the strength of our culture, reinforcing its resilience.


A resilient company culture calls for a collaborative endeavorResilience must be embedded into the structures of the organization's culture, absorbing influence from every team member irrespective of their designation. This inclusive buy-in ensures everyone understands the company's mission, aims and values.Jim Collins, in his seminal business guide, Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't, describes the importance of getting the right people on the bus and in the right seats before defining the journey.This encapsulates our philosophy at SetSchedule. Endeavoring to ensure everyone's understanding of our vision, we cultivate a robust culture capable of navigating the stormy seas of the real estate market with composure.Embracing learning as a catalyst for resilienceIngraining the ethos of continual learning in the work culture engenders resilience. Challenges are viewed as stepping stones, opportunities to learn and grow.By fostering a culture that promotes learning, we're amassing collective resilience, which helps us recover quickly and efficiently after setbacks or failures.Carol S. Dweck, known for her work on mindsets, has noted that organizational resilience is tied to promoting a growth mindset. Unlike a fixed mindset, which views capabilities as static, a growth mindset values the journey of constant learning, evaluation and growth.Related: Resilience Is One of the Most Essential Entrepreneurial Traits. Practicing This Can Help You Build It.Building resilience through emotional intelligenceAt my company, another cornerstone for the development of a resilient work culture is emotional intelligence.


Steering through setbacks requires employees who can understand and manage their emotions. Emotional self-awareness, empathy and interpersonal effectiveness help not only in navigating personal challenges but also in fostering positive workplace relationships.Encouraging these aspects within our team has led to better stress management and conflict resolution, two crucial components of resilience.Resilience through social responsibilityEngagement in social responsibility initiatives enhances organizational resilience by building strong relationships with the community and stakeholders. It demonstrates a commitment to more than just profit, showcasing a dedication to societal growth and well-being.This, in turn, strengthens the brand and fosters a sense of pride and purpose within the team.


My company actively participates in and supports various community engagement programs. We've found that this not only uplifts the communities we serve but also enriches our company culture, imbuing our team with a sense of purpose that transcends the daily grind.Long-term vision for sustained resilienceFinally, resilience is not just about the short-term bounce back; it's also about sustaining that momentum into the future. It requires a clear long-term vision that can guide decision-making, strategy formulation and cultural development. This vision must be adaptable, capable of evolving as external conditions change, but always offering a beacon for the company's direction.We continuously refine our vision, ensuring it remains relevant and inspiring for our team. This long-term perspective helps us frame our everyday actions and challenges within a broader context, providing clarity and motivation even in tough times.Related: From Setback to Success — 4 Ways to Turn Your Struggles into Resilience


In wrapping up, SetSchedule's journey towards building and maintaining a resilient company culture is multifaceted, grounded in strategic intent, collective effort, continual learning, emotional intelligence, transparent communication, innovation, employee well-being, social responsibility and a steadfast long-term vision.These elements combined fortify our ability to adapt and thrive amid adversity, ensuring we remain relevant in the face of the unpredictable dynamics of the real estate industry.The path toward building such a culture is persistent and evolving but ultimately rewarding. It ensures that, regardless of the challenges we face, we have the foundation to not just endure but to grow stronger and more cohesive in our endeavors.

45,3 Ways Founders Can Connect With Their Customers to Drive Sales,"Mar 18, 2024",Thomas Strider,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-effective-ways-to-connect-with-your-customers/470871,"
In today's market, the bond between founders and customers is more than a transaction; it's the cornerstone of sustainable growth and brand loyalty. Modern consumers want authenticity more than ever. They find it difficult to connect with faceless entities and want to follow people rather than businesses.This shift towards personal connection in marketing stems from a saturated market where consumers are bombarded with choices and advertisements daily. Personal stories and authentic interactions cut through the noise in this crowded space, creating a memorable impression. Consumers crave realness and transparency at a time when these qualities are scarce in the world of business.So, how do you go about deepening your connection with your target audience? Here are three strategies that can turn your customer interactions into a powerful engine for sales growth.



1. Personalize your approach with behind-the-scenes storytellingIt's one thing to sell a product. It's another to tell a story and share fascinating details that resonate.Imagine a founder sharing their journey, the highs and lows, through a series of behind-the-scenes content. This narrative isn't about humanizing the brand; it's about creating a shared experience. When customers see the sweat and tears behind a product, they're not just buying an item; they're investing in a piece of your process and founder's story.


So, how do you start?Weekly emails or social media posts that peel back the curtain on your process make customers feel like they're part of your journey. To do this effectively, begin by mapping out key milestones in your company's history or product development process. For each milestone, identify a story or challenge you faced and how you overcame it. These stories form the basis of your content.Next, use visuals like photos, videos, or even simple sketches to bring these stories to life. Visual content not only increases engagement but also helps to humanize your brand further.In your communication, be transparent about the obstacles you've encountered and how you've addressed them. This transparency fosters trust and relatability. Moreover, invite your audience to contribute their thoughts or similar experiences through comments or direct messages, turning your storytelling into a two-way conversation.


Publicly tell people the ""why"" behind your products, services, and company by integrating customer testimonials or user-generated content that aligns with your narrative. This validates your claims and amplifies your community's voice, making your brand's story part of their own stories.Like successful pitch decks showcase the story behind your brand, so should your content marketing and advertisements. Bringing the ""real"" to your business breeds authenticity, and that authentic connection will drive your business's growth. Remember, the goal is to broadcast and engage in meaningful conversations that build long-term relationships.Related: 8 Effective Ways to Connect With Your Customers2. Leverage technology for personal connectionsAI tools are booming, so personal connection using automation seems like an oxymoron. Yet, technology can be the very tool that brings you closer to your ICP.


Consider implementing AI chatbots that do more than answer queries. Work with tools, consultants, and language model professionals to custom-tailor AI to chat with your customers.Implement these chatbots on your company website and train them to initiate conversations based on customer behavior. Offer personalized recommendations or even simply check in with website visitors. Sometimes, a simple ""How are things going?"" goes a long way, and this part of your customer experience can be automated.This approach won't replace human interaction, of course, but it will enhance it by making your brand present and proactive in your customer's lives.The key? Ensure these AI communications feel personal and specific, not just like another automated message in their inbox or as a popup. This takes a bit more effort to implement, but the investment is worth it for the long-term growth of your brand and business.


Related: 6 Ways Connections Create a Sense of Belonging Anywhere With Any Workplace3. Create exclusive communitiesImagine a space where your customers can gather to discuss your product and share their stories, challenges and triumphs.There's a particular company on the rise called Skool, which enables businesses and personal brands alike to do just this. Other great platform choices, such as Circle, Mighty Networks or Kajabi, enable seamless community building. These platforms allow you to make posts and help your customers, but they also give users the flexibility to post and communicate with each other.An exclusive community for customer discussion could take many other forms as well: a Facebook group, a Slack channel or a dedicated forum on your website.


The goal for your community is to foster a sense of belonging and mutual support, turning your customer base into a tight-knit community. Offer insider access, sneak peeks, and the opportunity for feedback. The more valued and listened that customers feel, the more likely they are to advocate for your brand organically.Over the long term, these communities become a word-of-mouth marketing machine.

46,Laughter Is a Universal Language — Here's How to Use It to Empower Your Team,"Mar 18, 2024",Bradley Hook,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-to-boost-your-teams-performance-make-them-laugh/470237,"
Sir David Attenborough once observed, ""It is through play that the lion cubs develop agility."" When navigating meeting rooms of large corporations, I see the word ""agile"" scrawled on whiteboards almost everywhere. Yet I rarely encounter a culture that embodies play. In a time marked by burnout, chronic stress and overwhelm, perhaps laughter is the best medicine for cultivating a culture of calm readiness.But like well-being, you can't simply manufacture a positive culture. It requires active leadership participation. That's where you come in. Leadership is not management; it's about deeply connecting on a human level, inspiring a collective journey toward a shared vision. Laughter, in this realm, serves as a universal language, breaking down barriers of culture and rank to knit an environment rich in trust, openness and mutual respect. When leaders harness laughter with genuine intent, it doesn't just ease tension — it becomes a catalyst for collaboration and fulfillment.Related: Want to Build Relationships? Find Ways to Laugh Together.



Why laughter matters more than everLaughter is a strategic asset, building resilience and promoting a flourishing work environment. It boosts endorphins, lowers stress and forges strong social bonds, enabling teams to navigate challenges with flexibility and innovative thinking. Laughter also indicates an environment of psychological safety, where team members feel secure and valued, encouraging open communication and risk-taking without fear of ridicule or retribution. This psychological safety is foundational for trust and innovation, leading to significant ROI for organizations. Companies that prioritize a safe environment report higher levels of engagement, reduced turnover rates and increased productivity. In essence, laughter not only enriches the workplace culture but also serves as a catalyst for tangible, positive outcomes in organizational performance and employee satisfaction.A study by Bennett, M.P., & Lengacher, C. (2006) underscores this, revealing that laughter can significantly reduce stress and improve natural killer cell activity, thus enhancing the body's defense against illnesses. This aligns with the findings of Dunbar, R.I., et al. (2012), who discovered laughter's ability to increase pain tolerance — and I'm sure you'll agree that work can be painful sometimes.


Resilience through laughter and humorResilience isn't merely about bouncing back; it's about growing through adversity. It is the gateway to antifragility. Laughter and humor inject a sense of perspective and lightness into the workplace, enabling individuals and teams to view setbacks not as insurmountable obstacles but as opportunities for growth. This cognitive flexibility empowers individuals and organizations to navigate the uncertainties of the business landscape with decisiveness and agility.Research by Papousek, I., et al. (2017) showed that laughter immediately increases mood and well-being, emphasizing laughter's protective effect against mental health challenges. Moreover, a study by Tugade, M.M., & Fredrickson, B.L. (2004) highlights how laughter and positive interactions enhance social bonds and collective problem-solving abilities, promoting a collaborative and innovative work environment.Aligning humor with organizational valuesHowever, laughter and humor must resonate with the core values of an organization to be effective. Humor that is inclusive and respectful will strengthen team cohesion and uphold the dignity of all members. Therefore, leaders must model and encourage forms of humor that align with the organization's values, cultivating an environment where every team member feels a sense of connection and belonging. I recommend starting with observational humor and silly one-liners, perhaps of the eye-rolling ""dad-joke"" variety (even if you're not a dad). Some low-risk examples of workplace jokes are:""Lately, coworkers have been writing names on the food in the office fridge. I'm currently eating a sandwich named Kevin.""""You know what can really ruin a Friday? Remembering it's Thursday.""""What's the best thing about teamwork? Someone else to blame.""Avoid sarcasm or laughing at the expense of others — that includes a nightmare client or employee who has departed. Remember, jokes are inherently viral.Related: How to Use Humor at Work Without Acting Like a JerkA blueprint for leadersTo integrate laughter into leadership effectively, leaders can:Model behavior: Demonstrate the value of laughter, setting a tone that encourages light-hearted interactions. Start with a smile; sometimes, that is enough. Notice your posture and voice tone when you speak. Emotions are contagious, so be the change you wish to see.Cultivate a joyful environment: Build a culture where laughter and humor are normalized, ensuring they are inclusive and aligned with company values. Ask team members to share what made them laugh over the preceding week. Build humor as a micro-habit.Celebrate with laughter: Use humor to celebrate successes and navigate challenges, bolstering a growth mindset. Try starting and ending meetings with humor rather than diving straight into the agenda or concluding on a serious note. Ask, ""What went well?"" instead of dwelling unnecessarily on negativity.Embrace authenticity: Share moments of humor that are true to you, building trust and authenticity. Your trials and tribulations — and how you've learned to laugh at them — can inspire others to see the lighter side of their challenges.Integrating laughter into leadership is not just about adding moments of joy; it's about building a more cohesive and innovative team. Laughter, when aligned with an organization's core values, becomes a powerful tool in the leader's arsenal, increasing well-being and elevating performance. In the quest for organizational excellence, embracing laughter is embracing the future of leadership, where challenges are met with agility, resilience and joy.

When I interview a candidate, I mostly want to learn why they want to work for me. I'm always shocked when job seekers reveal they have never been to the website as opposed to those who are excited to share why they feel connected to our mission. When I interview a candidate, it's often the vulnerability in their answers that speaks to me. Sometimes the person I'm interviewing tells me of a personal disability or limitation, which to me is an act of openness and transparency. I love to hear people say they are passionate about working in an inspirational environment. When our conversation begins, I'm listening for a story.


What many candidates don't know is the interviewer is waiting for them to have their breakout moment. This departure from the usual Q&A often reveals their passion for the work or vulnerability.It's important to make sure your interview questions allow you to see a prospective employee's connection to your mission. You can start by asking candidates what measurable impact they would like to make in the position offered. You can also find out how they envision their work life five years from now.2. Create a culture of engagementDoing purposeful work means the executive team must create educational opportunities for staff as well as clients, extending engagement with the company beyond ""business hours."" This is a chance to show your team and your customers that their needs matter beyond the job description or the product or service you offer.Having a corporate reputation as a company that births new leaders and supports hard work and ambition will go a long way toward retaining good team members with the savvy to innovate, create and energize your workforce. Whether it is a group meeting or a corporate retreat, it's important to mix staff together, allowing employees from across departments and positions to collaborate, exchange ideas, rise as leaders and support each other.


This kind of shift can start by simply reassigning tasks or creating challenges that give employees a chance to spread their wings. You can take some projects off the administrative assistant's plate or reassign some items on the to-do list to a staff member who has shown initiative. A team member could send out invitations to meetings or reminders to committee members taken from a list of goals. A staffer could also create a committee to help plan a corporate event and see it through.Keep a watchful eye on employees who stand out and give them the opportunity to be seen as experts. Let some be advisors, coaches or provide support to other team members. This will make the staff feel recognized and encourage others to rise to that purposeful level. This kind of support will give you a ""pool"" of potential leaders, helping your team members feel that their contributions are noticed and rewarded.Related: 3 Reasons Why a Strong Purpose Is a Good Business Idea3. Build a positive online reputation for your businessAlthough you can never eliminate negative reviews, the best approach to a positive corporate reputation is actively implementing a variety of ways to get reviews from employees and customers alike. While it's estimated that 99% of customers read reviews from time to time, only 13% would choose a product or service from a company with a two-star rating.


There are several proven ways to generate positive reviews. The process can be as simple as using comment cards. You can also ask for an email address from the customer. Some businesses have a physical ""register;"" others have an email link where people can sign in and provide this information. From there, it's easy to follow up and ask for a rating or comment. Other stores offer rewards in exchange for reviews. This offer is usually seen on banners or signs within the physical store, on the receipt (physical or via email) or on the company's homepage. Some businesses use a QR code leading directly to the online review spot; you have likely seen a kiosk within the store allowing immediate feedback.Another way to generate rave reviews is to get endorsements or recommendations from businesses you have partnered with over the years. These allies can speak of important attributes of your company that go beyond a rating system or short comment and may attract traffic to your website and new clients responding to the positive vibes.The mantra ""If you don't ask, you don't get"" works well here. There are more ways to get positive feedback for your business than ever before thanks to evolving technology. Rather than running from a corporate fear of bad reviews, make it your business to seek and obtain the best reviews by engaging the community in the process.You can direct your company's reputation by finding new ways to engage your workforce and the people you serve. By promoting outstanding employees, offering training and opportunities for leadership and by making positive feedback a priority, your company can stop putting out fires and start basking in the culture of purpose you always intended.

48,The Secret Sauce to Entrepreneurial Success — Why Your Business Needs a Diverse Team Now!,"Mar 15, 2024",Chris Kille,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-your-business-needs-a-diverse-team-now/470607,"
Have you ever considered why some businesses are just ""on point"" while others keep getting lost in the market? It isn't the product or even the service at all times. Sometimes, it is people who matter. No, not just spending the time joining and contributing to different clubs — what I meant was a diverse team!Regarding entrepreneurship, diversity isn't just one of those popular words; it's your most reliable tool. It makes us stand out, separates us from the rest and allows us to shine. Therefore, it is worth exploring why building a diverse team shouldn't just be considered an option. It should be considered a necessity, and in this article, I'll explain why.Related: Diverse Teams Drive Innovation in Ways Homogeneous Teams Just Can't



1. Humanize: The embodiment of ingenuityThe different perspectives and experiences of diverse teams make them innovation powerhouses. When you combine different backgrounds, experiences and outlooks, you're not just adding; you're increasing the possibilities that your team has to be creative. A blend of diversity, creativity and innovation is born, which can help you stand out in a heavily crowded marketplace.2. Decision-making becomes a lot betterA thing of the past is the moments when echo chambers prevail and groupthink happens. Working in a multidisciplinary team offers a broad base of possible perspectives during the decision-making process, where the final choices must be comprehensive, balanced, and most importantly, effective. It is almost like having an internal consultancy group!


3. Mirror the market, encompass the marketThe customers you have are diverse. Why don't you get a team that reflects this diversity? A team with a diverse background can be of significant value by offering in-depth insights into different market segments, thus improving the business's ability to connect with the public. It's a straightforward formula: Take your market knowledge to the next level, and serve your market better.4.

Increase the employee satisfaction, and retain the employeesEmployees who are engaged and part of a culture that makes them feel valued and heard will succeed and thrive. A team with different backgrounds and identities automatically creates a sense of belonging for its members, which promotes employee satisfaction and helps with retention. The cheerful and productive employees are not just the best brand ambassadors, but they also multiply your profits.6. Enhanced problem-solving skillsDiversity is far more than just a mere representation of how we look. It brings a variety of problem-solving approaches to the table. Each team member might possess a wide range of such skill sets, which can allow the team to tackle problems from diverse angles simultaneously and consequently discover solutions that most people do not know.

Assembling a uniquely diverse team is not only good for business, but it is the right way to do things. It stands for the ethics and social principles of equal treatment and supports your brand's image and reputation.


10. Financial performance to envyLet's talk numbers. The studies continue to portray that diverse teams perform well and are connected to better financial results. Diversity isn't just a moral responsibility but also a financial responsibility.And so, how do you ensure that your concept becomes a reality? Be stringent with the hiring process you are employing. Look also at the ponds of creativity. Build an inclusive environment where various views are not only allowed but also appreciated. Offer training and development programs that allow the whole population to show their talent and share their qualities.Related: Diversity and Inclusion Best Practices for Your WorkforceHaving a diverse team is good and essential for the continuous success and innovativeness of any organization in a dynamic business environment.

So, leap. Many entrepreneurs mistakenly think that success comes from homogenizing their client base. However, I recommend that you embrace diversity and watch your business transform. In the conductor of a corporate symphony, it's a harmony of instruments playing together that gives the most beautiful music. Why not make your office be the exhibition of your artistry?

49,Making the Strong Business Case for Driving Human Brilliance,"Mar 15, 2024",Fasika Melaku,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-harness-human-brilliance-to-power-organizational/470753,"
Twenty years ago, when I first worked with my current CEO at a different company, she taught me what it truly meant to always think about the human element first. When she promoted me, she launched my professional journey, but she also did something I'll never forget — she invited me over for wine.At the time, she was a director, and I had only just started as a manager. I was one of two African Americans working at the company and an immigrant. I often felt that reality with others, but never with her. I remember asking myself, ""Does she not see that we're so different?""Her invitation was the first time I saw someone create a space for human brilliance. Fast-forward 20+ years, and she is at it again. As my current CEO, she is still creating spaces for me to do my best work, fueling my career to Senior Vice President of HR and Chief Learning Officer at Denny's. When human brilliance thrives, we create positive change: where we sit, work, and live in the world and for an organization.



Related: How To Attract (And Encourage) Brilliance In Your WorkplaceWe do our best when brilliantHuman brilliance is different for everyone. Like a stone polished to its gemlike core, bringing out an individual's brilliance is smoothing away externally imposed ideas to uncover raw, authentic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We bring out our strengths from that essence and polish them to our ultimate brilliance.


Human brilliance is not just what we get right, but all the times we fail, realize where we went wrong, and learn. Years ago, we ran the ""Surprise and Delight"" campaign, a marketing initiative that included surprising our guests by paying for their meals. By leaving extra cash in their pockets and treating them with unexpected kindness, we put our guests in a position to do better, achieve more and positively impact more people in their day.We considered the campaign successful, but reflecting, we realized we could have done more. Our current CEO joined the organization and established a new level of thinking: impact comes when those who create impact — our teams. She asked how we surprised and delighted the cooks, servers and staff. By not considering the rest of the team, that successful campaign missed an opportunity to create more points of exponential brilliance across the organization.Related: Eight Steps To Build Teams That LastMake the most of time and moneyIn my most challenging moments — heartache, illness, even death — I often realize the preciousness of time. These moments teach us that any time spent on being our most brilliant selves is an invaluable investment into who we can become and the impact we can have on the world. By helping others realize the value of investing time in developing their brilliance, I simultaneously help myself realize mine.


Time is a precious commodity in business, and the cost of capital has reached an all-time high. Not harnessing the full potential of a team's talents is a lost financial opportunity. When leaders focus on enhancing the brilliance within their organization, they unlock a competitive edge. It starts with just one person believing they can make a positive difference; this inspires others, creating a domino effect. When individual brilliance is connected and amplified, we cultivate collective wisdom, accelerate innovation, boost performance, and ultimately increase profitability.Related: Seven Ways You Can Establish Loyalty (And Even Love) In Your TeamBrilliance thrives in safetyBrilliance thrives in environments where everyone feels safe to authentically express their ideas and identity — to learn, fail, and cry ugly tears. When an organization provides such an ecosystem, it evolves into a community, and its people find a common purpose in doing their best work together. Upon this stage, we create places of brilliance. To build this foundation:1. Help remove self-limiting beliefsMany of us struggle with self-limiting beliefs that can hinder our ability to support ourselves or contribute effectively to others. I was recently diagnosed with chronic self-doubt. When leadership once presented me with an advancement opportunity, better pay, and an improved title that could open future doors, I hesitated and, ultimately, said no. This was not for a lack of qualifications but rather my self-limiting beliefs preventing me from fully committing to my organization and unleashing the full scope of human brilliance within me.


By cultivating gratitude and resilience, we can tackle these doubts head-on and inspire our teams to develop these crucial qualities. When facing self-limiting beliefs, I practice pausing and engaging in deep reflection. I ask myself, ""What's preventing my progress right now, and how can I navigate past it to unlock my true potential?"" Acknowledging obstacles and actively seeking ways to surmount them encourages growth.Related: Why Gratitude is the Missing Piece to Your Success2. Understand the existing frameworkEvery group of people has its own culture. When I greet someone from my Ethiopian heritage with three kisses on the cheek to represent warmth and connection, this customary gesture is unique to that culture. Similarly, within any organization, unique methods of connection and communication prevail, reflecting its distinct cultural environment. Leaders aiming to unlock the potential of human brilliance should first aim to understand and support the existing group connection.The approach must capture everyone for it to succeed, so get to know people and really listen. Putting in the work to understand them and meet them at their table helps pave the way for more authentic connections and a stronger foundation for collective brilliance.3. Build upon strengthsOnce at their table, I explore questions like: What is the general language of connection and can everyone easily understand it? How does our communication foster inclusivity? What rituals define and unite us? Just as childhood rituals shape our identities and lay the groundwork for trust and unity within our families, the same happens in a company.


We uncover hidden cultural strengths and insights by thoroughly examining how people learn, engage, and show vulnerability. When new leaders enter an organization believing a complete cultural overhaul is needed, when it isn't, they waste time and money. Instead, they should focus on enhancing existing strengths, nurturing and supporting them to unlock significant impact and foster human brilliance.Working with 12 million people or one, with $1 or $1000 in your bank account — anyone can foster environments that illuminate the brilliance in others. Make mindful decisions to craft spaces for individuals to reach their fullest potential. Progress towards brilliance is a mosaic of smaller yet significant achievements — each one a spark of brilliance deserving of celebration in its contribution to the larger glow of success.

50,Former Interrogator Shares 5 Behaviors Liars Exhibit and How to Handle Them,"Mar 14, 2024",Lena Sisco,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/former-interrogator-shares-key-behaviors-that-liars-exhibit/470777,"
I often get asked how a former Human Intelligence (HUMINT) interrogator can help me transform into the business leader I want to be in a field that has nothing to do with investigating the criminal activities of terrorists.Most of my clients work in human resources, employee relations, sales and finance-related investigations. They are entrepreneurs and business owners, C-Suite executives, coaches and auditors. I left the world of interrogation long ago and still use my HUMINT skills to lead challenging conversations with confidence and authority to accurately identify deception and go after the truth. In the past two decades of interviewing, I can accurately say that liars exhibit the same deceptive behaviors.Here are five deceptive behaviors to pay close attention to and how to handle those behaviors when you encounter them.Related: Use This Secret Military Trick to Tell if Someone Is Lying1. Inability to answer yes or noThe easiest test to give someone you believe is withholding the truth is to ask them a yes/no question such as, ""Are you being honest with me?"" The reason is that truth-tellers typically answer a closed-ended question quickly and succinctly with a yes or no answer, whereas liars tend to avoid answering them.



For example, in the post-trial interview with OJ Simpson in 2016, the reporter asked OJ, ""Did you ever have any [Bruno Magli shoes]?"" OJ paused, took a deep breath and shrugged his shoulders as he said, ""First of all, I would have never worn those ugly shoes."" He never answered the question. If he was being truthful, he should have answered ""no.""Liars tend to oversell a yes or no answer because they don't believe it is convincing enough. As a result, they will usually say ""absolutely, always"" for yes and ""I would never"" for no. Ask a closed-ended question and then listen to the response. Is it truthful or deceptive?2. Missing ""I"" and ""my"" pronounsPronouns play a big part in detecting deception. The possessive pronouns ""I"" and ""my"" indicate that a person is taking ownership of what they say. Typically, liars will replace those two pronouns with other pronouns such as ""you,"" ""we"" or ""they"" or avoid them altogether when they do not want to take ownership of knowledge or information.For example, if you ask an employee allegedly involved in an ethics violation, ""What happened?"" and they answer with, ""We're trying to figure out what happened."" They could be avoiding responsibility because they didn't say, ""I'm trying to figure out what happened."" Remember Anthony Weiner? When he was lying, he said, ""We're trying to figure out who sent the tweet from my account."" He takes accountability for his account but NOT for trying to figure out who sent the tweet because he knew he sent it. A great way to handle this behavior is to ask, ""You and who are trying to figure this out?""


3. Behavioral incongruenceBehavioral incongruence is the most accurate indicator of deception. It happens when our body language contradicts our spoken language. When we are being truthful, our words, voice, emotions, facial expressions and gestures are naturally in sync; when we lie, they are incongruent. Two great examples of behavioral incongruence that are easy to identify involve shoulder shrugs and head nods and shakes.We will shrug our shoulders in uncertainty when we doubt what we are saying. If someone says, ""I know exactly what happened,"" and they shrug their shoulders, you have a problem. They are doubting what they are saying — and so should you.In most cultures, head nodding signifies ""yes,"" and head-shaking signifies ""no."" If someone says, ""I like your idea,"" but shakes their head sideways, they may not like it. When you see incongruent behaviors in someone, do not trust them. Instead, ask them, ""Why should I believe you?"" A truthful person will usually say, ""Because I'm telling you the truth."" Any other response should be suspicious.Related: 10 Telltale Phrases That Indicate Somebody Isn't Telling the Truth


4. The smokescreenA smokescreen is a ruse to disguise someone's real intentions or actions. People will try to avoid answering a question by taking the conversation onto a different topic, so you focus on their ruse rather than what really happened.Here is an example: Drew Peterson, a former cop now in prison for murdering his third wife while his fourth wife is still missing, during an interview with Larry King, said that his marriage to his fourth wife was going through tough times because she was medicated for depression after her sister died. That is a great disguise to blame their marriage troubles on. He also claimed she ran away with another guy. Yet another cover-up to take him out of the investigation spotlight.When you ask questions to discover the truth, if a liar doesn't want you to know the truth, they may try to disguise it and use a smokescreen to take your attention elsewhere. If you notice someone using a smokescreen, redirect the conversation to the topic in question!5. How liars sound (pitch, rate, breathy)To discover lies, you must focus on the words people say and how they sound. When most people lie, they become nervous, and their vocal cords can tighten, raising their voice's pitch. They also will unconsciously change the rate of their speech. Liars may try to speak faster to avoid being questioned, while others slow down because they struggle to think of what to say. They may be so worried that their cognitive abilities are lessening, so they will speak slower. Either way, in the past 20 years of listening to liars, I will say for certain that their rate of speech will change when they lie.


Finally, when someone is lying to you, they may begin to breathe heavily, and you will hear them becoming breathy. Essentially, they are out of breath because their heart rate has increased due to flight or fight. So, when you hear a change in how someone sounds, investigate it! Ask questions on that specific topic to uncover the truth.These five behaviors are very accurate when deciphering between truth and deception. Reading about them has increased your awareness about them, so the next time you have a gut feeling that someone isn't being honest, ask yourself if they demonstrated one of these five deceptive behaviors.Related: The One Interviewing Technique Guaranteed to Get You the Truth

51,How to Battle Burnout While Protecting Your Most Valuable Asset — Your People,"Mar 14, 2024",Apu Pavithran,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-battle-cybersecurity-burnout-and-protect-your-people/470720,"
The cyber threat landscape is a relentless battlefield. As leaders in this unforgiving arena, we wear many hats — strategists, innovators, risk mitigators and, most importantly, leaders. In this constant state of defense, it's easy to overlook the most critical line of protection: our own people, the cybersecurity professionals who stand guard day and night. They are the human firewall, the skilled hands deciphering cryptic codes and thwarting insidious attacks. But here's a brutal truth: they are burning out.The numbers paint a grim picture. A Forrester study last year revealed that a staggering 66% of cybersecurity professionals experienced extreme stress and burnout, with 51% being prescribed medicine and 19% consuming three drinks daily to deal with the stress. This isn't just a human cost; it's a business vulnerability. Burnout threatens to leave our digital castles unguarded in an industry already plagued by a 4 million talent gap.Related: How to Spot Entrepreneurial Burnout (Before It's Too Late)



Reframing the narrativeThe causes of cybersecurity burnout are multifaceted. The ever-evolving threat landscape generates a constant sense of urgency and an unending race against unseen adversaries. Long hours, on-call expectations, and the weight of potential breaches together create a highly strenuous environment. In addition to the resource crunch, understaffed teams grapple with inadequate budgets and outdated tools, further amplifying the stress.To reframe this narrative, realizing that fostering such an environment starts by acknowledging stress is important. Hence, the first step is to promote open dialogue about the pressures associated with cybersecurity work. Creating a safe space for employees to express their concerns and providing adequate support can significantly impact them.


Companies that promote and facilitate the exchange of information and knowledge among different functions and departments tend to be more cohesive in pursuing objectives. Enhanced collaboration often leads to greater trust among teams, which in turn promotes additional sharing of knowledge. This positive cycle can significantly enhance organizational cybersecurity, as each employee's actions contribute to overall resilience. Another pillar of a stress-free workplace is encouraging a healthy work-life balance. Cybersecurity professionals must be reminded to take breaks, utilize vacation days, and disconnect after working hours. Moreover, leading by example is essential; as leaders, demonstrating healthy boundaries sends a powerful message.Related: Are You at Risk for Burnout? This Psychologist-Created Quiz Lets You Know in 5 MinutesBuilding sustainable systemsAddressing burnout doesn't stop with individual-level interventions. It necessitates a strategic and systemic approach that addresses the root causes. Businesses must take charge of building sustainable systems that support and enhance the resilience of the cybersecurity workforce.One significant contributor to burnout is the overwhelming workload faced by IT teams. As companies embrace digital transformation, they have access to many solutions, each with its own benefits. However, a major drawback is the increasing burden on IT professionals. In this context, solutions integrating multiple capabilities are invaluable in lightening the workload.


For example, implementing a unified endpoint management (UEM) solution consolidates device management, application management, patch management and more into a single console. Similarly, secure access service edge (SASE) combines network connectivity and security functionalities into a unified platform.Another approach is promoting cross-training. This facilitates knowledge sharing and fosters a collaborative approach within the cybersecurity team. Furthermore, it helps distribute workloads more effectively while also cultivating a sense of collective ownership. Finally, offering avenues for continuous training and upskilling ensures that employees have the necessary knowledge to stay ahead in the ever-evolving threat landscape.Related: Cyber Attacks Are On the Rise — Here's How Your Business Can Continuously Prepare for ThreatsCultivating an atmosphere of appreciation and recognitionIt's often easy to overlook the tireless efforts of our cybersecurity professionals, working diligently behind the scenes to thwart attacks without seeking recognition. Yet, this silent service deserves acknowledgment. Recognizing their contributions and celebrating their successes can reignite their passion and dedication. Highlighting successful security outcomes and the individuals responsible fosters a sense of pride and accomplishment.


Additionally, to foster a culture of collaboration and trust, break down silos, and encourage open communication and information sharing across teams. Empowering employees to contribute their unique perspectives fosters a sense of belonging and deepens appreciation for their invaluable contributions.We are fortunate to be in an era where mental health is regarded as important as physical health. However, in a field known for high-stakes scenarios, mental health often takes a back seat. Therefore, businesses should ensure that employees have access to assistance programs and mental health resources, fostering an environment where discussions about mental health are normalized and stigma-free.In short, cybersecurity burnout is not an inevitable consequence of the job. It's a systemic issue demanding leadership. We can turn the tide by prioritizing our people's well-being, empowering them with the right tools and resources, and fostering a culture of support and appreciation. Remember that protecting our data and systems starts with protecting the human beings who are our most valuable assets in this digital warzone.

52,Boomers: The Wealthy Client Group You Can't Ignore — Here's the Best Way to Market to Them.,"Mar 14, 2024",Scott Keffer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/boomers-own-most-of-the-wealth-heres-the-best-way-to/469989,"
In the unending search for the holy grail of marketing, financial advisors are lately tempted by promises of quick and easy client acquisition through digital marketing miracles. From buying digital leads to endless social media posts, content marketing and webinars, the financial industry has embraced the allure of online strategies with hopes of waves of new affluent clients.However, starting with a method is marketing backward. Marketing should always begin with your ideal client. Knowing their mindset is the recipe for success – embracing their desires, mastering their language, and resonating with their values.The ideal clientThe first and foremost consideration is defining the ideal client. Seeking to be everything to everybody positions you as nothing to no one.



My definition is an E.L.K. — Easy. Listen to you. Keep paying you the most — who is successful, serious and salt. Successful financially ($2 million to $25 million), serious about their money and future and salt-of-the-earth (loyal and trustworthy). Most importantly, they are in a position to become a client today and move their money to you now (ages 64-74).That's a Baby Boomer. Boomers own 51 percent of all wealth in the United States, have the most wealth per household, have the most money in retirement funds and have the most money in stock and mutual funds.


Related: The 7-Step Guide To Finding the Right Clients and Avoiding the Ones Who Waste Your TimeThe normal and natural testProspects do what is normal and natural.Think about this: Would an affluent Boomer normally and naturally go online to find a CPA, attorney, heart surgeon or financial advisor? The answer is no. Sure, there are always exceptions. However, in marketing, relying on exceptions is foolhardy and costly. Marketing must be sustainable and scalable to be successful.Many mistakenly assume that the majority of retail purchases are made online. Not true. In 2023, only 15.6% of all U.S. retail sales occurred online, according to Statista. Furthermore, 84% of Boomers prefer visiting a physical store for their shopping needs.


Understanding the mindset of Boomers, who grew up in a world devoid of technology, unveils a picture of their unique set of values and preferences. Growing up with catalog shopping, green stamps, waiting for the mailman, service stations, rotary phones, telephone operators, sending postcards while traveling, adjusting the antenna on the single black-and-white TV, vinyl records, having milk delivered to a box on the front porch and getting news from Walter Cronkite has stamped an indelible set of values and preferences on them.Not surprisingly, Boomers align with traditional values, are most comfortable with conventional communication, and value information from trusted sources.Typically, three kinds of people go online for financial information: 1. Hot tip investors seeking the latest stock ""intel,"" 2. DIYers seeking ""how to"" information, and 3. Price-shopping penny pinchers seeking a deal. None of these are the kind of people who make the best long-term, loyal clients.Related: How You Can Build Long-Lasting Customer Relationships


The ideal marketing mediumDirect mail aligns perfectly with the preferences of Boomers. They trust the tangible.According to the United States Postal Service (USPS), 92% of Boomers check their mail daily, with 91% stating that sorting through mail doesn't stress them. Furthermore, 82% express a greater likelihood of buying from a business that sends them direct mail, considering it more personal than digital communications. These statistics reinforce that Boomers trust direct mail more than any other marketing channel.Even Google and other popular brands rely on direct mail to get businesses to advertise with them. In a 2018 Vox article, they report, ""Yet over the last few years, brands — including hot, digitally savvy, direct-to-consumer ones like Casper, Harry's, Wayfair, Rover, Quip, Away, Handy, and Modcloth — have taken to targeting customers in the mail.""Better yet, mailboxes are less cluttered these days, which means less competition. As advertising spending overall grew 50% (2015-2021), the dollars that went into Direct Mail dropped 17%, per Statista.


Related: 5 Ways to Effectively Market to Baby BoomersHere are five keys to make for direct mail success1. Personalize the mail: Make it unique — Craft your message as if it's a letter written to a friend. Address the dreams, desires, and concerns of a Boomer. Make them feel seen and understood, establishing an immediate connection. Use their name, acknowledge their individuality, and tailor your communication to resonate on a personal level with authenticity and sincerity.2. Invest in presentation: Make it hard to ignore — Design your mailing package to be visually arresting. Invest in quality paper, eye-catching graphics, and a layout that demands attention. A well-presented letter not only reflects professionalism but also intrigues prospects, urging them to want more.3. Appeal to both the heart and the head: Mix emotion with reason – Strike a balance between emotional resonance and logical persuasion. Connect with them emotionally and support your claims with rational arguments, data, and evidence. This harmonious blend creates a persuasive narrative that speaks to both the heart and the head, leaving a lasting impact and setting you apart from the crowd.


4. Include high-value content – Provide information that adds genuine value. Offer statistics, trends, and insights that position you as a source of exclusive knowledge, elevating the perceived value of your message. By sharing relevant and intriguing content, you position yourself as an indispensable resource, fostering trust and credibility.5. Use familiar analogies and metaphors – Communicate complex ideas using relatable analogies and metaphors. Create a bridge between unfamiliar concepts and your prospects' existing knowledge. Analogies serve as mental shortcuts, making it easier for your reader to grasp the essence of your message. By using familiar comparisons, you enhance accessibility.In a world barraged with online noise, the key to success with affluent Boomers lies in delivering messages that are normal, natural, and, above all, trusted by them. Financial advisors can unlock a deep gold mine of affluent Boomers with little competition by embracing direct mail and crafting personalized, engaging marketing.

Two of the biggest concerns for small business owners are hiring the right talent (60.7%) and retaining and motivating employees (33%), according to survey data from the nonprofit organization SCORE.A study from The Society for Human Resource Management found that, on average, it costs a company six to nine months of an employee's salary to find a replacement — and a Gallup poll revealed that more than half of employees who quit said their manager or organization could have done something to prevent it.Related: 4 Ways to Boost Your Employee Retention in an Uncertain EconomyBut what does preventing a mass exodus of talent actually look like?It can literally pay to draw on examples from some of the world's most successful billion-dollar firms.

From coaching and mentoring employees on the path to senior roles to allowing them to work in a remote or hybrid setup, there are plenty of ways to show employees their value.Related: This Is How to Boost Employee Retention With Lifelong LearningCheck out OnDeck's infographic below to learn what it takes to ensure your employees stick around:Image Credit: Courtesy of OnDeck

54,5 Surprisingly Critical Employee Skill Sets in Demand for 2024,"Mar 14, 2024",Jason Zickerman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-invaluable-soft-skills-to-seek-in-your-next-hire/470695,"
A reporter once asked professional development guru Dale Carnegie how he was able to pull off hiring 43 millionaires. Carnegie responded that those people were not millionaires when they were hired. Rather, he had identified their potential and cultivated them into the successes they ultimately became. Carnegie, whose leadership insight was clearly ahead of its time, added, ""Men are developed the same way gold is mined. Several tons of dirt must be moved to get an ounce of gold. But you don't go into the mine looking for dirt. You go in looking for the gold.""The trick for business leadership and hiring managers is knowing what great potential looks like. And in all likeliness, you can't glean that from a resume, as the promise of an employee's greatness isn't necessarily evident from their current skill set or perhaps even their past jobs. Sure, experience and hard skills are important, but there are more powerful indicators of long-term success — gold, if you will — that are far better telltales of an employee's ability to flourish.The interesting thing here is that employees often aren't even conscious of their capacity for growth. While it is surely in one's best interest to have self-awareness related to one's natural talents and deficits, the onus is on leadership to recognize the potential for greatness within their employees. But often, those who should know best simply miss the ball when assessing and nurturing talent.



Many people, particularly those new to management, focus too heavily on identifying weaknesses and overcoming deficits in their employees. This is the dirt that Carnegie was referring to. Regardless of how successful we are, everyone (and I do mean everyone) possesses at least some challenges and shortcomings. We also all have certain behavioral profiles that work wonderfully in certain situations and not so great in others.As managers grow into true and effective leaders, they recognize that focusing on employees' faults rather than their potential is a losing game for everyone. For instance, a performance improvement plan (PIP) aims to address an employee's deficits rather than how to leverage their talents better. True or not, many workers feel that PIPs simply document their failures as a precursor to being let go. So, while PIPs are ostensibly designed to foster progress and growth, they often have the opposite effect due to their focus on the dirt. While the stats don't currently seem to exist, it would be interesting to learn what percentage of PIP recipients ever move on to advanced positions within that organization. I imagine it is astonishingly few.


More evolved and successful managers instead work purposefully to find and foster the strengths in each member of their team. Their job is to identify that gold in each individual and put them in positions where they can maximize their strengths for the betterment of themselves and the company.I know, I know. Your pushback is, ""What if the employee is actually untalented or unredeemable in some way?"" That reflects as much on the hiring process and HR management as it does on the employee in question. If a business finds itself making lousy hires after bad hires, the process is broken or is ironically due to talent deficits within the hiring manager. Somewhere along the line, the wrong attributes are being favored instead of the right stuff.Related: High Performers and High-Potential Employees Are Not One in the SameThe following are a few soft skills worth their weight in gold that you should look for in your next great hire.


1. Adaptability and resiliencyAn employee's ability to adapt is an exceptionally valuable characteristic and a strong indicator of long-term success. Adaptability means that an employee is not only quick on their feet, but also reflects an innovative, agile and agreeable spirit. Resiliency is reflected in their capacity to bounce back from misfires and overcome obstacles.2. CommunicationVerbal aptitude, writing ability and listening skills are invaluable talents that you should look for in every employee, regardless of their pay grade. Your entire team's ability to express themselves to others ultimately leads to better connection, improved collaboration and a more compelling company culture.Related: How to Delegate Effectively Without Ruining Your Team3. CreativityCreative thinkers are natural innovators. They not only offer fresh ideas and approaches but also inspire others to do the same. Creative thinkers tend to be your best problem solvers and are catalysts for organizational improvement and growth.


4. Leadership potentialWhile leaders can certainly be developed, natural leaders possess some key traits long before they ever climb the corporate ladder. Those best positioned for future leadership roles are wired to inspire those around them, demonstrate initiative and take ownership of their decisions regardless of their current title.Related: Feel Like an Imposter? Practice These 5 Habits to Beat Your Imposter Syndrome5. Continuous learningA hungry mind is a tremendous asset and a clear indicator of a growth mindset. An employee's drive to attain new knowledge reflects an incredible array of transferable skills, including increased capacities in problem-solving, collaboration, critical thinking and innovation. So, keep a keen eye out in your hiring process for job candidates with curious minds.As you begin to focus on the right skills in your hiring and employee development initiatives, you and your entire organization will surely be rewarded with all the riches you deserve.

55,Top Ways I've Learned to Keep Motivation High in an Asynchronous Workplace,"Mar 12, 2024",Tom Medema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-keep-motivation-high-in-an-asynchronous-workplace/470472,"
The asynchronous work environment was largely forced upon us in recent years, with professionals worldwide having little say in the matter. However, the continued commonality of this geographically extended workplace means we have to make sure that by cutting certain corners of traditional work, we aren't depriving ourselves of personal working life hacks and skills, such as motivation, that should be ever-present in workplaces.From my experience, intrapersonal-type skills tend to be cast aside and devalued in an async environment. Our focus for today is motivation, which is one of them. If we just stop for a second to think about prior conversations regarding our levels of motivation, I believe that most of our memories will jump to a time when a pitfall in motivation brought about the conversation, and thus, occurs at a time when it is almost impossible to successfully maneuver ourselves out of this rut, and onto an inspired, powerful, and motivated path once again.This mustn't be the case, and as a pioneer of async communication and workplaces myself through my role as CEO of Bubbles, I want to make sure we are continuously mindful and self-aware, but that we also collaborate to structure our working environments in such a way that we give each other the highest chance of success and omnipresent motivation. Let me show you how.



Related: Has Technology Killed Face-To-Face Communication? How to Navigate the Nuances of Digital Age CommunicationUnderstanding asynchronous workTo understand optimizing asynchronous motivation, we should first boost our understanding of this newfound technique. I say newfound, but in reality, async communication has been around for donkey's years (relatively speaking), with email and fax, for example, but these processes were never enough alone to fully run businesses from. This is why, with the recent influx of revolutionary async communication methods and tools, such as Bubbles, and the increasing popularity of tools like Slack, we are witnessing a new asynchronous generation and phenomenon among professionals. However, not everyone is keeping up.


In 2022, Buffer's State of Remote Work report revealed that only 38% of companies had an async-first policy, despite 52% of employees desiring an async set-up. Moving and evolving with the times is something critical in my view of a successful business, and trying to always align with what our employees want is something that should go without saying. If we ignore these lighthouse signals, we are likely to witness, ironically, things like a lack of motivation in our teams. Nevertheless, I want to focus on the instances where async has been chosen and help as best as I can, starting with some soft-skills and intrapersonal skills.Related: How to Create an Asynchronous Work CultureFlexibility and employee preferencesThe allure of remote work largely stems from its flexibility. Buffer's report highlighted that 67% of remote workers valued flexibility in time management, while 62% appreciated the choice of work location. This flexibility, however, must be balanced with strategies to keep remote workers motivated and engaged.Empathy and recognition in asynchronous workEmpathy is naturally intertwined with asynchronous working. Providing our employees with vast flexibility and choice of working locations cannot be discredited in terms of a caring approach to each individual, to the extent that these two remote benefits came at the top of an importance list in the same Buffer report. I want to note here, though, that this is not just about 'being nice' to our staff, because the reality is that we will gain masses in return for this thoughtfulness, through boosts in motivation, productivity and desire to impress. This claim that I make is not plucked out of thin air, and in fact, according to Businessolver, a staggering 70% of employees and HR professionals agree that empathetic organizations lead to higher employee motivation. Moreover, 68% of HR professionals believe employee recognition and feedback positively impact retention (SHRM). In an asynchronous setting, where face-to-face interactions are limited, recognizing employees' efforts becomes even more vital to maintaining motivation.


Here are five more strategies for maintaining motivation.1. Establish clear communication channelsClear and efficient communication is imperative for your team to thrive in an asynchronous environment. I am not just referring to the technology here, as although that is the umbrella above this, it is equally important to set expectations for response times and time-based performance.Related: Open Your Digital Doors: Communication and Remote Work2. Build this culture of recognitionRecognition excites people and boosts motivation. Professionals are aware of this to some degree, with Reward Gateway proving that 60% of employees want to see managers or leaders praising their colleagues' work more often. When feedback like this arises from a group who are looking to become a more prosperous and motivated team, we can be sure that regular recognition, whether in one-on-one sessions or daily stand-up, is something to focus on.


3. Promote work-life balanceOne of remote work's main and most widely covered struggles is unplugging after work hours. Again, encouraging a healthy work-life balance and being empathetic with after-hours communication can prevent burnout and maintain motivation.Related: Having A Work-Life Balance is Nonsense. To Reach Your Goals, Follow Another Approach4. Provide opportunities for professional growthEmployees want and need growth and development opportunities even in an asynchronous environment. Keep the conversations going about career paths, and make sure to mentor wherever you can.5. Implement flexible work policiesFlexible work policies are a key motivator, and a highly valued aspect of async, as established earlier. A PR NewsWire report also indicates that 81% of employers see improving talent retention as a motivation for adopting flexible work policies, as well as boosting the pool from which they can hire. Allowing employees to choose their working hours can increase job satisfaction and motivation, meaning you get more from less.So, I hope by now you have clocked on to the importance of not neglecting key aspects of our work lives, such as motivation. This is a lesson that is aimed at helping you and your teammates, so I hope you can go away from this motivation to instill some new values in your asynchronous workplace!

56,"Embracing Antifragility — How to Leverage Uncertainty, Volatility and Stress for Unprecedented Growth and Innovation","Mar 11, 2024",Peter Goldstein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-leverage-uncertainty-volatility-and-stress-for/469929,"
Over a decade ago, esteemed statistician and essayist, Nassim Nicholas Taleb wrote a series of arguments about organisms or systems that do more than just resist or bounce back from stressors and adversity. Instead, they improve their capacity to thrive in the long term because of those very stressors.This phenomenon, which he termed antifragility, has subsequently been applied to various fields such as risk analysis, aerospace, molecular biology, urban planning and more, to great success. Where it hasn't been adequately integrated and leveraged is in entrepreneurship, and further, in how we develop the psychology required to become antifragile. Therein lies a significant opportunity.In an entrepreneurial sense, antifragility means that unlike things that are ""resilient"" (i.e., can withstand shocks) or ""fragile"" (i.e., are harmed by shocks), antifragile entities thrive and improve in the face of volatility, uncertainty and stress. Applying the concept of antifragility to an entrepreneurial framework involves cultivating an organizational structure and mindset that not only withstands uncertainties and disruptions but leverages them for growth.



I am no stranger to the volatility of life and the markets. I've weathered life's ups and downs, particularly after the 2008 crash, when I faced total financial loss. This phase was tough on both personal and professional fronts. Those days tested me to the core. They were challenging my resilience and character like never before. As I began to rebuild my life and reframe my purpose as an entrepreneur, the concept of antifragility began to blossom. I learned to lean into hardship, and I embraced the principle of antifragility, learning to grow stronger from adversity, volatility and stress.Related: How to Thrive Through Adversity — A Roadmap for Entrepreneurial Resilience


Understanding antifragilityAntifragility is not about bouncing back, returning to baseline or even withstanding stress, volatility, uncertainty or any other adversity. It's about growing and benefitting from those things. It's being a Hydra, not a Phoenix. The famous mythical bird, the Phoenix, is noted for its incredible ability to dissipate to ashes, only to be reborn as it once was. It does this repeatedly, the same cycle of ashes to rebirth, over and over. However, the Greek legend of Heracles and his 12 labors paints a different picture for us. One of Heracles' famous labors is the destruction of the Hydra, a nine-headed water snake. While nine heads might be more than formidable enough, the Hydra also had a unique characteristic. If Heracles were to successfully slice off one of the Hydra's heads, it wouldn't just grow the head back, it would grow back that head and more. Cut off one of its heads, it grows back two more. The Hydra isn't just resilient, it's antifragile.From an entrepreneurial perspective, the concept of antifragility is a powerful tool. It's learning to become a Hydra. Adopting an antifragile mindset in business means not just surviving in a chaotic environment but actively seeking ways to grow and improve as a result of the chaos. It's about turning volatility and uncertainty into opportunities for innovation, learning and resilience.Indeed, this can be a difficult concept to apply practically simply because most of our knee-jerk reactions are to avoid discomfort, volatility and uncertainty. So, how can entrepreneurs develop an antifragile mindset?Building an antifragile mindsetWhile much more research needs to be done to better understand the psychology and neuroscience of antifragile behavior, we do have some excellent indicators from the science and lived experiences of antifragile individuals. Several of those indicators fall into a bucket of what we call mindset, a set of beliefs, both conscious and unconscious that influence the way we see and interact with the world. These mindsets impact our ""thought-action repertoires,"" the short list of possible actions or behaviors chosen from in any given context.


Developing such mindsets requires training several ways of thinking over time so that they eventually become traits. The first, and perhaps most critical trait is psychological flexibility. Antifragility is not about rigidity, but flexibility within a clearly defined boundary of values and beliefs. It's not just mental toughness or ""suck it up"" attitudes. It's the ability to exist in, endure and even benefit from a rich range of experiences and to be able to see situations from a range of perspectives.This gives way to another important skill, the ability to see and approach stressors as challenges or opportunities instead of threats, what is commonly referred to as a challenge mindset as opposed to a stress mindset (e.g., fight, flight or freeze). While many more granular details and thinking styles exist within these larger categories, being psychologically flexible, generally optimistic and challenge-oriented serve as excellent starting points for developing an antifragile mindset.Related: Obstacles Are Opportunities: Use Them to Take Your Business to the Next LevelAntifragile strategies for entrepreneursOnce you have worked on developing an antifragile mindset, entrepreneurs can begin to apply practical strategies for building antifragile businesses and frameworks.


Recognizing that antifragile systems thrive amidst chaos and uncertainty, and choosing to see these conditions not as threats but as avenues for growth is a game changer. This mindset encourages entrepreneurs like us to not shy away from risks but to engage in calculated ones that bring beneficial volatility.Similarly, diversification is key; by spreading out revenue sources, customer bases and offerings, we can make our businesses more adaptable and less prone to singular shocks. Learning from failure is also a cornerstone of antifragility. Viewing setbacks as crucial learning moments allows us to foster a culture of innovation and resilience.Agility and adaptability are paramount; I believe in incorporating flexibility into business models to swiftly navigate market shifts. This involves a constant re-evaluation of strategies to stay aligned with the dynamic business environment. In pursuing decentralization, we mitigate risks associated with single points of failure, enhancing our response to disruptions. Ensuring systems are robust, with redundant processes and well-thought-out contingency plans, further fortifies our antifragile stance.Continuous innovation keeps entrepreneurs ahead, urging us to always push the envelope and explore new territories. Building a strong network is equally crucial, providing a support system and resources that are vital in tumultuous times.


Lastly, the foundation of antifragility lies in resilience — both organizational and personal. Prioritizing the well-being of ourselves and our teams, ensuring a healthy work-life balance and nurturing a supportive environment are all critical in building a truly resilient and antifragile enterprise.Related: Why You Need to Embrace Uncertainty as an Entrepreneurial Leader (and How to Navigate It Effectively)Embracing antifragility represents a paradigm shift in entrepreneurship, encouraging leaders to not just endure but to harness volatility and uncertainty as engines for innovation and growth.As we navigate a world characterized by rapid change and unpredictability, the principles of antifragility offer a roadmap for building robust, dynamic businesses poised for long-term success. By integrating these concepts into their strategies, entrepreneurs can create organizations that not only withstand but capitalize on the complexities of the modern market.


It's time to let chaos be your catalyst, embracing antifragility as not just a strategy for survival, but as the foundation for unprecedented growth and innovation.

57,6 Ways I've Achieved a Healthy Work-Life Balance as a Business Owner,"Mar 11, 2024",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-master-work-life-harmony-with-these-simple-steps/469893,"
Collaboration is a powerful tool that has become increasingly essential in the modern business world. Working together with others can help drive growth, innovation, and success. My journey with collaboration caused me to discover some hacks that have improved my work-life balance.This article will explore the importance of these hacks and provide some tips for re-prioritizing your work-life relationship and using it to achieve your goals.Related: Why Strong Collaborations Will Change Your Business



1. Set clear boundariesThe first step to finding balance is to set clear boundaries between your professional and personal life. When you're working, focus solely on business tasks without letting any outside influences distract you.Similarly, when you're out of the office, ensure that work doesn't infringe upon your other activities or relationships. You must understand what lines must not be crossed for both sides of your life to remain healthy and balanced.


2. Prioritize your timeWhen managing your time as an entrepreneur, it's important to prioritize the most important tasks first. This means taking some extra time during the day or week to plan what needs to be done ahead of time so that nothing is left undone or forgotten about. Doing this will help keep task-related stress at bay and give you more freedom in determining how best to divide up the rest of your day or week into a manageable schedule.Additionally, don't forget to add some non-work-related activities into your schedule, such as exercise or leisurely activities — these can help provide much-needed respite from your otherwise hectic workloads.Related: 15 of the Best Time Management and Productivity Books of All Time3. Take regular breaksIt's easy for entrepreneurs to get caught up in their work and forget about taking regular breaks throughout their day. But breaks are essential for maintaining both physical and mental health — they can help reduce stress levels while providing an opportunity for creativity, too.


Try setting reminders on your phone or computer so that you take regular breaks throughout the day – this could mean stepping away from the desk for 10 minutes every hour or even going for a walk during lunchtime, if possible! Taking regular breaks will refresh your mind and body alike, helping you stay productive yet balanced over time.Related: How to Achieve A CEO Level of Focus by Breaking Habits and Taking Breaks4. Learn to say noAs an entrepreneur, it can be easy to overextend yourself by saying yes too often when asked for favors or projects outside of work hours — but learning when (and how) to say no can ultimately save considerable amounts of unnecessary stress in the long run.Don't feel guilty if you need to turn down certain requests; just politely explain why it's not possible at this particular time, perhaps offering alternative solutions depending on what may be suitable instead. By knowing when (and how) to say no without feeling guilty, entrepreneurs can find greater peace of mind while still being able to give back where needed most.


5. Schedule regular 'me time'Making sure that there is adequate 'me time' built into each week is essential – regardless if it's reading a book in silence, going out with friends, or simply enjoying a warm bath after work hours — whatever activity works best for giving yourself some much-needed rest. Having this type of downtime allows entrepreneurs ample opportunity to recharge their batteries before returning to business mode — allowing them to manage better stress levels associated with being constantly busy with numerous tasks at hand.6. Don't neglect your health and well-beingLastly - one key area that entrepreneurs needn't forget about balancing is their health & well-being; don't neglect to eat nutritious food regularly during working hours nor avoid exercise altogether either — these are paramount needs necessary for keeping one's energy levels high while reducing any risks associated from sitting down all day — thus ensuring both physical & mental well-being remains balanced over longer periods.ConclusionManaging a successful career and a satisfying lifestyle outside of work can be difficult but achievable, no matter what stage in business development one might find themselves at now.The key lies in understanding where our limits lie and setting clear boundaries between our personal life and professional obligations accordingly—along with scheduling sufficient 'me' time each week where necessary. Following such guidelines helps ensure balance remains intact over extended periods while promoting productivity and achieving success simultaneously, too.

58,The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers Not to Be Quiet,"Mar 8, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-little-coffee-shop-that-asks-customers-not-to-be-quiet/470902,"
Nirvana Soul in San Jose, California is not a place you go to bury yourself in a book or work quietly on your computer. Colorful artwork lines the walls, and upbeat music fills the air. You're bound to meet someone new during your visit as the conversational baristas and owners float around tables to chat with customers.Sisters Jeronica Macey and Be'Anka Ashaolu started the coffee shop in 2018 to create a space for belonging. They wanted people to have a space where they could experience community or come to make a friend. From day one, they've poured their efforts into curating an energizing and welcoming environment at the shop.Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront



Nirvana Soul's tight-knit community feel is a huge appeal for customers, including Yelp Elite and Community Intern Camy T. A local college student, Camy frequents Nirvana Soul to study, work on art, and hang out with friends. ""Downtown coffee shops were missing that community aspect,"" she said. ""But when Nirvana Soul came into town, things shifted in my perspective. It became a hub for many college students for studying, creating art, showcasing their talent at open mic night, and meeting new people, especially creatives.""Be'Anka and Jeronica's team laid the foundation for the shop's accessible and inviting feel. Their friendly staff is eager to answer questions and make an effort to ""table tap,"" walking up to every customer to ask how they're doing and offer them water. ""We just try to put in little joyful moments, so [people] have great coffee and a great experience at the same time,"" Be'Anka said.


The owners acknowledge that their departure from the coffee shop's traditional head-down work environment can lead to misunderstanding and sometimes critical feedback. They've had to learn how to respond when critiques come from someone who might not be in their target audience.""Change is hard, right?"" Be'Anka asked. ""So sometimes, it's almost like a culture shock. We've had reviews where people say, 'This is not what a coffee shop is supposed to be.' And we're like, 'Okay, I hear you, but maybe it's just different than what you're used to and we can be a little more open-minded.'""Related: The Owners of This Texas Farmers Market Took a Big Gamble. Here's How It Paid Off Bigger Than They Dreamed.Reviews like these can actually be a useful way to set expectations for future customers about the shop experience. By clearly communicating how your business operates, future patrons will have a better sense of what to expect and can decide if it's a right fit for their needs. In her time running Nirvana Soul, Be'Anka has learned the value of all feedback, both positive and critical, in helping her optimize the customer experience.


Be'Anka also stressed the importance of sharing your feedback in the moment. While Camy loves the environment and food at Nirvana Soul, she mentioned in her 4-star review that the sweet flavors in her drink were overpowering. Critiques like these are easy fixes that Nirvana Soul's baristas are happy to accommodate in the moment.""We'd so much rather [hear in person] than read about it later because now you're out there in the world with a drink that you hate. We could have gotten you something better, and you're already gone,"" Be'Anka said.As a consumer, Camy feels a responsibility to provide thoughtful feedback, always striving to help businesses improve.""I think people get a bit into the realm of people-pleasing,"" she said. ""You want to make people feel good, but you're also sacrificing your own needs as a consumer by not letting a business know if something could be changed. We're in an era of improvement, of growth, and I think it's important to critique every now and again.""


As a business, in addition to being responsive to feedback, creating touchpoints with your customers on social media is an important way to make them feel like a valued part of your community. As Be'Anka builds up Nirvana Soul's social media presence, she makes an effort to reshare posts from customers whenever she can. These expressions of appreciation go a long way with regulars like Camy.Related: This Mom and Pop Ice Cream Shop's Success Comes Down to This Simple Phrase""I think it's really beautiful to exchange that back-and-forth with a business,"" Camy said. ""I come here frequently. You recognize that, you appreciate me as your customer, and I'm dedicated to your business.""Be'Anka also emphasizes the importance of being consistent and active on social media. If you find social media intimidating, start small. It's better to post one simple photo every day than to let the need for a ""perfect"" feed hold you back from posting.


""I just snap pictures of anything. It doesn't matter what it is. It could be a drink, it could be artwork, it could be a scene in the shop. You don't have to say much. You can describe what's in the photo. You can say 'good morning.' It doesn't even matter because tomorrow's another day and you should probably just post the next picture.""Above all, Nirvana Soul is a space for community, a key part of which is representation. During their six years in business, Be'Anka and Jeronica have featured the work of over 65 artists, including female artists and artists of color, with the intention of creating a space where diverse voices are seen and uplifted.While the shop celebrates its role as one of a handful of Black- and woman-owned businesses in San Jose, Be'Anka recognizes that the quality of the Nirvana Soul experience is what shines through to customers at the end of the day.""We know there's going to be people who find us because we're Black-owned,"" Be'Anka said. ""We also know that it's not going to be a one-and-done with them because they're going to come in, love the experience so much, and know that this is a Black-created experience. And then they'll come back and bring more people—because after a certain point, it's just awesome coffee and a great experience.""


In addition to staying true to your mission and vision, Nirvana Soul believes in:Engaging customers during their visit to your business. Create a space where they feel comfortable chatting, asking questions, and raising any concerns they may have.Maintaining an active social media presence.

59,5 Tips for Building a Strong Customer-Centric Culture and Fostering Brand Loyalty,"Mar 8, 2024",Henry Ma,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-build-an-ironclad-customer-centric-culture/470147,"
All of us have been customers at one time or another, and we have all likely had a customer service experience that was less than ideal. When we think about those experiences, all of the feelings we experienced in that moment rise to the surface.Negative customer service experiences can deeply impact our feelings about a particular business or brand, and those negative feelings can be hard — if not impossible — to forget. That's why every business operating today must have robust strategies for prioritizing customer service and a customer-centric culture. Without satisfied customers, no business can expect to survive, and providing a service is why those businesses are started in the first place.Businesses that prioritize the needs and desires of their customers and center their happiness can expect better engagement, loyalty, reviews and overall success. According to studies, 73% of consumers say a good customer experience is the key to influencing brand loyalty.



Here are some actionable steps businesses can take to build an ironclad customer-centric culture and create loyal fans of their brand.Related: How to Cultivate a Customer-Centric Approach to Brand Building


It's a marathon, not a sprintBuilding and fostering a culture within a business is often a slow process because its leaders have a wealth of factors to consider. For instance, the branding must resonate with its target audience, the brand's message has to be on point, and everything must sync with the business's overall values.It can take months — even years — to finally get it right and ensure all of these aspects align by finding the correct language, copy, look and feel to capture customers' attention and make them want to do repeat business with the brand. Entrepreneurs must remember that, when building their business, patience is a virtue. Creating a customer-centric culture will not happen overnight.That being said, businesses should prioritize customer service from the moment their venture evolves from a concept to an operating brand. If customer service is woven into the brand's culture from the start, it will eventually become second nature to every stakeholder, including its customers.A commitment from leadershipAn organization's leadership must set a good example by prioritizing customer service by embodying the values of customer-centricity in their actions and decisions. A commitment to meeting customers' needs should be threaded through all aspects of their leadership.


Additionally, the leaders' vision regarding customer service needs to be properly communicated to the rest of the organization. All employees, on every level, should be aware of how the company prioritizes its customers and make this an integral part of their daily approach to their roles.At the same time, employees should be given enough autonomy to make decisions that allow them to provide outstanding customer service and a customer-centric culture overall. Employees who go above and beyond in this area should be recognized and rewarded.Related: 4 Ways to Provide Excellent Customer Service Ongoing trainingTo make customer-centricity part of the organization's culture, employee onboarding and training need to have a customer-centric focus. Employees should receive in-depth training on customer service approaches that meet the goals and values of the organization.


Employee feedback should also be considered, especially feedback from employees working directly with customers day in and day out. If leaders have set clear expectations for their employees, ongoing training should simply be a refresher on the values and goals of the organization.Listening to customersA significant component of providing exceptional customer service is listening to what customers want and acting on their requests. Businesses should implement systems for collecting customer feedback through surveys or requesting reviews.Customer feedback should be regularly analyzed to determine whether the company is meeting the needs of its target market or if it may be falling short in certain areas. Businesses should also remain transparent with customers regarding changes, mistakes or misfires by keeping the lines of communication open. Doing so will allow customers to feel like their input and feedback make a genuine difference, and companies will feel like they are receiving valuable feedback from their customers.Adapting, pivoting and continuously improvingA part of any successful customer service strategy is to be ready to adapt to customers' changing needs and the ability to pivot to meet those needs. If a business has remained customer-centric, it already understands its customer's needs, preferences and pain points. Through collecting and analyzing customer feedback, brands should be able to identify if those needs, preferences or pain points are changing and preemptively work to meet the new needs.


Businesses that are as flexible and agile as possible in responding to changing customer desires and trends will ultimately be the most successful.Related: Why You Need to Learn to AdaptFostering a customer-centric culture is no longer a mere option. It is a necessity in today's ultra-competitive landscape.The good news is that there are various strategies that businesses can employ to make sure their customers feel listened to, engaged with and taken care of. From leadership commitment to employee empowerment to listening to customer feedback and embracing metrics and analytics, each approach plays a crucial role in creating an environment that allows customers to feel valued and where their needs are consistently met.

60,I Attended an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class and Learned How Steve Jobs Became a Better Leader in 10 Minutes,"Mar 8, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/heres-how-steve-jobs-became-a-better-leader-in-10-minutes/470841,"
Hitendra Wadhwa, professor of practice at Columbia Business School and founder of Mentora Institute, teaches the university's most popular class on personal leadership and success — two topics that most business students are eager to learn more about.That much was clear on the rainy January day when I sat in on the afternoon session of Wadhwa's course; despite the dreary weather, the energy was palpable, with every seat taken and some attendees even standing in the back.Wadhwa wrote the literal book on looking inward to find outward success. In Inner Mastery, Outer Impact: How Your Five Core Energies Hold the Key to Success, Wadhwa reveals how activating purpose, wisdom, growth, love and self-realization can help people make a real mark on the world.

During the session I attended, Wadhwa relayed a compelling story about Steve Jobs that captures those core energies in action — and shows that the best leaders are willing to pivot, even when it's difficult.""Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.""The story starts in 2001, just before Apple was set to open its first retail store. Ron Johnson, the company's senior vice president of retail from 2000 to 2011, was riding to a weekly planning meeting with Jobs when he shared his concerns about the proposed layout of the new store.Like most retail outlets, Apple planned to organize its store by product. But Johnson saw an opportunity to design it according to activity, like making movies or listening to music, and lean into the innovation that had already helped Jobs' brainchild become a category of one.


But Jobs wasn't having it: The store's opening was fast approaching, and he didn't think there was time for a complete overhaul. Johnson and Jobs sat with the tension of that disagreement as they rode the rest of the way to the meeting.Related: As Steve Jobs Once Said, 'People With Passion Can Change The World'Then, about 10 minutes later, the pair walked into the meeting, and Jobs surprised Johnson by telling the team that Johnson believed the store's design was completely misguided — and that he agreed. Jobs said he was going to step aside while they all worked together to figure out the best way forward.By telling the story about Johnson and Jobs, Wadhwa makes an invaluable point: The kind of leader someone is in one moment doesn't have to dictate the kind of leader they'll be in the next. A willingness to change your mind and think outside of the box, even when it means additional challenges in the short term, isn't a weakness — it's a strength.

61,Having Time Management Problems? Then You Must Do One Thing to Avoid These 3 Consequences,"Mar 8, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/having-time-management-problems-try-this-weekly-habit/469749,"
Nearly everyone wishes they had more time. One of the biggest challenges facing most of my clients is finding enough time to ""do it all."" We have more time-saving tools and resources at our fingertips than ever before. Many of them come in the form of electronic devices that exist to serve us. Yet, most of us report having less time than ever before.Ultimately, time management is just self-management. Those of us who do it well experience much higher levels of satisfaction and success in every area of our lives. My advice? Carve out 1-2 hours early in the week to strategize and plan your time and calendar. Many of us don't make time to do this (because we feel we can't), but that's a mistake. Here's what happens if you don't do this every week.Related: 5 Reasons Why You Need to Learn Time Management for Your Business



1. You'll never connect to your wildest goals and your core valuesWhen you don't regularly make time to check in with yourself, you rob yourself of opportunities to identify what you're passionate about, where your talents lie and what you were put on this earth to do. You'll start to forget your ""why."" The things that must be done today will always feel more urgent than the things you'd like to do tomorrow — but the latter is often far more important.Without alone time to focus on the future, it's incredibly easy to get sucked into the day-to-day minutiae or whatever deadline your boss gave you that's fast approaching. Without intentionally pulling yourself out of the daily grind, you'll never develop a true plan for where you want to end up in five or 10 years and what you stand for. Without that, it's nearly impossible to take the right actions this week to manifest your future self.


If you have an idea of what you'd like to be remembered for, it's imperative that you spend time now crafting that specific vision and how you plan to make it happen. It won't happen on its own. This is also a chance to ensure you're living in accordance with your core values. Many verbally say things like ""family is the most important thing to me,"" but then don't back those words up with action. If you take time to remind yourself of your most important values on a weekly basis, you'll have an easier time prioritizing and committing to them.2. You won't know who to empower and what to delegateWe all have the same 24 hours in a day. Strategy time doesn't add more hours to your week; it only takes time. It doesn't allow your plate to become any bigger, but it does allow you to decide how you'll remove things from your plate. A weekly strategy session allows you to figure out what can be automated, delegated or eliminated. Ask yourself: Is there a way I can use technology to make this process faster? Is there someone around me who is better suited than me to complete this project or task, and who would also view it as a great growth opportunity? Do I have the right people on my team? How am I helping them become ready to take on more?When you make time to ask questions like these, it's amazing what epiphanies you'll have. Private strategy sessions are a great place to make plans for who you'll ask to do what and why it's the right decision — not just for you, but for them. In my days as a senior leader in financial services, I'd use my strategy time to make careful decisions about which direct reports I'd ask to lead our weekly conference calls and monthly meetings, as well as who I might tap to complete special assignments. Until I made this shift, these were all things I felt I had to do myself. It was incredible how many hours I was able to free up on my calendar once I realized that empowering the talent around me is a key part of great leadership.Related: What Are You Wasting Your Business Time On?


3. Your calendar will fill up with other people's most important priorities instead of your ownWhen you make time to strategize and plan each week, you get to load the things that matter most (to you) onto your calendar before others have the chance. As Stephen Covey said, ""Act or be acted upon. It's easier to say no when you have a greater yes in mind."" It's true. It's much easier to turn down an invite for a meeting or an event when you already have a conflict scheduled on your calendar that feels more important to you. Saying no becomes far less personal.Taking time on Sunday night or Monday morning to map out your week and give your most important priorities a place to live and breathe on your calendar strongly increases the chance that those things will get done. It's amazing how much metaphorical gravel and small rocks will fit onto your calendar (between all the cracks) once you schedule your big rocks first. This allows you to be proactive instead of reactive. If you've already been intentional and deliberate about what you want to get done each week and where you feel your time is best spent, you'll be able to articulate those thoughts more easily in the heat of a moment when someone spontaneously asks you if you can spare time for them.If you already feel that you don't have enough time, I understand that making time to strategize around your biggest priorities, plan for the future, and calendar your week feels nearly impossible. But remember: Time is not found; it's made. Don't be a slave to time. Practicing this discipline does take time, but this practice returns more time back to you, especially in the long run. This process will help you (and everyone around you) become stronger. If you consistently make time for this activity on a weekly basis, you'll eventually find that you're ahead of whatever is coming down the pike and you've got time for all the things that matter most, both professionally and personally.

62,Employee Morale Is More Than Pep Talks and High Fives — Here's How You Can Really Capture the Power of Team Spirit.,"Mar 8, 2024",Lissele Pratt,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/heres-how-you-can-really-capture-the-power-of-team-spirit/469967,"
As the founder of a growing company, I've seen firsthand just how crucial team spirit is. In those early days of building our business, we faced all sorts of challenges. But one particular moment sticks out in my mind. We were up against an extremely tight deadline, and it seemed like every obstacle imaginable was getting in our way. Instead of giving up, though, my brilliant team banded together.That experience really drove home the importance of team spirit for me. It's about more than just getting along — it's about truly believing in each other's abilities and lifting each other up when things get tough. Without that kind of teamwork, I honestly don't think we'd be where we are today.So, how can you ensure that your team, regardless of its size, harnesses the transformative power of team spirit? Let's explore.Related: Life's Too Short to Work With Incompatible People — Follow These 3 Secrets To Building High-Performing TeamsWhat is team spirit in an organization?Team spirit isn't just reserved for sports teams. No, it's just as crucial in business settings. Essentially, it's about fostering unity, trust and a shared purpose among your employees. It's creating an environment where everyone feels valued and supported, where their viewpoints and opinions matter. And, when you have a strong and united team, it leads to a whole host of benefits for your company, including:



Improved communicationIncreased collaborationBetter job satisfactionActive problem-solvingHow to create a good team spirit at your companyBuilding team spirit requires deliberate effort and nurturing. When the bonds among your team members are weak, it's time to roll up your sleeves and get to work on strengthening them. Here are some key steps to fostering team spirit within an organization:Encourage collaboration and teamworkThink of your team as a well-oiled machine — each person has their own role and responsibilities, but together, they're unstoppable. To foster collaboration, consider implementing the following actionable strategies:Establish clear team goals: Make sure everyone knows what they're working towards and how their piece fits into the bigger picture. When everyone's on the same page, it's easier to work together towards a common goal.Host brainstorming sessions: Schedule regular brainstorming sessions where everyone can share ideas and challenges and explore new possibilities. No idea is too big or too small and you should encourage everyone to contribute their thoughts.Invest in team-building activities: Make some time to get to know your team outside of work. Whether it's a team-building workshop, an offsite retreat or just grabbing lunch together, building those personal connections can go a long way.Related: This Four-Part Formula Can Help You Build Great TeamsClear communication is keyYou've probably heard the phrase ""communication is key"" more times than you can count, but let me tell you, there's a reason it's such a timeless mantra. When your team can communicate well with each other, they can better bond with each other. Here's how you can make sure everyone's voice is heard loud and clear:


Create a culture of transparency: Nobody likes feeling left in the dark. Make transparency a top priority by keeping everyone in the loop about important decisions, changes and updates. When everyone knows what's happening, it builds trust and prevents rumors from swirling.Embrace two-way communication: Communication is not just about talking but about listening. Make sure you're not just broadcasting information, but actively listening to what your team has to say. Whether it's through one-on-one check-ins, open-door policies or mentoring. At Capitalixe, we hold monthly mentoring sessions to get to know our team and their dreams and aspirations.Lead by example: As the leader, your actions speak louder than words. Be proactive about sharing information and soliciting feedback, be your team's biggest cheerleaders and be open to new ideas.Recognize your team's winsIt may seem like a simple gesture, but employee recognition goes a long way in boosting morale and keeping everyone motivated. Here's how you can make sure your team feels appreciated and valued for their hard work:Celebrate wins, big and small: Maybe your team has hit a major milestone or landed a new client. Or, maybe an individual is experiencing a personal win like an engagement. Celebrate their success. Host a team lunch, throw a work party or even just give a heartfelt shout-out during a team meeting. Celebrating wins together can do wonders in boosting team spirit.Create a culture of recognition: Make recognition and appreciation a regular part of your team culture. Encourage team members to recognize and celebrate each other's successes through peer-to-peer shoutouts, kudos boards and other recognition programs.Reward achievements: As well as verbal recognition and praise, consider offering actual rewards for team successes. This could be an annual bonus, extra paid time off or other incentives that praise your team for their hard work and dedication. When team members see that their efforts are being rewarded, it motivates them to continue giving their best.Related: Why Acknowledging Your Team Members Is Critical to Your SuccessFinal thoughtsSo there you have it. We've unpacked how team spirit can make or break an organization's performance. From my own journey, I've learned firsthand that the results speak for themselves when the team's spirit is strong.Team spirit isn't just about high-fives and pep talks — it's about creating a vibe where everyone's rowing in the same direction. To get there, it's all about encouraging teamwork and collaboration. You want your team to feel like they're part of something bigger like they're all in the same boat and paddling together towards a common goal. Communication is also key. So keep those lines open and make sure everyone's voice is heard, and don't forget to sprinkle in some recognition and celebration along the way.


So, let's keep the energy high, the communication flowing and the good work rolling. With the right team spirit, there's no limit to what you can achieve together.

      Key Takeaways    



        Every business has a strategy because strategy involves making choices. However, the effectiveness of a strategy lies in whether these choices actively contribute to the business's goals and the delivery of value.
      


        This article outlines seven common but ineffective strategies that businesses may have unintentionally adopted and advice on how to make better choices.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""One of the biggest problems with strategy is that the business doesn't have one."" It's common to read this phrase in articles that aim to identify why a business strategy isn't working.And yet, every business has a strategy because strategy is about choices — and the team makes choices every day. The issue is that the choices they make do not advance the business.Effective teams make deliberate choices so every action the business takes drives toward delivering the value the business exists to deliver.Related: 7 Strategies Businesses Can Use to Be Profitable and SustainableSeven common but ineffective business strategiesWhether you're consciously aware of it or not, you make choices based on something. That something and your choices serve as your strategy. Here are seven common but ineffective strategies you may have inadvertently adopted:



1. You're reactiveWhether it's a new idea, a raging fire or the ping in your inbox, you choose to act based on what hits you at that moment. I've made the mistake of saying this type of team isn't strategic when I meant to say they aren't deliberate. You're likely pedaling at full steam but not going anywhere.2. You do what you want to doYou build what you want to build. The quintessential example is a robotics company that wanted to build X even though all the input they received from their customers told them they needed Y. The company continued to build X because that's what they wanted to build. Now, they don't exist anymore. If you're the only one reaping value, you have a hobby, not a business.3. You do what you've always doneYou know the approach works. You're comfortable doing it. And you definitely don't want the stress of changing it. So you keep on keepin' on. Alas, too many businesses no longer exist because they failed to evolve. You must adapt what you do and how you do it because the world changes all the time.4. You chase the new cool thingEvery day brings new priorities that start with emails like, ""Check out how cool this is. We should do it."" Sometimes, you start a new thing because you enjoy creating. Sometimes, you do it because the new thing is simply more exciting than doing the hard work you actually need to do. Much like a reactive strategy, your team finds it hard to gain any traction or soothe their spinning heads.


5. You spend as little money as possibleYou scrutinize every investment looking for the cheapest option, including what could be done for free. Slowly, sometimes glacially, no one wants to work on your team, and your business loses all the resources required to do, well, anything.6. You go after the moneyYou see a way to get a lot of cash in the near term, so you immediately apply effort in that direction. Never mind what you were doing before. Never mind that you (somehow) want team members to keep doing that stuff, too. If you can put a check in the bank today, you'll worry about tomorrow later. Unfortunately, you may not have a business tomorrow.7. You pursue moreWhen someone asks for your strategy, you answer, ""To be the biggest company in the world!"" You pursue more markets, more users and more followers. When asked why, you say, ""Because we need to be the biggest!"" Your team has a tough time making choices and a high likelihood of running an unprofitable business.Related: 5 Common Growth Strategy Mistakes and How You Can Fix Them


How to make better choicesIt's not that the companies making choices in any of these seven ways don't have a strategy; they don't have a particularly good strategy. They may even operate using a few of these strategies at once, which only compounds the negative effects.New businesses launch every day. We can create products and services faster than ever before. And soon, production will come at pennies on the dollar. The only way to thrive is to focus on delivering meaningful value.Define the value you deliver by engaging the people you serve. Then make choices so everything you do as a business drives toward delivering that value. To succeed, you'll need to assess how your choices work — i.e., how effectively they deliver value — and adjust accordingly.Routinely gather input from the people you serve, your team and the external environment, so you're positioned to evolve your business as value shifts, your team grows and the world changes.


You and your team make choices every day. You choose to hold this meeting, adopt this software or launch this product. You need to make deliberate choices that advance your ability to effectively deliver value. The choices you make — and what you base them on — define your strategy. And like so many things, some strategies work better than others.Related: How to Recover From a Failed Strategy

64,How to Identify and Address Dysfunctional Venture Capital Relationships in the Startup Ecosystem,"Mar 6, 2024","Jena Booher, Ph.D.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-navigate-dysfunctional-founder-investor-relationships/469424,"
The venture capital (VC) world has long been characterized by its tight-knit and somewhat private community. Founders typically maintain a low profile regarding what transpires behind closed doors, largely due to their significant financial reliance on the investor community.Understanding the dynamics within this community can be challenging without direct exposure or day-to-day interactions with investors or founders. Over the past two years, my increased involvement in the VC community has brought to light both commendable individuals and concerning trends that have direct implications for founders.In the realm of venture capital, there are VCs who genuinely support founders, but there are also those who exhibit behaviors that can hinder entrepreneurial success. Despite a shared desire among all stakeholders for optimal business performance, founders and VCs occasionally grapple with misaligned incentives. While investors may have the intellectual intention to support their founders, there exists a challenge in fostering an environment where founders feel comfortable being open about what is or isn't working in the founder-investor relationship.



Drawing from my expertise as a business psychologist, I have observed the financial repercussions of founders becoming sidetracked by managing investor relationships at the expense of their businesses. My aim is to shed light on these observed issues and encourage VCs to reflect on their actions. Projecting emotional or mental health issues onto invested founders not only risks financial returns but also exacerbates challenges for entrepreneurs already facing significant obstacles.Related: 5 Tips for Navigating the Entrepreneur/Investor Relationship


Three prevalent dysfunctional VC archetypes emerge1. The Bully:The Bully archetype within the VC landscape often presents as an investor with an initially charismatic and supportive demeanor. However, this façade quickly transforms after the ink has dried on the contract. These VCs may lack substantial operating experience as CEOs, leading them to impose their subjective views on what it takes to be a successful CEO. Criticism often targets the founder's decisions and sometimes questions their character, suggesting they are ill-suited for the role or negligent in their fiduciary duties.The Bully employs vague strategic advice intentionally, creating ambiguity to make failure more likely. This lack of clarity allows the Bully to seize opportunities to point out the founder's supposed incompetence, negatively impacting the founder's self-esteem and decision-making. The unpredictable nature of interactions with such VCs further contributes to an unhealthy founder-investor dynamic.Bully archetype snapshot:Qualities: Lack of operational experience; emotional volatility; creates ""gotcha"" scenariosImpact: Harmful for founder self-esteem; insecure attachment; relationship between founder and investor leads to lack of trust2. The Daddy:The Daddy archetype is characterized by a patronizing attitude and a hero complex. These investors leverage their initial belief in the founder as a tool for manipulation, reminding the founder of their unwavering support. This dynamic can lead to breaches of professional boundaries, with the investor overstepping by providing unsolicited advice. The fragile ego of the Daddy investor is highlighted, revealing a need for constant validation from founders to maintain their perceived relevance and importance. This emotional reliance distracts founders from their primary responsibilities, creating an imbalanced power dynamic detrimental to business success.


Daddy archetype snapshot:Qualities: insecure; manipulative; breach of professional boundariesImpact: imbalanced power, as the founder may find it challenging to assert independence or make decisions without the constant approval of the Daddy investor.3. The Neurotic:


The Neurotic archetype enters the VC community, often through familial or friend connections, with a potential lack of resilience for the roller-coaster ride of startup life. While these VCs may possess impressive intelligence and academic credentials, they struggle to endure the inevitable ups and downs of the startup ecosystem. Their inability to weather challenges prompts excessive involvement in their portfolio companies, seeking regular updates on performance. This behavior is driven by a lack of thick skin for the job, leading them to emotionally lean on founders during tough times.While their intentions may be well-founded, the Neurotic archetype needs to cultivate greater resilience. Instead of emotionally dumping on their founders, seeking external support for managing anxiety over their portfolio's performance is crucial for maintaining a healthy investor-founder relationship.Neurotic archetype snapshot:Qualities: excessive involvement; need for constant reassurance; lacking resilienceImpact: poor emotional boundaries; looking for the founder to relieve their distress, which leads to founders becoming distracted from core business problemsRelated: The Relationship Between Founders and Investors Transcends Beyond CapitalCharting a course forwardThe venture capital industry operates under immense pressure, leading to stress, anxiety and a fear of failure. Nonetheless, founders can't bear the brunt of VC stress, and if you identify with one of these archetypes, it's essential to address the core issues.If you find yourself exhibiting Bully or Daddy behaviors and feel the need to assert power over others, it's likely that someone wielded power over you in your past. That is a wound that has gone unaddressed and unhealed. Without judgment, find a way to explore that core wound with a trusted therapist to diminish emotional projections.


If you're displaying behaviors exhibited by the Neurotic archetype, you should be aware of your challenges, surround yourself with supportive individuals who can model emotional regulation, and utilize tools for anxiety management like mindfulness, therapy and nervous system regulation.If you're a founder facing a contentious relationship with investors, especially if it verges on an abusive situation, my advice to you is to stop blaming yourself for not ""figuring this out"" sooner. In my experience, founders blame themselves first and then internalize the stress and shame. Also, look to establish boundaries, keep business discussions within scheduled meetings, and consider bringing others to meetings for support. People can show up better when there are more folks in the room.Investors and founders alike should schedule periodic sessions to openly discuss the dynamics of their relationship. Just like any interpersonal connection, it's crucial to approach these conversations with care, ensuring they are structured to focus on the health and effectiveness of the overall partnership.Navigating the founder-investor relationship is tough, but it's crucial to remember shared interests. Choose differently to avoid making the startup journey harder than necessary. In the startup world, where the odds are always against you, how you choose to turn those odds around matters.

65,Many Confident Leaders Resist Change — And These 5 Emotional Wounds Could Be to Blame,"Mar 6, 2024",Kelly L. Campbell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-reasons-why-leaders-resist-change/469901,"
Confidence can be an effective leadership trait, and assertive self-confidence requires getting ahead of limiting beliefs to achieve what we desire or deem successful. But what if a leader's confidence is actually just one of the masks that help them assimilate in groups where power dynamics call for boldness and strength?How could that mask of confidence work against them and hinder the success of an organization when a leader is afraid of change?Five Soul WoundsRejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal and injustice are the five soul wounds often passed down to us by our parents, following us from childhood into adulthood. While first identified by an American physician and psychiatrist, a Canadian therapist wrote about them in her book and brought the research to the masses. The transference of wounds from generation to generation is actively discussed on social media, podcasts, and in other books like Heal to Lead.



Let's break down each of the five primary wounds as they apply to low-conscious or unhealed leadership.1. RejectionLeaders with the wound of rejection might withdraw from situations or discreetly avoid them altogether for fear of being rejected. Their ability to work anchors them in reality, which starkly contrasts the many ways in which they prefer to escape. Their people-pleasing tendencies are a means of self-protection, which can manifest as perfectionism and not asking for help in leadership roles.


Related: Rejection Is Part of Entrepreneurship. Here's How to Handle It.2. AbandonmentLeaders with the wound of abandonment project a type of sadness that is almost indefinable, as their deepest fear is loneliness. To combat the inner strife that causes mood changes, they can seem dependent on others, seeking advice and support to keep themselves in center focus. Compliments are a natural reward for overgiving, and if those are in short supply, leaders with wounds of abandonment may create drama to receive attention differently.3. HumiliationDeep feelings of shame accompany the wound of humiliation. For wounded leaders, this might show up as humility and taking care of others. They keep themselves busy because they fear freedom — associated with the absence of limits and engaging in too much fun, pleasure, or the like. These wounded leaders often tend toward self-deprecation to make others laugh; in this way, they control who humiliates them and to what extent.Related: Bullies At Work: Stamping Out Abuse In The Workplace


4. Betrayal (linked to Abandonment)The wound of betrayal shows up most often in people-controlling leaders because control is the mask they wear to avoid separation and denial. In demonstrating a lack of trust in others, these wounded leaders disempower those around them by setting standards impossibly high to ensure failure. Though unconscious, these authoritarian leaders are out to prove their perceived value by stepping on, manipulating, and mandating that others do things precisely how they would.5. Injustice (pairs with Rejection)Leaders with an injustice wound also tend toward people-pleasing, but the difference is in pretending that nothing impacts them. They refuse help and would rather run themselves into the ground than admit that they're tired or angry. In not wanting to be treated unfairly, they can project that onto others without realizing it. Everything must be justified, even if it means exaggerating or outright lying.Related: Why Trauma Integration Will Give You a Competitive Advantage in LeadershipResistance to changeSo, how do these soul wounds correlate to a strong resistance to change? Wounded leaders often employ unconscious survival strategies to ensure their worst fears don't materialize. In the face of uncertainty of any kind — where their safety could potentially be at risk — low-conscious leaders dig their heels into what will protect their ego, even if the change at hand would benefit their organization.


Change can be stressful and even terrifying for most people, but add the layer of a soul wound, and it can feel like life or death — because that's how the ego perceives it.When leaders are unaware of these unhealed aspects of themselves, those around them can suffer unnecessarily when on the receiving end of unhealed projections, from an organizational perspective, that can lead to higher employee attrition, a negative impact on morale and overall culture, and a plateau in revenue and innovation.When they feel resistance to change arises, the best thing leaders can do is to take radical responsibility for their own trauma integration. They can start with small steps that develop self-awareness, like listening to podcast episodes or reading books on the topic, or perhaps talking with a trauma-informed therapist or coach.If they won't do it for themselves (at first), they can think about how many others will benefit from their inner work. From family members to business partners, employees, clients, and community members — when leaders do the work, they become more adaptable to change. As a result of their improved abilities to self-regulate, embrace curiosity, and make decisions for the good of the whole, their organizations grow more flexible to meet uncertainty with ease.

66,Reputation Management Starts Before Your First Bad Review — Here's How to Develop a Proactive Crisis Plan,"Mar 5, 2024",Danielle Sabrina,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-prepare-for-a-reputation-crisis-before-it-hits/470366,"
In an era where a single tweet can go viral and a review can reach millions overnight, the reputation of a business has never been more vulnerable — or more valuable. In the words of Warren Buffett, ""It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently."" And with the ability to share personal experiences at the touch of a finger, those words have never been more true.This new age of connectivity has leveled the playing field for consumer opinions, empowering them to share their experiences far and wide. While this can bolster a business's reputation through positive feedback, it also means that a single negative review can have a disproportionate impact.Traditionally, reputation management has been reactive, a strategy employed to mitigate damage after the fact. However, in a world where information spreads at the speed of light, the most successful businesses are those that adopt a proactive stance on reputation management. This approach mitigates risks and builds a resilient brand capable of withstanding the inevitable challenges of the digital age.

This is not merely about having a profile but actively engaging with your audience through regular updates, sharing valuable content and participating in industry conversations. The goal is to saturate the digital landscape with positive content about your business, making it the first thing potential customers see.


There's an old saying that you never get a second chance to make a first impression. In the world of online business, this adage rings particularly true. Early positive reviews and glowing testimonials can set a tone of trust and quality around your brand, influencing potential customers' perceptions and decisions from the get-go.Strategic advantages of early reputation managementSEO benefits: Search engines love fresh, positive content. By populating the internet with favorable articles, blog posts and customer reviews, businesses can enhance their visibility. A robust SEO strategy ensures that when potential customers search for your business, they are met with a chorus of positivity, drowning out any lone voices of dissent that may arise later.Building trust and credibility: Trust is the currency of the digital marketplace. Establishing a solid reputation early on fosters credibility with potential customers, making them more likely to choose your business over a competitor with a less established online presence. This trust, once built, becomes a shield against the impact of future negative reviews.Feedback and improvement loop: Engaging with customers for feedback before any negativity arises creates a culture of continuous improvement. By soliciting, listening to and acting on customer feedback, businesses can often preempt negative reviews, turning potentially dissatisfied customers into brand advocates.

It involves detailed planning, team preparation and the development of protocols that allow a business to respond swiftly and effectively to potential reputation threats. Consider the following when preparing your proactive crisis plan:Establish a crisis monitoring team: Designate a team responsible for continuously monitoring online channels, news media and social platforms for any signs of emerging crises that could impact your brand.Develop early warning systems: Utilize social listening tools and set up specific alerts for increased volumes of mentions, sudden spikes in website traffic from forums or news sites, or patterns of negative sentiment that could indicate a brewing crisis.


Communication strategy: Create a comprehensive communication strategy that outlines how to communicate internally to employees and externally to customers, stakeholders and the media. This strategy should include key messages, tone of voice guidelines and the preferred channels for communication.Scenario planning: Prepare for various crisis scenarios by developing specific action plans. Scenarios might include data breaches, negative press, product recalls or customer service failures. For each scenario, outline the steps to mitigate the issue, including who needs to be informed, how to respond publicly and measures to resolve the situation.Rapid response framework: Develop a framework for rapid response that enables your team to act quickly once a crisis is identified. This includes templates for press releases, social media posts and FAQs that can be quickly adapted to the specific situation.Approval processes: Streamline approval processes for crisis communication to ensure that responses are timely but still maintain accuracy and adhere to your brand's values.


Identify key stakeholders: Map out your key stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, investors and regulators. Understand their concerns and expectations during a crisis.Tailored communication plans: Develop tailored communication plans for each stakeholder group, addressing their specific needs and concerns.

67,3 Ways Women Empower Other Women (and 3 Ways They Don't),"Mar 5, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-ways-women-empower-and-discourage-other-women/470234,"
Women in leadership are in a position to lift each other and make room for whoever wants a seat at the table or who wants to create their own table. Sadly, that's not always the case.Since women already combat stereotypes of being ""too outspoken,"" ""too bossy,"" or just too much in general, it would make sense for women to support their female colleagues and peers rather than battling them.Of course, there are several ways women can empower other women, but there are also several instances when women do not. It's important to be aware of what it means to be a true leader and ally and identify and avoid non-supportive behaviors.



Related: 8 Ways To Empower the Next Generation of Women Leaders1. Be a mentorOne of the best ways to empower other women is to become a mentor. Females entering the workplace or rising in the ranks for the first time are looking for leaders to point them in the right direction as they navigate the terrain.


Be the example by sharing your successes and stories of overcoming failures. Schedule time to meet for a coffee chat, host a free class and write reference letters for those who may be looking to you for guidance.Being a mentor may also involve inviting other women into your network. Being a connection can give someone the confidence they may need to introduce themselves and share what talents and ideas they have to offer to a group.2. Amplify female voicesA simple way to lift up other women is to amplify their voices. When someone shares their work online, commenting on it or re-posting it for others to view allows them a greater reach. Also, providing welcoming spaces where women can feel comfortable presenting ideas and participating in discussions will build community.There is no limit to how women can share the stories and work of others in positive ways. Whether it's promoting their offerings, supporting colleagues in meetings, or giving them shoutouts via social media, find ways to spotlight those you admire and pass the mic, so to speak, to those voices who often are shut out.

Participate in a collaboration or a showcase, giving women in business an opportunity to connect with others. Or, consider investing in a woman-owned business that aligns with your values. Showing support often goes beyond simply giving money, and even the smallest gesture can make the biggest difference.Related: 6 Ways to Better Support Women in the WorkplaceExamples of disempowering behaviorThese are a few of the many ways women can empower other women and motivate them to grow in their careers and personal lives. However, on the flip side are women unwilling to offer support.


They may view others as competition or embody the cattiness stereotype; whatever the reason, be on the lookout for such behaviors and remove yourself from any business or personal relationships that can bring you down.Here are examples of how women can disempower other women, which, unfortunately, may feel too all familiar to some.1. A woman will tell another woman they need to ""wait their turn""As society evolves and we make more room for those without the same opportunities, it's up to us to celebrate wins for all. However, some women believe that because they had extra challenges and setbacks, anyone who tries to do the same must do the same.Telling someone they must pay their dues or wait their turn is not only disempowering; it's insulting for those who have worked tirelessly to make the path easier for others. For those who want women to face the same struggles they did, actions may be motivated by insecurity and resentment from their own experiences and have less to do with other women at all.


Related: How to Deal With Negative People Who Just Aren't Going Away2. A woman will tell another woman they look tired in a mean-spirited wayPassive aggressiveness in the professional world is more common than one might think. The workplace can be rife with backhanded compliments to undermine a woman's self-esteem and belittle their presence. Casually telling another woman they ""look tired"" or providing any other commentary on their looks is condescending.Even if a person feels drained by their day, hearing those words does nothing to encourage them to keep going. Why not let a person know how great they're doing, acknowledge something helpful they've done, or, when in doubt, say nothing? Don't be a mean girl!3. A woman will talk negatively about another woman to othersGossip is contagious but can easily be avoided by simply redirecting a conversation or leaving a discussion altogether. Consider your words carefully and decide if you would say the same if the person were standing in front of you.


When you participate in talking negatively about another woman with someone else, it automatically makes you untrustworthy. Don't buy into the hype of false camaraderie by taking jabs at someone behind their back. If there are specific grievances, it's best to create opportunities to clear up misunderstandings and collaborate on solutions for the future rather than complaining.

68,3 Ways I've Ensured Small Victories As A Business Owner,"Mar 5, 2024",Alykhan Jetha,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-ways-to-ensure-small-victories-as-a-business-owner/469980,"
Entrepreneurs and small business owners: when was the last time you formally acknowledged your progress on building your business?If your response is ""rarely"" or ""never,"" I understand. I've been there, too.In the earliest days of my company, Marketcircle, my team and I were laser-focused on growth. Like many of us, I was programmed to believe that only big achievements (new product/service launches, big rounds of VC funding, mentions in a major media outlet) are worth the noise and celebrations.



In many ways, the entrepreneurial journey has become synonymous with ""BHAG's"" (Big Hairy Audacious Goals). Many of us channel the entirety of our focus on pushing harder towards achieving the biggest of outcomes. Of course, I believe in goal setting and purposeful growth. In my industry (software as a service/technology), ""more"" has long been an unofficial mantra.Yet before long, the continuous grind and the hustle towards big achievements becomes draining, making it challenging to stay motivated, impacting our lives.


It may have taken me a while (two decades as a small business owner), but I've learned that there is so much power in acknowledging the little wins along the way. It's not just impactful from a positive psychology perspective; celebrating milestones can have a tangible, game-changing effect on your business.Related: 5 Things Not to Do When You're Running a Small Business1. Small goals for the winWhile it is great to have big goals and dreams, the path to getting there is to start small.I started to break down my goals into smaller, achievable tasks, which helped me manage my energy and stay happy along the way. For instance, instead of aiming to finish a programming project in one go, I used to break it down into a few lines of code daily, and when I finished those things, I celebrated internally.


Incremental goals are broken down into a series of repeatable, meaningful micro tasks that suddenly become more motivating. Procrastination is reduced as a large project's ""daunting"" element is reduced. Aside from becoming more realistic and manageable, an incrementalist approach allowed me more flexibility: if something went wrong, I could pivot and adjust in real time without feeling overwhelmed. I could identify bottlenecks earlier in a project rather than at the end, allowing me to address the issues quickly.Having a victory every day and going to bed feeling accomplished is a powerful motivation to begin work the next day.1. Battling burnout75% of entrepreneurs experience occasional or frequent burnout. Entrepreneurial burnout can have dangerous compounding effects on all facets of our health and lives. Our bodies suffer, our executive functions shut down, and our relationships take a hit. The risk of burnout is real - and celebrating small victories can help.During my early years as an entrepreneur, I was permanently in ""nose-to-the-grindstone"" mode, managing every aspect of the business and juggling numerous tasks, contexts, and responsibilities simultaneously. Switching ""hats"" or identities (leader, manager, salesperson, programmer) was a complex process that took a toll. I was singularly focused on achieving the more significant milestones. In the process, I was burning out.


It was initially uncomfortable, almost as if our minds need to be rewired to think about celebration and iterative progress. Yet, in time, I began to reflect on and celebrate progress over outcomes. The impact was noticeable on my health, my productivity, and the business' growth.Celebration and acknowledgment positively impact our physiology, and this doesn't have to be expressed outwardly; you can keep this internal if you are so inclined. The reward circuitry in the brain gets activated. Chemicals responsible for feelings of excitement, gratitude and pride flood our brains, giving us motivation and optimism for the next achievement, no matter how small.Related: Time Management Hacks That Very Successful People Practice Daily2. Habits and consistencyIt's no secret that habits are complex to break but even more challenging to form, yet once a habit is part of a daily routine, it has to stick power.


I'm a technologist, so I turned to digital tools to cement the habit of small wins into my life. None existed then, so I used my product, Daylite, an award-winning CRM, sales management, and project management tool for Mac. Daylite's task management feature helped me list tasks for each day and enjoy the experience of crossing them off the list when they were completed. I took a moment to acknowledge the win, with each act of ""crossing off"" signaling that I had made progress.I also set short recurring meetings with myself at the end of each week - to review my progress from the week that was wrapping up. Having the reflection in my calendar as a tactical priority that went untouched by other meetings served as a forcing function to build the habit of acknowledging small growth.Alternatively, you can use pen & paper and cross off items on your list. It feels great!Journaling, 15 minutes of mindful reflection, a weekly call with a mentor to review progress - whatever practice you choose, make it consistent. Before long, it'll become a habit ingrained in your daily life, and the practice of celebration will become simply part of who you are as an entrepreneur. Personal and professional growth will come, and those around you will feel it.

69,How Tech Companies Can Harness the Power of Non-Verbal Communication for Enhanced Efficiency,"Mar 1, 2024",Greg Davis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-harness-the-power-of-soft-communication-for-enhanced/470360,"
The importance of soft communication and operational efficiency cannot be overstated in today's fast-paced business world. These concepts, often overlooked, play a crucial role in the success and fluidity of a company's operations. Similar to the bustling environment of a restaurant, where seamless non-verbal communication ensures efficiency, the same principles apply to other business settings, including tech companies.Soft communication involves the subtle, often non-verbal interactions that occur in a workplace. These cues, whether a nod, a glance or an unspoken understanding, contribute significantly to the smooth operation of a team. They help convey messages quickly and efficiently, reducing the need for constant verbal directives. In environments where time is of the essence, these forms of communication are invaluable.Recognizing and understanding these non-verbal signals requires high team cohesion and awareness. Employees who are tuned into each other's habits and preferences can anticipate needs and actions without explicit instructions. This intuitive understanding enhances workflow and minimizes disruptions, leading to a more streamlined work process.



Related: 7 Communication Skills Every Entrepreneur Must MasterThe role of non-verbal cues in team dynamicsNon-verbal cues play a pivotal role in facilitating smooth communication in a team setting. These cues, ranging from facial expressions to body language, help convey emotions and intentions, often more effectively than words. They serve as an undercurrent of communication, complementing verbal interactions and providing additional context. Being attuned to these cues in a business setting can prevent misunderstandings and foster clearer communication.


Building trust and reliability in a business settingTrust and reliability are foundational elements of effective team dynamics. Just like in a restaurant where staff trust that someone will fill the ice bin without being told, in business, this level of trust ensures that each team member can focus on their tasks without worry. Knowing that everyone will handle their responsibilities effectively creates a sense of security and confidence within the team. This trust is not built overnight but develops over time through consistent and reliable actions.Reliability, a key component of this trust, is demonstrated when team members consistently meet their commitments. It's about knowing that colleagues will deliver on their promises, which reduces the need for micromanagement and fosters independence. This reliability strengthens the team's cohesion and enables a more efficient division of labor.Learning from the operational dynamics of a restaurantThe operational dynamics of a restaurant offer valuable insights into efficient team management. In a restaurant, staff members often work in close quarters under time pressure, requiring high coordination and unspoken communication. This environment demands quick decision-making and an implicit understanding of each other's roles and responsibilities. Observing these dynamics provides lessons in operational efficiency that can be applied to various business settings.Restaurants function smoothly when there is a clear division of labor, with each staff member understanding their role and the roles of others. This understanding enables them to anticipate needs and respond accordingly without explicit direction. Such a system reduces confusion, increases speed and ensures a high level of service.


The principles of operational efficiency in restaurants can be effectively translated into the tech industry. Clear and efficient communication is vital in tech companies, where projects often involve multiple team members. Adopting the restaurant model of implicit communication and role clarity can streamline processes and reduce time wasted on unnecessary discussions. This can be especially beneficial in fast-paced tech environments where quick adaptability and responsiveness are crucial.Just as chefs and waitstaff coordinate seamlessly to deliver meals promptly, tech teams can synchronize their efforts for timely project completion. This requires a clear understanding of each team member's strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to support each other effectively.Related: One Negotiation Expert Shares the 4 Body Language Cues Every Entrepreneur Should RecognizeActionable strategies to foster an efficient workplaceTo cultivate an environment of efficient soft communication, it's essential to establish clear roles within the team. This clarity allows team members to understand their responsibilities and how they fit into the larger picture. It also helps set expectations and reduce ambiguities, which is crucial for smooth operations. Clear role definition is the first step towards building an environment where non-verbal communication can flourish.


Fostering open communication is another vital strategy. Encouraging team members to share their thoughts and ideas openly can build trust and mutual understanding. Regular team meetings and feedback sessions can facilitate this. In addition, creating a culture where team members feel confident that their colleagues will deliver on their commitments is essential.Cultivating a culture of unspoken understanding and commitmentDeveloping a culture of unspoken understanding and commitment requires a consistent and deliberate effort. It starts with leadership setting an example in non-verbal communication and trust-building. Leaders should demonstrate the behavior they wish to see, such as reliability, attentiveness to non-verbal cues and a commitment to the team's goals. This sets a precedent for the rest of the team to follow.In the ever-evolving landscape of modern business, the significance of soft communication has never been more pronounced. As teams become more diverse and projects more complex, the ability to communicate efficiently, both verbally and non-verbally, becomes increasingly important. Soft communication facilitates quicker decision-making, reduces misunderstandings and builds a cohesive team dynamic. These qualities are essential for businesses aiming to stay agile and competitive in today's fast-paced environment.Related: Improve Your Company's Efficiency with These 5 Strategies

70,Women Are More Likely to Be Laid Off Than Promoted in Tech — Here's How We Can Change the Status Quo,"Mar 1, 2024",Jacqueline White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-ways-to-reverse-techs-gender-disparity-in-leadership/469543,"
Nearly every industry suffers from a gender gap in terms of leadership — including technology. In fact, women lag so far behind men that they hold less than 24% of all tech leadership positions across industries, according to 2023 data from WomenTech Network.The underrepresentation of women in the tech industry was exacerbated by the tech layoffs in 2022, further hindering their progress. According to additional research by WomenTech Network, 69% of those laid off were women. While this does not imply that the decisions were made due to intentional gender stereotypes, societal norms and implicit biases shape everything from hiring to promotions. Chances are that separations fell within these same lines.When women experience disproportionately higher layoff rates, the direct result will be a smaller pool of experienced women candidates for leadership positions. Not only is this trend a clear problem on its own, but it could also have significant long-term consequences if it persists. The industry already grapples with the glass-ceiling effect; higher layoff rates only reinforce that barrier. As a result, this could potentially discourage more women from entering and remaining in tech careers, worsening the existing underrepresentation of women in the field.



As the number of executive women in tech diminishes, there will also be fewer women role models and mentors available to guide and support younger women in their careers. Certainly not the best means of empowering women in tech, especially when you consider that 60% of managers who are men admit to being uncomfortable mentoring women, according to a study from LeanIn.Org. Additionally, job security is a significant factor to consider. Layoffs within the tech industry can create a sense of instability, potentially dissuading women from pursuing long-term careers in the field.Related: How to Close Your Wage Gap and Open Equity at Work


How to support women in techEmpowering women in tech can certainly help address myriad challenges, but it is still important to be proactive with your efforts. Otherwise, the underrepresentation will persist, just maybe not to the degree that the industry is currently experiencing. The question then remains: What should we do to solve these issues? The following are good places to start:1. Institute equal opportunity policiesI began my career in the late '90s when men primarily dominated the tech industry, so I knew I would have to work twice as hard to be considered in the same category as my male colleagues. While more laws are now in place to protect employees from being treated differently or less favorably due to their sex and gender, additional work can be done internally to minimize implicit biases. Something as simple as an audit of your HR policies around hiring and promotions can shed great light on whether these decisions are truly merit-based or not. Also, you should review workforce reductions to determine if the criteria used are objective and free from discrimination.2. Establish a formal mentorship programEveryone can benefit from a champion in the workplace, and a mentorship program can serve as the perfect avenue to narrow the gender gap. After all, a mentor not only aids in someone's professional development but also offers insights into how to navigate difficult situations and business relationships. This person also provides an opportunity to connect with others in the industry to build a stronger network.NetSuite certainly got the memo on this. The enterprise software company matches high-performing women with colleagues who work at least two levels above and in different departments than their mentees. The program seems to be successful based on the data, achieving a score of 3.7 out of 5.


Related: How Women Are Innovating and Shaping the Tech Landscape — and How Men Can Support Them3. Create a women-only leadership development programIf you want more executive women in tech, invest in their development. Create a leadership development program tailored specifically for women, aimed at preparing them for leadership positions. This program can align closely with your existing leadership programs, which should include an educational track for men in the organization as well.Necessary elements include communication, coaching, accountability, influence, negotiation and change management. The only real difference will be in the program's participants, and evidence suggests that the move will lead to higher promotion rates among women employees. It can also bolster retention and even attract more women tech talent to your company.Related: 3 Ways Leaders Can Support Women Who Want to Enter a Career in Tech 


4. Look at your organizational cultureSometimes, the answer to how to get more women in tech comes down to organizational culture. The lack of diversity in leadership can perpetuate the status quo and even discourage the necessary changes to promote equality. Ask yourself, ""Does my organizational culture foster inclusivity and diversity? Does it value the contributions of women in all aspects of operations?"" If not, look for ways to improve.Apple, for instance, has more than 25,000 of its employees participating in groups like Women@Apple, Black@Apple, Accessbility@Apple and more. There are even faith-based groups at the company. Could they do better? Probably, but the company scored 73 among diverse employees, putting it in the top 20% of U.S. companies with 10,000 or more employees.Getting more women in tech leadership positions is not just a matter of equity or social responsibility; it is a strategic imperative that directly impacts your bottom line. The data is clear: Diverse leadership teams drive innovation, improve decision-making, attract top talent and enhance corporate reputation. When combined, these ultimately lead to greater competitiveness and success in the dynamic tech industry.

After a few years of economic uncertainty, 2024 is shaping up to be a promising time for startups to get off the ground. While software may see a particular resurgence due to anticipated market growth, every industry has opportunities for fresh concepts and innovative companies. That's beneficial for founders entering the tech industry. However, technology isn't the only area ripe for new companies, ideas and concepts.Take ecommerce, for instance. According to Insider Intelligence, it's a sector expected to expand as sales soar toward $1.72 trillion within three years. Renewable energy is another promising sector to explore, with the World Economic Forum noting that green solutions are expected to account for 35% of global energy by next year.In other words, it's a good time to consider launching a business or product. However, resilience remains crucial for all entrepreneurs venturing into the startup space. Even in the best of times, launching companies can be risky. Flexibility and adaptability are essential to success, no matter the economic climate.



How can you ensure that you are prepared to pivot at a moment's notice? Implement a few proven strategies to keep your growing business agile.Related: The Basics of Building a Budget for Your Business


1. Design your annual budget allocations to account for uncertaintyWhat are some reasons why startups fail? According to CBInsights, 38% of failed startups cited a lack of cash as the primary issue. That's nearly 4 in 10, which is a compelling reason to ensure that you dedicate significant time to adjusting your funding allocations.First off, be sure to set aside emergency dollars. Having some money in reserve could save you from problems if a vendor suddenly increases prices or you can't meet payroll. This is beyond just being efficient with your cash flow; it's setting aside a slush fund, so you're not struggling to cover basic bills.Next, invest in your profit centers. These will naturally include your sales, marketing and support departments. Many founders have made the mistake of trying to reduce their sales and advertising budgets. That's a good way to lose a lot of leads and make it difficult for you to generate revenue for your business. You can (and should) still operate with a lean, grassroots mindset. Don't be frugal in small matters and wasteful in larger ones, especially if you've allocated those emergency funds.2. Stay alert for opportunities to broaden your influenceYou need a solid business plan to establish a supportive and visionary framework for your company. That's great, but remain open to opportunities that might not align with your current plan. You don't have to seize every opportunity to grow, but stay alert to possibilities.


For example, let's say you have developed a product, and your business is in the U.S. However, your sales team brings you some interesting findings: They are receiving a lot of interest from buyers in foreign markets. This might indicate that you are focusing on increasing international sales. In 2021, INS Global discovered that 42% of companies found moving outside domestic markets a popular way to diversify.The point? Staying updated on trends is essential for making real-time decisions. Nothing should be set in stone, from marketing to reaching a new demographic to changing your internal processes. If you are too rigid, you will not experience the benefits that come from being able to adapt.Related: 10 Tech Trends That Will Shape the Next Decade3. Differentiate your company through exceptional customer serviceEvery company has competitors. Some of your competitors may offer products or services almost identical to your startup's. Yet, you can still win over customers with innovative customer service solutions.


This is how Zappos has risen to become a leader. The company's service team deserves custom awards for their innovative approach to engaging with customers needing assistance. A great example of their unique strategy is how Zappos focused on communicating with call-in customers during the pandemic. Instead of following the same old approach, Zappos empowered its representatives to engage in genuine conversations about anything and to stay on the phone for as long as necessary.How can you revitalize your service and disrupt your industry in a way that attracts more fans? A good starting point is to examine what other companies are (and aren't) doing. As you identify gaps, consider ways to address them. Next, test some of your creative solutions. Not all ideas will work, but some will likely be winners. Add them to your service offerings and watch your competition scramble to keep up.There's no reason to hesitate pursuing entrepreneurship in 2024. Yes, the past year or so has been challenging. That doesn't mean you can't be successful as a business owner. You just need to implement measures to enable your organization to adapt and change as the months progress — and the money flows in.Related: 4 Ways to Provide Excellent Customer Service

72,Stop Losing Great Talent! 5 Ways to Attract Highly Engaged Employees to Your Business,"Feb 29, 2024",Nicholas Leighton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-ways-to-attract-highly-engaged-employees-to-your-business/470146,"
Attracting and retaining good employees in today's business world is extremely difficult. A growing number of employees are feeling the pressures of rising costs, the threat of job displacement due to technology and a perceived lack of respect and loyalty from their employers. This is causing a shift in the ways companies need to operate in order to successfully navigate employee retention and recruiting.Below, I'll share five things you can do to attract and retain good, highly engaged employees to your business.Related: How to Attract and Retain Top Talent



1. Family care benefitsOutside of work, employees often have a lot on their plate. Caring for children has always been a balancing act for workers. However, this is becoming increasingly difficult since the current economic climate often requires both parents to join the workforce. In the United States, the average cost of childcare is nearly $15,000 a year. With the rising costs of childcare, many employees have been forced to choose between their careers and caring for their children.Companies that offer benefits like on-site daycare centers, dependent care flexible spending accounts (FSAs), parental leave policies and discounted babysitting services can reduce their team's stress and keep them more engaged at work.


Companies should also acknowledge that some employees don't have children, so adding benefits such as pet insurance or elderly care is a great way to make sure everyone feels included.2. Focus on employee wellbeing and mental healthEach year, the global economy loses about $1 trillion to decreased productivity as a result of burnout, depression and anxiety. The reality is that more and more employees are suffering from mental stress as a result of economic uncertainty, global instability and technology addiction.Employers who recognize this can position themselves to support their employees. Not only will this boost productivity, but it can also encourage loyalty from employees who truly believe their employer has their best interests in mind.We live in an era where employees are often expected to carry the work that was once handled by two or three people. While maximizing resources is smart, entrepreneurs need to make sure they aren't creating unintended consequences for the business.


One of the top factors in employee wellbeing is work-life balance. Companies can relieve stress by making sure their team has the right resources available and feel that they can reasonably unplug and recharge. Entrepreneurs should carefully evaluate if they are overloading their employees and ensure that work is distributed equally. In addition, getting rid of employees who aren't pulling their weight can boost morale and productivity within the remaining team.Related: 8 Ways to Foster an Environment of Employee Wellbeing3. Job insecurityLayoffs seem to be in the news every other day. Some of these losses are a result of the economy; others are a result of job displacement due to technological advancements. If employees feel uncertain about the future of the company, they will be more likely to leave and not risk sticking around to see their job eliminated.Unfortunately, there is a growing culture of disloyalty to employers as employees feel like expendable resources. Entrepreneurs can shift this narrative and retain their workforce by staying proactive. Open and transparent communication can provide a comfortable level for uneasy employees. Companies can also offer incentives such as severance packages or extended layoff notification periods to give employees the peace of mind that they will have some level of protection if the worst happens.


4. Reevaluate compensation packagesThe cosmetic retail brand Sephora received a lot of heat in the news recently for ""rewarding"" their employees with a cookie for helping the company achieve its $10 billion revenue goal. With rising inflation and increased costs of living, pizza parties and gift certificates will no longer be sufficient in retaining employees. This forces employees to seek better compensation elsewhere by finding a new job.Employees are quickly realizing that loyalty no longer pays. Why would employees stick around for a 3% annual merit increase when they could get 10% more by changing employers? Companies that focus on paying their existing employees market rates will reduce the risk of employees pursuing more lucrative salaries with other companies.Related: Employee Retention: 4 Tips to Help Keep Your Top Talent5. Address toxic cultures and work environmentsEmployees want to work in an environment where the entire team pulls together toward a common goal. Unfortunately, the average workplace is teeming with toxic cultures and poor leaders. Since employee referrals are one of the best sources of new talent, having a bad culture not only drives away good employees but also reduces the chance of finding high-quality talent.


This is especially true in an era where employees have access to employer reviews on sites like Glassdoor. The key to building a better culture is carefully listening to what employees have to say about the company. As an entrepreneur, driving a healthy and desirable culture begins and ends with you.

As Tom Irons predicted in the documentary Rewilding Kernwood, I was aghast. For over 90 minutes, I watched as he and his partner Jean Aspen dismantled, nail by nail and log by log, the stunning homestead they had taken years to build together by hand in the remote Alaska wilderness. When they were done, and the last of the logs from their cabin had been released into the river, their tenure of 28 years had vanished without a trace.It was difficult to watch this dismantling because ""place"" is so central to our humanity and our organizations. Place gives us an anchor for our identity — both individually and collectively. Without these observable manifestations, who we are can only be implied abstractly through language. Place gives us a touch point, a place to gather, and a place to remind ourselves of who we are and how we show up and operate in the world.Place came to the center of our organizational consciousness, perhaps never as much as when COVID-19 shuttered businesses and forever changed life and work as we knew it. Recall your own pre-pandemic experience of getting to work, being in your workspace, interacting with your coworkers, and engaging in your organization's routines and rituals: The places in which these occurred created bodily experiences, emotions, and thoughts that affected our ideas about ourselves, our organizations, and our relationships within and to it.



Related: Getting The Most Value Out Of Your Brand Identity DesignOrganizations with a strong sense of placeIn my consulting work with the IMF, it was apparent that they understood the importance of place as they sought to create a hybrid workplace mindfully. Rather than react to pandemic-era mandates, they wanted to make this experience meaningful for all employees and use this as an opportunity to deepen their identification with the organization, no matter where they were located.


I decided to talk with other leaders to understand the importance of place in organizations. Bettina Mihai, Organization Effectiveness Consultant, explained that place — in the form of local community — is the heart and soul of H&R Block. H&R Block expresses this in various forms, from their purpose (to provide help and inspire confidence in clients and communities everywhere) to their community impact platform.Sandra Kiely, granddaughter of businessman and philanthropist Charles Gates, Sr., also stressed the importance of place to the Gates family. Kiely explained that her grandmother had built the original family estate that continues to serve as a gathering place for the now four generations that have grown up within the Gates Family Foundation. Her will was clear: the home is never to be sold — and, if it ever is, it must be taken apart piece by piece.What Irons, Aspen, and Kiely's grandmother seemed to understand is that place houses the spirit, soul, and being of our organizations — as a result, these places must be protected. Irons even further explained that allowing our organizational places to fall into disrepair or be overtaken by those who would not comprehend and honor its soul would be ""immoral.""Related: To Make Your Mark, First Find Your Place


Creating place in your organizationBecause place is so important for socializing new members and carrying out the rituals that reinforce an organization's purpose, values and being, I often ask leaders about their organization's relation to place during my work with them. We begin with the assessment:What are the places that embody your organization's identity and bring employees together?What do you need to do to protect better and leverage those places?When organizations lack such places, I ask leaders to consider what they would gain by creating them. For those who had these places and lost them — for example, due to the move to hybrid or virtual workspaces — we begin by reflecting on what they lost when they lost their organizational places.I then invite organizations that realize the need to strengthen their sense of place to carry out several steps:Begin with who you are: Before selecting a place, it is critical to consider the organization's identity. This involves identifying the core, distinctive, and enduring characteristics that set it apart from other organizations.Reflect on the physical manifestations of identity. With identity uncovered, consider the physical features that best align with it. Irons and Aspen are steadfast conservationists; therefore, building materials for their Alaskan homestead had to be nontoxic and naturally occurring (such as moss) whenever possible.Select or create identity-congruent places. Next, select or create a place that reflects the organization's identity and related features. This could concern a physical place within the organization (e.g., a deliberately curated lobby) or outside it (e.g., the location for an annual conference). For the Gates family, these places included the family home and its ranches, where the family continues to gather each year.Galvanize identity through place-based rituals, language, and imagery. Next, reinforce the organization's sense of identity, oneness, and purpose through narratives and rituals surrounding and occurring related to the selected place. For example, in the master's program I graduated from, a coastal condominium community south of California's Bay Area has hosted several sessions for every class since the program's inception. There, countless ""walks and talks,"" ""personal development labs,"" ""group formations,"" and other experiences forged the lifelong friendships and lasting transformations that have become synonymous with the program. It is hard to imagine the same transformations possible in a hotel conference room.Leverage the power of placeWhen selected and managed deliberately, place can become a powerful tool for organizational success. Reflect on your organizational ""places"" and consider how you can better leverage these to deepen employees' sense of oneness and purpose.

74,Are NFTs Back? Why NFTs Will Make a Comeback in 2024,"Feb 28, 2024",Ariel Shapira,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/why-nfts-will-make-a-comeback-in-2024/469664,"
In the last crypto industry bull run, we saw growing curiosity and experimentation from major financial institutions, a surge in numerous altcoins (non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies) that are now ecosystem staples, major DeFi (decentralized finance) developments, positive regulatory actions, and of course, Bitcoin's value reaching an all-time high. But in that whirlwind period, we can't forget the unparalleled hype and interest surrounding something called non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.For those who were absent, NFTs are a unique digital identifier recorded on the blockchain to certify ownership and authenticity of an asset—often, but not exclusively, a digital piece of art. NFTs rode the bull market wave to prominence with numerous high-profile digital art collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks becoming iconic cultural phenomena, consistently fetching upwards of six figures a piece in the process.One NFT, ""Everydays: The First 5000 Days"" by Beeple, sold for an astounding $69 million in March 2021. Before the NFT bubble popped, the NFT market rose to $41 billion in 2021, approaching the conventional art market's valuation of around $50 billion in 2020.



Related: What Is NFT Art? Everything You Need To KnowA fall from graceBut the NFT market crashed hard as the crypto industry suffered from ever-frequent scams, hacks, and high-profile exchange collapses. These scandals, which were typically the result of criminal intent, negligence, or poor risk management, stained the industry to the point that it delegitimized blockchain technology entirely.


The scandals forced the industry to acknowledge and address its flaws. As a consequence, many saw NFTs as the poster child of crypto's problems: Built on hype, seedy, and lacking utility.As the price of Bitcoin and most other altcoins plummeted, NFTs were singled out as just another blockchain-enabled scam. NFT buyers were mocked relentlessly on social media as some demonstrated how they could simply hover over any NFT image listed on a marketplace and then ""right click, save as."" Perceived ownership be damned. Meanwhile, the prices of their expensive digital art were freefalling harder than Bitcoin and Ethereum.NFT or ""play2earn"" gaming, another brainchild of the last bull market, also suffered greatly despite claiming to provide actual use cases by integrating digital assets into gameplay. Critics of the NFT gaming sector widely described these games as underdeveloped, uninteresting, unplayable, and unsustainable business models. Some even went as far as to call the games centers of undercover gambling.As the crypto industry underwent a cleanse that aimed to weed out scams, provide real-world utility, align with regulators, and emphasize product over hype, we began to see an industry on the mend. With prices gradually rising and other positive industry developments taking shape, NFTs have been quietly excluded from many of these conversations until now.


Related: Why Another Bitcoin Boom Could Be the Key to Institutional Adoption. Should You Buy In?NFTs: Back with a vengeance?The tea leaf readings are consistently trending toward an inevitable crypto bull run. Citing the recent SEC ruling to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs from 11 firms, including BlackRock, and the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event in April, crypto enthusiasts are finally hoping for an end to the debilitating crypto winter.The overall crypto industry positivity bodes well for a depleted NFT market as the two sectors are intrinsically linked, with the latter being more dependent on the former. A stronger, more financially robust crypto economy means there is more capital to spend on NFTs, which still enjoy a loud and loyal community despite their downtrodden standing.But this time, an NFT revival isn't solely dependent on the crypto industry's wellbeing. Momentum has been building over the last couple of months, showing that interest in NFTs remains, with several vital shifts driving this renewed interest.


Both macro and micro-trends within the NFT space could propel them back into the mainstream but with a more mature flavor. On a macro level, we are seeing a shift from expensive, small-quantity NFT ""members clubs"" to more affordable assets produced in larger quantities and a greater focus on direct value creation over speculation — a common past critique of NFTs that limited their accessibility. Furthermore, major brands like Nike and Starbucks are experimenting with mass-market NFTs as a way to build and grow brand loyalty through digital collectibles.On a more micro level, the buzz around generative AI-created art provides a tool for developers to experiment and produce innovative and unique NFTs. For example, AI blockchain infrastructure startup ChainGPT has a user-friendly NFT generator that completely automates the entire generating and minting process, reducing the chance of a verification error or another mistake associated with manual NFT creation from occurring.Aside from AI, though, we can expect to see other exciting and innovative use cases for NFTs that go beyond what we've witnessed so far. This is already playing out in the fashion industry, where NFTs serve as proof of authenticity for luxury goods, and in the music industry, where it's becoming commonplace for artists to tokenize royalties of songs as NFTs.Just as the broader crypto industry matured during the down market, the same can be said for NFTs. With new projects, new use cases, and the power of AI, NFTs will likely play an impactful yet more modest role within a stronger and more stable crypto industry. While they may not be as prominent or as hyped, they will serve as a gateway to the world of digital assets for many simply by exposing them to the concept of digital ownership.

75,"Leaders, Here Are 4 Ways You're Inadvertently Destroying Trust in the Workplace (and What to Do Instead)","Feb 28, 2024",Brandy Ferrer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-ways-youre-inadvertently-destroying-trust-in-the/470007,"
Trust is the ""IT"" factor in effective communication and your relationships with your team — and ultimately, it's the ingredient that fosters creativity. And yet, for many leaders, trust within the team remains elusive.You may be part of the problem. Despite your best intentions for building relationships and trust within the team, you might be inadvertently diminishing your trustworthiness with the team, thus slowing communication, hurting relationships and stunting innovation.The good news: It doesn't have to be that way.



Here are the four biggest trust-destroyers for leaders and what you can do instead to deepen those relationships and be the trustworthy leader your team and your organization need you to be.Related: Lack of Trust — What Does It Do to Your Company? Here's What Leaders Need to Know.


1. Failing frequency""If you don't hear from me, everything is good."" This cringe-worthy statement is brought to you by busy leaders everywhere.No matter how busy you are, limiting communication to only the most urgent or problematic situations stifles relationship development and it creates the perception that you are the bearer of bad news.This lack of communication leaves the team feeling like they're operating in the dark. Since it's human nature to fill in information gaps with our own stories, lack of information also fuels the rumor mill.Make it a point to touch base with your team at least once a day. This could be a five-minute standing meeting in the morning, a quick cube drive-by (or a brief phone call or teams chat for remote teams) for each team member.


Share summaries from leadership meetings, strategic initiatives and goings-on outside the immediate team. Even if you think there's not much to share, touch base with your team anyway. The more information you share, the more confident the team feels.One more thing to keep in mind: It takes an average of 7-10 times to hear or see a message before it starts to be internalized. The more important something is, the more often you will need to talk about it.Frequent, ongoing communication provides a win-win in that you have the organic opportunity to check on status, offer support, remove barriers, and over time, deepen trust and relationships.2. Muddled messagingDo you set sweeping expectations in the hopes your smart, capable team will ""figure out"" how to deliver your vision? Do you give feedback in broad, unspecified terms? Do you find yourself making a lot of ""educated guesses"" when answering the teams' questions?


This is muddled messaging. These unclear, barely actionable messages have hopes of providing clarity or direction.A simple shift in how you construct your messaging makes all the difference.Be clear, be concise. Get rid of jargon-y, fluffy filler words. Don't leave space for ambiguity. Instead, use these guiding questions to help construct the message: WHO is the audience? WHAT do they need to know? WHY are you sharing this message? WHAT is the expectation?Related: Trust Needs To Be Earned — Not Demanded. Here Are 5 Crucial Leadership Elements to Earn Your Team's Trust.


3. Lack of listeningListening to only a chosen few or selectively excluding voices of dissent from decision-making is a bad idea for many reasons.In selective listening, the tendency is to invite opinions and advice only from the ""yes people"" and your perpetual cheerleaders. Not only does this prevent you from hearing valuable insights (even the dissenting — as those are the ones who will challenge, poke holes and encourage deeper thinking), but it drives distrust and stifles creative thinking.In order to be an effective leader, it's not enough to listen to the board or to the chosen few. You have a responsibility to solicit feedback (and internalize it) from your team.Build trust by listening. Get curious about what the team has to say. Proactively seek out advice and insights. Questions like ""How did I do on that call?"" ""What did you think about that meeting?"" or ""What would you do if you were in my position?"" are great prompts to hear from others.


4. Words and behaviors don't matchThis is stuff your mama told you. If you say you're going to do something, for goodness sake, do it. And if something unforeseen arises that prevents you from honoring your commitment, say something!I had to dump a long-time vendor for exactly this reason. They kept promising a two-week delivery on my promotional items. After six weeks, there was still no order. When I called, they promised it wouldn't happen again. But the same thing occurred the very next time I ordered; they promised two weeks but turned out to be closer to eight.I didn't fire this vendor because the product or service was bad. I fired this vendor because they weren't honest about how long things were going to take, and they didn't communicate proactively when there was an issue. I fired them because I couldn't trust them to keep their word.The takeaway? Honor your word. If unforeseen circumstances arise that prevent you from keeping your word, be forthcoming about it. This allows others to adjust their expectations and allows you to still keep your commitment.


Avoid these trust-damaging pitfalls and replace them with ongoing, candid communication and aligned words and action. This small investment will yield you tons of return in the effectiveness of the relationships with your team.Related: 7 Proven Tips for Building Trust and Strengthening Workplace Relationships

76,Why Successful People Never Second-Guess Themselves — and 5 Strategies to Help You Get Rid of Indecision,"Feb 28, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-successful-people-never-second-guess-themselves-and/469042,"
Indecision is a problem for many of us. Some of us spend far too long deliberating our decisions, even ones that aren't that significant. Usually, it stems from fear. Sometimes, we become so paralyzed by fear of making the wrong decision that we don't make any decision at all.Most of us can remember a time when we stood still for too long. Time runs out, doors close on us and opportunities pass us by. However, not all of us struggle with indecision. Our history is rich with examples of business, political and military leaders who made incredibly complex decisions of extreme importance — and did it while under immense pressure. How were they able to do it? Often, it's because they believe in following these five principles.More from the author: 6 H.A.B.I.T.S. of Powerful People

77,"As a Black Woman CEO, I Built a Remote Company Not Just to Save Money — But to Mirror My Commitment to Diversity. Here's How.","Feb 23, 2024",Catherine Mandungu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/as-a-black-woman-ceo-i-built-a-remote-company-not-just-to/469043,"
In the tech industry, global diversity is more than a buzzword phrase — it is the engine of innovation and leadership. Launching my startup was a new beginning. It was fueled by my journey as a Black woman entrepreneur. I chose to be a remote operation not just to save money. It was also to craft a work culture that showcases my core values and the complexity of our global community. This decision was less about following trends and more about purposefully nurturing a diverse and connected environment.Diverse teams have an advantage in decision-making, task execution and innovation. This advantage is becoming increasingly logical. Diverse teams outperform groups that are not diverse. Robust data supports this. The benefits of diversity go beyond theory. They boost a team's innovation and finances. In 2023, about 16% of companies had gone fully remote and about 28% had gone hybrid. The importance of remote work and diversity is clearer than ever. These trends show that remote work is possible. They also highlight the key role of diversity in modern business success.Related: How to Build Team Culture in a Remote-Work World



Building a diverse and global teamOur strategy for building a diverse team is rooted in a deep dedication to diversity. It is a guiding principle and a daily practice. We've created a thorough remote onboarding process. It helps new team members join our culture and rhythms. The system has virtual meet-and-greets, in-depth project orientations and ongoing mentorship. It has been pivotal in building a unified team spirit. This spirit is undeterred by the lack of physical closeness.We tackle the challenges of distance. We do this by doing regular virtual team-building exercises. They are designed to build community and improve team dynamics. Twice-a-year in-person meetings at key locations have strengthened our team, as well.


Our global team is from the United Kingdom, France, Bulgaria, the Philippines and India. It brings together a rich mix of perspectives. These enrich our work and foster an environment ripe for innovation. It's a diversity of thought and culture. It doesn't just encourage creative problem-solving — it also bonds us as a team. It shows that distance is no barrier to building a strong, cohesive unit.Harnessing geographical diversityThe diversity of our team is among our most significant assets. We show commitment to being sensitive and inclusive. This is seen in our communication practices and in our scheduling and observance of local traditions. This respect for each team member's heritage enhances our output and experience. It embodies the essence of a globally connected team.We use our geographical diversity to be available to clients around the clock. We offer solutions based on a deep understanding of their unique needs and challenges. Using time zone differences well guarantees our responsiveness. It also brings rich ideas and views to our projects. This sparks innovation and a global approach to problem-solving.Diversity comes in many forms. It ranges from location to culture and language. It helps us handle challenges with many strategies. This boosts our problem-solving abilities a lot. Our ability to view issues from many angles has been key, helping us to secure pivotal clients. It lets us showcase the real benefits and value of our diverse views. This not only reaffirms the importance of cultural diversity, but also highlights it as an important driver of superior business performance.


Related: How Cultural Understanding and Adaptation Drives Business SuccessFostering innovation with global insightsCreating a diverse remote team has been a game-changer. It sparked unmatched innovation and a deep understanding of global markets. The array of perspectives in our team empowers us. It lets us address challenges with new solutions and creative thinking, improving our problem-solving abilities. Our global footprint provides insights into varied market dynamics. It includes consumer behaviors and business practices. This allows us to craft cutting-edge solutions with global relevance.Empowering transparency and developmentAt the heart of any thriving team is effective project management. By adopting online tools, we achieve transparency in every task and project, ensuring all team members are informed of their roles and responsibilities. This method promotes a culture of accountability and cooperation. Alongside this, we prioritize the continuous professional growth of our team. We provide access to online courses, webinars and virtual workshops. Tailored to our team's expertise. They equip our team to lead in industry innovations and practices. We focus on clarity in operations and on nurturing our team's development. This focus boosts our efficiency and drives our ongoing innovation and progress.Personal growthBuilding a remote team has been transformative. It has offered me substantial personal growth and the freedom to immerse myself in different cultures in Asia and Europe. Enriching my personal life on a day-to-day basis. It has also broadened my leadership in a multicultural setting. Learning from different cultures and business practices has been eye-opening; it's shown me the key role of diversity in success.


This change reflects a wider trend among remote workers. In particular, millennials show more engagement in workplaces that champion inclusivity. They highly value cognitive diversity and see the importance of solving business challenges through teamwork. For this generation, inclusion goes beyond representation. It's about fostering an environment where every voice is heard. All perspectives contribute to better business solutions.Related: Diverse Workplaces Generate 19% More Revenue Than Less Diverse CompetitorsConclusionBuilding a diverse remote team is a journey. It requires continual learning and flexibility. This initiative has many benefits. It will spur innovation, promote inclusivity and expand our global outlook. These benefits are immense. They far outweigh any obstacles we encounter. This approach drives groups to better achievements and creates a more inclusive and interconnected global work environment by embracing diversity in all its forms. This paves the way for a richer and more collaborative future in business and beyond.

78,3 Strategies to Help Leaders Ignite Passion in the Workplace (and Why It's Important),"Feb 23, 2024",Itzik Elbaz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-strategies-to-help-leaders-ignite-passion-in-the-workplace/469450,"
It's time to reframe how we look at work and view it through the lens of creativity. Because if we're trying to help motivate our employees, once we understand that so much of our work is about creativity, passion becomes much more important. The most creative artists are deeply passionate about their craft. And the most successful employees are normally those with a similar passion for their work.Employees who are passionate about their work are transformed from a group of people trying to get through a list of tasks to more productive, creative and happier professionals. That, in turn, leads to a better product, happier customers and more sales.Related: How To Keep Employees Feeling Passionate About Their Work



Start by leading with passionCompany culture comes from the top, so it's really important to hire leaders who openly display and role model passion in their day-to-day work. Managers who are enthusiastic, communicate transparently and actively engage with and support their team's ideas will help them understand the true value of their work and how it's helping the end users. This can then inspire a similar passion across the organization.When team members see genuine passion in their management, they feel more connected to their work and motivated to contribute their best. Passion is infectious.


How to bring passion into the workplaceSteve Jobs once said that the only way to do great work is to love what you do. That's all well and good, but as leaders, it's up to us to create a work environment where people have the space to love what they do, and therefore do their best work. But how do you motivate your team and inspire passion? That's the million-dollar question. Here are three methods I use to bring passion into the workplace:1. Focus on passion from day one:When you onboard new employees, don't just tell them about your products and services. Immerse them in your company culture. They can't feel passionate about what they are doing if they don't feel a deep connection to the organization, its goals and how their role will make an impact. Excite them. Inspire them. Make sure they fully understand what is expected of them and how they fit into the big picture.2. Connect everyone to the bigger picture:By being transparent about the company's business goals and sharing information, you connect your employees with the bigger picture. Your ultimate aim should be to make them feel that they're an inseparable part of achieving the company's goals, which will empower them to do their best work. They should easily understand the steps they need to take to reach their objectives and shouldn't have to put unnecessary energy into irrelevant tasks.3. Put the right person into the right job and set the right expectations:Employees who are professionally suited to the work they are tasked with are naturally more passionate about what they're doing. While it seems obvious to assign projects to people with the right skill set, a lack of resources or a failure to deeply understand the task can lead to a mismatch — and that's a great way to kill passion and increase frustration. On the other hand, when projects are built around motivated individuals, with realistic and agreed-upon expectations, the sky's the limit.


Related: 7 Steps to Building an Inspired Team That Achieves Amazing ResultsWhy does it matter?Passionate employees have a direct positive impact on the success of a business. Engaged employees have a positive influence on everyone around them. Two teams with exactly the same skillset can have completely different results, driven by the level of their energy and enthusiasm.The data confirms this. A huge Gallup study involving over one million employees found that the most engaged teams can outperform the least engaged teams by over 20%. A separate study by Deloitte found a direct connection between passion for work and better innovation and customer satisfaction.This also extends outside of work. In the teams I work with, there are people who make music, record podcasts, write blogs; others who love to go hiking, surfing and climbing. We use these personal passions to recharge and come into our work with renewed energy.


But even more than that — when people have the time to develop their personal projects, it enriches their creativity by encouraging them to think differently than they would in their day job. It opens their minds to new ideas and approaches that they bring into work, helping them take on their tasks with a more creative and passionate mindset.So, cultivating passion in the workplace results in employees who work harder to find solutions to challenging problems and deliver better results. In turn, I believe that passionate employees lead to passionate customers. Your team's passion comes across in marketing materials, it's felt in interactions with the sales and support teams, and it drives a better product. As I said previously, passion is infectious, and great experiences with your brand will turn your customers into passionate advocates on your behalf.By giving your employees the freedom to think outside the box, implement innovative initiatives and find creative solutions to problems, you're fueling their passion for your business. When they see that their ideas are transformed into action, and have a real impact, their passion and creativity will only increase. And your customers will feel the difference.Related: 8 Ways to Motivate Employees Into an Unstoppable Team

79,How to Regain Your Passion for Your Business — And How to Keep It Alive,"Feb 22, 2024",Nicholas Leighton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-keep-your-passion-alive-as-your-business-grows/469362,"
Behind every successful company is an entrepreneur who is deeply committed to their business and is passionate about their products and services. For new entrepreneurs, this passion is easy to sustain in the beginning when everything is new and exciting. There seems to be an endless flow of challenges, change, accomplishments and milestones that keep you going.Unfortunately, seasoned entrepreneurs know that once this ""new business smell"" wears off, it can be difficult to stay passionate about the work every single day. As the company grows and entrepreneurs are sucked into the complexities and routine of the business, they often find themselves struggling to maintain the initial passion that fueled their venture.This doesn't mean that you have a bad business. This is a natural cycle that every entrepreneur must overcome. Fortunately, there are ways that you can build a business model that centers around keeping that passion alive and well.



Related: 3 Ways to Stay as Passionate About Your Business as When You Started1. Set clear and ambitious goalsIn the early stages of building a business, entrepreneurs go through a whirlwind of quick accomplishments such as landing their first client or reaching profitability. Once the business stabilizes and has consistent operations, it's easy to fall into the trap of the day-to-day routine.


To keep the passion alive, entrepreneurs should always have clear objectives that they are working towards. It's important for these goals to be ambitious. If your goals aren't ambitious, there is a huge chance that you'll get bored and won't feel challenged. 2. Create a culture of innovation and improvementStagnation is the most common reason why people stop feeling motivated and passionate about their work. As a business owner, you can drive a culture of innovation and consistent improvement. It doesn't matter how passionate you are about the business, a lack of passion in your team will drag down the organization.By discovering new products, services or ways of doing things, you can keep yourself and your team engaged in the business. Take the time to listen to your customers and use that as an opportunity to refine your current products or services. Change is a great way to combat monotony and keep your team passionate about the business.Related: Path to Success: 4 Ways to Reignite Your Passion


3. Delegate thoughtfullyNothing kills passion faster than an entrepreneur spending three hours trying to find the typo in their accounting records because they wanted to do the bookkeeping themselves instead of hiring a professional. Running a business isn't always fun, but it can be more enjoyable if you allow yourself and your team to avoid tasks they hate or aren't good at.Instead of randomly assigning responsibilities, carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of everyone on the team. By playing to everyone's strengths, you can delegate activities in a way that keeps people excited about their work every day.4. Permit creative outletsPart of the reason why new entrepreneurs can stay passionate about their venture is because they are doing new and exciting things. Keeping your passion alive may simply require allowing creative outlets, even if they aren't necessarily business-critical. Give yourself and the team the opportunity to learn new skills and cross-train in different roles. This will help strengthen the business and provide an opportunity to step back from the monotonous day-to-day activities.Related: 6 Surefire Ways to Stay Constantly Motivated


Sustaining passion over timeBuilding a culture and business model that is passion-centric is essential. However, despite all of these efforts, it can be challenging to maintain the excitement over many years. Here are some other routines and methods entrepreneurs can leverage to sustain their passion long-term.Unplug: Take time to recharge from time to time. You can't bring your best to your business or team if you are working around the clock for long periods of time.Network and connect: Taking the opportunity to collaborate and build relationships with other people in your industry is a great way to stay connected to your business purpose and stimulate innovation.Explore a greater purpose: Building a business is a huge accomplishment, but keeping the passion alive may require looking beyond the business to see what you can do to give back to the community through philanthropic endeavors.Stay healthy: People who exercise regularly are 13% more productive at work and have higher levels of happiness and satisfaction. No matter how busy you are in the business, take the time to stay in shape and eat healthy.Get a mentor: Having someone in your corner who is outside the business is a great way to keep your passion levels in check. A mentor can help guide you through periods of stagnation or challenges in a safe and productive way.Remember that passion is the reason you started your business in the first place. For this reason, it's the most important ingredient to keep your company moving forward and getting the most enjoyment out of your work.

80,How This Crucial Leadership Style Will Increase Your Employee Retention,"Feb 22, 2024",Elayna Fernandez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-this-leadership-style-will-increase-your-employee/469467,"
It was almost 9 p.m. on a Sunday, and I had officially spent all weekend pretty much on my couch, feeling a rollercoaster of emotions and trying to process the Friday morning meeting with my manager.The words kept echoing in my head: ""It's the most supportive decision for you."" I felt I was being penalized for doing too much and doing it well.I felt a punch in the gut when my manager told me about all the meetings that had taken place: what I should be doing, how long I should be doing it for, and who would take over things I had previously done. A decision had been reached that would affect my entire life, and I was not invited to the decision-making process.



What?I don't even make decisions about my four-year-old child without her consent! I kept thinking as I raged, cried, and felt the shame of having sacrificed myself to perform with excellence while clearly being underpaid.


As I got up from that couch that night, I thought about how today, more than ever, employees need truly supportive leaders. And that's when Vance came to mind.Back in 2009, when I was recovering from cancer, I covered the Naples International Film Festival as an influencer.The film 500 Days of Summer, a romantic comedy-drama directed by Marc Webb, left an impression on me. Everyone knows that I love rom-coms, but the truth is that this film teaches a powerful lesson about supportive leadership.Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Tom Hansen, a hopeless romantic who writes greeting cards for a living. He falls in love with co-worker Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel. Their breakup and his eventual heartbreak affect every aspect of his life and, naturally, his productivity and work performance.


Mr. Vance, Tom's boss, portrayed by Clark Gregg requests a meeting with him based on a very explicit Valentine's Day card he wrote. The conversation goes like this:Tom: Mr. Vance... Are you firing me?Vance: No. No. Relax, Hansen. You're one of the good ones.Tom: Okay, well, yeah, I'm sorry. Things have been a little difficult.Vance: That's okay. I completely understand that. I'm just saying that perhaps you could channel those energies into something like this.Tom: Funerals and sympathy!Vance: Misery, sadness, loss of faith. No reason to live. This is perfect for you. Good. Okay. And back to work you go.Tom: Thank you.


Mr. Vance was concerned about Tom and suggested a supportive solution because he saw him and what he was going through. Vance's response to Tom in 500 Days of Summer is like a masterclass in supportive leadership.Related: Are You a Trauma-Responsive Leader? Why Trauma-Informed Leaders Make a Happy and Healthy WorkplaceThe supportive leadership styleA supportive leader regularly checks in with employees, learns whether something is blocking them from achieving their goals, and then allows them the freedom to creatively come up with their own solutions.This is what Vance did, and it inspired my acronym:Validate their painAffirm their valueNurture their positive skillsCultivate safetyEncourage a way forwardRelated: Intent vs. Impact: What Leaders Need to Know to Create a Safe SpaceBe like V.A.N.C.E.Let's go through every letter of the V.A.N.C.E. acronym to understand the supportive leadership concept:Validate their pain — Supportive leaders sense when something is off with a team member and acknowledge it out loud — to their face. They genuinely care about the whole person, not just their performance.Affirm their value — By offering authentic appreciation, people feel valued even when performance isn't going well. When Vance says, ""You're one of the good ones!"" he focuses on true identity versus current productivity levels.Nurture their positive skills — Whether someone is stuck in a grief or trauma cycle when someone is struggling, it's important to state what could go right rather than what is going wrong. Vance pointed out what new skills emerged from Tom's predicament, which helped Tom feel seen in a very hard situation.Cultivate safety —Supportive leaders hold a safe space and seek understanding without placing blame or shame. A ""no retribution rule"" allows people to open up and express their feelings.Encourage a way forward — Supportive leaders encourage team members to envision a new future with the company while fully respecting their sense of autonomy and affirming their sense of belonging. The ""we're in this together"" spirit is palpable and reassuring.When trying to be supportive goes wrongThat Sunday night, I felt demoralized, excluded, and discriminated by that manager's decision - and not at all supported.


The meaning of the word support, according to its etymology, is ""to bear part or all of the weight."" To be a genuinely supportive leader, there has to be a sense that we will share the burden. Imposing so-called solutions based on what is convenient for the company without employee buy-in does not equal genuine support.And that's why I wrote my resignation letter for a job I truly loved and a company I was loyal to. While I didn't recite an epic ""I quit"" speech like Tom Hansen did, my resignation was effective the next day. I knew I deserved better - a leader who was committed to being like Vance.Related: 7 Ways for Leaders to Gracefully Accept a ResignationLeaders like Vance are not only a work of fiction. In my work as a corporate trainer, I've encountered countless supportive leaders who know that in caring for their team, they are caring for their own position in the company and the organization's wellbeing.


Supportive leaders help companies avoid the devastating impact of high employee turnover. After all, we all know that people don't quit companies — they quit people.

In an era when technology dominates the landscape, algorithms wield power far beyond mere computation. The transformative promise of artificial intelligence (AI) lies not solely in its ability to enhance products or streamline services. Of far greater significance is its capacity to deepen our understanding of ourselves as a society and highlight the necessary moral compass amid this transition.Related: The Top 4 Most Bankable AI Skills You Need to Succeed in 2024AI is a catalyst — orchestrating pivotal revolutions across diverse industries — and the advent of driverless cars stands as a testament. Although autonomous vehicles foretell a future of unprecedented convenience and security, they also unravel a host of societal and ethical dilemmas. Can these machines make morally weighted decisions? And more pressingly, how can we program those decisions in a manner that upholds our collective ethical norms?



This episode of the Beyond Impossible podcast, with special guest Jonathan Campos of Alto, isn't just another fireside chat about emerging tech.

In a world preoccupied with competitiveness, AI advancements can appear a double-edged sword.

No one knows everything. There's no need to pretend that we do. A great leader is honest about their limitations and strengths. Accept that you will fail. Being honest and open about failure is not a weakness.A great leader is not defined by having all the answers but by a willingness to grow and learn, a curiosity that leads to finding the required answers. It is about stopping, refueling, and being the best version of yourself.Think about it. Do you want a team that comes to you for the answers? That has no mind of its own? No creativity? We all know the answer to that. Command and control is a thing of the past and won't cut the muster in today's ever-evolving business landscape, not if you want to be a business of tomorrow.

83,This is the Real Secret to Success — How to Lead Even When You Are Losing,"Feb 21, 2024",Kristopher Tait,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-find-success-in-failure-and-loss/468964,"
Recently, my team and I lost a client — a large client. And it hurt a lot. We don't like losing; call it our competitive nature or just the fact that we pour everything we have into these client engagements, our ideas, and our time.In just over a decade, we have landed in New York and grown from a team of under ten to an organization with more than 500 people globally. We've won incredible clients — driving their businesses forward and delivering upon ambitious growth plans.We've done a lot of winning. So, losing naturally stung. But that sting quickly morphs into something far more powerful: motivation to learn and grow.Related: 8 Tips to Help Entrepreneurs Find Success After FailureOn the pitchThe challenge with always winning is that you will feel like you are succeeding. As if you've earned the title ""best in the business."" But in reality, that feeling is somewhat of a falsity because you're actually not really learning. Yes, you're winning. But you're not growing.



This is why I'm here to remind ourselves that the real secret to success is learning how to lose. To lose with grace but also fire. To lose with conviction and a promise to learn, grow and continuously do better.Don't believe me? Just ask David Beckham and Sir Alex Ferguson.Close your eyes and reflect on the 1998 World Cup in France. England faced their old enemy, Argentina, in the first knockout rounds. David Beckham started for England in midfield. At this moment in time, he was a young man with the world at his feet. He was a fast-emerging superstar. He was dating a superstar. And he was playing for England and Manchester United.Life was looking good for Becks. Until, with the game tied at 2-2, Argentina's notoriously tenacious midfielder Diego Simeone committed a cynical foul on Beckham. After Beckham hit the floor, Simeone antagonized Beckham by ruffling the back of his hair.


And in that moment, Beckham's life would change forever.Beckham lost control of his emotions. He instinctively kicked out his leg at Simeone— leading the referee to swiftly brandish a red card and send Beckham off the pitch. England lost the game. And chaos ensued.Beckham went from the golden boy to the most hated man in Britain in a flash. The media turned on him. He received death threats from fans, bullets in the mail, and a Beckham effigy was even hanged outside a pub in London.Related: Why Failure Is Your Best TeacherEveryone turned on him. Except his manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.Sir Alex put his arms around him. He protected him — and made sure his teammates did, too. He created an ""us versus the world"" mentality within Beckham and the club. And together, they fought on and pushed forward.And it worked. Within a year, Beckham and Manchester United would win an iconic treble. Tides would shift. He was back to his place as beloved the world over.Pivoting back to the world in which we thrive — the world of business—this ""us versus the world"" mentality can be incredibly powerful when deployed well and with intention. By having instilled the right mindset, our best work has been done when we've lost a few things in a row.


Why? Because it forces you to reassess your position in the market, develop new tools and capabilities and refine your sense of direction. Lastly, always remember that feedback is a gift, take as much as you can and learn from it. Embrace it. We call that having a growth mentality.Related: 7 Lessons on Failure You Can Learn From Top AthletesLosses and lessonsLosing hurts. It will always hurt. But there is no shame in losing — so cast that thought aside. There is only regret if you fail to learn.Sir Alex Ferguson turned a crisis into an opportunity by leading with a people-first mindset and putting the collective well-being of his team first. He stood by his team, and the world witnessed that.


Businesses work in the same way. Leaders need to create a sense of togetherness. When you lose out on a pitch, people will worry about the security of their jobs. As I am learning again, an ""us against the world"" mentality can be a transformational asset in these moments.If you spoke to David Beckham in the aftermath of that game versus Argentina, he would likely give anything to turn back time and change his actions. But that loss, that mistake, was likely worth more than he could realize.A loss is not always for the worse. Sometimes, it is the best thing that can happen for a person or a business. It's a chance to refocus. To reevaluate your processes and your priorities.We are all going to face challenging moments in 2024. Everyone will lose at some point. But not everyone will learn. And that, more than their percentage of wins against losses, is what separates successful leaders and businesses from the rest.

84,8 Reasons Why We Need Entrepreneurs Now More Than Ever,"Feb 21, 2024",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/8-reasons-why-entrepreneurship-is-needed-now-more-than-ever/452735,"
Entrepreneurship is the foundation of invention, job creation and wealth generation. Successful entrepreneurs are the driving force behind new diligence, products and services that profit society in numerous ways.Starting your own business and entrepreneurship do more than just boost the economy. They spark and fue­l good changes in your community. Those making laws and investing mone­y need to recognize entrepreneurship, back it, and nurture it. Only then that we­'ll see the re­al power of business ownership for a strong e­conomy and healthier society.Embarking on the entrepreneurial journey is challenging and rewarding, requiring work, dedication and calculated risk-taking. The potential benefits that arise from entrepreneurship extend far beyond the entrepreneurs themselves.



Related: 3 Values That Empower Entrepreneurs As They Start Their Business Journeys1. They are innovation catalystsEntrepreneurship stands as the linchpin of innovation. Visionary entrepreneurs perpetually seek novel and inventive solutions to problems, demonstrating a willingness to undertake risks and invest in unconventional ideas. Through their inventive pursuits, entrepreneurs not only birth new products and services but also enhance existing ones. This continuous cycle of innovation propels economic growth, fostering the emergence of new industries while enhancing the productivity of existing ones.


Related: How Entrepreneurial Creativity Leads to Innovation2. Job creationA substantial contributor to job creation, entrepreneurship spawns new businesses that necessitate a workforce. Entrepreneurs, in addition to working for themselves, become employers, fostering employment opportunities. Globally, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of numerous economies, accounting for a significant share of job creation. SMEs contribute to over 50% of new job opportunities in most countries.Entrepreneurship is a factor in creating wealth. As businesses grow and flourish, they accumulate income and profits, which can be reinvested to fuel expansion. Apart from prosperity, entrepreneurs also add value to society by providing in-demand products and services.Related: The 9 Power Moves You Need to Find Success


3. Economic growthEntrepreneurship plays a role in driving progress. Its impact goes beyond creating industries, products and services; it also fuels economic activity and generates revenue. Entrepreneurs contribute to job creation, wealth generation and overall economic development through their investments in ideas and innovations. A thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem has the potential to propel lasting growth and prosperity.4. Market expansion and trade enhancementEntrepreneurial ventures also often lead to market expansion and enhanced trade opportunities. As businesses grow, they seek new markets to explore and conquer. This expansion not only increases the reach of these enterprises but also contributes to international trade. Entrepreneurs are driven by the desire to tap into global markets, engage in cross-border trade, foster economic cooperation and create opportunities for diverse business partnerships.5. Technological advancements and digital transformationEntrepreneurs are at the forefront of technological advancements, driving digital transformation across industries. The continuous pursuit of innovative solutions necessitates the incorporation of cutting-edge technologies. This, in turn, leads to increased efficiency, streamlined processes, and the development of new digital platforms. Entrepreneurs leveraging technology enhance their businesses and contribute to the broader digital evolution, shaping the future of industries.6. Social impactEntrepreneurship goes beyond economic benefits; it plays a vital role in community development and social impact. Local businesses and startups contribute to the overall development of communities by creating a sense of identity and pride. Additionally, entrepreneurs often engage in philanthropic activities, giving back to the community through social initiatives. This social responsibility aspect of entrepreneurship enhances communities' overall well-being and resilience.


Related: How Social Entrepreneurs Are Changing the World7. Job creationJob creation is a pivotal mechanism through which entrepreneurship fuels economic growth. New businesses necessitate diverse skills, from management and marketing to product development and customer service, providing employment opportunities. This surge in employment, in turn, stimulates increased spending and economic activity as individuals have more disposable income.8. CompetitionEntrepreneurship fosters healthy competition within the marketplace. The entry of new businesses introduces novel products or services, challenging established firms. This competition often results in lower prices, improved quality and heightened innovation as businesses vie to distinguish themselves and meet consumer demand. Ultimately, consumers benefit by accessing a broader range of products and services at more affordable prices.ConclusionIndeed, entrepreneurship comes with challenges, demanding significant resources such as capital, expertise and time. Many entrepreneurs grapple with entry barriers like insufficient funding, regulatory complexities and market saturation. Nevertheless, entrepreneurship emerges as a potent engine of growth and innovation for those who navigate these challenges, driving economic prosperity and enhancing lives.


In conclusion, entrepreneurship plays a role in driving our economy's growth. Entrepreneurs, known for their willingness to take risks, bring innovation. Solve problems are responsible for creating businesses, products and services. These ventures do not generate employment opportunities. It also fosters healthy competition and boosts economic progress.

85,3 Mind-Changing Habits Every Leader Should Follow,"Feb 20, 2024",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-mind-changing-habits-every-leader-should-follow/469561,"
The human mind is incredibly powerful in shaping our feelings and behavior, which is why your mindset can make all the difference in your level of success as well as your daily happiness. In fact, your mindset even affects those around you through your attitudes and actions. Because of this, mindset is especially important for business leaders, whose feelings and decisions affect the people they lead and the outcomes of their businesses. But changing your mindset takes more than just willpower — it requires regular thoughts and actions.One of the most effective ways to change your mindset is through the power of habit. Habits come in many shapes and sizes, good, bad and neutral. Once a habit is established, it's easy to continue doing it, which is what makes it such a powerful tool to affect your mindset. Here are three habits that I use to help me create a more successful mindset.Related: Hope, Optimism and Resiliency: The Three Most Powerful Leadership Tools You Can Have As An Entrepreneur



1. Build resiliency through optimismWe've all been told at some point in our lives to adopt a positive mindset — and for good reason. It's incredibly beneficial not only in making you feel happier but also in building resiliency, a skill that every leader needs in order to recover from challenges and setbacks.While it may seem more practical to take a pessimistic or realistic approach to challenges, an optimistic approach is often most advantageous because it doesn't allow you to become discouraged from continuing to try to find a solution and push through the difficulty. A positive attitude allows you not to take setbacks personally and to believe in your own abilities even when things aren't going according to plan. For a leader, positivity during times of challenge or crisis is especially important in order to support team morale and direct the team toward solutions rather than discouragement.


Of course, choosing a positive attitude isn't as simple as flipping a switch when you wake up in the morning. It takes a significant amount of work, but luckily there are a few practices you can use to help you establish and maintain a positive mindset.I use the practice of gratitude journaling, which has become popular as a form of reflection and as a mindset tool to foster positivity. Taking time to appreciate positive things in your life will naturally make you feel uplifted and happier, so a practice like this can be worthwhile to establish. Similarly, you can focus on the positive by finding things throughout your day to appreciate. For example, try challenging yourself to pay five compliments every day to five different people. Not only will you make someone else feel positive, but you'll feel good about it too.When you do catch yourself thinking negative thoughts, whether that's about yourself, someone else or a situation you're in, try to reframe them into something positive or change your focus onto something uplifting. While this isn't always possible, the more you practice it, the easier it will become to keep your mindset positive as a whole.2. Practice generosityNot only is generosity virtuous, but it has a number of positive effects on your mindset. First, and most obviously, it feels good to do something nice for someone else, which can help you maintain a positive attitude. But if you make a point of practicing generosity regularly, it can have even more benefits. It affects the way people see you and the kind of culture you create as a leader. And when you give to others regularly, it helps you develop a mindset of abundance rather than scarcity.


At my company, we have an annual Random Acts of Kindness week, in which all employees participate. We're a remote company, so it might look a bit different if you were to implement it. The week has opportunities for employees to show kindness towards coworkers on Monday, their team on Tuesday, their loved ones on Valentine's Day, local small businesses on Thursday and the community on Friday. We post photos on our Slack channel and donate money towards a charity.Related: Why Your Creativity Is Your Most Valuable Skill3. Create a habit of creativityCreativity is essential for the business leader in growing your business, and it's one of your most important functions — something no one else on your team can do for you. But creativity is like a muscle, and the more you practice it, the easier it becomes. By maintaining a creative mindset, I find I'm better able to respond to problems, and I'm constantly coming up with new ideas. Creativity is never a struggle for me because I make a habit of it by creating space in my regular schedule dedicated to creativity.Making creativity into a habit starts by simply scheduling time for it regularly, then showing up and staying focused on your creative tasks without distractions. Your mindset is something you get to choose, but it takes work to get there. By establishing habits that help you craft the mindset you desire and practicing them regularly, you'll be able to more easily maintain a mindset that will help you reach higher levels of success as a leader.


The power to shape our mindset and improve our business lies within our grasp, offering a gateway to enhanced success and daily contentment. As business leaders, recognizing the profound impact our mindset has on those we lead and the outcomes of our endeavors is paramount. Yet, the journey toward a transformative mindset requires more than sheer willpower — it demands the cultivation of habits that nourish positivity, generosity and creativity.By embracing practices like gratitude journaling, fostering a culture of generosity and carving out dedicated time for creativity, we pave the path toward a mindset primed for triumph. Join me in committing to the regular cultivation of habits that elevate not only our own success but also those around us.Related: The 8 Habits of Highly Effective Entrepreneurs

87,How Taking Up Boxing Transformed My Outlook on Entrepreneurship,"Feb 20, 2024",Sam Saideman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-lessons-i-learned-about-entrepreneurship-from-boxing/469096,"
If you pursue anything hard in life, you've likely dealt with sacrifice, whether that's a sacrifice of personal health, mental health, relationships, time or finances. Likely while chasing that goal, one or more of those things have suffered. When asked what surprised him most about humanity, the Dalai Lama said, ""Man. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health."" He goes on to get far more philosophical and far more depressing, but the above quote is a great testament to the power of chasing dreams without being mindful of what you need to not just survive, but thrive.Now, that's not to say making sacrifices in pursuit of goals isn't a good thing — it's usually necessary. But being intentional about what you're giving up for what you're trying to get is how one lives a life without regrets. This is something that has remained relevant in my daily work to become a better leader, and while I've grown over the years of running businesses and learned along the way, nothing has made me grow and learn more than getting in the ring.A little over a year ago, I was reconnecting with an old friend from college, and he mentioned his new fascination with boxing. I had been around it as a teenager with friends pursuing it, but it had never been something I actively took part in. He convinced me to go with him and retry it in my adulthood. New Year's resolution and all, I went, and the rest was history. That one day in Nashville's Fighters Boxing Gym hitting heavy bags sparked an obsession which has resulted in boxing becoming a large line item on my expenses, more than half my laundry and most of my personality.



Here are the three most important lessons I've learned so far from the squared circle.Related: Knockout Personal Branding Strategies From Mayweather and Pacquiao


1. Resiliency is mandatory for successWorking in a startup environment where every deal matters and sparring in boxing are more alike than you think. For one: You have to have thick skin. No matter how much we try to ""cut off the ring"" with better services and have the client ""on the ropes"" with making a purchase decision, sometimes the potential client changes their direction and hires someone else. Those punches, while they may not hurt as much if you focus on each individual hit, but over several rounds, they start to add up. Learning to keep fighting and not accept defeat is how you force the fight to a decision without getting KO'd. In other words, if you're not resilient and you didn't stumble on hidden treasure, you likely won't last long in business.As an entrepreneur of a startup that never took on investment, my back has been against the ropes more times than I can count. This key lesson of staying resilient and not taking ""no"" for an answer has allowed me to stay determined and motivate my team to develop new verticals without having to close shop or lay people off. I attribute my ability to pivot my company to offering influencer marketing campaigns to brands and musicians/labels in a large way to boxing. Staying adaptable and being unwilling to throw in the towel. Boxing took me there.2. Focused time spent learningFocusing on learning is necessary for all great battles. There are no cutting corners on this one. If you don't put the hours in, you won't prevail. That goes for the time in the ring or in the boardroom. You need to work on the basics of being a good leader as much as you need to work on the fundamentals in the gym. Muhammad Ali said, ""The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses — behind the lines, in the gym and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights."" Muhammad Ali would've been great in any profession. If you don't carve out uninterrupted time to improve, you won't improve.In my years as an entrepreneur, I've struggled to find uninterrupted time for growth. Digging into redlines, a client calls me. Working on a proposal, an employee asks me a question. Learning the importance of unavoidable ""offline"" time has made me more demanding of that in the workplace. I am now able to whiteboard, learn about new lanes or do whatever else I need to without compromising or being half distracted. If you're distracted while boxing, you'll feel it (literally). If you're distracted at work, you'll feel it differently — but both are equally detrimental to winning.


Related: 7 Lessons From the Boxing Ring3. Your corner can make or break youA boxer is usually only as good as his corner. To be truly great, you need a great trainer and cut man, just like an entrepreneur needs great leaders within their business and advisors outside of their business. The people you surround yourself with in either realm must be people who can be supportive and are also not afraid to speak their minds when things need improving. I'm far deeper into my entrepreneurial journey than my boxing journey; however, the coaches I've spent my time learning from, hitting mitts with, and sparring at The Punch Club in Los Angeles and Fighters in Nashville, have been the same type of people I try to surround myself with in business. Don't be afraid to make changes if those people aren't the right fit.It's easy in the workplace to be okay with keeping things the way they are. Justifying actions that shouldn't be justified because of busyness. Boxing has taught me that every voice in the room can make or break winning or losing. It's helped me to be more proactive with making changes when things aren't working.So the next time you're exhausted, worried about staying on your feet and the bell rings — or the Google Calendar alarm dings — be ready to fight with everything you've got left. I know I will be.

88,4 Honest Truths That Will Make You a Better Boss,"Feb 16, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-simple-truths-that-will-make-you-a-great-boss/468756,"
At lunch with a potential client recently, he said something interesting: ""Every mistake that is made in my company is ultimately my fault, and yet every win is accredited to me too. It's a weird dynamic, because neither side of this equation is accurate and yet both sides — at least in the public eye — are true."" As the CEO of a team of 15+ team members, I immediately got what he was saying and realized it's part of my daily role.Think about it: The ground-shattering advancements of Apple have historically been attributed to just Steve Jobs. When Tesla stock goes down, it's all Elon Musk's fault. And when people think ""Amazon,"" they think ""Jeff Bezos"" — no other name at all except Bezos. The space heater that didn't arrive the day it was supposed to? Bezos better get on that!But of course, none of this is the case, is it? No single business owner, whether they have a team of 15, 1,500 or 15,000, can possibly be responsible for every single thing that goes on in the company, and they sure as heck aren't responsible for all the things that go right. And yet they're routinely assigned this burden. That's an awful lot of weight on the shoulders of leaders. How you carry it is up to you.



Some truths about being the bossIn my 15 years of running my own PR firm, I've been on both sides of this seesaw. I've sat on the side of a client singing my praises to the skies for a fundraiser that exceeded expectations, and I've also been harshly reprimanded by a client who was sorely disappointed by the lackluster results of their press release pickup. In the first instance, it was my events coordinator who chose the venue, the date, the band, everything; in the second, there's only so much you can do if the media is simply not at all interested in your widget.In both cases, I've had to assess what is real and true for me, and I've come to some conclusions about being responsible for the whole shebang. Interestingly, most of what rings true is about the value of my team, not me.


Related: Don't Let Your Biggest Client Become Your Biggest Nightmare — You Should Fire Them Instead. Here's Why.Truth #1: You can't manage effectively without delegatingEven bosses of small teams know that they can't do every task themselves and have their whole hand in every pie. I'm not advising bird's-eye management, but micromanaging isn't the answer either. You'll limit your vision of the big picture by concentrating too much on the pixels, and you'll stymie your staff to the point of building hostility and resentment.I field about 2,000 emails a day. It just isn't realistic or sustainable for me to have to follow through on each and every one of those emails. I have to forward most of them on for implementation; I have to delegate to manage the workload so my company can succeed and thrive. Delegation means getting things done better and faster than I could ever pull off alone. Delegation makes sense, and it affords room for growth. But when you don't see every single document produced and every single assignment completed, it also means that something can go awry at any time.Truth #2: Some mistakes are not your ownOver the summer, my bags were hugely delayed after a flight. I was livid with the airlines, and when I got home, I sent a strongly worded letter to the head honcho expressing my discontent. The fact of the matter was that it was the contracted baggage handling company at the airport that was at fault, but that didn't matter to me in my anger. I threatened the airline to never fly them again if they didn't shape up.


The same will happen to you. Embarrassing typos that get published. Misstatements by others you wish could be retracted. An employee having a public meltdown one day under extreme stress. You weren't a direct part of any of this — you did not take these missteps. Doesn't matter. Does. Not. Matter. You're in charge, and when a team member makes a mistake (as humans are wont to do), you have to own the mistake as yours. Your staff will not only love you for it, they'll remain loyal. It's not just the right thing to do, it's the only thing to do to maintain morale and support the people who propel your business forward.Related: 7 Mistakes That Make or Break Small BusinessesTruth #3: None of the glory is your ownBosses can easily get a big head when they win a nifty award, slay it at the board meeting or see record profits. Did you earn all this yourself? Do you deserve the credit for all this? No, you absolutely did not and do not.I can't think of one fellow entrepreneur I know who got where they are now just on their own coattails. If we're honest with ourselves, we all know that we simply couldn't proceed and progress without Amanda's diligence, Ty's way with numbers, and Steph's IT prowess. I don't care how proud or excited you are about a worthy accomplishment; you should not only share the laurels but plant them firmly in your team's camp, never your own office. Sometimes, you didn't make the mistake that got you into some hot water for a time. All the time, I'd be willing to bet, you alone didn't bring about the achievement you're celebrating. The celebration belongs to the team that made it happen for your company.


Truth #4: The buck IS yours; take itAll of this is to say that the buck does stop with you. So grab it and put it in your pocket, no one else's. Do not encumber your staff with an affliction they did not mean to create or an onus that is not theirs to bear. Being the boss means holding tight to the reins of leadership when the ride is smooth and when the ride is bumpy.This all comes with time and practice. Accepting the blame and deflecting the credit aren't always easy shifts to make in your mindset — at first, it's natural to get defensive when something goes amiss on your watch that you weren't aware of, and it's equally natural to want to rejoice in your triumphs. But ultimately, it's empowering to train your brain to adjust to this aspect of strong leadership and to overcome initial impulses in lieu of the greater good for your company.A president is a presidentThere are some striking similarities between being the president of an enterprise and being the president of the United States. When things are going swimmingly, the person in charge is lauded for establishing the sunny climate, and when things are floundering, the commander is denounced for the stormy weather. But you can't throw your people under the bus for poor results any more than a sitting president can finger-point at members of his cabinet during a State of the Union address. Both types of presidents need to assume the mantle they have accepted, and that mantle is called accountability.It might just be a mental game you play with yourself — to get comfortable taking responsibility for the bad and not taking responsibility for the good — but it's a game with fair rules. It's a game that protects your players and allows them to shine at the same time. It's a game you can win, and it's a game that every good boss needs to learn to master if they want to become a great leader.

89,How Asynchronous Work Can Help Battle and Eliminate Burnout,"Feb 16, 2024",Tom Medema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-asynchronous-work-can-help-battle-burnout/469374,"
The overall change in workplace dynamics has been widely covered in recent years and for obvious reasons. Due to my professional focus, I have had my fair share of this coverage, but my perspective has mostly been on the positive end of the spectrum. I understand that the generally inquisitive nature of humankind can sometimes lead to heavy questioning and, thus, a naturally slow and tentative adoption of rapid change, but that is why I see it as crucial to highlight benefits that I believe can be massive and that largely arise from this adoption.My professional focus as the founder and CEO of Bubbles revolves around workplace dynamics, and more specifically, asynchronous work environments and the need for optimization of meeting calls that are deemed essential. It represents a quest to adopt revolutionary changes in both general working patterns and behavior, and the improving technology that facilitates it.Now, many view the continued stronghold of remote, asynchronous work negatively, but I am of the opinion that the majority of those holding this view have not fully considered the extent of the benefits. One of them is the impact of asynchronous work environments on burnout and how changing work patterns have impacted our perception and management of workplace stress. To clarify, burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged exposure to stress. Burnout is something that has been of growing concern in work settings, both traditional and (to some extent) modern. Nevertheless, we should all want to reduce or even eliminate burnout. I just specified that the lack of full extent for modern burnout is a concern because of the positive impact of asynchronous work habits.



Nevertheless, there remains a long way to go. To put some numbers to this claim, a 2022 study by Asana that quizzed over 10,000 knowledge workers across seven countries found that around 70% of respondents experienced burnout in the previous year. This is a crazy number, but as I mentioned, if we can all collaborate to increase our expertise and awareness of burnout, I know we can find ways to reduce it, improving our work individually and when working as a team. Let's now explore how this is possible by first gaining more of an understanding of the problem itself.Related: 6 Ways to Avoid Burnout While Working Remote


Understanding burnoutPer the World Health Organization, burnout is a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. Symptoms include energy depletion and increased mental distancing from the job at hand, which all combine to reduce the worker's efficiency. The roots of burnout can be vast but generally encompass excessive work, especially with a lack of control and a subsequent lack of fairness and conflict in values. Burnout can itself be a root of more serious health issues, such as depression, anxiety and cardiovascular issues. A Gallup study found that employees with regular feelings of burnout are 63% more susceptible to sick days and are 2.6 times more likely to be on the new job hunt.Of course, there are a variety of burnout types, from being overloaded to being under-challenged, and technological burnout is also more than possible in the digital age. Still, part of this journey is to recognize that entirely eradicating is unrealistic. Instead, we should see these startling health statistics as a trigger to reduce the prevalence of burnout as much as possible, which is what async working, in my view, has been doing.Related: 5 Tips to Build Mental Fitness Within Your TeamsThe rise of asynchronous workAsynchronous work is a flexible working style where tasks are completed without the need for real-time interaction, and it has gained popularity recently due to the desire to optimize remote working. Flexibility brings control, directly counteracting a root cause of burnout, but also retains or even increases the effectiveness of collaboration, as the async approach allows more deliberation time to communicate those thoughts effectively. Any team member succeeding in achieving this is bound to feel like they are constantly improving their teamwork and team success, which will increase morale and work-life balance, which is pivotal to reducing stress and preventing burnout.


Furthermore, these success stories are becoming ever more common with the rise in async adoption. Speaking from a position of experience with Bubbles, which is partially an asynchronous communication platform, I have heard that my own team, who all pioneer this technology, feel far more comfortable and happy in their collaborative efforts due to the reduced pressure of immediate responses, and flexibility to manage personal responsibilities.From my perspective, implementing asynchronous communication in your team can appeal to every member. Those who are shy and reserved in their input feel less stressed by everyday meetings and conversations, and those who are more boisterous can continue to be so but also have that added flexibility to communicate on their own time. In these instances, the former experiences less stress and, therefore, usually less burnout, and the latter feels less pinned down and restricted to tight timings, potentially, for example, meaning they can attend a gathering or meet with a friend while still ensuring they complete their work. The effect here is a boost in work-life balance and happiness, which hopefully has a mirrored effect.Related: Avoid These 3 Key Mistakes for Team Success in 2024To conclude, asynchronous work environments hold significant potential for reducing workplace burnout through revolutionary shifts in everyday communicative and collaborative patterns. This is not to say that async is a panacea, and the success of these environments in reducing burnout largely hinges on their implementation and management. Nevertheless, the risk of adoption and testing is minimal compared to the reward of unblocking your team from burnout and ensuring a healthy, productive work environment. Therefore, my final words are to move with the trends and explore how beneficial this can be for you and your team.

What does it really mean to Live Más?That's what Taco Bell sought to answer during the fast-food behemoth's first-ever Live Más LIVE! in Las Vegas during Super Bowl LVIII weekend. The brand brought together superfans on social media, professional athletes, media, and longtime customers to unveil its new menu items, programs, and more.""Live Más to me means go for it. Living Más is living your more, and when you live even more, you're unhinged, you're unbridled, you just go for it,"" Taco Bell CEO Sean Tresvant told Entrepreneur. ""Whether that's in my personal life or that's in my business life, just the idea of just trying something and going for it is pretty cool.""

""You have to love your customers, love your consumers — like, really love them,"" Taco Bell CMO Taylor Montgomery told Entrepreneur. ""Think about it, it's like a relationship. When you're creating a brand, you have an obligation to create a relationship with your consumers, just like any other relationship — ask a lot of questions, you've got to listen and admit when you're wrong.""The event was live-streamed so viewers could see the new menu items, but some in-person attendees got to try them all— including me.

91,3 Business Basics to Remember in 2024,"Feb 15, 2024",Paul Burke,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-business-basics-to-remember-in-2024/469360,"
The digital world is obsessed with trends. Trending videos, sounds, images, backgrounds — you name it. Trends change overnight and without notice; act quickly or you'll be left in the dust by the algorithm.As much as capitalizing on a successful trend can lift your business, many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) would benefit from shifting their attention from Hail Marys to the basics of business building. These are principles that no matter the social media platform, algorithm or brand, don't go out of style. They were here yesterday, and they'll be even more valuable tomorrow.Let's dive into a few of the basics that will benefit every SMB in 2024.Related: The 5 Fundamentals for Growing Your Startup1. ResponsivenessWe all have that friend who leaves us on ""read"" for days at a time. We may act like it doesn't hurt our feelings or impact our relationship, but it does.



It's no different in business. Responsiveness to your customers shows respect and prioritization to them. By responding quickly to their needs, you let them know that they will be taken care of and that their problem is your problem. This will naturally benefit retention.""One of our company core values is ""radically serve others"" and all of our customer-facing teams truly take this to heart. This is more than evident when we review our weekly metrics and see our average customer response time low and customer satisfaction rating high every week,"" shares Jerry Tsai, President of Acceptd.Make this a company value by putting metrics around response time. This can include how quickly your team responds to emails, customer service requests or phone calls.2. Be a personHard to believe this qualifies as advice in 2024, but with everything digital, automated and AI-powered, you'll find customers are, more often than not, sick of talking to a robot — or even worse, a customer service rep with the personality of one.


Last year while working in operations for a startup, I handled customer service requests for about a month. My responses were quick and not overly formal, clearly written by a human being. You'd have thought I was curing the world from all its pains based on the feedback I received from people.I also found it interesting that people were far more respectful and reasonable, given that it didn't feel like they were talking to a customer service representative as much as they were a person who was here to help them.Teach your team that, as much as professionalism matters, so does coming across as a real person who wants to help people. Measure the success of your customer service interactions with a survey to understand how one method of engagement might be better than another.Of course, this recommendation does come with caveats. Being personable doesn't cover unprofessional, inappropriate or unhelpful support.Related: 5 Ways to Show Your Customers You Understand Them in a Digital-First World3. Follow upWe're always looking for the next best thing. And with that comes forgetting about leads or prospects that fell through the cracks. If you're not systematically following up with prospects, you're losing business.""People are doing more research than ever and earlier than ever, meaning they might not be ready to move forward when they initially reach out. We found that ⅓ of our leads weren't converting for 2+ months after their first inquiry. That shows the power of following up even months after their first contact,"" says Oakwood Management CEO Keith Jones.If your business is digital-first, extend your automated email sequence another month or two. If your business is lead-generation, this means setting up reminders to call and email prospects until you know they're not in the market for your service anymore.


""Prospects often have many different priorities, and knowing that you care enough to check in with them regularly goes a long way in establishing trust,"" adds Sriharsha Guduguntla, Hyperbound CEO.Trust is developed over time — one reason why following up weeks or months down the road can be such a high-value investment. It shows prospects you are diligent and process-oriented. Bonus points if you can personalize your outreach as much as possible so they know you care and remember their specific circumstance.Related: 4 Insane Truths About Failing to Follow-upThese tips won't take your business to the moon or help you go viral. They aren't talked about on social media by influencers or business gurus. They have been lost in a sea of distractions and trends that pop up one day and disappear the next. That's the biggest benefit of following these tips. They are so rare that you instantly distinguish yourself from your competitors by getting the basics right.


Do the basics at a high level for long enough, and you'll see the results compound through higher retention, better conversion rates, more word of mouth and a stronger business foundation.From there, you'll find you may not even need to chase the latest trends to be successful. Simply focusing on serving your customers is unique enough to achieve success.

92,Why Most Founders and Investors Are Wrong About Disruption,"Feb 15, 2024",Dustin Lemick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-most-founders-are-wrong-about-disruption/469194,"
There's something that every leader needs to understand about disruption: It is always happening.It is always taking place. It can be easy to believe that disruption is limited to once-in-a-lifetime occurrences, where the world is forever changed. Or that it is always mass scale. In reality, everything is always in a state of business change. It can come in many different sizes and forms. It can also happen at any time and anywhere.Yet, disruption is commonly misunderstood. It can be difficult to recognize. A lot of people overlook it or can't see it. There is an overuse of the term. Many believe or claim they're disrupting a market or industry when they are not — or the disruption isn't large or significant enough to make a major impact. Some assume that disruption automatically means technology. It isn't always the case. Innovation typically plays a role, but it can come in many forms.



Your company, market or industry can be disrupted, or a combination of the three. Larger macro issues also take place globally that can spark major changes: economic conditions, geopolitical issues, weather, conflict, currencies, and other factors. It then trickles down to everyone. The only real truism about disruption is that it constantly occurs everywhere. In today's market climate, leaders can gain an in-depth understanding of disruption, when to recognize it, and how to create opportunities when it happens.Related: How to Bounce Back and Succeed During Times of Disruption


Real disruption changes the normal course of an activity, process, or behavior on a mass scale. Airbnb and Uber are great examples. Consumers once predominantly relied on hotels and motels for lodging when traveling. Airbnb changed this; today, consumers are as likely to opt for Airbnb as another option. With Uber, people began to use gig economy drivers instead of taxis or other traditional means. It significantly impacted the transportation business. These two case studies illustrate major changes that challenged an industry's fundamentals. The COVID-19 lockdown was a large global issue that incited a giant fundamental shift. Companies had to change how they operated dramatically — what they offered, how they served customers, led employees and generated revenue. It forged entirely new ways of doing business. In all these scenarios, genuine disruption was at play.What are the tell-tale signs of disruption? Are there ways to detect when disruption is occurring? How can you tell if your business or idea is truly disruptive? An excellent general rule is to look at your market leader/incumbent. If the market leader is copying your offering or that of another disruptor, it can be a clear sign – i.e., replicating tactics, products, services, etc.It is likely a signal that the market leader is losing position. Challenging market leaders can be a place to identify where disruption is needed or likely to occur – i.e., what isn't working, what could be done better or differently, what is outdated, etc. Additionally, disruption is a new technology, tool, or process that your industry is adapting to. Shifts in outputs can also be a form. These are just a few examples of what can indicate disruptive change is underway or on the horizon.It's also important to determine if the disruption you're witnessing is large or small and whether it can make an impact. This is particularly relevant if you're an investor or looking for investment capital. Investors typically want to disrupt big things to get big rewards. They want big problems and solutions. Is something disruptive creating or solving a problem, and if so, how big is it? Investors want to know whether disruption will be valuable at an appropriate scale.


Recognizing disruption requires an open mind. In many instances, people can't believe or see something is disruptive at first. They think the idea is foolish or won't work. Disruption is usually caused by something that hasn't existed before or something new. Airbnb is a great example here as well. Its founders are said to have gone to every venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and were famously laughed out of meetings. People couldn't see what they saw — it hadn't been invented yet. Even the most seasoned business leaders can misunderstand and mistake disruption or fail to recognize it.Related: 3 Mindset Shifts Every Disruptor Must HaveDisruption doesn't always mean extinction. History has proven this for countless companies, processes, products, services, and ideas. Organizations can collapse after big changes. They did not or could not adapt. But something new or different tends to fill in the gap. It's often better, and the cycle continues. I have been on both sides of disruption at my company, BriteCo. We are one of the jewelry industry's disruptors – we were the first to move jewelry consumers to 100% paperless processes with technology and the internet. We also provide our customers with different ways to buy our coverage, unique to BriteCo, versus an outdated analog process at the retail point of sale. Yet, we still face disruption by the latest emerging technologies and innovations — ChatGPT and GenAI are good examples.Your ability to adapt to disruption begins first with recognizing it and determining its size and scale. Then, you must gauge its potential impact on you and your business. This can enable you to adapt more effectively and better decide if you need to take action. And, most importantly, help you navigate and succeed despite whatever change comes.

93,Lack of Trust — What Does It Do to Your Company? Here's What Leaders Need to Know.,"Feb 15, 2024",Greg Davis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/lack-of-trust-what-does-it-do-to-your-company/469215,"
Trust is the cornerstone of any successful organization, especially when it comes to scaling up. A lack of trust within a company can lead to numerous challenges, undermining the organization's potential for growth. It not only affects the internal dynamics but also has far-reaching implications on how the company is perceived externally. Understanding these implications is crucial for businesses aiming to grow and thrive in today's competitive market.What do modern business leaders need to know about trust and how to foster transparency in the current landscape?Related: Trust Should Be the Foundation of Your Business — Here's How to Earn It.



1. Turnover will be an ever-present issueHigh turnover rates are often a direct consequence of a lack of trust within a company. Employees who do not trust their leadership or feel undervalued are more likely to seek opportunities elsewhere. This turnover not only disrupts the workflow but also incurs significant costs in terms of recruiting and training new staff. Furthermore, frequent personnel changes can lead to a loss of institutional knowledge and negatively impact team dynamics.In addition, high turnover can create a negative reputation for the company in the job market. Prospective talents might be deterred from joining an organization known for its high employee turnover. This can create a vicious cycle where the best talents are lost to competitors, further hampering the company's ability to scale. Establishing trust is crucial to maintaining a stable and committed workforce.


2. The loss of intellectual property will be detrimentalA lack of trust can lead to the loss of valuable intellectual property (IP). Employees who don't feel valued or trusted might not take the necessary precautions to safeguard sensitive information. This can result in leaks of proprietary data, harming the company's competitive edge. In addition, distrust can lead to a lack of open collaboration, which is essential for innovation.In scenarios where employees leave the company due to distrust, there's a risk they might take their knowledge or even trade secrets with them. This not only affects the company's current projects but also its future endeavors. Protecting IP is fundamental for companies, especially in high-tech and creative industries, and trust plays a pivotal role in this protection. Hence, fostering a culture of trust is essential to safeguard a company's intellectual assets.3. A lack of succession planning is a red flagIn companies without trust, succession planning becomes a significant challenge. Without trust, leadership might hesitate to delegate responsibilities or groom future leaders, fearing for their position or the misuse of power. This lack of succession planning can lead to chaos when key personnel leave or retire, hindering the company's stability and growth.In addition, a clear succession plan is a sign of a healthy, forward-thinking organization. The absence of such planning can demotivate ambitious employees who see no clear path to advancement within the company. This can further exacerbate turnover issues and prevent the company from developing strong leaders from within, which is crucial for long-term sustainability and scaling.


Related: 5 Ways to Build a Culture of Transparency4. Lack of transparency will cripple growthWhen trust is lacking, transparency in communicating the company's goals and strategies becomes a major casualty. Employees who are not privy to the company's vision or direction can feel disconnected and unmotivated. This lack of alignment between employee efforts and company goals can lead to inefficiency and a waste of resources.In the absence of transparency, rumors and misinformation can flourish, leading to confusion and mistrust among staff. It becomes challenging for employees to align their individual goals with those of the company, which is essential for a cohesive and productive work environment. A transparent culture, fostered by trust, is key to ensuring that everyone is working towards a common goal, thus facilitating scaling and growth.5. Quality, performance and productivity will declineA workplace lacking in trust is often characterized by decreased quality, performance and productivity. Employees who do not trust their leaders or colleagues may not feel compelled to put forth their best effort, leading to subpar work. This decline in quality can be detrimental to the company's reputation and customer satisfaction.


Furthermore, distrust can lead to excessive micromanagement, stifling employee creativity and initiative. This environment hampers innovation and can slow down processes, further affecting productivity. Companies striving for growth must recognize the importance of trust in enhancing performance and maintaining high standards of quality.Related: You Can't Lead Effectively Without TrustIn the end, the importance of trust in a company's growth trajectory cannot be overstated. It is a vital ingredient for fostering a positive workplace culture, ensuring employee retention, protecting intellectual property and facilitating effective succession planning.Companies that prioritize trust and transparency will find themselves better positioned to navigate the complexities of scaling in the modern business world. Thus, building and maintaining trust should be a key strategic goal for any organization looking to scale successfully. Business leaders should not hesitate to reach out to experts who can help ensure a culture of trust.

Andy Reid is undoubtedly one of the best coaches the NFL has ever had. Although I am certainly not a football historian, even a cursory view of his accomplishments reveals a man at the top of his profession. He has three Superbowl rings, is the only coach in history to win 100 games for two different franchises, has an almost certain future date with the Hall of Fame — the list goes on.By all accounts, he is a great coach.

95,Why the National Football League Is a Leader in Social and Corporate Impact,"Feb 14, 2024",Craig Kielburger,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/why-the-nfl-is-a-leader-in-social-impact/469239,"
The expectations for this year's Super Bowl were high, but I don't think anyone predicted that this year's event would turn out to be America's most-watched program since the moon landing, with an astounding 123.4 million viewers tuning in to the big game.While the Taylor Swift effect certainly was a factor in achieving that staggering number, there is more to the modern NFL than celebrity fans, touchdowns and tailgate parties. The league has grown into a case study for a corporation seeking to support its communities across the country.The NFL has been a long-time supporter of charitable causes, but in recent years, it has significantly ramped up its player safety, social responsibility and social justice initiatives.



A visit to the NFL's Community page on its website shows the breadth of the league's initiatives, from environmental sustainability to domestic violence education, youth fitness, early cancer detection and prevention, and building character in young people.I learned of the massive scope of the NFL's social responsibility work through another of its initiatives, Inspire Change, the league's social justice platform. Its goal is to reduce barriers to opportunity, particularly in communities of color. It operates at all levels of the league, from current and former players to the NFL teams and their owners and up to the league head office.


Related: A Former NFL Plays Says 'Indentity Shifting' Is the Key to SuccessInspire Change facilitates NFL investment in organizations, programs and initiatives that reduce barriers to opportunity, anchored in four pillars: Education, Economic Advancement, Community-Police Relations, and Criminal Justice Reform.My connection to the program came from a partnership between Inspire Change, my organization (Legacy+), and the Martin Luther King III Foundation.Martin Luther King III, his wife Arndrea Waters King, and their daughter Yolanda Renee King were seeking ways to commemorate the upcoming 100th birthday of Martin's father, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The result was Realize the Dream, a bold new initiative that aims to transform, unify and uplift America by rallying communities to perform 100 million hours of service by the 100th anniversary of Dr. King's birth.


In seeking to amplify Dr. King's vision of unity and launch the historic community service program, the NFL was an obvious choice. No other platform has the reach or worldwide profile held by the NFL. In 2023, the league averaged 17.2 million viewers per game for its 272 regular season games, creating a potential viewing audience unmatched in North America.Those significant audience numbers rise exponentially during the playoffs, so we worked closely with the NFL to launch the five-year service campaign during Wildcard Weekend, which coincided with MLK Day 2024.The game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Tampa Bay Buccaneers opened with a commemorative coin toss with Martin Luther King III, Arndrea Waters King and Yolanda Renee King.A series of events and activations took place over the weekend, with MLK decals and Dr. King's iconic ""Be Love"" message affixed to the helmets of all 318 players participating in the weekend games. The ""Be Love"" and ""It Takes All of Us"" messages were also stenciled into the end zones for all games.


The game opened by the Kings drew an audience of over 29.2 million viewers. While that number seems low compared to the viewership for the Super Bowl, the game was ESPN's second-most watched NFL game in its history. Public service announcements aired over the weekend on all the networks covering the games (ESPN, ABC and CBS), with over 180 million viewers taking in the games and viewing the powerful Realize the Dream messaging.Beyond its ability to reach tens of millions of viewers, we looked for the NFL's support due to its work to raise awareness on diversity and equity issues. Along with Inspire Change, the league is on the record in committing to increasing the number of black head coaches and executives so that the diversity on the field is reflected back on the sidelines and in owners' boxes.To that end, the league adopted the Rooney Rule in 2003. Named after a former Pittsburgh Steelers owner who also served as the chair of the league's diversity committee, the rule set out hiring and interview requirements for filling coaching and front office positions to ensure more minority candidates were considered and hired.Related: Why All of Us Need to Join the Fight for Workplace Diversity


The NFL's support for Realize the Dream is yet another positive step in accelerating the league's commitment to diversity and inclusion, and it may already be reaping benefits.Within days of the launch of the campaign, the New England Patriots named Jerod Mayo as their new head coach, the Atlanta Falcons hired Raheem Morris to lead their team, and the Las Vegas Raiders elevated interim head coach Antonio Pierce to full-time status.While those three hirings happening so close to the launch of Realize the Dream could be written off as coincidence, they may also reflect how the league's open commitment to diversity can influence the actions of ownership, teams, and players.That is the power of corporate impact initiatives that permeate an entire organization. It would be one thing for the NFL to make a lump sum donation to Realize the Dream or some other cause, but the level of buy-in was visible on team uniforms and helmets, in the end zones on the field, all while tens of millions of viewers watched from homes and restaurants.


While corporations making donations to charitable organizations is a commendable way to try and give back, concrete actions like those being taken by the NFL deliver true impact and will ultimately be the drivers of change.

96,Understanding Your Personality Type Can Make You a More Successful Entrepreneur. Here's How.,"Feb 14, 2024",Rachel Cubas-Wilkinson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-understanding-your-personality-type-can-make-you-a/468941,"
Entrepreneurs play a vital role in the global economy by spearheading innovation, fostering job creation and pioneering entire industries. By helping entrepreneurs understand themselves, insights into personality type can help them operate more efficiently, resulting in tangible advantages to the economy and society at large (not to mention their employees).Psychometric assessment can be a powerful tool for providing insight into how entrepreneurs tend to operate and what makes them tick. A recent study by my firm found a relationship between an individual's Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®) personality type and the attributes they perceive as either aiding or hindering their success as an entrepreneur.In this article, I'll explore how type preference can give clues to areas that entrepreneurs can either leverage or that they need to pay attention to. But first, let's look at some of the more general characteristics typically exhibited by entrepreneurs, and how they may impact performance.



Related: Your Personality Type Determines Your Leadership Potential. Here's How to Find It – And Unlock Its Full Power.General attributes contributing to success or failureMy firm's research found that entrepreneurs displayed a notably greater inclination toward creativity, risk-taking, impulsivity and autonomy. Likewise, the businesses they lead tend to be less structured and hierarchical than typical organizations.


While there can be clear positive aspects to these characteristics and this approach to business, the study indicates that entrepreneurs might be placing excessive emphasis on passion, enthusiasm and cooperation. Conversely, they might be undervaluing the more practical aspects of business such as administrative tasks, attention to detail, marketing and sales. Similarly, those who expressed dislike for data, statistics, finance-related matters and networking tended to demonstrate comparatively poorer performance.While these findings might provide a general starting point for self-improvement, I've observed in my own consulting that these sorts of descriptions are usually a little too vague to be actionable. However, when people begin to understand the nuances regarding how these descriptions may play out according to their own personality type, they can be addressed in much more tangible ways.According to the MBTI model, personality can be described by preferences along the following dimensions:Extraversion or Introversion (E-I), which describes people's orientation toward the outer world and how they gain/focus their energySensing or Intuition (S-N), which reflects one's preference for how they take in informationThinking or Feeling (T-F) which describes people's emphasis on either the tasks and logical consequences or personal/social values in their decision-making processesJudging or Perceiving (J-P), which describes whether people tend to orient themselves toward the outer world in a more decisive and planned or flexible and spontaneous wayLet's explore, according to a few different MBTI personality types, inherent entrepreneurial strengths that can contribute to success as well as aspects that, if left unattended, could potentially hinder it.


The entrepreneurial approach of the conserver (ISTJ, ISFJ) Those with favorite processes of Introverted Sensing often tend toward being detail-oriented, knowledgeable, structured, organized, focused, reliable, punctual and natural avoiders of procrastination. However, as the study notes, these individuals may want to exercise caution regarding their potential:Propensity toward risk aversion that could lead to missed opportunitiesHesitation in making critical decisions and temptation to engage in less strategically significant activities as a form of displacementFor example, imagine an ambitious tech startup founder who possesses a wealth of knowledge in their field and is incredibly detail-oriented, organized and reliable. Despite these clear advantages, their risk-averse nature and hesitation in decision-making pose challenges as they navigate the unpredictable startup landscape.


Recognizing the need to fine-tune their entrepreneurial skills, they might seek out specific training focusing on strategic thinking and decision-making under uncertainty. Successful training would enable them to learn to reframe their perspective on risk, understanding that they can parlay their natural talent for detail and structure into calculated risk-taking. It would also help them learn methodologies to analyze and prioritize tasks critical to a startup's success, avoiding the trap of postponing strategically significant actions.As they apply these newfound skills, they'll evolve into a more dynamic and well-rounded entrepreneur, striking a balance between their meticulous, detail-oriented nature and a more strategic, risk-embracing mindset.Related: What Your Personality Type Says About Your Career Destiny (Infographic)The entrepreneurial approach of the explorer (ENFP, ENTP)At the other end of the spectrum, those with favorite processes of Extraverted Intuition may show strong social confidence, evidenced by a robust network of contacts. Moreover, they may be well-served by curiosity, innovation, willingness to explore novel approaches and embrace risks, adaptability and generally enthusiastic demeanor. However, they may also possess a:


Tendency to get easily distracted from the tedium of administrative tasks which could lead to overlooking errors, including in financial mattersDislike for structured approaches that may produce disorganizationSusceptibility to distraction from critical immediate tasks by new and intriguing ideasFor instance, consider an entrepreneur leading their own innovative tech startup who's known for their social confidence and an extensive network of contacts within the industry. Their curiosity, innovative spirit and enthusiasm that initially drove the creation of their company, however, walk hand-in-hand with challenges that make them less effective in managing the administrative aspects of the business.


Recognizing this, they seek training focusing on enhancing their organizational skills, attention to detail and time management.During the training sessions, they address the inclination to overlook details in financial and administrative matters, focusing on tools and techniques for effective management. Additionally, they explore how to improve their approach to structured planning. To mitigate their aversion to structure, they focus on flexible planning methodologies and creating adaptable yet comprehensive plans that allow for creativity while maintaining organizational coherence.As they implement these strategies and techniques, they develop an approach that is flexible yet structured, allowing them to maintain organization while fostering innovation and remaining diligent in overseeing detailed matters and administrative tasks.Tying it all together with a personality type-based approachThese two scenarios are, of course, only descriptive of four of the sixteen MBTI types. But in either of these cases, understanding of type offers important clues as to how they'll likely fall prey to some of the pitfalls common to entrepreneurs running their own businesses.


By understanding their key entrepreneurial strengths and vulnerabilities, they can take a tailored approach to their growth areas, while leaning into their strengths and preferences. In some cases, this involves identifying a somewhat modified approach to an area of concern that, rather than forcing them to be something they're not, allows them to flex comfortably to be what their company needs.Related: 10 Personality Traits of Legendary Entrepreneurs

97,3 Big Reasons Why Leaders Should Embrace the Joy of Missing Out,"Feb 14, 2024",Heather McLeod,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-big-reasons-why-leaders-should-embrace-the-joy-of-missing/469092,"
As a high achiever, your to-do list will expand to fill the space you give it. You can see the value in every opportunity, and the fear of missing out (FOMO) is powerful. As an ambitious leader, I'm always thinking about how to maximize my time. You probably are, too. But are you missing out on life's quiet moments? The ones that spark creativity and build resilience? Embracing the joy of missing out (JOMO) is my unlikely professional development recommendation. Choosing fulfillment over FOMO gives me space to trust my team and the time to reconnect with my priorities.I credit one of the leaders on my team with teaching me about JOMO. Her decision to reframe ""fear"" into ""joy"" allows her to maintain a healthy work-life balance and enjoy a more intentional experience of freedom than most people I know. Spurred on by her example, I decided to log off during a recent vacation. For eight business days, I didn't check my email. I deleted the email app from my cell. I was fully present for my trip, and my loved ones and I returned to the office as a JOMO evangelist.Ultimately, knowing and modeling that ""less"" can be ""more"" will make you a better leader. Here's why.Related: Once a Month This CEO Kicks Staffers Out of the Office. Here's Why.1. Focus and creativity flourish with restOur attention spans are decreasing. The average person shifts focus on a screen every 47 seconds. Every time the focus shifts, our brains must start from the beginning of the new task. We make more mistakes, and it takes longer to complete a task. Plus, endless hustle can stifle creativity and innovation, which is a concern for 60% of leaders. Our base level of distraction is the real productivity-killer. Combatting it takes effort. Enter JOMO.



Traditional understandings of ""maximizing time"" might be hurting productivity instead of helping. While collaboration can be a tremendous source of creativity in the workplace, tougher problems require more time for the brain to make connections and form new, big ideas.Science shows that intentional breaks, even very short ones, help our brains better process all the information we're juggling at any given time. A mind that's given the time to wander intentionally is free to solve complex problems.Related: 9 Ways to Rewire Your Brain for Creativity2. Disconnecting from the hustle fuels deeper connections with yourself and othersThe always-on mentality can drown out the very things that make work meaningful. Focusing too narrowly on the day-to-day work and stressors can leave us feeling disconnected from our inner selves. Intentional disengagement and embracing JOMO gives us the space for introspection and self-awareness. We remember what we care most about and what really motivates us.


The highlights of my career so far aren't KPIs; they're relationships. From franchise owners I've helped reach new heights to nurturing blossoming leaders on my own team, it's all about people. That goes for most businesses, too. Performance boils down to trust and authenticity. To show up as your authentic self, you must cultivate self-awareness and interrogate your values: Who are you, really? The opportunity for this kind of thinking doesn't come up during the average workday. You have to make the choice to pause and reflect. You have to opt to miss out on doing something from your to-do list.Learning that it's OK not to be in every meeting is an exercise in trust. When you have strong relationships on your team and across departments, you can rely on their good judgment to pull you in when necessary.3. Modeling resilience-boosting habits has a ripple effect on teamsEmbracing ""less"" is imperative for leaders who want to have a collaborative, supportive and high-performing team. Chasing achievement can be exhilarating, but over time, the perception that success demands a 24/7 schedule takes its toll. According to Gallup research, people are more likely to leave a job due to culture or work-life balance problems than for better pay.Overall, employees are more disengaged than they were just a few years ago, and 1 in 4 employees is experiencing signs of burnout. A good leader can help prevent burnout (and all its costs) by walking the walk with their teams. When leaders normalize setting boundaries, it empowers their team to do the same.


Related: These Invisible Energy-Draining Habits Are Making You — And Your Team — Less ProductiveChoose fulfillment over FOMO and reap the rewards""More"" is a defining characteristic of work for high achievers and leaders: more emails, more meetings, more urgent decisions, more ways to connect, more opportunities to make a difference. Honestly, I thrive with all that ""more."" That's why I have to be so intentional about saying ""no"" to some of the pressure.By making the conscious decision to miss out sometimes, we create space to remember who we are and what really matters. There is so much satisfaction to be found in focus and intentional choices. Work is not the most important thing we do. The time we spend with the people who love us is what really matters.

98,Why Leaders Need to Stop Using These Phrases if They Want to Communicate With Their Team,"Feb 13, 2024",Karen Brown,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-older-leaders-need-to-stop-using-these-phrases/468966,"
In today's diverse and multi-generational workplace, the way leaders communicate can significantly impact their effectiveness and the cohesion of their teams. One aspect of this communication that is often overlooked is the potential disconnect from the use of language, particularly when there is a significant age difference between leaders and their team members.The language of leadership across generationsLeadership is as much about inspiring and guiding as it is about communicating. When there is a generational gap between leaders and their team members, particularly when older leaders manage several different generations or much younger leaders, language can bridge or widen this gap. Terms and phrases that were commonplace and resonated with one generation may seem outdated or irrelevant to another. For instance, idioms or cultural references that are second nature to a Baby Boomer may be completely foreign or even amusing to a Millennial or Gen Z team member.Related: 5 Hacks to Capture Your Gen Z Audience



The use of antiquated phrases or references by leaders may not only confuse, but could also inadvertently signal a disconnect with the current cultural and social milieu that younger generations inhabit. This can make leaders appear less relatable or not get the point across at all, undermining their effectiveness.For example…


If you're looking for some examples of antiquated phrases or words that might not connect with younger team members, they're not hard to find. Some of our favorites can be found in this article from HR Magazine. Here are some of the ones that are particularly ""disengaging.""""Circle Back"": This term is often used to mean revisiting a topic or discussion at a later time. Younger people might prefer terms like ""revisit"" or ""discuss again later.""""Boots on the Ground"": This phrase, with military origins, refers to having people physically present in a field or market area. Younger individuals might simply say ""team in the field"" or ""people on site.""""Synergy"": While still used in business contexts, younger workers might find this term overused or vague, preferring more specific terms like ""collaboration"" or ""teamwork.""""Dial into a Call"" refers to joining a conference call, a phrase that harks back to the era of rotary phones. Younger people might say, ""Join a call,"" or ""Log into a meeting.""""Par for the Course"": This golf metaphor means something is normal or expected. Younger people might say ""typical"" or ""usual.""""Run It Up the Flagpole"" means presenting an idea and seeing if it gets approval. Younger colleagues might say, ""Test an idea"" or ""Get feedback.""""Low-Hanging Fruit"": Refers to tasks or goals that are easily achievable. Young people might describe these as ""easy wins"" or ""quick gains.""Related: 10 Phrases That Need to Be Banned From the OfficeUnderstanding the language barrierUnderstanding what's at stake when communication falters across generational lines is crucial. Language is a powerful tool that shapes not only how we express our thoughts but also how we perceive the world around us. When leaders use language that seems antiquated to younger team members, it can create a sense of ""us"" versus ""them,"" fostering an environment where younger employees feel misunderstood or undervalued.Furthermore, language is closely tied to cultural trends, technological advancements, and social norms, all evolving rapidly. Leaders who fail to adapt their communication style may struggle to engage effectively with younger team members who are more in tune with current trends and digital communication norms.


The impact on team dynamicsThe implications of a language disconnect in the workplace extend beyond mere misunderstandings. It can have a tangible impact on team dynamics, employee engagement and productivity. Younger team members might feel alienated or less inclined to approach leaders with ideas or concerns, leading to a breakdown in essential communication channels within the team. This alienation can manifest in decreased morale, lower job satisfaction, and, ultimately, a higher turnover rate among team members.On the other hand, leaders who make an effort to understand and adapt to the evolving linguistic landscape can create an inclusive and dynamic work environment. Such leaders are often perceived as more empathetic, approachable, and in tune with their team's needs, fostering a culture of open communication and mutual respect.Adapting leadership communicationsAdapting to a changing linguistic landscape doesn't mean leaders must adopt every new slang term or meme that emerges on social media. However, it does require a conscious effort to understand different generations' communication preferences and cultural touchpoints. This adaptation might involve:Staying Informed: Keeping abreast of current trends, popular culture, and the digital platforms where other generations spend their time can provide valuable insights into their world.Active Listening: Engaging in active listening demonstrates respect and a willingness to understand, helping bridge any communication gaps.Language Flexibility: Being flexible with language and open to using simpler, more direct forms of communication can make interactions more effective.Cultural Sensitivity Training: Regular training sessions can help leaders and team members appreciate and understand the diverse perspectives within their team.Feedback Mechanisms: Encouraging feedback from team members about communication styles can give leaders insights into how they're perceived and how to improve.Embracing the changeThe dynamic nature of language in the workplace reflects the broader societal changes. Leaders who embrace this change and try to adapt are more likely to foster a collaborative and inclusive work environment. It's essential to recognize that adapting one's communication style is not about compromising professionalism or core values; instead, it's about enhancing the ability to connect and engage with a diverse team.


The role of younger team membersWhile much of the onus is on leaders to adapt, younger team members also have a role to play. They can help bridge the gap by being patient, understanding the context of different communication styles, and, when necessary, helping to translate or explain current trends and terminologies.The bottom line is that while a disconnect in language and communication style between generations can pose challenges, it also presents an opportunity for growth and learning on both sides.

""Be nice, be clean, and be present."" This is the mantra of Philip and Sibs Harrell, owners of Sundae Scoop, a mom-and-pop ice cream shop in Virginia Beach, Virginia.Customer service is the number one priority for these business owners. Whether chatting with customers or selecting and training staff, Philip and Sibs focus on creating an inviting community space for friends and families to gather.Related: 7 Essentials of Great Customer Service



""At the end of the day, being in the community is what an ice cream shop is about,"" Philip said. ""We represent every culture that's in our area. That's where the ube ice cream comes from, or the coquito, or rum raisin. Each one of those [flavors] is gonna respond or touch something in someone that they remember from their childhood.""Sundae Scoop's warm and engaging customer service has earned the business a 4.8-star Yelp rating with nearly 100 reviews (at the time of writing). Most reviewers discuss positive experiences they've had interacting with Philip and his friendly staff, including Yelp Elite Aneesa P.


Arriving right after the store had opened for the day, Aneesa chatted with Philip as she ordered her ice cream. He shared the story of the shop, helped her pick out the perfect gluten-free flavor, and even helped her snap the perfect photos and videos to accompany her review.""I felt like we really connected,"" Aneesa said. ""He wasn't just like 'Here's your ice cream. Go.' He was like, 'Hey, I want to let you know, behind the scenes, the story of how I came up with this idea.'""Philip and Sibs see positive reviews like Aneesa's as a key tool for boosting staff morale. When a scooper gets called out by name for contributing to a positive customer experience, Philip and Sibs are the first to let them know.""They're young kids. They're very self-conscious,"" Sibs said. ""So it feels really good when people give them their big-ups and name them.""


Philip and Sibs spend a lot of time not only encouraging existing staff but also hiring scoopers who will contribute to Sundae Scoop's hospitable culture. They ask all job candidates to thoroughly read the reviews and take note of what people love most about the shop. They want to make sure all new and potential hires are ready to deliver the peppy, friendly service Sundae Scoop promises.Related: How Chef JJ Started a Rice Bowl Revolution in HarlemAs a community-driven space, Sundae Scoop is active in the Virginia Beach area, partnering with local schools and businesses on events like ice cream socials. Philip and Sibs are also committed to mentoring fellow small business owners, connecting with other businesses through community groups and promoting them on the walls of their shop. In his three years running Sundae Scoop, Philip has helped three other businesses get off the ground.""They took the risk too. They took that leap of faith,"" he said. ""So if someone like myself or my wife can come along and help them on their journey, that's all the better because it's building a stronger community.""


Philip has found these relationships especially important to cultivate as a Black business owner. He speaks to the fear of the unknown that can surface in the Black business owner community when you don't know who to turn to or what resources are out there.Related: 3 Strategies This Vietnamese Noodle Shop Has Used to Thrive in Minnesota""I always encourage people just to join something,"" he said. ""You gotta find something bigger than yourself. You have to find people who look like you, and you have to find people who don't look like you. And you need to be able to use advice from all of them and put it together.""Supporting Black-owned businesses was part of Aneesa's motivation to visit Sundae Scoop. Being one of a handful of Black women in her field, she was able to connect with Philip over what it's like to be successful in a white-dominated space. Aneesa stressed the importance of writing reviews to ensure that great Black-owned businesses don't get closed down due to a lack of support.


""We all have to support each other, not bring each other down,"" she said. ""[It's] really important to me to be able to let everybody know, 'Hey, we can own all of these spaces and also be successful as well.'""Philip and Sibs remind themselves every day of their commitment to being groundbreakers in their community with a mural on the wall of Sundae Scoop. This reimagining of the famous painting ""Under the Wave off Kanagawa"" represents a line from artist and rapper Tobe Nwigwe's song ""EAT"" that reads: ""[We] don't just ride the wave, we create it.'""""[Sundae Scoop] is our way of creating our own waves, of making our own path and making sure that we're going to be okay,"" Philip said. ""At the end of the day, just be good, support each other, and help each other where you can, and I can almost promise you that it's going to come back your way.""In addition to the power of warm and engaging customer service, Sundae Scoop believes:Reviews are the roadmap to success. Positive feedback can be used to set key expectations for staff, and critical feedback can be used to make important changes to operations or processes that make the customer experience easier or more enjoyable.Friendly staff play an important role in creating positive customer experiences, and training them on your processes and values is a key part of your customer service strategy. Hire a diverse team of employees who are dedicated to delivering your business's mission.Minority-owned small businesses need to support each other. By guiding and mentoring others, business owners can pave the way for a flourishing Black-owned business community.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Philip, Sibs, and Aneesa, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora, and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl

101,3 Ways to Build a Culture of Radical Honesty (and How It Can Transform Your Business),"Feb 7, 2024",Andrew Schaap,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-build-a-culture-of-radical-honesty-and-why-you/468889,"
What keeps me up at night? Watermelons.As a CEO, my biggest fear is that the digital dashboards capturing my company's vital signs are the business equivalent of that tropical fruit — green and firm on the outside, but red and mushy underneath. At first glance, everything looks solid. Then one morning, I get a call from a client asking, ""What the hell is going on with A, B or C?""This concern isn't fair to my team, who consistently exceed my expectations. But the reality is that for many leaders, such nagging fears can persist. When there's a problem, the last thing you want is for people to give you the impression — intentionally or not — that things are better than they truly are. So, how do you avoid this?



For the past few years, I've led a company in an industry facing astronomical demand. One of the biggest lessons: The agility, operational excellence and innovation required to meet this challenge requires building a culture of radical honesty.Here are three ways that leaders and their teams can embrace radical honesty — and reap the benefits of better decision-making and a true picture of where the business stands.


Related: How to Employ Radical Candor in the Workplace With 5 Simple StepsEncourage your people to admit their weaknesses — and play to their strengthsA simple formula for business success: Do things consistently better than the competition, and those wins will compound over time. The key to pulling it off? Let people focus on their strengths and delegate everything else.That calls for honesty and transparency. ""Fake it till you make it"" doesn't always work in business, where pretending can have disastrous consequences. As a leader, I want people to do the opposite — by asking for help and saying, ""I don't know.""One way to do this is by empowering and trusting team members to be rock stars in their domain. That makes our company better at creating innovative technologies, tackling new markets and responding nimbly to changing conditions.


But at the same time, as I urge people to lean into their strengths, I give them permission to be less adept at other things. For example, if a member of my leadership team is no good at financial underwriting, I tell them to own it like a badge of honor.After all, that's what hiring is for. To make up for their lack of knowledge and expertise in a particular area, we can bring on someone to fill the gap. It's my job as CEO to explain that the goal isn't to undermine or replace them, but to help them focus on what they do best.There's a direct line between that mindset and business results. In one study, companies whose CEOs excelled at delegating grew more than twice as fast as those with a less skilled delegator at the helm.Don't default to the rulebookFor leaders, honesty is nearly always the best policy, even if it means ruffling a few feathers or going against convention.


Sometimes this requires poking holes in well-intentioned ideas that also happen to be intellectually lazy. This came up recently in a chat with my team about how we plan to meet the demand that AI is creating in our industry. While some of the ideas presented were sound, others needed more probing.Take the argument for keeping someone in a management role because they've done the job forever. Many companies default to this way of thinking, but what if they're overlooking a newer hire with a fresh perspective and a natural ability to inspire the team? To me, sticking with option A isn't an intellectually honest approach.As hard as it is, leaders can't escape making these kinds of tough decisions. Without abandoning all loyalty to people, they should consider what's best for the business and make pragmatic rather than emotional choices. Even if those decisions aren't always popular.In a broader sense, being intellectually honest means knowing when adhering to the rulebook is hurting the company, not helping it. For example, I'm a big believer in hiring top talent, telling them where our True North is, and then letting them figure out the best way forward. If somebody needs a course correction, that can be addressed. But expecting the entire team to follow every company rule to the letter? That will only slow us down.


Related: Stop Lying to Your Team — And Yourself. Try Radical Honesty Instead.Give the team a license to speed without getting a ticketLeading with radical honesty also requires getting real with yourself and your team about how willing you are to embrace failure.At our latest companywide offsite, I told people I want them to fail more. For a business, that isn't as risky as it might sound. Companies that are serious about innovation should be willing to try new things and pivot fast if they don't work.Take Airbnb, which didn't begin by building an elaborate home rental website. Instead, the founders tested the waters by renting out their own loft online. Google Glass — released by a company famous for its ""moonshots"" — is a good example of a failed experiment. When its smart glasses didn't catch fire with consumers, Google moved on.


Encouraging creative destruction means removing the fear of failure, a major cause of inaction. Within reason, people should be able to fail out loud without worrying they'll get fired.For me as a leader, there's little risk because I've hired talented people who are laser-focused on executing well. All they really need is a license to speed without getting a ticket.Unfortunately, many business leaders don't see things that way. Despite all the rhetoric around moving fast and breaking things, less than half of companies have a leadership team that regularly tolerates small-scale failures, according to a recent global survey of CEOs.Someone should explain to them that the rewards of letting people fail can be substantial. In a study of 120 tech startups, those committed to learning from failure produced greater scientific output, raised more capital and innovated more.


Of course, businesses must also know when to play it safe. For Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, there's a big difference between ""experimental failure"" (good) and ""operational failure"" (bad). It's the same at my company, where the mission-critical computer and electrical systems that power our facilities don't leave much room for error. But even there we get creative — for example, by finding innovative ways to keep the lights on during a blackout.Related: How to Allow Room for Failure and Create a Successful Work EnvironmentFor leaders and their teams, the biggest benefit of a culture of radical honesty is the elimination of fear: that employees will get into trouble for taking risks, that folks aren't good enough at their jobs or that the company is actually on shaky ground.Ultimately, ensuring that everyone knows where they and the organization stand is a competitive advantage, thanks to a more engaged workforce, a clear view of where the business needs to grow and iterate, and a culture where people feel as emboldened to innovate as they do to ask for help. When it comes to performance, what you see is what you get. So, here's to keeping watermelons where they belong — at the company picnic.

102,"Crisis at 30,000 Feet: Grading the CEO Responses to Boeing's Mid-Flight Blowout","Feb 7, 2024",Christopher Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/crisis-management-lessons-from-boeings-mid-flight-blowout/469305,"
On January 5th, 2024, an alarming incident involving an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 necessitated an emergency landing due to a cabin blowout. This placed Boeing and its airline partners United Airlines and Alaska Airlines under intense scrutiny. Company CEOs Dave Calhoun, Scott Kirby, and Ben Minicucci each navigated their companies through challenging times with distinct approaches, focusing on safety, quality, and strategic adaptation. In the following analysis, Miguel Aponte and I explore the actions taken in response to the crisis, highlighting their leadership in addressing immediate concerns while eyeing long-term objectives.Related: 10 Strategies for Businesses to Navigate and Thrive in Times of CrisisDave Calhoun, CEO of BoeingActions Taken:Engagement with U.S. Senators: Met with senators to discuss the 737 MAX 9 grounding and address regulatory concerns.Quality Assurance Stand-Down: Implemented a temporary pause in production to focus on quality checks and employee training.Public Commitment to Quality Improvements: Announced initiatives to enhance quality control processes at Boeing.Communication with Customers: Proactive outreach to airline customers to discuss issues and reassure them of Boeing's commitment to resolving problems.Internal Review and Employee Engagement: Solicited ideas from employees for quality improvements and initiated an internal review process. Sent a letter to staff saying, ""[he was] deeply sorry for the significant disruption and frustration for our customers.""Motivations and Impact:Calhoun's actions are geared towards damage control, restoring confidence in Boeing's aircraft, and addressing safety concerns from regulators, customers, and the public. The engagement with senators and quality assurance initiatives are aimed at demonstrating Boeing's proactive approach to resolving the issues. However, these actions have led to production delays and financial impacts but are crucial for long-term trust and reliability.Related: 4 Smart Strategies for Safeguarding Your Business and Brand Reputation in a CrisisScott Kirby, CEO of United AirlinesActions Taken:Public Criticism of Boeing: Voiced disappointment in Boeing's handling of the situation.Exploring Alternative Fleet Plans: Indicated openness to considering other manufacturers for future fleet needs.Internal Fleet Planning Adjustments: Removed Boeing MAX 10 jets from internal planning, indicating a shift in fleet strategy.Direct Communication with Boeing: Held discussions with Boeing's CEO to express frustration and seek solutions.Motivations and Impact:Kirby's primary goal is to ensure United Airlines' operational reliability and financial stability. His public criticism and consideration of alternatives signal a strategic shift and put pressure on Boeing to address the issues more effectively. These actions also safeguard United's interests, offering flexibility in fleet management and potentially leveraging better terms with Boeing or alternatives with competitors like Airbus.Ben Minicucci, CEO of Alaska AirlinesActions Taken:Blaming Boeing for Financial Losses: Publicly held Boeing responsible for the $150 million loss due to the grounding.Expressing Anger and Frustration: Voiced strong emotions about the blowout incident on Alaska Airlines flight.Future Fleet Planning Considerations: Suggested the possibility of reevaluating the airline's relationship with Boeing.Demanding Higher Quality Aircraft: Called for Boeing to produce better planes and address manufacturing challenges.Motivations and Impact:Minicucci is focused on mitigating financial losses and operational disruptions for Alaska Airlines. By publicly blaming Boeing, he seeks to hold the manufacturer accountable and potentially negotiate compensation or better terms. His actions also reflect a commitment to safety and operational excellence, signaling to both the public and Boeing the airline's priorities and expectations.Evaluating the ResponsesIn this intricate scenario, each CEO's actions reflect a strategic response to protect and advance their company's interests amid Boeing's 737 MAX 9 crisis. Dave Calhoun's focus is on restoring Boeing's reputation and ensuring long-term viability through quality improvements and regulatory compliance. Scott Kirby and Ben Minicucci are primarily concerned with maintaining operational stability, financial health, and safety standards, demonstrating a willingness to adapt their strategies, including considering alternatives to Boeing if necessary. These actions collectively underscore the intricate dynamics within the aviation industry, where safety, reliability, financial considerations, and strategic relationships play crucial roles in decision-making processes at the highest levels.Related: A Guide to Effective Crisis Leadership — Key Steps to Lead Your Team Through Turbulent TimesWhat Leaders Can LearnAll CEOs involved have shown commendable leadership amidst challenges. CEOs need to be publicly vocal and demonstrate they care about the companies and businesses they represent. That being said, there is room for improvement on every party's end. Dave Calhoun needs to focus on increasing transparency to rebuild trust more effectively. Prioritizing safety and proactive future planning could secure Boeing's competitive edge in the long term. Within the last two decades, Boeing has been in the spotlight for tragedies involving MAX 8 planes. Dave must ensure they build planes that are up to standard. Scott Kirby has shown a willingness to adapt to crises showing his interests are what is best for United. To build upon this, improving communication with customers about safety measures could further strengthen brand loyalty for customers. Additionally, diversifying United's fleet would mitigate any dependency on Boeing. Ben Minicucci too has shown adaptation in the crisis and was critical of Boeing. Continuing the conversation of building safer, better planes will lead to safer flying throughout the aviation industry. Re-evaluating the choice of planes for Alaska Airline's fleet is an important decision that can lead to more growth opportunities in the future.

103,Are You Failing Your Employees? Take These 3 Steps to Become a More Supportive and Empowering Leader.,"Feb 6, 2024",Kristel Bauer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/is-your-leadership-team-failing-your-employees/468811,"
I'm sure you have seen the headlines about quiet quitting, loud quitting and company struggles with employee retention. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become very clear that many employees are unhappy in their current jobs, but what is the main culprit here? While this is a complex issue with many potential contributing pieces, there is one clear factor fueling a large portion of employee dissatisfaction, and it is poor leadership.Throughout my career, I have seen the ill effects of bad bosses from many different angles. During my time practicing in healthcare, I saw the physical, mental and emotional strain caused by poor leadership and its impact on patients, colleagues and even myself. I remember when I started my first ""real"" job after college. My boss at the time wanted me to check in with him before leaving for the day. Typically, around 6:00 pm, when all my work was completed, I would wait by his door with my stomach growling hoping to get the thumbs up to make the 60-minute or more commute home. My boss would see me standing there and would typically make a motion like he was busy, and I needed to wait (if he acknowledged me at all). If I was lucky, it would be about 15-20 minutes before I got the hand wave that he was ready to talk, but most of the time I would be there waiting for much, much longer.On the flip side, I have also been extremely fortunate to experience what empowering and supportive leadership looks like. During my keynote talks and corporate trainings, I have witnessed solution-focused dialogue around employee pain points and struggles. I have seen leaders actively asking for feedback from their employees, looking for ways to implement positive change to support their overall well-being.



Related: 7 Timeless Principles That Will Help You Become a Better LeaderFor better or worse, the leaders in your organization can make or break employee happiness, well-being and company culture. I recently took a poll on LinkedIn where I asked the question, ""If you are not completely fulfilled at your job, what do you think is the main reason?"" Unsurprisingly, 56% of respondents chose poor leadership or their boss. When people don't feel valued or fulfilled in their careers, their performance suffers, and the organization as a whole is negatively impacted.


According to Gallup's State of the Workplace 2023 report, almost 6 out of 10 employees were categorized as quiet quitting, and 51% of surveyed employed workers reported watching for or seeking out a new job.So, what do employees really want from their leadership team? While exploring this question, I ran another poll on LinkedIn asking, ""What made the best boss you ever had such a great boss?"" An overwhelming 77% of respondents reported that it was their support and advocacy. At the end of the day, people want a boss that is in their corner. They want to work for a leader they can trust; a leader who has their back. Now, developing that trust is not always easy. It takes intention, self-awareness, time and effort.That said, here are three steps to help you move in the direction of becoming a better leader:1. Optimize how you communicateHow effective do you think you are at communicating? How does your communication style fluctuate based on your emotions? How are you perceived by others? A key part of being an excellent communicator is building self-awareness. When you start to recognize your tendencies and habitual responses to different situations, you can begin to see where there is room for improvement.


Do you shut down when you get upset? Do you micromanage when you get stressed? Is there regular, clear and open dialogue between you and your team about expectations, workload, timelines and potential speed bumps? What does your team really think about your communication style? Getting feedback in this arena and working towards being an optimal communicator will help create an environment where everyone feels seen, heard, valued and supported.Related: 5 Steps to Communicate Like a Boss2. Build connectionHow well do you know the members of your team? As a leader, it is important to have regular check-ins with your group via different formats including, email, phone, virtual and in-person. You should also be having informal conversations in which you are able to get to know them as a person.Learn about your team members' goals and aspirations. What are their strengths? Is there a time of day when they work the best? What are their pain points with their job? What kind of help and support could they benefit from? Discovering these things will help you more effectively lead each individual employee based on their unique situation. You won't be able to provide support and potential solutions for problems if you don't even know they exist.


3. Be receptive to feedbackToo often leaders are the ones providing the feedback, but they are not always getting honest feedback from their teams and groups. Leaders need to provide constructive feedback, mentorship and support, but they also need to be actively seeking out feedback from their team. You may be biased when it comes to your leadership style, or you may not be aware that some of your messaging is being misinterpreted, so getting feedback is essential.Now, no one is going to want to share feedback about their boss if they are afraid that it will negatively impact their job security or career advancement. As a leader, you are responsible for creating a safe environment and a feedback loop for employees to share suggestions, concerns and pain points.When it comes down to it, no one really wants to be a bad leader. They may just be lacking the tools, skills or self-awareness needed to create a space where employees can thrive. Wherever you are at in your leadership journey, remember that there is always room for growth. By investing in leadership development, you will be planting the seeds for an empowering company culture with happier employees who will want to work with you for years to come.Related: 5 Tips to Help You Be the Sort of Leader Employees Love to Work For

Restaurant owners can build their business and personal brands simultaneously.Kelli Ferrell is a distinct personality in the restaurant space. Not just as the founder of Nana's Chicken-N-Waffles, but as a dynamic individual weaving together her roles as a mother, content creator, entrepreneur, and self-taught chef.In the world of culinary arts, Kelli transcends the traditional role of a restaurateur.



She uses Instagram as a digital platform to strategically separate her personal brand from that of the business.

""@whoiskelli represents who I am as an individual, as a mother, as a content creator, as an entrepreneur, and as that everyday woman just kind of striving to build her brand,"" Ferrell told Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media. ""My degree was in fashion, merchandising, and design. It had nothing to do with culinary. So you'll get a little bit more fashion-inspired things. But it's food and fashion that you would really see on @whoiskelli.""On the other hand, branding is an essential element for Kelli that extends beyond her role as a restaurant owner. As the self-taught chef behind Nana's Chicken-N-Waffles, she recognized the need to establish a separate brand for herself. Kooking with Kelli became an avenue where her passions intertwine, showcasing her unique approach as a non-traditional chef. ""Kooking with Kelli is really birthed for food and fashion,"" she says.

105,Inside Potbelly's Recipe for Fast Casual Success,"Feb 5, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/inside-potbellys-recipe-for-fast-casual-success/469067,"
Have you had a Potbelly's sandwich? If you live in America, chances are you have. They're in 32 states, have over 400 locations and they're fantastic. On this episode of The CEO Series, I broke bread with Potbelly CEO Bob Wright and got his secret recipe for this national powerhouse franchise's success.Below are some highlights of that conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. Watch the full video above.On being a CEO""I've had a lot of jobs in my career, and I think the best part about being a CEO is bringing all of that experience together, but still focused on the same exact thing. One of my mentors warned me that being the CEO can be lonely, and in fact, he gave me good advice to find others in similar positions who you can connect with and turn to. I trust the leaders on my team. I love engaging with my senior leadership team. They're the smartest and the best in the business. But everyone is looking to the CEO to have a leadership position and to have a thought about the vision, the strategy, or the decisions of the day.""



Related: Avoid These 3 Key Mistakes for Team Success in 2024On his business beginnings""The summer after my freshman year in college, I wanted a job that summer that would pay me not only a wage but give a chance to earn tips. And I must not have been cut it waiting tables because I tried for almost a month. I walked into a Domino's in Houston and asked if they were hiring. The guy asked me if I had blue pants. So I think that was my interview! I told him I did (which was a lie actually) and he said, 'All right, see you back here at four o'clock.' So I went to the mall and bought blue pants and started working at Domino's and I was there for 12 years. I didn't realize that taking opportunities that were presented to you could be as valuable as they could be if you were just willing to take the chance.""


The secret of Potbelly's success""We sit right in the sweet spot of the fast-casual consumer with this amazing differentiated menu of sandwiches that are hot and toasted at 500 degrees, as well as soups and salads made fresh when you order them. Our cookies are the best on the planet. Our sugar cookie is better than anyone I've ever had in my life. I've been a fan of this brand for 20 years and have always thought that it had great potential. It's got great heritage, too.""Related: With Over $120 Million in Sales, Dude Wipes Is No Joke. Here's How the Company's Chief Executive Dude Keeps Things Fun and Profitable.On trends in fast casual dining""I'd say some of it has its roots in the pandemic, but fast casual is clearly where the consumer is going. Higher quality, more value for the money, and more flexibility and opportunity to use that brand in the way that fits your life. Sure, people are going out, sitting down around a table, getting waiter service and so on. But fast casual is where all the massive growth is because that's where the consumer is.""On learning""I love to read biographies of people that have been accomplished, have been great leaders, have been founders of our country. I thought David McCullough was a fascinating writer — Truman, 1776, those were, those were awesome books. I think you learn more from watching than from being told. And biographies are a way for us to watch what other people have done.""

        The business partners use a leadership approach honed over years on the set of 'Breaking Bad.' 
      












""I saw a clear opening with mezcal,"" Aaron Paul, co-founder of Dos Hombres Mezcal with fellow actor Bryan Cranston, says. ""You ask anyone on the side of the road, 'Name your favorite mezcal,' [and] they're like, 'Oh, mezcal is…' But they can name a vodka, a tequila.""Cranston and Paul, who played Walter White and Jesse Pinkman on AMC's award-winning crime drama series Breaking Bad, became fast friends on set. So, when Paul suggested the duo start a mezcal brand of their own several years after the show wrapped, Cranston was all in.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 



Dos Hombres, which means ""two men"" in Spanish, launched in 2019. The mezcal is crafted by third-generation maestro mezcalero Gregorio Velasco, who uses traditional production methods to blend Espadin agave hand-picked from the hillsides of the small village of San Luis del Rio in Oaxaca, Mexico. It boasts notes of apples, mango, local ""zapote"" fruits, wood and an ""almost imperceptible"" smoke on the finish.Constellation Brands announced a minority stake in Dos Hombres in 2021 through its venture capital group, though the company remains independently owned and continues to manage, market and produce its mezcal.

They're determined to make Dos Hombres the No. 1 mezcal, they say, and that means doing things a bit differently than some of the many other celebrity spirits brands.""Celebrities have an opportunity,"" Cranston says. ""They have the door open. You want to come in? It's up to you. And a lot of celebrities will come in — and then go away. You want me to go and work…?""""Wait, you're not just going to write me…a check?"" Paul quips.Related: How to Be Your Own Boss and Drink on the Job


Cranston notes that ""there are far more celebrity brands that have failed than have succeeded."" But, like their on-screen characters, the pair isn't afraid to get in the trenches and do what needs to be done. Until about six months ago, the co-founders ""were on emails constantly,"" and Paul ran the company's social media accounts.""I think actors, especially, we're used to stepping into something we don't know,"" Cranston says. ""Every time we take a job, 'I think it could be this, but I'm not sure.' I'm playing a podiatrist — 'Oh, I gotta go learn all about the feet.' So we're not daunted about stepping into something we don't know. We're like a dry sponge. So we go down to Oaxaca once a year and talk to our people.""Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal ""We break bread with them. We talk to them, and we learn.""Dos Hombres has 50 employees in Mexico and 22 in the U.S., and Paul and Cranston have personally interviewed each person who was hired onto the team. They want to make sure that everyone understands the culture they've built: ""We work hard here, and then we go home,"" Cranston says. ""That's the greatest thing. Work hard, go home.""Paul and Cranston are ""very proud"" of the team members they've brought together — and seize every opportunity to learn from them.""We break bread with them,"" Cranston says. ""We talk to them, and we learn. Every time we're down there, it's like, 'Oh wait a minute, that's a new thing. Why are you doing this? Oh right. What happened there?' And then [we] learn about the mashing, the smoking, fermentation, the distillation, bottling.""Related: Comedy Legend Dan Aykroyd Doesn't Mess Around When It Comes to Vodka


Paul and Cranston's hands-on leadership approach to building their ideal company, team and culture is a straightforward but perhaps underrated one these days. And it carries over from their years on the set of Breaking Bad. Paul, who was 28 when the show debuted, says that Cranston taught him that ""when you're No. 1 on the call sheet, you set the tone.""""[Cranston is] the hardest worker in the room but also the most immature person you've ever met,"" Paul says. ""And I say that with love and respect because he does the job perfectly, but he has the best time doing it. He loves to pull pranks; [he] jokes.""Cranston says there were a couple of hundred people on set that they felt responsible for, and to help establish the kind of close-knit culture they envisioned, they started a bowling night with not just the crew but the crew's family, too. ""We'd take over the entire bowling alley and just play,"" he recalls.Image Credit: Paul Quitoriano for Dos Hombres Mezcal 


""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""The co-founders might not have anticipated going into business together during their early days on set. Cranston admits he had no idea Paul had such a ""business mind,"" though he was quickly impressed by his co-star's boundless ""energy"" and strong work ethic — and adds that ""he's not at all like Jesse Pinkman.""Needless to say, the real-life friends have a more functional business partnership than Jesse and Walt ever did. They also have a lot of fun with it: Just don't ask them to take any shots of mezcal if you run into them at the bar.""We go out a lot to all the bars and restaurants, and most of the younger kids go, 'Ah, let's do shots,'"" Cranston explains.""It's sacrilegious to do a shot of mezcal,"" Paul says. ""Down in Mexico, they say, 'You kiss the spirit.'""

107,The Ultimate 7-Step CEO Guide to Visionary Leadership,"Feb 1, 2024",Derek Lusk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/7-traits-leaders-need-to-attain-to-visionary-leadership/468711,"
Thomas Jefferson had a bold vision as the United States broke away from British rule. Consider his letter to John Adams in 1823, when he said, ""I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past."" Jefferson was contemplative and progressive in emphasizing his dream of a different America. He was a visionary.Many others have failed in dogmatic pragmatism. George H. W. Bush had several leadership qualities, such as humility and integrity, but Bush scholars universally agree that he lacked vision. His perspective on the United States was similar to Blockbuster and Kodak: let's double down on our history and what's worked in the past.Bush is even known for saying that he doesn't understand ""that vision thing."" In his inaugural address, he said there's no need for the country to ""invent a system by which to live."" All we need to do is ""act on what we know.""



There's utility in traditional thinking, but it becomes a strength overused when you can't do the other side of the coin — vision. Bush was a one-term president, losing to a relatively unknown Bill Clinton because he lacked an inspirational message.So, how can CEOs create a vision so powerful that it ignites organizational transformation?Related: Are You a Visionary Leader? Here are 12 Ways to Cultivate and Enhance Your Leadership Vision1. Vision from the heartIn Nietzsche's words, ""Only as an aesthetic phenomenon are life and the world justified eternally."" A vision should only affect us in the way art can, revitalizing the spirit and the selves' experience, as opposed to the task-oriented and linear nature of day-to-day goals. The executive's vision is an aesthetic, imaginative idealization that gives meaning to the organization, like an artist moving from a blank canvas to what could be.2. Align with the organization's valuesUnlike strategic objectives, which are rationally derived, visions are values-laden. They give meaning through an ideological goal. Since they are about what should be, they are, by definition, an expression of values and corporate identity.Thus, effective CEOs keep the vision malleable in relation to the business landscape but never change the values underneath. Not only that, but their personal values align with the organization and its vision — one reason for doing a values assessment in CEO succession.


Related: How Great Leaders Communicate Their Vision3. Create the vision with othersThe best CEOs have a clear vision that's tied to their values. It isn't a fully democratic process because the CEO must believe passionately in it. However, it's essential that the vision is not unilaterally imposed but rather distilled from the contributions of leaders throughout the organization. The first reason is buy-in from everyone else. The entire company needs to feel it in the heart, too. The second reason is that the organization existed before the CEO and will after the CEO, so the vision must align with the entire organization for continuity.Related: How to Engage Employees Through Your Company Vision Statement4. Make it valuable to all stakeholdersSome of the most catastrophic events in history have been the result of a psychopath's vision. Visions can be powerful, influential and morally corrupt — all at the same time. Conversely, real leaders create a vision that benefits the entire ecosystem, where the rising tide lifts all boats and makes the world a better place. Robert House, from the University of Pennsylvania, defined a greater good vision as ""an unconscious motive to use social influence, or to satisfy the power need, in socially desirable ways, for the betterment of the collective rather than for personal self-interest."" This is using the will to power for the betterment of humanity, to shape the future, rather than as a source of ruthless evildoing.


5. Use the vision to galvanize changeIn academia, there's a close relationship between visionary and charismatic leadership. Consider House's Theory of Charismatic Leadership, Bass' Transformational Leadership Theory, Conger and Kanungo's Theory of Charismatic Leadership, and Sashkin's Visionary Leadership Theory. They all emphasize how the most effective visions challenge the status quo and inspire evolution. The CEO evaluates the organization and its context, such as its core competencies and competitors, and through vivid mental imagery, paints a picture of the future.Since vision is related to influence and change, it's easy to understand how Kay Whitmore from Kodak and George H. W. Bush had ineffective visions. They were preventative instead of future-oriented and, therefore, neglected to become bigger, faster, stronger, and even something brand new. They were demotivating instead of galvanizing and failed to energize the organization.Related: What Is Transactional Leadership and How Does It Work?6. Ensure it's believableVisionary leaders are often bold and risk-taking, as well as imaginative. Like a psychic in Vegas, they're bold enough to think they can see the future and inventive enough to dream up a new reality that challenges today. With this psychology, the strength overused is that visionary CEOs are often alienated from reality. Conversely, the most effective CEOs are versatile enough to, as inherent in Marshall Sashkin's theory, balance vision with operational actions. Their visions are inventive, aesthetic, imaginative, bold, and innovative but believable and achievable.


7. Use the vision for strategic decisionsAnother benefit of vision, besides influence, is that it frames consequential strategic decisions. At Netflix, Reed Hastings could have charged ahead with being the number one DVD-by-mail company in the United States. But, as explained in the book CEO Excellence, the new direction was supported by a vision of transformation. ""The big strategic moves that followed made sense in ways they would never have otherwise: moving into video streaming, betting on the cloud, creating Netflix originals, driving exponential globalization, and so on."" The vision justified a series of innovations, decisions, and where the company should focus its limited time and resources.In all, the CEO's highest duty is breathing life into the organization, giving it meaning and harnessing the social forces toward a worthwhile future. Only as an aesthetic phenomenon, not one of logic, power, and control, is an organization's existence authentic and fully realized. Art reflects life, not just beauty, and an organization's vision reflects its identity and fulfills its purpose, without which it is lifeless.

108,How Chef JJ Started a Rice Bowl Revolution in Harlem,"Feb 1, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-chef-jj-started-a-rice-bowl-revolution-in-harlem/469038,"
When Chef JJ Johnson opened his first rice bowl restaurant, he set up shop in an area that doesn't see a lot of his kind of businesses. Where others saw that as a problem, he saw it as an opportunity to fill a clean eating gap in a working-class community that has traditionally lacked access to healthy, fast-casual restaurants. That first FIELDTRIP location in Harlem was the first of three storefronts he opened across New York City providing nutritious meals at quick speeds and affordable prices.""I think I'm a disruptor,"" Chef JJ said. ""Throughout my career, looking at communities of Black and brown folks and talking to developers and landlords in the search, [people were] always saying that these communities don't want this type of food. And that's not true.""Related: How to Open a Restaurant Step By Step



FIELDTRIP's bowls focus on one ingredient—rice—which Chef JJ calls the ""greatest connector in the world."" From Southeast Asia to West Africa to the Caribbean, the restaurant takes its customers on a trip around the globe with hearty and delicious blends of vegetables, proteins, and starches. The goal is to use ingredients that are familiar to FIELDTRIP's diverse customer base to create fresh and balanced meals.Despite some initial, external resistance to his business idea, Chef JJ's restaurant was a huge success and has since expanded to storefronts near Rockefeller Center and Columbia University. His fresh, flavorful bowls have drawn in many loyal customers, including Yelp reviewer Sonya H.


""The guy who welcomed us at the door was great,"" Sonya said, reflecting on her first time at the Harlem location. ""And all the workers were great. They were mixing up the food, and they gave me a sample of their tea. And I was like, 'Oh, this is a good sign.' Everything was perfect.""Even with a glowing review, Sonya's first ""field trip"" wasn't entirely smooth sailing. When she called to order to-go bowls for herself and her son, the staff wasn't able to take her order over the phone. But she didn't let that deter her, and upon arriving at the busy restaurant in person, she understood why no one was able to process her call right away.Related: Restaurant Owners Reveal Their Success SecretsThough Chef JJ recognizes that it might turn some customers away, not taking call-in orders is actually a strategic part of how he refines his business model. Instead of taking a customer's information over the phone, which can pose legal problems, the celebrity chef and his staff direct customers to order on FIELDTRIP's website or mobile app. The online system not only improves the accuracy and security of orders, but allows Chef JJ to track who his customers are, what menu items they like, and how often they're eating at FIELDTRIP.


""When you look at brands that are growing, you need that data,"" Chef JJ said. ""Who are your customers? What do they look like?""By observing what kinds of customers the restaurant appeals to, Chef JJ is better able to cater to his audience when making decisions about expansions and rewards programs. While he doesn't think FIELDTRIP has found its ""home run location"" yet, he is always thinking about how to move closer to his targets. As FIELDTRIP's location near Columbia University grows, the business's next step is to tailor offerings to undergraduate students.Chef JJ also tries to differentiate his business through top-tier customer service. When conducting market research for his Harlem location, he found that many fast-casual restaurants in the neighborhood were known for having unfriendly service. In response to this, FIELDTRIP makes a point of always greeting customers and calling out ""See you on your next trip!"" as they exit, earning staff their reputation for charm.Despite Sonya's initial frustration with not being able to call in her order, she gave FIELDTRIP five stars on Yelp after experiencing the restaurant's hospitality in person.


Chef JJ maintains that hospitality with online touch points as well, making an effort to respond to every review he receives. He often goes the extra mile, communicating with critical reviewers to invite them back for a better experience.Chef JJ is grateful for loyal customers like Sonya who support him and other Black business owners, who haven't always been given the resources they need to succeed. By identifying with business attributes on Yelp, FIELDTRIP's business page is able to attract diners who are eager to invest in the Black business owner community.""I'm happy to see other people of color promoting businesses that look like them for folks that don't know about them,"" JJ said. ""We have to come together just as much as we want everybody else to come together with us.""In addition to knowing your audience and engaging with your customers, FIELDTRIP believes in:


Breaking the mold. Locate business opportunities by thinking about what your community needs, not what it has already found success with.Making strategic operating decisions. Using and encouraging an online order system is a great way to acquire crucial data about your customers that can inform future business operations.Creating a sense of belonging. Small things like being greeted as soon as they walk in the door can have the power to reverse poor first impressions and keep customers coming back.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Chef JJ and Sonya, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora, and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl.

109,Why You Need to Embrace Uncertainty as an Entrepreneurial Leader (and How to Navigate It Effectively),"Jan 31, 2024",Peter Goldstein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-unlock-transformative-growth-by-embracing-uncertainty/468698,"
In the challenging realm of entrepreneurship, change is constant, and uncertainty is expected. It's not a matter of if, but when, and how you navigate the unknown that defines your journey. Once you learn to accept uncertainty, entrepreneurs and CEOs will discover that it can be a gateway to transformative growth.Recognizing the inevitability of uncertainty is a strategic imperative. I have learned that it is not a challenge to overcome; but instead, something to be embraced as a tool for leadership and a catalyst for personal growth.As an entrepreneur and capital market expert with over 35 years of experience, I lost almost everything I had built during the Great Recession. It was a period that tested more than my business acumen; it was a profound examination of my resilience and integrity. During that time, the challenges were immense, but in retrospect, the lessons were invaluable. The strategies I learned to employ, the decisions I made and the mindset I cultivated during that tumultuous time continue to be guiding beacons for me in navigating the complexities of today's business environment. Having been through a time that tested my resilience in business and life, I now understand the intricacies of leading through uncertainty.

This state of perpetual unpredictability is simply a factor of modern existence in the business world. It is a convergence of factors — technological leaps, global interconnections, economic changes, geopolitical issues and environmental challenges. Together, these factors weave a complex narrative and result in an environment where change is not just a possibility but a constant force that shapes the very fabric of entrepreneurial endeavors.


Yet, within these uncertainties lies a paradoxical truth — uncertainty, rather than a hindrance, can be a powerful catalyst for innovation and strategic thinking. Uncertainty can be a disruptor of conventional patterns, pushing entrepreneurs beyond their comfort zones and challenging established norms. The very nature of uncertainty demands a continuous reevaluation of strategies, which fosters a culture of adaptive planning and innovation. This can help businesses not just to survive but to thrive in an ever-changing market.McKinsey & Company, a beacon of strategic consultancy, echoes the sentiment of embracing uncertainty. Their insights on managing uncertainty in business emphasize the critical importance of preparation for various outcomes. They advocate for a shift toward creative problem-solving approaches and the need for new operating models to respond to extreme uncertainty. Strategic courage, according to McKinsey, is paramount in volatile times, urging organizations to build resilience for an uncertain future. This resonates profoundly with the idea that navigating the uncertainties of today's business environments necessitates not just traditional strategies but innovative leadership and adaptable approaches.Case study in entrepreneurial resilienceIn the tumultuous IPO market of 2023, characterized by fluctuating valuations, tightened access to capital, rising interest rates, bank instability and global geopolitical challenges, several IPOs stood out as beacons of entrepreneurial resilience. One such success story was CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE: CAVA), a leading U.S.-based restaurant chain that defied the odds and went public in June 2023.The IPO of CAVA Group, Inc. exemplifies strategic resilience in uncertain times. Despite the challenging backdrop, the company's shares experienced a remarkable 37% rise from their initial offering price, signaling not only the market's strong reception but also confidence in CAVA Group's business model. Opening at $22 per share and raising $318 million, the IPO closed its first trading day at an impressive $43.78. This success underscores the potential for triumph in a volatile market, highlighting the importance of robust business strategies and adaptability.
