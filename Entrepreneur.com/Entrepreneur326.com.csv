0,"3 Types of Creative Blocks, and How to Overcome Them","Apr 24, 2024",Amber Rae,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/3-types-of-creative-blocks-and-how-to-overcome-them/473108,"
I had every intention of writing this article yesterday morning. And then again, last night. And then this morning. But my team needed me, I had a couple of fires to put out, and honestly, I just didn't really feel like doing it. When I finally sat down to write, I realized what was going on: Procrastination was rearing its head. Or, as I like to call it, ""Fear in overalls."" Procrastination is a type of fear that has good intentions but lacks consistent follow-through, and it's easy to slip into. It's the part of us that says, ""It's all good, I can do this later, I'm not really in the mood, I'm waiting for inspiration to strike.""As a bestselling author of three books, and a writing mentor who's supported thousands, I've learned a thing or two about why we don't start or finish projects — why ideas nudge us for years but rarely see the light of day. 



Whether I'm supporting a founder with a track record of success, a New York Times bestselling author, or an aspiring writer who's just picking up the pen, creative blocks plague us all. Through my work, I've identified three types of creative blocks and how to overcome them. Creative Block #1: Procrastination — ""I'll do this later after I do that other thing.""Maybe you're reading this right now to avoid something else that you need or want to be doing. If so, you may be dealing with procrastination. But before you get down on yourself, let's look closer at the real cause. Unlike what many of us learned, procrastination is not a sign that we're lazy, weak, or lacking in motivation. Procrastination, from a psychological perspective, is also a survival function. 


When we're stressed, overwhelmed, burnt out, or dealing with any perceived threat — which could be, ""I really want this to go well but the outcome is uncertain,"" or ""I want to put myself out there but I'm not sure how it'll be received,"" — our nervous system moves into a fight/flight/freeze response. In other words: we procrastinate. Understanding the science of this can help us have compassion for ourselves—and others—and also decide what to do about it. I learned about ""micro-yeses"" from my friend Britt Frank, a neuropsychotherapist and the author of The Science of Stuck. A micro-yes is the smallest next step you can take—a step so small, it seems almost ridiculous to call it ""a step."" So, if you're wanting to write an article but you're stalling — like I was — the next micro-yes is not to schedule an hour to write. That might spook your nervous system and send you into further delays. In my case, my micro-yeses were:


Get my tush in the chair.Write one bad sentence.Write another.And voila, the brain stopped perceiving threats, my nervous system was more regulated, and I cranked out the article. I was on my way, and micro-yeses will help you get going, too.Creative Block #2: Perfectionism — ""This isn't good enough.""If procrastination is ""fear is overalls,"" perfectionism is, as Elizabeth Gilbert put it, ""fear in fancy clothes."" Of all the blocks out there, perfectionism—and the pressure to be great right away—is one that will stop a project dead in its tracks before it ever has a chance to flourish.When I landed my first book deal, my publisher asked me if I could write the book in three months. As crazy as that sounded, my book was titled Choose Wonder Over Worry, so instead of worrying about how unrealistic that deadline sounded, I asked myself: I wonder how I can get this done?I cleared my calendar, flew across the world for a writing retreat, and then, as I sat down to write, I found myself paralyzed by a voice inside my head that chimed in every ten seconds to tell me, ""That's a very bad sentence.""


After consulting with a mentor (and nearly losing my mind), I was reminded that there is no such thing as a great first draft. In fact, my goal was to be a ""bad writer"" and write terrible first drafts, so that I'd get to the stage of having so-so second drafts and better third drafts.That strategy helped me finish my book—and it's one that's helped many others in my signature writing workshop, On The Page. Revision is essential and will strengthen your work—but first you need to get those ""pen miles"" down. Creative Block #3: Imposter Syndrome — ""Who am I to call myself a writer? Am I going to get found out?""If procrastination is ""fear in overalls"" and perfectionism is, ""fear in fancy clothes,"" then imposter syndrome is ""fear in hiding.""Whenever you're putting yourself out there, or trying something new, there will be people who will be more experienced, or knowledgable, or renowned than you. It's a simple fact of life. Whether you are just starting out in your career, or have decades' worth of accolades, there is always a fear that people who have achieved more will say: You don't know what you're talking about, or, who are you to think you can do this? 


In fact, sometimes the more successful you are, and the more you've accomplished, the more likely you are to feel imposter syndrome. It's like the old saying attributed to Aristotle: ""The more you know, the more you know you don't know."" Case in point, I have a client who got a significant book deal on a topic that she's a world-renowned expert on. She's been featured in dozens of publications, she has a thriving business in her field, and her book is a vehicle to make her message more accessible to more people. And yet, on one of our calls, she shared with me: ""I hope I can one day call myself a writer.""""What do you mean?"" I asked.""Well, I'm not a writer like those other writers,"" she said. ""Maybe if the book's a huge success.""That right there is where imposter syndrome thrives: between internal doubt, and the belief that external accolades will prove we are worthy. And the most brutal part of imposter syndrome is that even if we reach our vision of ""ultimate success,"" it's still not enough. 


So what to do about it? The solution to imposter syndrome is two-fold:Notice the critical voice inside your head that says, I'm not enough, I'm going to be found out, I don't deserve this, I have to work harder to prove myself — and remember that voice is an old and damaging story that you don't need to buy into anymore. Notice it, remember it's not you, and as uncomfortable as it might feel, choose a more empowering narrative, such as: I'm already enough.Celebrate the progress you've already made—including the mistakes. Focus on what you're learning, how you're growing, what you value, and what is meaningful to you. Don't get caught up in what you'll need to ""someday"" achieve so that you'll finally arrive. You've already arrived. I know encountering blocks can feel unsettling. But once we name what we're experiencing, we can recognize it more easily, and then respond to it differently. Creative blocks are challenges, yes, but they do have science-backed solutions. Sometimes it starts with lowering our really high personal expectations, rolling up our sleeves, and having a little faith in the process.

1,How Mindset Plays a Role in Your Entrepreneurial Success,"Apr 23, 2024",Joseph Camberato,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-mindset-plays-a-role-in-your-entrepreneurial-success/472788,"
When you consider the different factors that contribute to your success as an entrepreneur, mindset may not be the first thing that comes to mind. Mindset may not seem important as you move from task to task, but it has a significant impact on how you run your business.Successful entrepreneurs have a different mindset than everyone else, and it affects how they run their businesses.Let's look at seven mindset shifts you must embrace as an entrepreneur and why each one matters.Related: Why Mindset Matters for Success1. Reframe failureMany people believe that failure is the opposite of success, but failure is actually a necessary step toward success. Failure is a part of every entrepreneur's journey — Walt Disney, Steve Jobs and Arianna Huffington all experienced significant setbacks. What matters is how you react to failure and turn it into something positive.



Look at every setback as an opportunity to learn something new and practice resilience. Failure is often the catalyst for innovation — research shows that companies that encourage risk-taking and try new ideas perform better in the market.2. Thinking bigSuccessful entrepreneurs have big, ambitious goals for their businesses. The best way to achieve more is to set higher goals and push yourself beyond what you believe is possible.Most people get into entrepreneurship because they are naturally big thinkers. However, it's easy to lose this mindset when you're focused on your business's daily operations. To some extent, this is normal — your employees have to get paid, and there are daily to-do lists that must be completed.But if you aren't careful, you can lose sight of your bigger vision for your business. Thinking big helps you break out of this mindset and see opportunities you might have missed otherwise.


3. Take calculated risksIt's impossible to start a business or launch a product without some degree of risk, so entrepreneurs need to get good at taking calculated risks. When you take a calculated risk, you accept a certain likelihood of failure because it can potentially move your business forward. It's an informed decision based on market data, not a haphazard choice based on feelings.The key is learning when it pays to take a risk and when it doesn't. Start developing a decision-making framework to help you lay out the facts, evaluate your options, make a decision and commit to seeing it through.4. Continue learningThe most successful entrepreneurs are known for embracing continuous learning. For example, Bill Gates is known for being a voracious reader and regularly shares thoughts on his favorite books. When he goes on vacation, he spends about three hours a day reading and taking notes as he reads.Continuous learning can take many different forms, such as reading, attending industry events or taking courses. Expanding your knowledge and honing your skills gives you an edge over your competitors.


Related: 8 Mindset Shifts Entrepreneurs Must Make to Achieve Their Ultimate Goal5. Embrace a growth mindsetThe term growth mindset refers to an individual's belief that their skills and abilities can improve with effort. In comparison, individuals with a fixed mindset believe that their personality and abilities are fixed traits that don't really change.A growth mindset gives you the resilience to adapt and move through challenging situations. It allows you to learn from mistakes and find the necessary resources to grow your business.If you want to launch a new product, a growth mindset allows you to test and iterate on your idea. Instead of viewing negative feedback or slow sales as a sign you should give up, you can use this feedback to improve your product offering.


6. Focus on providing valueSuccessful entrepreneurs focus on providing value rather than just making more money. This can be a challenging mindset shift to make because we all need money to pay our bills and buy the things we want.But when you focus on making money as your end goal, it's easy to become short-sighted and make every decision based on maximizing your profits now. If your customers don't receive value from your products or services, you can't build a sustainable business long-term.7. ResourcefulnessWhen you're starting a business, time and money are almost always in short supply, and unexpected problems will arise. You have to learn to be resourceful and find creative solutions to problems.Being resourceful also means being flexible and willing to adapt to a constantly changing environment. For example, the most resourceful entrepreneurs were able to pivot during Covid-19, adjust their business strategy and identify new opportunities.


Related: It's All in Your Head: How to Shift Your Mindset for Serious SuccessMost people attribute entrepreneurial success to things like planning, innovative ideas and product-market fit. While those things are certainly important, it's easy to overlook the importance of mindset when you're starting or growing a business.Your mindset matters because it shapes your decisions and actions. By embracing the seven mindset shifts outlined in this article, you'll set your business up for even greater success.

2,8 Little Things That Make Remote Work More Efficient for Everyone,"Apr 23, 2024",Artis Rozentals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/8-ways-to-make-remote-work-more-efficient-for-everyone/472694,"
For the first time since we were all forcefully thrown into remote work in 2020, it finally feels like the debate surrounding it is settling down.Companies that wanted their teams back in the office have enacted relevant policies. Meanwhile, employees enamored with remote work have lots of options, with vacancies offering just that. Also, many workplaces have adopted hybrid ways of working to get the best of both worlds, with studies reporting more than half of working Americans having the opportunity to work remotely at least once a week.That means that for a majority of employees, remote work remains a core part of their day-to-day life because, even when you work fully in-person if you have a colleague joining from home, you inevitably get sucked into a remote work dynamic. For many, this continues to be a challenge — remote work has its own specifics regarding communication, collaboration and general etiquette, which don't come naturally to everyone.



So here are eight little things anyone can do to improve their remote work experience and that of their colleagues.Related: I Live in Hotels Full Time. It Works Out Cheaper Than Renting and I Haven't Changed My Sheets in 3 Years.


1. Make your availability knownAre you out for lunch? Picking up kids from school? Do you have irregular working hours? While remote work's flexibility is one of its best features, ensure your team is informed about when you'll be in work mode to avoid misunderstandings, missed messages and schedule clashes.For instance, if you start work later, it may be wise to indicate that somewhere so early birds know not to expect your input in the initial hours of the morning. This can be as simple as a relevant emoji on your Slack profile or a quick update at a weekly meeting.2. Document processesSince much remote work collaboration is asynchronous, try to document processes, decisions, and strategies so that anyone in the team can find their footing at any time. If you don't, there's a risk of confusion and repetition — teammates might miss updates, and managers might grow tired of explaining the same things to everyone individually to get people on the same page.If you haven't yet, one good practice to adopt is to send out meeting summaries and make a habit of it for other informal important discussions, too.


3. Don't forget about timezonesAmericans may be accustomed to time differences between coasts, but with the rise of remote work, your team may have added some international talent. Emilia from Finland won't be available for your afternoon catch-up because her day ended hours ago — and unless it's been previously agreed upon, you shouldn't expect her to be.Related: The Most Common Work From Home Problems -- Solved!4. Use the same software and tools as your colleaguesTo avoid constantly converting documents, downloading new software, or getting into protracted arguments about which tool is best, you must agree on a single set of tools that will be used company-wide. Larger enterprises typically already have an established tech stack, and smaller companies should follow suit.Remote work and communication necessitate a variety of technologies for collaboration, work, and management. If everyone starts using whatever they like, it'll sow frustration, impair cybersecurity and leave information scattered.


5. Don't browse social media during meetingsThat's it — that's the whole tip. You know it's counterproductive and affects the overall quality of the meeting and your information retention capacity. Will you stop doing it after reading this? Let's be real — probably not.So here's a pro tip and a fun read: to avoid getting into hot water, take off your glasses when you scroll social media during a conference meeting.6. Avoid common video conferencing issuesMute your microphone when you're not talking, test your connection and tech beforehand, show up on time, turn on your camera, be presentable and ensure your background is as well. By now, we all know these video conferencing best practices, but very few people take the time to practice them. As a result, it's extremely common for calls to get disrupted by basic tech issues, sowing frustration and impeding communication.7. Respect different working stylesEveryone has their own ways of working that suit them best. Some people are gifted multi-taskers who want to know everything that's going on and be constantly in the loop. Others thrive in deep work, and a single distraction can reduce their productivity.


Accordingly, while the former will be happy to receive a Slack message and engage in discussion, the latter may find it irritating and disruptive. Some people will be happy to jump into a quick meeting to get on the same page, whereas others would prefer an email.Respecting how others operate can maximize each individual's productivity. To do so, all you need to do is discuss it with colleagues.Related: How to Navigate Generational Differences and Hybrid Challenges in the Workplace8. Regularly celebrate winsIt's no secret that remote workers struggle with loneliness. One of the chief arguments against remote and hybrid work is that it hampers team bonding and the development of a healthy company culture.


But this isn't an inherent problem with remote work. Rather, fostering camaraderie and a healthy work environment demands more active effort in a remote setting than an in-person one. By putting in the effort, you can overcome the challenges of feeling and experiencing the realities of isolation.A great place to start is celebrating wins — develop a shared virtual ritual that involves the entire team and helps people connect.These eight tips will significantly boost your team's efficiency. But remember that for them to be effective, they need to become foundational to your operation. It's not a one-and-done kind of thing but rather an ongoing collective effort to improve everyone's working environment.

3,Your Work Ethic Is Not the Problem — Debunking Three Modern-Day Productivity Myths,"Apr 22, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/lets-debunk-these-3-modern-day-productivity-myths/471744,"
In ancient Greece, philosophers like Plato and Aristotle were already grappling with the notion of work-life balance. The latter described amusement as a remedy for the ""ills of work,"" which he said was accompanied by ""toil and strain."" Work, they acknowledged, was necessary for living a virtuous life — and paying for stuff — but it shouldn't be the end, in and of itself.Nearly two-and-a-half millennia later, we still struggle to define what constitutes a good life and how work and productivity factor in. Our modern-day hustle culture, and many of today's outspoken business leaders, would have you believe that more is more. A steely, unwavering work ethic is a requisite for success. Sleep can wait, so the thinking goes.But a growing body of research plus some innovative companies are showing that the truth about productivity is more nuanced. More isn't always more — but working long hours isn't always bad either. There are no hard and fast rules.

4,Do You Want to Live to Be 100? This Researcher Has the Answer to Why Longevity is Not a Quick Fix or Trendy Diet,"Apr 19, 2024",Elisette Carlson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/do-you-want-to-live-to-be-100-this-researcher-has-the/472338,"
Dan Buettner is an explorer, National Geographic fellow, award-winning journalist and producer, and author of The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer from the People Who've Lived the Longest. In 2000, Buettner traveled to Okinawa, Japan, to investigate why people lived to be 100 and beyond there. With the support of National Geographic, Buettner and his team then traveled around the world in 2004 to explore other regions with reportedly high lifespan, better known as longevity.He identified five places, which he named ""The Blue Zones,"" where people live the longest, healthiest lives. The five original Blue Zones were Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece; and Loma Linda, California. The research and learnings from the five populations where he interviewed many centenarians living high-quality lives became a Netflix Documentary entitled ""Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones."" Within these communities, people prioritized family values, community, Mediterranean diets and living in walkable neighborhoods.I've known of Dan for years, and while I don't hold his three Guinness World Records in distance cycling, we share a mutual passion for cycling and the outdoors. I intended to dig deeper into his insights regarding how people, especially in America, always look for the quick fix and jump on the latest fad wagon. Be it Ozempic, no alcohol, cold plunging or eating a carnivore diet, I asked Dan for his opinions on these trends, more of which included CrossFit workouts, keto diets and intermittent fasting.



I said to Buettner, ""Amongst all of these protocols, trends, supplements and nutrition plans, where is the magic of longevity?""""There is no short-term fix,"" he responded. ""We keep searching for it, and we keep failing. None of it has been proven to work on humans for more than single digits of a percentage of people.""


Every year, we are marketed to try new diets, supplements and workouts and three months into them, 90% of people fail at what they started. Buettner explained how he discovered five populations that are living long because their daily unconscious behaviors are healthy and sustainable. And guess what? It doesn't cost much.Related: Adopt These 9 Habits and You'll Be Unrecognizable By the End of 2024Nutrition and specific foodsBeginning with food, Buettner explained how people eat so much processed food and tend to rely on a ""see food"" diet. If we see it on our counter or pantry, or there are treats in the office, we eat them and are mindlessly eating.This data was backed by research at Cornell, and in his books, he encourages people to set out bowls of fruit in their kitchens and keep healthy food accessible, including beans and nuts, both of which have strong nutritional benefits and help reduce inflammation. Beans are also loaded with fiber, something that 80-90% of Americans need more of, and they're inexpensive, shelf-stable and benefit the healthy gut bacteria. Buettner also relies on a handful of nuts daily, and his research shows that nuts add 2-3 years to life expectancy.


Buettner eats a plant-based diet, and the five cultures in the Blue Zones mostly do the same. These communities eat meat about once per week, whereas an American eats an average of 240 pounds per year — ""about a bathtub full of meat.""He explained that meat is like radiation in that we know we are likely going to die sooner of Type 2 diabetes or cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. He also loves his coffee and explains that coffee drinkers have lower rates of Type 2 diabetes or Parkinson's and also have better physical endurance and cardiovascular output.Related: These Four Words Can Change The Way You Approach Every Impossible TaskCommunity and purposeYour circle of friends influences happiness, health and a sense of purpose. For example, if you have active friends, you'll likely be active, and if your best friends are obese, there's a good chance you'll be influenced in that direction. ""Upgrade your circle of friends"" to people who will encourage you to be happy and healthy, make you laugh and make you feel good about yourself when you are with them.


Related: Your Peers Shouldn't (Only) Think Like You Moving naturally and avoiding health trends that failSo how about sauna and cold-plunging? Buettner occasionally saunas and believes that cold plunging is already on the decline. Unless you are swimming in the ocean, surfing or doing something you enjoy, he believes that intense cold plunging at 35-40 degrees, which is what most cold plunge studios do, is painful. As with most gym and nutrition trends, people get excited for a few weeks or maybe a year, and then they almost all say, ""Enough.""I loved hearing Buetter explain that the ""no pain, no gain"" mentality is wrong. The opposite is correct and true: ""The least pain, the most gain,"" and doing this long enough to make a difference is precisely what populations in the Blue Zones do. The Blue Zones populations interact with the outside environment, sit down at meals with their family, socialize with friends and prioritize sleep.These are human things that bring joy amongst daily and inexpensive habits that expand lifespan — such as living in walkable neighborhoods where you walk to get your food and run your errands, eating mostly fresh and non-processed food and avoiding things that cause you pain.


When I asked him about Ozempic, he exclaimed, ""Who the hell wants to jam a needle into their gut to lose weight?"" Again, it's another fad miles away from longevity.The number of obese people in America has tripled since 1980, and Buettner explained how this is an unmitigated mental health failure. Most Americans get fewer than 20 minutes of exercise per day, while Blue Zone people walk to most locations, garden or weed in their yards and practice stress-reducing activities, unlike CrossFit, which can raise inflammation and cause injury.Buettner, also an outdoor enthusiast, passionate about ultralight hiking and pickleball, explained that 75% of Americans can benefit by simply walking to work or taking public transportation. The morning we spoke, Buettner told me that he went to get a haircut, had a physical therapy appointment and then picked up some breakfast, all on his bike.I encourage you to watch the Blue Zones documentary to learn more about specific longevity lifestyle habits. If we all adjusted just a few small daily habits, it might just help us 'Live to 100.'

5,How to Escape Entrepreneurial Burnout When You Can't Just Quit,"Apr 18, 2024",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-escape-entrepreneurial-burnout-when-you-cant-quit/471967,"
I have experienced burnout before as an entrepreneur. Yes, burnout is an extremely common topic. A quick search mostly shows tips on how to avoid it, which is great until you find yourself in the middle of it. In fact, I found that when I actually experienced it for myself, few resources gave me an answer that would work with my life.The number one answer I found online? If you're experiencing burnout, quit your job. For someone who owns a business, that's not so easy. Now, it's not impossible to get rid of your business and change career paths. If you want to do that, you certainly can.However, being an entrepreneur certainly follows the idiom: in for a penny, in for a pound. Most business owners I know are all in. There is no other career for them. Finances, schedules and other people's lives are all tied to a business. Stepping away is not always an option.



So, what do you do when you're experiencing burnout as an entrepreneur and you feel like your entire career is on life support as you barely make it through each day?Related: 3 Insights From the First Large-Scale Study on Burnout and Entrepreneurs


Address the root issueTake a moment to determine what is causing you the most stress. Pinpoint a few key stress-inducing areas. Perhaps it is a single client. Run through the numbers — can you part ways with that client? Are they worth the hassle? And if they are a larger client, you can come up with a plan to find someone else to replace that revenue stream. Businesses are always changing. You are not required to have the same clients for 10 years, 20 years or even a single year. Some companies and some clients do not work well with each other, and that is okay.Perhaps you just feel as though you've lost passion for the job. Do you feel bogged down with menial tasks? Maybe you're a more creative person, but as your business has grown, you've found yourself stuck with things like scheduling meetings and following up on emails. You should hire a virtual assistant. They can share the load and get smaller items off your plate so you can focus on what you love to do.Maybe you've just lost sight of your ""why"" along the way: You don't remember why you started your business or what made you passionate about it. Try going down memory lane — look through old photos or social media posts, talk to people who knew you before you started your business, and maybe even see if you can find some notes from when you first started. This can help you get a little perspective back on the company so that you can make a plan to get back to your original mission.While I would love to say take a week off from work to really sit with yourself and review what's going on, I understand that's not always possible. Pick a holiday or your slowest time of the year. Block off some time as though you are in a meeting and figure out what the root cause of your burnout is, and then make a plan on how to change things so you do not experience it again.


Protect your healthAbove all else, protect your health. According to the Mayo Clinic, burnout is a serious health concern. You don't just feel tired and sluggish — your entire body is suffering and will show signs such as exhaustion, loss of sleep, mood changes and more. Burnout can quite literally turn you into a different person if you are not careful.And, if you continue to try and push through it, you will find that your body will stop you by making you get sicker more often, or even causing you to develop a serious issue such as heart disease. Burnout should not be taken lightly.I want to provide a bit of a warning: If you've realized that you do need to step away from your business to stay healthy, then you should do so. That is not an easy decision, but at the end of the day, you need to protect your health. As entrepreneurs, we are driven by our businesses and often feel obligated to clients, so it might help to reframe it like this: Losing you to a serious disease will cause more problems for friends, family, employees and clients versus you deciding you need to step away to stay healthy and ultimately happy.Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Protect Their Mental Health While Being Their Own BossOn the other hand, if you want to keep your company and find ways around burnout, try these solutions:Consider seeking therapy. Sometimes pushing yourself to burnout can be a symptom of larger issues that a medical professional can help with.Set boundaries. You are your own worst enemy, and you will work too hard, pushing yourself to impossible deadlines that maybe not even your clients have asked for. Set times to work and set times to step away from work. Good clients who recognize the value your business brings will honor those times.Take a break. You might not be able to work a full vacation into your schedule, but you can set 10 to 15-minute breaks throughout the day to just breathe.Work out your stress. Although you may feel exhausted and sluggish, burnout is actually just another type of stress, which means it can be relieved through physical activities such as walks or high-intensity workouts.If you find yourself suffering from burnout, don't give up hope. Instead, give your career some CPR and get it off life support by reaching out to others for help so that you can protect your health and your business.

6,Eliminate Busy Work and Become More Productive with These Task Management Tips,"Apr 18, 2024",Kimberly Zhang,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/boost-efficiency-by-eliminating-busy-work-now/472852,"
Productivity means doing things smartly and efficiently. When you're productive, you're not just busy—you're doing things that really matter. First, think about what you want to achieve. Then, make a plan to reach those goals. Being productive means using your time and resources wisely. So, stay focused, plan well, and avoid busy work to maximize your efforts.Identifying busy workBusy work is when you spend time and energy on tasks that don't help you achieve your goals. Sometimes, we do helpful things but don't make real progress.Examples of busy work include talking about things that don't matter, spending too much time on emails, or going to meetings that aren't important. It's like spinning your wheels – lots of action but not going anywhere. Instead, focus on activities that actually move you closer to your goals. That's true productivity, not just being busy.



Using a time clock can help you keep track of how much time you spend on tasks. This can help you work faster and more efficiently.Emails can be distracting. But you can avoid interruptions by setting specific times to check them. This way, you can focus better on important tasks instead of getting caught up in busy work. So, next time you're working on something, try using a time clock and setting email-checking times. It could really help you be more productive.


Related: This Bad Work Habit Is Stealing a Shocking 72 Days of Your Time Per YearWorkplace productivity statisticsDid you know that the average worker is only productive for about 60% of their workday? That means a lot of time might be spent not getting much done. It's even less for office workers – only around two and a half hours of real productivity each day.When teams are engaged and work well together, amazing things can happen. Highly engaged teams have fewer problems, such as internal theft, absenteeism, and job turnover.Surprisingly, social media can cost businesses a lot of money. Employees spending time on Facebook and other sites wastes billions of dollars annually. And those long, unproductive meetings? They're taking up billions of hours, too.


Nowadays, it's not just about being busy – it's about having the right talent. Talented and right employees can change how much work gets done. In fact, they can be up to 400% more productive than average workers. The best ones can even complete difficult tasks super efficiently, sometimes reaching productivity levels that are eight times higher than normal.Related: Wasted Employee Time Adds Up: Here's How to Fix ItKey elements of productivity Did you know that employees can be twice as productive when they are engaged in their work? When people feel connected to what they're doing, they tend to work harder and get more done.But there's something else that can affect how productive people are: sleep. If you're not getting enough sleep, it can make you less efficient at work. In fact, sleep deprivation costs businesses a lot of money – $63 billion every year. And it's not just a few people – one-third of workers in the US aren't getting the sleep they need.


Another thing that can distract people at work is the internet. When employees spend time online doing things like watching sports or shopping, their productivity can be cut in half. It's important to stay focused on work tasks to get things done efficiently.Turning busy work into productivity To make sure your team is using their time wisely, it's important to plan ahead and delegate tasks properly. Start by figuring out what needs to be done first, and then guide your team to focus on those tasks. This will help them stay on track and motivated.If you notice your team spending too much time on the same things over and over, try finding ways to make those tasks easier. You could use software or tools to automate them or group similar tasks together to get them done more efficiently.It's also a good idea to break up the workday into smaller chunks and take breaks in between. This can help prevent burnout and keep your productivity levels high. Also, keeping the office tidy and organized can help reduce distractions and keep your team focused.


Besides, you can use tools like time clocks, to-do lists, and project management software. These can help your team stay organized and on top of their tasks. With the right planning and tools, busy work can become productive work in no time.If you delegate tasks based on expertise, you'll find less time wasted on busy work. Follow up by regularly evaluating workflow. Keep your team informed about fresh methods and tools; thus, you can support them in working more intelligently rather than just harder. Identify what needs improvement and be willing to make changes.Related: 12 Factors That Are Fueling Your Workplace Mental ExhaustionTools to stimulate productivity If you've ever used a legacy digital calendar to become better with time and more organized, you probably felt you were spending too much time entering and revising data. The latest digital calendars are equipped with AI-enabled solutions that memorize your schedule and take over booking, organizing, and updating events and meetings on your calendar. They also sync across devices and tools, enabling a more efficient and productive work process.


Cluttered inboxes are one of the most significant productivity roadblocks employees encounter. The best email management tools can categorize similar emails and give employees a variety of tools to manage them easily, quickly, and efficiently. They can block senders, delete multiple emails at once, or unsubscribe from emails automatically.Final VerdictsBy organizing tasks, setting clear goals, and using helpful tools, you can turn busy work into productive work. You should plan well, divide tasks wisely, and stay motivated to succeed. With your effort and the right methods, productivity can increase, distractions can decrease, and work can be more efficient for everyone.

Responses have been edited and condensed for clarity.Image Credit: Courtesy of CCRSP INC. Dr. Amareen Dhaliwal. How were you introduced to EdTech, and what inspired you to start your side hustle in that space?When I had the opportunity to tutor STEM classes in college, I quickly realized teaching was my passion. I excelled on the newly formatted MCAT and decided I wanted to help students achieve higher scores (one of my students even reached the 99th percentile!). A college friend suggested I create a pre-med club focused on innovative learning experiences, which sparked my interest in curriculum development and the use of learning management systems supported by professionals in medical and scientific fields. The idea to build a website and offer tutoring services emerged after I hosted a successful MCAT seminar, and my commitment to tutoring in college laid the foundation for my future endeavors.



My tutoring venture expanded into a holistic coaching experience, which focused on the psychology of studying, anxiety management and wellness, including the utilization of 24-hour planners, exercise and nutrition. This comprehensive approach led me to pursue a psychiatry residency. Despite not initially seeing myself as a business person, the need for innovation in MCAT preparation drove me to entrepreneurship.Related: Best New Shows for Entrepreneurs (Streaming Free)


After collaborating with peers in clinical trials, we launched online clinical research courses, aiming for excellence and continuous improvement. This endeavor was more than a business; it was about making a meaningful impact and addressing broader needs. CCRPS INC was founded to address the underemployment of foreign medical graduates and healthcare professionals in the U.S. despite their impressive credentials. Together with colleagues in clinical trials, we aimed to provide educational courses to help these individuals secure entry-level positions that offer both competitive salaries and a sense of purpose. We established a strong online presence, developed expert-led courses and focused on education and career preparation. Our commitment to quality content quickly earned us recognition and trust, positioning CCRPS as a leader in the field.What were some of the first steps you took to get CCRPS off the ground?First, we identified our niche by recognizing a gap for non-clinical medical professionals seeking valuable career paths. We built a user-friendly website and formed partnerships with providers, building trust by seeking out video and audio reviews from graduate students to help other students have a better idea of our comprehensive and in-depth educational approach. We collaborated with experts to create high-quality course materials and secured the necessary accreditations to establish credibility. We also offered comprehensive career support and focused on quality education, which spurred organic growth through referrals and a robust online presence.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Building and growing a startup requires constant ""figuring out"" of challenges. The biggest challenge was meeting and surpassing our clients' needs so they could continue to grow. Additionally, delegating to the right people requires trial and error; you can't expect to get it right from day one! The key to overcoming these challenges is learning to be okay with the ups and downs, being the rock when changes don't go as planned and consistently providing excellent services.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


How long did it take you to see consistent revenue from your work within EdTech?From the outset, our business achieved net profitability, a testament to our compelling curriculum. Starting with one in-person student whose enrollment funded our initial website and SEO efforts, we adopted a strategy that allowed us to reinvest early profits into expanding our operations. This approach was essential in both our foundational stages and as we scaled, particularly with the MCAT company.Despite promising early enrollments, our focus has always been on student success and quality education rather than merely generating revenue. This commitment enabled us to reduce prices over time, making education more accessible and aligning with our belief in the importance of affordable education. Engaging students meaningfully requires commitment, evidenced by our successful partnerships with contract research organizations and our lean yet effective operational model.How do you balance your entrepreneurial pursuits with a demanding career in medicine?Following a year-long hiatus to launch CCRPS, I transitioned back into my residency. Today, brilliant clinical research professionals and a solid team manage the day-to-day operations and business aspects, ensuring student success remains a priority at CCRPS while I fully immerse myself and focus on my residency.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


What do you enjoy most about running your own business?I appreciate the profound influence I can have on students' success and career advancement. Witnessing their growth, seeing their achievements and knowing that we play a pivotal role in shaping their futures is incredibly rewarding and reaffirms my passion for education entrepreneurship every day. With over 22,000 student members from more than 1,200 organizations, including six government agencies and 308 universities, the reach and influence of CCRPS are evident. A 2024 LinkedIn review of graduates highlighted remarkable outcomes, with placements in over 1,600 companies and 23% achieving managerial roles or higher. Furthermore, the initiative has significantly contributed to developing the clinical research workforce for various contract research organizations. This progress, driven by a team of exceptional clinical research educators, underscores the collective effort and dedication to advancing clinical trials and healthcare.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful businesses?Learning how to harness and delegate our strengths effectively is crucial. Sometimes, guidance from those who've walked the path before us can be a game-changer; seeking expert mentorship in areas we find challenging can make all the difference.Start small and focus on what matters: In a world brimming with startups, it's vital to remember that at the heart of every idea and venture are the people we aim to help. They are our priority, always. Let's embrace our unique talents, lean into learning and always put people first.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

8,5 Ways to Maximize Your Returns at Live Conferences,"Apr 12, 2024",Lena Grundhoefer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/maximize-your-roi-at-live-conferences-with-these-5/472055,"
Conferences are among the most important marketing avenues for my consultancy, and I'm not alone. The global live event industry (which includes live sports and concerts, corporate events, and conference and exhibitions) surpassed $650 billion last year and is projected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2032.Of course, it's worth mentioning that conferences aren't guaranteed success. E3 was once the most important annual video game event, but it struggled to remain relevant after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and inevitably shut down permanently in December. Although sad, it's an anomaly in a recovering industry–events like CES, SXSW and ComicCon bounced back and continue to prove their value for major brands and professionals alike.Major players like Apple, Amazon and Coca-Cola have robust live event strategies, so clearly, the return on investment is there for planners, buyers and exhibitors from the top brands in the world.



The average trade-show budget for exhibitors was $1.4 million last year, an increase even from pre-pandemic levels. Add-ons like panel and stage participation, awards and strategic advertising throughout the event increase costs. However, calculating the ROI of these expenses can get complicated.Related: How to Network at Events Like a Pro and Watch Your Startup SoarThrough working countless events and putting many hours behind the upsides and even pitfalls, here are five tips to maximize your ROI at events.1. Lean into your brandingBranding is perhaps the most important factor for attending, sponsoring or exhibiting at a major event. In fact, research found conferences can increase brand recognition by up to 76%, although 85% of exhibitors say their primary reason for attending is to generate leads and sales (covered in the next point).To maximize this benefit, be sure everything you bring with you to the show improves your branding down to every detail. This includes what your team wears to the event, any merch you plan to hand out, marketing materials, brochures, clipboards and pens used, and more. These events fly by fast, with a lot going on at once, and it's important to make a lasting impression quickly for the best possible results.2. Nail a clear call to actionAs mentioned above, sales leads are the lifeblood of any business, and conferences can make or break your company. That's why it's necessary to have a clear call to action in all of your branded materials. If you forge a strong connection with a potential prospect, you need to close the sale before they talk to someone else and forget.


Conferences last from a couple of days to a week, and you'll meet hundreds or even thousands of potential prospects in that time. You should have a highly polished elevator pitch (30 to 60 seconds) that easily highlights the selling points of your business, and it needs to end with a simple and intuitive CTA to ensure you complete the necessary sales to guarantee an ROI.And following up a week or two after the event is equally important in closing the deal.Related: 5 Ways to Make the Most Out of an Industry Conference3. Leverage satellite eventsEveryone assumes the business happens on the trade floor, but little do they know the handshakes happen in intimate settings. Every conference has satellite events, and these typically happen at the various venues surrounding the main event venue. Decision-makers often attend these get-togethers to network, and these side events are where it's at.


These side events are also a great way to benefit without a ticket to the main event. It's not unusual for aspiring entrepreneurs to lurk outside the main convention to learn more about side events happening after hours and stake those out to meet potential investors and clients. A handshake deal after hours can make the difference between a win and a loss at the event.4. Tag teaming makes the dream workOrganization is the best way to ensure success, and conferences are best handled with a team of three or more people. Throughout the event, the exhibition floor remains active, and there are plenty of conferences and panel discussions happening simultaneously. It's impossible to be everywhere at once unless you have a team willing to divide and conquer.Set up a time and place to meet at the end of the day, and keep two-way radios on hand, as event Wi-Fi can be spotty. These small radios have about a six-mile radius, which is more than enough to keep you in contact throughout any major event. Staying in contact with each other ensures you maximize potential opportunities throughout the event without doubling up on each other's efforts.Related: 5 Tips to Networking at Conferences as an Introvert


5. Have fun!Above all else, it's important to have fun when attending conferences. Although it's a business trip, these events can be a fun place to meet up with people you've only worked with virtually. Getting to know other people and learning new things can help you build your community, even if you don't close the deal.ConclusionConferences are a cornerstone of business, and even at the height of pandemic lockdowns, live virtual events came through. If you're looking for a way to elevate your business to the next level, attending a live conference or conference can be the way to go.It's not guaranteed, though–these events are expensive, with tickets that can cost thousands of dollars and exhibits and sponsorships that easily cost seven to eight figures. Without careful planning, it's easy to waste money without any tangible ROI. Some people even find success offsite without ever buying a ticket to the main event.Be sure you have a solid plan and execute on it for the best possible outcome. If you do it right, you can easily land the deal that makes up for the cost of the event and creates sustainable long-term success for your business.

9,We Live in a Data-Driven World — Here's a Case For Listening to Your Gut Instead,"Apr 12, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/its-a-data-driven-world-but-i-say-listen-to-your-gut/471040,"
Fresh or frozen? That was the million dollar question facing restaurateur Danny Meyer following a searing New York Times review. The local rag had torn into Meyer's slowly growing Shake Shack empire — then about 30 restaurants — for serving frozen french fries. Pride wounded, Meyer quickly switched to fresh fries without thoroughly researching the alternative. If he had, he may have discovered that fresh fries have to be fried three separate times, and the taste and quality are inconsistent. A year later, the burger chain converted back to frozen.The takeaway? Meyer should have listened to his gut. Despite the review, high-quality frozen fries were working for customers. You know the adage: If it's not broken, don't fix it. And second, Meyer could have dug more into the data and researched the proposed business change. He may have realized that it wasn't worth switching to fresh — that his intuition had been right all along. It's a prime example of why leaders should pay heed to data and their gut.In recent years, there's been a big push toward data-driven decision-making. Author and Wharton professor Adam Grant told the Washington Post:

10,Feeling Overwhelmed at Work? Follow These Tips to Prevent It From Turning Into Burnout.,"Apr 11, 2024",Cyrus Claffey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/feeling-overwhelmed-at-work-heres-how-to-handle-it/472314,"
Running a successful business isn't just about finding a lightning-in-a-bottle idea or hiring a great team to surround yourself with; it's also about staying motivated and making sure you don't become too overwhelmed. Keep in mind, however, that acknowledging that you're overwhelmed isn't a sign of weakness but of great self-awareness.It's a skill to step back from a project and say, ""I'm swamped, and I need more help on this project or time away to regroup."" As a business founder and owner at ButterflyMX, I've learned that how you proceed after this acknowledgment is key to not letting your overwhelm turn into burnout.Related: Overwhelmed? These 10 Techniques Can Help You Cope With Uncomfortable Feelings.



Early indications of being overwhelmedIn order to prevent being overwhelmed from morphing into burnout, you have to first be able to detect it. This is hard because many early indications of being overwhelmed are subtle and can be mistaken for typical workplace stress. Still, keeping tabs on the indicators to see if they become persistent over time is a good way to become aware of overwhelm early.Here are a few key indicators that you're becoming overwhelmed at work:


Never-ending feelings of anxiety surrounding projects, meetings and deadlines.Consistently working extended hours that considerably disrupt your work-life balance.Feeling a continual decline in job satisfaction despite achievements.A focus on formerly routine tasks and deadlines as grueling and taxing.You feel like you're facing challenges you can't handle rather than healthily challenging yourself.Overall, when your focus at work shifts from the solutions you're finding to the problems you're facing, you're probably reaching a tipping point. So, it's important to face this issue head-on before it becomes unmanageable.What fuels the state of being overwhelmed?You've determined that you may be overwhelmed, which could very easily turn into burnout at work. What's next? Determining what's fueling your overwhelmed feelings could point you toward a solution.So, what fuels the state of being overwhelmed?


There are a handful of reasons one might become overwhelmed at work. The pressure to grow and climb the corporate ladder, the wish to be a linchpin member of your team or simply the desire to appease your boss and colleagues are all common reasons people become overwhelmed. Noticing that you've felt any or all of these things in conjunction with key indicators of overwhelm may mean that it's time for you to set more professional boundaries.Related: 7 Tips to Avoid Burnout When Growing a BusinessSetting professional boundariesWhen responding to feeling overwhelmed, you don't need to drop all of your responsibilities in order to avoid burnout. Instead, you can reassess your task management style in order to set more firm professional boundaries. When doing this, look at how you prioritize projects, how you delegate tasks and how you and your team members manage your time. You may think that you're doing all of these things well, but until you take a step back and really examine how you manage your tasks, you're unlikely to reduce your frustrations.But what exactly does setting professional boundaries look like? This varies from professional to professional, but most of the time, it starts with the same few things.


First, map out and clearly communicate when projects must be completed, so you and your team are on the same page about deadlines.Second, delegate tasks to your direct reports — and have them delegate to their own teams. Not only does delegating tasks immediately lighten your workload, but it also gives your direct reports the chance to challenge themselves by doing a task outside of their comfort zone. Just be sure to check in on their progress and offer helpful feedback on their work.Third, set professional boundaries to avoid being overwhelmed, which includes project prioritization. Do you have two projects due the same week and don't know which to start with? Consider which project will affect the largest group of people. If one project is a report due that needs to be completed before a larger project can move forward, and your other project is a draft that won't be published for several days or even weeks, start with the report. And if you ever need to push a deadline back in order to prioritize a more pressing project, inform those who will be affected well ahead of time to avoid surprises.Related: 7 Ways to Reduce Stress When You Are Overwhelmed and Need to Prioritize


Recovering from feeling overwhelmedOnce you've faced your feeling of being overwhelmed head-on, you need to apply long-term solutions to ensure that the same lingering threat of burnout doesn't plague your future. But how can you do this?Recognizing areas of imbalance at work is important, but the steps you take to achieve stability are even more important. Keeping a healthy balance of professional challenges, workloads and professional relationships is key to becoming a successful worker long-term.Remember, knowing that you're feeling overwhelmed and taking steps to improve is not an admission of defeat. It's a mark of self-awareness and dedication to the greater good of your company.

Everyone knows the exasperation of unnecessary friction.We've all navigated systems that create maddening ordeals rather than give us simple answers, services, or refunds. We've sat through endless meetings with blabbermouths and ill-defined agendas. We've pulled our hair out over rules, procedures, traditions, and technologies that once made sense, but are now antiquated, pointless, and inefficient. These are all soul-crushing forms of organizational friction that make it difficult to do simple things. And as professors at Stanford's School of Engineering and Graduate School of Business, we spent the last seven years researching the causes and cures for these problems.But one of our biggest discoveries surprised us. It turns out that friction isn't always a problem. In fact, sometimes it can be a solution.

12,Specialization is No Longer the Path to Success — This Simple Life Hack Can Boost Your Career and Business,"Apr 4, 2024",Dustin Lemick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-elevate-your-business-with-skill-stacking/471765,"
It is a common belief that a razor-sharp focus on a single talent or skill is ideal for business success. The generalist or jack-of-all-trades is rarely considered optimal. Corporations often want employees to ""stay in their lane"" at work, where crossing into other skills or departments isn't encouraged or allowed.A number of professions, like legal and medical, require specialization. Industry consultants and experts often focus on a niche service. Production lines need workers to be proficient in one specific set of tasks. Cultivating expertise in a defined field or role is necessary for any career. Specializing in a particular talent or specific skill has its benefits.But, specialization can also be limiting and is not the sole path to success. Leaders and workers must be increasingly more flexible and adaptable in today's challenging economy and tech-powered world. That means rapidly learning and experiencing new and unexpected things related to their jobs. Even in careers and industries that require specialization, there has been a need to expand horizons. For example, restaurant owners must become tech-savvy and well-versed in e-commerce, food delivery apps, point-of-sale systems and social media marketing. Bringing a business online is a growing trend known as ""skill-stacking."" It can potentially help you, your workers and your organization.



Related: Why Being a Specialist Can Hurt Your Career SuccessThe premise of skill stacking is simple: be a generalist instead of a specialist. Rather than deep proficiency in one line of work, you aim to gain experience across many relevant practices. Obtaining these experiences can be applied to most job roles and at any stage of your career. Building a flexible and capable workforce across a broader range of business capabilities can help drive your company forward. For leaders, a working knowledge of all facets of your organization's needs can have infinite upside. For workers and job seekers, skill-stacking can enable you to increase your value while advancing your career. In entrepreneurship, it is not optional. You have to be capable of understanding and doing everything, especially at an early-stage startup.


I first encountered skill-stacking in college at UW-Madison. I was an Econ major exposed to wide-ranging areas of macroeconomics. At the time, I thought about how to apply what I was learning in the real world if I wasn't going to be a trader or an economist. However, it taught me a generalist skill set —thinking differently to recognize the value of gaining information and understanding across a broad spectrum of ideas and practices. I developed a willingness and interest to learn how to tackle just about everything. Today, I use skill-stacking daily as a founder and CEO and encourage our team members at BriteCo to do so.Related: 5 Invaluable Soft Skills to Seek in Your Next HireFor example, I knew little about digital marketing when I started my company. I am now proficient enough to help guide and drive results from learning and doing it. Am I an expert? No. Do I know enough to be dangerous? I do. I can recognize when something isn't accurate or working as intended and call it out. I can think strategically with enough tactical understanding to be an asset beyond my traditional role. It has helped. The more exposure to new and different business functions relevant to your company, the more you can learn how things work and where you can best contribute. Being a generalist helps you access other ways of thinking, approaches and insights you may not have gained otherwise. Building on top of your core expertise, you gain more.It's not just about knowledge but how you obtain the knowledge. It's about setting a base of expertise that serves as your ""personal infrastructure"" and building on top of it. That's the goal. Today, my infrastructure has gained depth and breadth across various experiences, skills and insights relevant to running my company. This is the skill-stacking effect.


Related: How to Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable, No Matter Your Age — Lessons for EntrepreneursAs a founder, CEO and leader, you can incorporate skill-stacking into your work by evaluating your current personal infrastructure. Then, build out the areas that you aren't as familiar with. These might include focusing on your customer support or learning from a third-party service provider of a critical business goal such as paid search or publicity. Keep an open mind and be curious. Make it a point to engage differently with a more hands-on, engaged approach. Continuously learn and participate. To instill the value of skill-stacking in your organization, encourage employees to explore and expand their infrastructure. Make it an integral part of your company culture.I prefer to learn new skills by doing. My research typically involves talking directly to people, hearing their perspectives and sharing their expertise. I also follow many business experts on social media. Others may prefer a more traditional textbook way. Some opt for online and on-campus courses and classes. All of these approaches to skill-stacking can be effective. Consider what works best for you and offer your employees various options.Try to include learning by doing whatever is possible. A direct, hands-on experience can provide unequaled value. Regularly check in with people and see how they're progressing. Encourage cross-participation and continuous sharing of execution experiences. Building a skill stack personally and across your organization can pay big dividends personally and professionally.

I had zero interest from potential clients, so I moved on to Facebook. I posted photos of the venue every day and came up with a package, which I posted on Facebook as well. I immediately booked two weddings, and after that, the leads started flowing in from referrals and sharing about successful events.


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them? One of the bigger challenges was learning to take the public's opinion with a grain of salt regarding what and how I should do things regarding the venue. There were a lot of strong opinions on what I should do with the barn due to its local history. Many people felt they had a valuable opinion of what should be done and how it should be done. One of the other big challenges was learning how to set and respect my boundaries and balance my personal time with work. In the first five years of getting the venue off the ground, I was terrible at work-life balance. I was consumed by the venue and did not give much thought to my own personal time.Related: This Mom Started a Side Hustle After a 'Shocking' Realization in the Toy Aisle.

14,"Use This Type of Routine and 4 Other Powerful Tips to Be More Productive, Pulitzer Prize Winner Michael Lewis Says","Apr 4, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/productivity-tips-from-pulitzer-prize-winner-michael-lewis/472060,"
Sleep, exercise and good nutrition are proven stress reducers and productivity enhancers, according to Harvard Business Review. That might sound simple enough, yet more than half of employees report being relatively unproductive at work, per McKinsey & Company. So what else exactly goes into unleashing creativity and optimizing performance in the workplace or in pursuit of another professional goal?Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Lewis, acclaimed author of hit titles including Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game, The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine and most recently Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon, about the crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, explores just that in his new class on MasterClass.The class not only breaks down Lewis's unique approach to masterful storytelling — ""which will enhance your life in all kinds of ways,"" the author says — but it also delves into the processes that lead to productivity and success in writing-related endeavors and beyond.



Related: 'Big Short' Investor: SVB Crisis Is Accelerating Economic Slowdown""At the bottom of the best me is love. It's love of what I do; it's love of the characters, for better or worse.""One essential component? That would be the creation of an environment conducive to success, according to Lewis. You have to zero in on that space and commit to it, the author says, adding that you should choose a location ""where you feel safe."" For Lewis, that means working in his office surrounded by photos of his family. ""At the bottom of the best me is love,"" he explains. ""It's love of what I do; it's love of the characters, for better or worse. It's love of telling stories. It's love of the interaction with the reader.""Additionally, Lewis suggests minimizing all potential distractions: Remove the cell phone from your desk ""because it's only a matter of time before it buzzes or rings,"" and consider slipping on headphones to listen to a mix tape. ""The key to it all is the feeling of impossible interruption,"" Lewis says. After a while, that playlist might even have a Pavlovian effect and kickstart any working session, he adds, admitting he wrote the whole of The Undoing Project to Frozen's ""Let It Go.""Related: 10 Simple Productivity Tips for Organizing Your Work Life""It's useful to have routine, but the minute it becomes a superstition…it becomes a crutch.""Lewis also notes that we can ""learn from the smartest baseball players about the power of routine,"" but the trick is to establish a loose routine — and ensure it doesn't start to get in our own way. ""You need to insist upon the difference of routine and superstition,"" he explains. ""It's useful to have routine, but the minute it becomes a superstition…it becomes a crutch.""Lewis prefers to write at the beginning of the day because ""your mind processes problems when you sleep"" or at the end of the day (he sometimes worked from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. before he had kids). Otherwise, Lewis isn't precious about it: ""The routine is put my ass in the chair. Don't get up until I have 1,000 words. Let that be a floor, not a ceiling. If you can go beyond that, that's great.""Related: Want to Be More Productive? Stop Trying to Finish Every Task, and Do This Instead""I know exactly where I want to go so there's no snag. When I start the next day, it will be obvious where I start.""Another perhaps surprising tip from the author is to ""stop before you're actually finished"" — essentially, you want to interrupt yourself in the middle of a task when it's going well so that it's easier to jump back into it later. ""I know exactly where I want to go, so there's no snag,"" Lewis explains. ""When I start the next day, it will be obvious where I start.""And some final words of wisdom for those who have their sights set on a writing project? Although you can ""be in almost any mood when you start writing,"" it's better to edit when you're in a good one. ""Write on caffeine, edit on wine,"" Lewis says. ""Don't write on wine and edit on caffeine. That's the wrong way around. It's a very bad way to do it.""

15,A Student in an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class Asked a Tough Question: What If Your Boss's Downfall Is Necessary to Get Ahead?,"Apr 2, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/mentora-lift-accelerates-performance-breakthroughs-at-work/472054,"
Seventy percent of employees avoid difficult conversations with their boss, colleagues or direct reports, according to a study by coaching and training firm Bravely. Unfortunately, awkward interactions in the workplace are often necessary to see positive results — including those in the form of a promotion or raise.One recent study from UK-based Reed Recruitment found that more than half of employees surveyed hesitate to broach the subject of career advancement, with 16% admitting that they simply don't know what to say. What if someone could help them find the words and prepare them for any possible response?A GenAI-powered coach from Mentora Institute, the global institute dedicated to developing exemplary leaders and accelerating performance, does just that.Related: I Attended an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class and Learned How Steve Jobs Became a Better Leader in 10 MinutesThe just-launched Mentora LiFT is designed to expedite performance breakthroughs at work with actionable and personalized coaching with ""the path breaking leading-in-flow method,"" Dr. Hitendra Wadhwa, Mentora founder and professor at Columbia Business School, shared in Harvard Business Review.



The tool became available for enterprises on April 2, and individuals will be able to access LiFT in waves with priority given to those on the waitlist and those who sign up today and throughout the week. Its three-level price tier includes an individual version for $45 per month, a professional version for $195 per month and an annual subscription for $1,995.How do you bring up the possibility of a promotion or raise when the path to career advancement isn't clear?In January, I had the opportunity to sit in on Wadhwa's business course at Columbia and see the technology in action. Wadhwa, who also authored the book Inner Mastery, Outer Impact: How Your Five Core Energies Hold the Key to Success, teaches the university's most popular class on leadership and success. Wadhwa asked for some class participation to help show what Mentora LiFT could do — did anyone have a challenging situation at work they'd be willing to share and work through with the tool?The student selected revealed a common problem: How do you bring up the possibility of a promotion or raise when the path to career advancement isn't clear? In this student's case, though, an industry-specific constraint added some complexity. As a professional working in academic medicine, he said the hierarchical structure and long-established trajectory of those working within it meant those who chose to stick around could expect a slow climb to the top, one that ultimately hinged on their superior's departure — by choice or otherwise.What if the only way to get a promotion is for your boss to…die? Naturally, his question elicited some laughter, as did his admission of offering his boss cheeseburgers to speed the process up, but the general premise — how to start a tough conversation in the workplace — was just what Mentora LiFT needed to do its work.


Related: The Secret to How Businesses Can Fully Harness the Power of AIThe Mentora LiFT added possibilities — and a lot of them — to an otherwise stultifying situation.The student prepared for a meeting with his boss that could change the trajectory of his career, and by inputting his specific goals, received recommendations for concrete actions and a custom plan complete with intention-setting, action-review and centering and visualization practices — and all in just 10-15 minutes. The tool also offers a simulated role-play option for those important real-world conversations.The student still had a significant challenge ahead of him in shifting the status quo, but the Mentora LiFT added possibilities — and a lot of them — to an otherwise stultifying situation. And that's precisely what it was built to do.In early testing of LiFT by executives from major organizations such as Google, IBM, Amazon, Citibank, Mastercard and more, executives mostly or completely achieved their performance goals 80% of the time with the tool, which also delivered an immediate average boost of 20% in achieving performance goals, increasing to 135% over time after 10 uses.

16,How to Avoid the Pitfalls of Collaboration – and When to Skip It Altogether,"Apr 2, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-avoid-the-pitfalls-of-collaboration-and-when-to/470724,"
Olympic relay races are the apex of collaboration. If one person falters, it impacts the whole team.When it comes to order, there's no hard-and-fast rule. Some teams put their fastest runner first, but others opt to put them last. According to USC's director of track and field, Caryl Smith Gilbert, sometimes you need someone ""hard-nosed"" like Usain Bolt (formerly the fastest man on Earth) to close the race. Just watch Bolt's final Olympic relay race and you'll understand exactly what Smith Gilbert means. ""It's anyone's race,"" says the announcer before the final handoff. But as soon as the baton is in Bolt's hand, the race is over. Jamaica wins by a long shot.Imagine if runners were less likely to participate in relays if they had to run last because they figured they'd get less credit. That's the case when it comes to publications in the field of economics. Researchers found that people were less likely to collaborate on articles if their surname was lower down in the alphabet — meaning they would be listed later in the byline. The reason is that when people think they're receiving less credit, they're less inclined to collaborate.

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2008, Vaccarella needed a better, practical beach bag — so she decided to create one herself. 
      


        The bags flew off shelves at a local boutique, but disaster struck after she invested her kids' college savings in more pieces. 
      


        Hurricane Sandy ""unexpectedly opened a door,"" leading to donations and increased interest in the bags. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Kim Vaccarella, founder of Bogg Bag, which offers a ""lightweight, durable, washable collection"" of bags and is on track to see $100 million in revenue this year, per the company. Image Credit: Courtesy of Bogg Bag. Kim Vaccarella. Did you have a 9-5 when you started the business? Yes, I spent 26 years in commercial real estate before fully dedicating myself to Bogg in 2018.



When did you start the business, and where did you find the inspiration for it?It seems like a lifetime ago. The idea came to me in 2008, born out of a practical need for a better beach bag. I envisioned the ultimate mom bag: durable and sturdy, with non-collapsing sides, large enough to carry everything we needed and washable at the end of the day. The catalyst was a trip to the Jersey Shore and a serendipitous encounter with EVA material, which I realized was the perfect material for crafting the perfect beach bag.Related: The Remote Side Hustle a 43-Year-Old Musician Works on for 1 Hour a Day Earns Nearly $3,000 a Month: 'All From the Comfort of Home'


What were some of the first steps you took to get Bogg Bag off the ground? How did you come up with the ""Bogg Bag"" name?As a full-time working mom with no experience in bag sales, the leap into launching Bogg Bag was huge. The idea came to me as a necessity, and despite the challenge of stepping into unfamiliar territory, I was determined to give it a go.The goal initially was to patent the Bogg Bag concept and sell the idea, avoiding the complexities of manufacturing. After facing numerous rejections, I realized the only way to see my vision come to life was to do it myself.Naming the bag was simpler than you'd think. Reflecting on water, frogs and lily pads, I played around with words until Bogg stuck. It felt right, signaling a fresh start — Bogg, it's the new bag!You used your kids' college fund to bring the dream to life. What happened next?After our first batch hit a small local boutique, they flew off the shelves. At first, I wondered if it was just friends and family showing support, but I chose to believe it was genuine love for the product. Encouraged, I doubled down and ordered 600 more. Those sold out too. Feeling bold, I invested my kids' college savings into over 1,000 pieces. It was a major moment, unloading a full container in our storage unit's parking lot under the night sky. But as we unpacked, my heart sank — every piece was marred by black streaks, unsellable to the high standards I dreamt of for Bogg.

We found a new purpose for these imperfect bags. The storm had wreaked havoc on our community, so we repurposed the flawed bags as emergency kits filled with essentials for those affected by the storm, distributing them to families in need. It was a heartrending experience, but providing aid gave a new meaning to our efforts.Initially, I thought this marked the end of Bogg's journey. However, about a year later, our Facebook page lit up with messages from those recipients. Beyond their thanks, they wanted more bags — for themselves, for family, as gifts. That overwhelming response reignited my resolve. I knew then that Bogg had to make a comeback.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bogg Bag


What were some of the additional challenges you faced while building your business, and how did you navigate them?After leaving my steady job in 2018, the pressure of succeeding on my own was immense. Having been accustomed to a regular income for 26 years, the shift was daunting. I set an ambitious target: $1 million in sales for 2018. Miraculously, we hit it. Then 2019 began promisingly until Covid brought the world to a standstill. Like everyone, we were in uncharted territory with no playbook on how to adapt.While many brands shifted to online sales — a logical move in such uncertain times — we chose a path less traveled. We stayed in close touch with our retail partners, sharing in their hardships and looking for ways to support them. The Bogg Bag's unique selling point — its washability — unexpectedly became its strength during the pandemic. Hospitals purchased them for healthcare workers, schools for teachers, and stores filled them with goods for contactless pickups and deliveries as Easter approached.This approach may not have been the most profitable in the short term, but it was the right thing to do. Maintaining these relationships was more important than immediate gains. To this day, I'm grateful for the support we were able to provide during those tough times, a sentiment echoed by our partners whenever we meet at trade shows.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? What does total revenue look like now?Even in the early days of 2014 and 2015, we began seeing monthly revenue come in, albeit modest, but steady and growing. Fast forward to 2023: We hit a milestone that once seemed a distant dream, crossing over $50 million in revenue. Now, with momentum on our side, we're ambitiously setting our sights even higher, targeting a groundbreaking $100 million in 2024. This growth is a clear testament not only to our product's value but also to the incredible team behind Bogg and the unwavering support from our community. We truly have something special.

      Key Takeaways    



        The business world is in step with a 5-day workweek, so any change will be sure to come with challenges. 
      


        After my experience with a 35-hour workweek, I can definitely see it working.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

4-day workweeks — it's the trend every worker is quietly rooting for. The concept is simple: one less day of work a week without any changes to remuneration, benefits or workload. Yes, workload. That means doing 100% of the work in 80% of the time. That's if you want to keep 100% of the pay.Proponents of four-day workweeks say that this should be possible thanks to transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence, better management techniques (e.g., not everything needs a Zoom meeting) and boosted personal productivity that stems from a better work-life balance.These proponents are also amassing a substantial body of evidence that not only proves the feasibility of the four-day workweek but also shows workers to become more satisfied and loyal. That's a powerful benefit to companies in a time when rampant worker burnout and disengagement may be costing the economy nearly $2 trillion in lost productivity.



One recent four-day workweek pilot program featuring 41 US and Canadian companies saw both worker satisfaction and business revenue go up. None of the participating companies had a desire to return to a 5-day workweek.A larger trial in the UK saw virtually identical results, with 92% of participating companies opting to continue with the four-day model post-pilot for the same reasons as above – greater worker satisfaction and a 35% average increase in revenue. A similar story goes for Spain and South Africa. Plus, Portugal, Brazil, Germany and other countries that are running trials right now are likely to corroborate these findings further.


Related: Want a 4-Day Workweek? This Scheduling Strategy is the First StepToo radical of a change?For some businesses, however, letting a fifth of their working week go may be too hard a pill to swallow. And there's no denying it — it's a radical shift.The business world is in step with a 5-day workweek, and whether it's customer expectations or communication with partners, operations can get messy if you find yourself out of tune. Moreover, startups and other high-growth companies that already expect 120% from their employees on a regular day risk completely overwhelming their people by shortening the week.This is to say nothing of shift workers or entire industries that simply don't currently have the flexibility to adapt. Nearly a third of UK businesses find a four-day workweek infeasible, with the manufacturing, human resources, and travel sectors being the most pessimistic.


It's not all or nothingLet's be real — nobody has any illusions about businesses suddenly adopting a four-day workweek en masse in the coming years, no matter how many positive test runs make the headlines. Rather, the message that should be gleaned from all these studies is that there's an overwhelmingly positive response to shortened workweeks that typically translates to improved business performance.Many businesses are taking an incremental approach to tapping into these benefits without undermining daily operations. Instead of going from a standard 40-hour week to a 32-hour one, they're taking the middle road, opting for 35 — or 36-hour workweeks.These can come in various forms:7-hour work days. 7 hours a day, five days a week. This is how we do it at DeskTime, and the practice has been received positively by the team.Summer Fridays. Fridays are half-days. This is a popular policy during the summer months, hence the name.Staggered Fridays. Nine work days a fortnight, or taking every second Friday off. Allows for alternating shifts, e.g., in customer support.Working four fewer hours a week sounds less radical than eliminating an entire day. For most white-collar workers, that's equivalent to cutting out two meetings, which is not only doable but maybe dearly welcomed.


Indeed, many companies looking to adopt four-day or even 4.5-day workweeks set their crosshairs on reducing and optimizing meetings. Simply following meeting best practices — no time overruns, everyone arriving prepared, and clear processes — can help reclaim a sizable chunk of wasted hours. The promise that it's their own free time that they're reclaiming is a good incentive for workers to take these best practices seriously.Every company I've talked to that has attempted shortened workweeks in one form or another immediately references a notable drop in employee turnover. Hiring also becomes easier, and the employees are happier. And others have had similar positive experiences, too.Related: That 9-to-5 Job You Hate Isn't As Safe As You ThinkA step closer to 4-day workweeksAs a CEO, I was skeptical when I heard that four-day workweeks were trending. Now, after my experience with a 35-hour workweek, I can definitely see it working. I still hear and understand the counterarguments of other business leaders, but I've learned that they're not insurmountable obstacles. It takes work, adaptation, and patience.


Shifting to a shortened workweek cannot be a snap decision. Even in the various national trials, the shift is typically preceded by a transitional period guided by experts who prepare the company and workers regarding expectations and practicalities. Get it wrong, and your transition to a four-day workweek may have the opposite effect — an overworked team struggling and failing to cram everything into four days, leading to heightened stress levels that fast-track burnout.But get it right – and you'll see it in your business results.

Avni Barman explains how she managed to get a $40,000 raise by working smarter, not harder, using the 


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. In 2022, I had my first-ever promotion. I was working as an associate product manager at Atlassian and received a raise of $40,000. It wasn't because I was the hardest worker or an exceptional employee, but because I employed what some call the ""lazy girl strategy.""This ""lazy girl strategy"" is really just about being proactive about sharing my work successes in an efficient way.



My career trajectory — from being a software engineering intern at LinkedIn to a product manager at Atlassian to now as the CEO of Generation She — has been marked by a significant realization: ""Loud work always wins, not hard work.""The truth is that smart work is often just as effective as — if not more so than — hard work, especially in large companies.


Through my experience, I realized that the belief that promotions are reserved only for workaholics is a myth that needs to be debunked. I was able to climb the ladder without burning out, and the best part was that it only took me 30 seconds a day.Capture daily impactFor many of us, our jobs on a day-to-day basis are composed of mini-actions rather than really big projects.Spend 30 seconds each day capturing a screenshot of the most impactful thing you did, and store these screenshots in a folder. This could be anything from a message you sent to a coworker that saved them time to a milestone in a project.Doing so will make it easier for you to add up all of your small wins into a few large wins at the end of the year and show noticeable impact on the company.Here's one way you could catalog your daily wins:Avni Barman via BII've also written a full guide with specific examples and templates you can use here.Just doing this alone will get you 90% of the way there.However, here are some additional strategies for career advancement that I employed to get promoted.1. Prioritize key metricsRather than attempting to excel in every single task, prioritize what truly matters in your job. Focus on your role's key metrics and strive to deliver on them.I maintained a monthly call with my manager, in addition to our weekly syncs, where I could reconfirm that I was still working on the right things that mattered for the company and for my role. This regular check-in is vital because company priorities can shift rapidly, and you want to ensure that you're always working on impactful tasks that can lead to a promotion, not just putting in hours.


I also employed a framework called ""start, stop, and continue"" to ensure my work was aligned with my manager's expectations. Every month, I made sure I was receiving actionable steps on what to start doing, what I should stop doing, and what I was doing well and should continue doing rather than abstract feedback that could often be confusing to implement in practice.2. Quantify your contributionsNot only is keeping track of all of your contributions crucial, but quantifying the impact of all your achievements, no matter how small, is also important because, at the end of the year, the outcomes of big projects may not seem to offer enough quantifiable metrics to justify a significant promotion.However, since you've accumulated and documented hundreds of small achievements throughout the year, you can add them all up to calculate the time or money saved for the company and make a strong case for a larger promotion.Avni Barman via BI3. Make Yourself Regularly VisibleConsistently communicate your achievements to your team and leadership. It's essential to make your successes known. Now that you've documented your small wins, share them early and often.I actively worked to highlight my contributions; for example, my manager suggested that I create a Slack channel exclusively with the leadership team, where I posted weekly updates on my accomplishments. They might not have always responded, but it ensured I remained at the forefront of their minds.I also blogged on the company wiki about my team's achievements every month and scheduled quarterly meetings with leadership to review my work. No one asked me to do these things; I initiated and led them.


Taking these steps greatly enhanced my visibility and played a key role in my eventual promotion.4. Follow-up consistentlyAfter highlighting your achievements, the next step is to engage in consistent follow-up and embrace a mindset of continual improvement. This includes sending thoughtful thank-you emails after meetings, actively seeking feedback for improvement, pursuing relevant learning opportunities, and actively participating in team meetings.Building strong internal relationships is also key. Periodic check-ins with your manager will help keep your progress and career aspirations on their radar.Securing a promotion is just the beginning — maintaining open communication and continually striving for growth are what will propel your career forward.


The ""lazy girl strategy"" isn't actually lazy or just for womenHow you package and present your work to leadership when seeking a promotion is as important as the work itself, and the ""lazy girl strategy"" can help you efficiently do so.The term ""lazy girl strategy"" is a bit misleading, though, as it isn't about encouraging women to be lazy. Instead, I see it as a clever approach to describe effective and efficient strategies that allow women to better advocate for themselves without overextending or constantly feeling the need to prove their worth.This is especially important for women in male-dominated workforces. When I was working in tech, I noticed women's work and efforts would often go unnoticed, and we frequently had to exert twice the effort to receive the same recognition as men.""Lazy girl strategy"" challenges the notion that constant busyness equals success. The idea of working less can initially feel like laziness, but it's important to remember that having some free time or focusing on fewer, high-impact tasks is not laziness — it's working smarter.


While the ""lazy girl strategy"" may serve as an effective coping mechanism in the short term, it's also crucial to continue pushing for systemic change in the workplace. My goal in founding Gen She is to provide ambitious young women with the skills and resources to be the leaders of tomorrow so that other women don't need to use the ""lazy girl strategy"" to be seen and valued at work.But in the meantime, the ""lazy girl strategy"" helped me get a $40,000 raise, and perhaps it could help you too.Avni Barman is the founder and CEO of Generation She and a former product manager at Atlassian.

22,8 CEO Mindset Quotes That Keep Me Honest and Inspired,"Mar 21, 2024",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/ceo-mindset-quotes-that-keep-me-honest-and-inspired/471192,"
Quotations are popular for a reason — sometimes a short piece of wisdom is exactly what's needed to inspire you, keep you honest or ground you in your values. The ones that tend to stick with you might be large ideas contained in small pieces of text or simple advice that helps you remember something important. They can feel inspiring and give us principles to remember to live by.I'm known to wear a variety of printed T-shirts with words of motivation on them to help me remember something important to me and to inspire others around me because I love to share an inspiring message. So here are eight of my favorite quotes for CEOs and why I think they're useful to remember:Related: 30 of the Most Inspirational Leadership Quotes



1. ""If you don't have an assistant, you are one!"" — Cameron Herold, author and coachOne of my favorite quotes that got me to take action was this one from Cameron Herold. This quote represents one of the most important lessons for an entrepreneur to learn — your time is your most valuable resource, so spend it on the tasks that are most important. That means delegating anything that doesn't require your level of expertise. Would you pay someone your salary to do the work of an assistant? If you don't have one, you're already doing that!2. ""It's okay to admit what you don't know. It's okay to ask for help. And it's more than okay to listen to the people you lead — in fact, it's essential."" — Mary Barra, CEO of General MotorsStrong leadership requires some level of vulnerability. Admitting when you don't know something, asking for help and listening to your employees are markers of an effective leader. The leader who tries to do it all on their own will never accomplish as much as the leader who values the expertise of others.


3. ""All our productivity, leverage and insight comes from being part of a community, not apart from it. The goal, I think, is to figure out how to become more dependent, not less."" — Seth Godin, author and speakerOne of the most important leadership lessons to learn is that your greatest business asset is your team. Each person brings a unique perspective and skillset, and the best innovations happen in collaboration. Your community extends beyond just your team as well — friends, mentors and family members all provide valuable, enriching relationships. Don't neglect them.4. ""No legacy is so rich as honesty."" — William ShakespeareIf there's anyone who managed to set a remarkable legacy, it was Shakespeare. More than what you accomplish, people will remember the way you behaved. And your legacy doesn't just start after you die; it's already in action, in the way people associate with you. A legacy and reputation as an honest person will take you far.Related: 15 Quotes on Success From America's Top CEOs5. ""You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have."" — Maya AngelouAs the CEO of your business, your creativity is one of your most valuable skills, so it's worth taking the time to practice it. I'm known for dedicating a day each week to creative endeavors to help keep my creative muscles in shape. And I highly encourage everyone to make intentional time for creativity, because the more often you do it, the more easily ideas will come to you.


6. ""A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties."" —Harry S. TrumanStop letting your thoughts get in your way. It's easy to adopt a pessimistic attitude under the guise of ""realism,"" but the reality is that it's optimists who tend to get the best outcomes. Why? Because they're not easily discouraged, so they're more likely to learn from their mistakes and keep trying. As opera singer Robert Breault said, ""The realist sees reality as concrete. The optimist sees reality as clay.""7. ""What looks like multitasking is really switching back and forth between multiple tasks, which reduces productivity and increases mistakes by up to 50%."" — Susan Cain, authorIf you're anything like the majority of entrepreneurs I know, you're always trying to do more with your time. Time is your most valuable resource, so it's important to use it wisely — which is exactly why multitasking is a bad idea. You'll always get more done when you dedicate your focus to a single task and give it your all.Related: 'Let's Punch Today in the Face!' 20 Inspiring Quotes and Sayings That Motivated Successful Entrepreneurs8. ""The best way to drive performance in an organization is to create an environment in which information can flow freely, mistakes can be highlighted, and help can be offered and received."" — Simon Sinek, author and speakerCreating a productive workplace culture can seem dauntingly complex to many executives, but the core of it is collaboration, where each employee is given the resources to perform their best. And in order to have strong collaboration, you need a creative and judgment-free environment where people can bring their ideas, perspectives and expertise to the table, communicate freely, take ownership over their tasks, ask for help when needed and have the freedom to make mistakes. When you create a culture of collaboration, that's where innovation begins.


If you found one of these quotes particularly inspiring or helpful, write it down on a sticky note and put it somewhere you can see it regularly. Sometimes these short reminders are exactly what we need to refocus and maintain our perspective.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Ray Cao, a Gen Z seller on StockX, an online marketplace and sneaker reseller. Image Credit: Courtesy of Ray CaoWhat was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?I was a student working as a part-time barista earning about $8 an hour (minimum wage at the time) at a bubble tea store in New York City. My family had gotten into $200,000 worth of debt from speculative investments and gambling. We were desperate to the point where my parents borrowed from relatives to get by. This put an obvious strain on the relationship between them, and my family would quickly become the topic of untoward gossip. I was ashamed, scared and insecure. I eventually cultivated these feelings of vulnerability into action and dove into entrepreneurship.



When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I started the side hustle in 2015 when I had just turned 18. Sneaker and streetwear culture was growing popular, and demand for these coveted brands trended higher. I heard from my friend that this would be a lucrative business opportunity, and we both pursued it. My inspiration for starting and continuing this business was always my immigrant family.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety. It Made $1 Million in 7 Months — Then Sold for a Life-Changing Amount.


Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I grew to understand that I was much poorer than my peers. My parents were seamstresses and worked around the clock to support the family. My mom would tell me that she only earned a dime for each fabric she had sewn together, totaling only $200 weekly. Even my late grandma would spend her days picking up bottles and cans to recycle for five cents per piece. My parents and grandma navigated their lives here through sacrifice, cultural disparity and language differences. To this day, their story continues to fuel my ambitions and keeps me progressing.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I joined online communities and forums (Reddit, Facebook, NikeTalk) to conduct research and opened a bank account and card to purchase online drops. Eventually, I bought my first item, Supreme Air Jordan Desert Camo 5s (2015), for $225 and sold them locally for a $400 profit.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As college progressed and my finance career came into focus, I didn't have the energy to grind through the manual labor required for the business (sorting through incoming inventory, shipping outbound orders, conducting quality checks and dealing with returns from purchases and sales). I automated the business through Excel spreadsheets and worked with my parents to facilitate the day-to-day operations. During this time, I also gained access to store inventory at the StockX warehouse. This dramatically reduced my active work time and involvement to 10 hours a month. Everything I needed to manage the business could now be done from my laptop anywhere in the world.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money. Subscribe to Entrepreneur+ now.


As my available capital increased, a new challenge sprouted: order sizing. For example, with $1,000 and a hype release, it was easy to size my order — as much as I could afford. When that available capital increases a hundredfold or a thousandfold, things become more complex. I remember placing a roughly $10,000 order for the Nike Blazer Mid 77 Vintage White Black. About the first 30 sold at a 15% premium, but demand dried up as I flooded the market with available pairs. I lost about $3,000 and quickly learned the importance of order sizing and liquidity.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?During the early growth stages, monthly revenue trended closely with the amount of capital that was readily available. As the business matured, monthly revenues in the past two years peaked at a little under $20,000.What does total revenue look like now?I've earned about $1.53 million in total revenue on StockX.What do you enjoy most about this side hustle?I enjoy the hands-off nature of this business because it allows me to simultaneously progress my finance career (whether it's a new business venture or another corporate gig). The network of partners and relationships I've built along the way is invaluable, and so is being surrounded by so many smart individuals — special shoutout to the StockX team!


Related: A Side Hustle Consultant Shares the Most Lucrative Gigs Right NowWhat's your advice for others hoping to be successful sellers on StockX?Invest in your long-term relationships; do not become shortsighted and chase every single transaction with profit in mind. Your network is a major barrier to growth, so take every opportunity to show potential partners the value you can bring them. Good information is valuable and scarce: Conduct your market research within small niche communities and build connections organically. Finally, you need a good accountant to set up your business and keep accurate books and records.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.Looking for your next side hustle?

25,Want to Attract Success? Don't Do These 9 Things,"Mar 20, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-success-dont-do-these-9-things/471131,"
Every entrepreneur has their version of what's led to where they are today. Whether it's a specific routine or tried-and-true perseverance, there's a lot of advice on the ""to-dos"" of success.But what about the things to avoid?There are as many ways to limit your success as stepping stones to lead you to where you want to be. Avoid getting in your own way and making it harder to get to your destination. There's plenty not to do to prepare for success as well. Here are nine things to avoid. Often, simply switching to a more positive mindset (eliminating negative habits) can clear the path.



1. Neglect self-careToo often, entrepreneurs focus on the grind alone without taking breaks or paying attention to their physical and mental health. This isn't sustainable and will lead to burnout or, worse, giving up on their business dreams altogether.Schedule time to exercise, sit down for meals and sleep at approximately the same time every night. These simple habits are as important as any metrics to measure your business success. By taking care of your health, you'll see the difference in your energy and outlook, which only helps fuel your growth.


2. Doubt yourselfSelf-doubt plagues every entrepreneur, at least in the beginning. Being your own boss means you need to be your own cheerleader as well. Turn to trusted peers and friends to give you constructive feedback when needed, but keep confident in your abilities.Once you begin second-guessing your choices, it becomes harder to move forward. Getting stuck due to indecision or feelings of unworthiness creates additional barriers. As entrepreneurs, there's already enough of those to deal with.Instead, explore different things and experiment with what works. Not every move will be perfect, but everyone can help you learn and improve as you go, which makes for a better entrepreneur and a better business.Related: The Biggest Threat to Your Boundaries Isn't Your Boss or Family — There's Someone Else You Need to Face First


3. Refuse to ask for helpEven if you have years of experience in your industry, stay humble enough to know when you need guidance. Trying to juggle every aspect can be overwhelming and means you don't have time to concentrate on the things that really matter.You must consider not only your trade or craft but also accounting, taxes, marketing and all the other aspects that help you grow. Whether it's advisory support from a respected colleague or outsourcing help for things like social media or copywriting to build your brand, delegating tasks helps you grow your business.4. Avoid networkingBuilding strong professional relationships leads to limitless opportunities. Expand your connections by networking with those both in and beyond your field. Start online through LinkedIn. Interact with posts and share helpful information of your own.Also, attend in-person events to meet with like-minded individuals. It will expand your business circle, and networking can be motivational as you take your business to the next step. You never know who might cross your path and who may be a valuable resource for you or vice versa.


Related: 4 Reasons Why Networking Is a Must for All Successful Entrepreneurs5. Postpone goalsTalking about ""someday"" means goals get pushed back further and further. Aiming high is great, but taking it step by step is a more realistic way to get you to your goals and continue once you reach them. Don't put off your goals because they seem out of reach today. Instead, put steps into place that can lead there so you get closer to your goal every day until you realize you've arrived at its doorstep.6. Overlook planningPlanning is the catalyst that helps you reach your goals. Without a plan, days go unstructured, and it's easy to do many small things that aren't linked to any objectives. Instead, take time at the beginning and end of each day to look at the day/week ahead.Also, prioritize deadlines. Though everything may seem urgent, trying to do it all at once means fewer things are likely to get done or, at least, get done well. Being an entrepreneur means balancing schedules to ensure you have enough creative time to dream and enough productivity time to do.


Related: 4 Strategies to Increase Your Success7. Play it safeBeing an entrepreneur already means you've taken a risk. Explore new areas where you can take the next leap and avoid getting too comfortable. It could be speaking on a panel, authoring an online article, or broadening your services.There is always another lesson to learn or another goal to create. Stay curious and eager to head to what's next. However, don't skip over the wins, big or small.Related: Want Success? You Have to Take Risks.


8. Minimize winsThere was once a time when you wanted to be an entrepreneur, and you put the plan into action to make that come true. Every time you achieve something, make sure to celebrate the win.It can be a revenue goal, a new client, or even crossing off your weekly to-do list. Looking back and adding up all the wins motivates you to keep going and lets you know you have what it takes to succeed.9. Stray from valuesAlways hold true to your values no matter how much success you achieve. When people slip away from their integrity, it trips them up and prevents future success.Stay aligned with your vision, work ethic, and how you treat people. You will go further when you align, and the wins will feel all the more worth it.

      Key Takeaways    



        Sarah Michelle Boes followed her passion for teaching into nursing school. 
      


        After passing her nurse practitioner's exam proved easier than expected, she wanted to instill confidence in others. 
      


        She put together her first course within a week of that exam — and became a millionaire within the year. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sarah Michelle Boes, the founder of Sarah Michelle NP Reviews (SMNP), which was acquired by Blueprint Test Prep in 2022. Boes currently serves as the chief nursing officer for Blueprint Test Prep and hosts the podcast Becoming A Stress-Free Nurse Practitioner. She earned her BSN from the University of Kentucky, her MSN in Nursing Education from Western Governors University and her post-MSN-FNP from Eastern Kentucky University. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. Image Credit: Courtesy of Sarah Michelle BoesI grew up in rural Eastern Kentucky, and I always had this passion for being a teacher. I had my heart set on it. But my parents are teachers, and they're like, ""Absolutely not. You can't do that."" There are a lot of politics and bureaucracy within teaching. It's a lot more than just being an educator. Then, when I was a teenager, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Without great access to premium healthcare in our area, we had to travel two hours to Lexington to get that diagnosis and receive a care plan that she could take back home. That was over the summer, so I went with her, and that was my first introduction to nursing at the Markey Cancer Center.



Those nurses were incredible. I feel like oncology nurses, in general, are kind of angels. Not only did they take care of her, but they also took care of me. It was just a great experience. So, knowing that I wasn't going to be able to be a teacher, I was like, Well, nursing — I feel like I could get something done. And there would be a teaching aspect because there's a lot of patient education, but I'd also get a human connection with people, which I thrive off of. So it was a no-brainer, and I attended the University of Kentucky, which guaranteed me admission to their program — and that's a really big deal.Related: This Nurse Turned $500 in Savings Into $100 Million in Sales After Sharing Her Hair Care Routine on YouTube. Now She's Revealing Her Secrets to Success.


I grappled with anxiety during nursing school. A class was notorious for weeding out people, and everyone dreaded taking it. I had a ton of anxiety in that class in particular, so much so that my instructor was like, ""I don't think nursing is for you. You're too anxious to be a safe nurse."" I had to choose to stay. The grading scale in nursing is also very different: In most programs, anything less than a 76 means you fail — and on the first exam in that class, I got a 74. I literally failed the first exam by one question. So I had to figure out how to contend with my anxiety, to think about the tools I could use.So, I started to figure out how to manage that class and my anxiety. Then, I began tutoring, ultimately quitting my full-time job as a manager to help students full-time. I taught them the skills that had helped me tackle that challenging class in a different way, and my anxiety didn't pick up again until I was a nurse practitioner — because it had been a long time since I'd taken a high-stakes exam. There was no one to turn to get perspective because I was the first nurse in my family, and I didn't know many people who were nurse practitioners.What's more, I took my nurse practitioner exam in the prime of Covid, May 2020. So it was chaos. Testing centers were down, and some places would let you take it online at home, but others wouldn't. By the time I took the exam in the middle of May, it had been canceled five times, three of which I'd already arrived at the testing center. So, there was a lot of anxiety involved. I was like, Am I ever going to take this test? My job is riding on this.Related: Nurse Makes $2 Million In One Year With Side Hustle Selling Class Notes Online


I was so stressed that I ended up breaking a tooth in my sleep because I was grinding them so hard. I was going to have to get a dental implant to the tune of $7,000; my hair was also falling out. But I finished the 175-question exam in less than an hour, and I passed. I was like, I can't believe I was stressing over this thing. This was so much easier than my nursing exam. All I needed was confidence in myself because I'd spent years in schools and hundreds of hours in clinical preparing. None of my reviews had given me that confidence.That realization — and the fact that I still had to pay for a $7,000 dental implant — motivated me to put together my first review course. I started my business because I was like, I can't afford this $7,000 implant. I figured if I put together a little review course and even just earned $500, that would help pay for it. And I started to think about how it could be done differently — how it could be less like someone lecturing you and more like studying with a friend. So, I came up with a Q&A approach, which I'd used as a tutor in nursing school and when I taught nursing students at the collegiate level.Within a week of passing the exam, I made my first three-hour course. I actually gave it out to all of my classmates for free. There were 30 of us, and I was like, ""Hey guys, I'll give you this course for free if you invite someone else into the group when I give it to you."" I gave the course to the first 100 people who came into the group. Then, not even a couple of days later, someone who had taken the course went on to pass, and it kind of exploded through word of mouth. It got wild really quickly. The first person I tried to sell it to for $25 got mad because her friend had gotten it for free, so she haggled me down to $15. Still, I made $1,000 on the first day I started selling, and I didn't even make $1,000 in a week as a nurse. I was like, What if I made $1,000 a day, every day? What would life look like?Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a Year


By the end of June and July, I'd surpassed what I used to make annually as a nurse. I told my nurse practitioner job I wouldn't be coming. I wanted to see how far I could take the business, but being reasonable and never having run a business before, I kept my full-time teaching job, just in case. But every spare hour I had, every weekend, was all about the business. Because I was so anxious about it being a startup, fragile and new, I waited to quit my teaching job until I made $1 million. We hit seven figures in seven months.About a year and a half in, I was still using third-party software to host my courses — nothing was in-house or really in unison. It got to the point where my students were literally breaking the software; I needed my own. We actually spent $100,000 trying to build an app that ended up completely falling apart. That was really hard, but we just kept running up against technology, and I realized I was the bottleneck to this thing. The business wanted to grow, so I started looking into other options.We considered a sale and put out some teasers, hoping to get constructive feedback. As it turned out, the test prep provider Blueprint had some internal meetings about the prospect before I even sent out the teaser. They had medical stuff, and they had LSAT stuff, but they didn't have any nursing material at the time. And I wanted to take some pressure off myself because a week into sending out the teasers, I found out I was pregnant. I never want people to think I sold because I was pregnant; it just coincided with the timing.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part


We loved the Blueprint team, but the deal just wasn't right at first. My husband and I had decided on a number before we had a single conversation, and I'd recommend any entrepreneur do the same. Otherwise, it can be hard to navigate a deal when emotions are running high. So the first deal wasn't our number, and we walked away. Then they came back with our number, and we ended up selling around the two-year mark. That money has been life-changing.At 36 weeks pregnant, we found out that my daughter was going to have a congenital heart defect. We had no idea. So everything kind of flipped on its head really quickly. When I gave birth, the money gave us the flexibility and ability to be with our daughter when she needed it the very most. She had six surgeries in her first five months of life, two of which were open-heart surgeries. So, very crazy, chaotic times, and what a blessing to be able to have not only a maternity leave, but also a medical leave, and to be able to be fully present for that — and not only me but also my husband. We could be there together and support one another.Now, my daughter is 19 months old, and for the past year, we've been working to do a legacy gift to our local children's hospital, where they literally saved her life. Hopefully, next month, fingers crossed, everything's going to be finished, and they're actually going to dedicate the Norton Children's Heart Institute to my daughter. They are trying to build out a premier heart program there, and you have to have the funds to be able to do that. So the money gives us a lot of freedom and flexibility — my husband's also starting up his own business — but our work with the children's hospital is the most meaningful and impactful accomplishment.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.

A few years ago, on a family vacation, my wife and I took a cooking class. I like cooking, but I'm a novice at best — and the recipe, French macarons, wasn't a cakewalk. Lucky for us, the chef-instructor was there to guide us each step of the way.That day I learned many things: how to beat egg whites until soft peaks form; the importance of sifting the flour; how to pipe the batter. I also learned how much work goes into one macaron, which translates to the price we pay at the bakery. I left with a new appreciation for those tiny cookies.As CEO of Jotform, I spend a lot of my time managing and guiding others. It's nice to switch hats (or rather, toques) once in a while, and let someone else teach me. It's humbling to realize how tricky something as seemingly simple as mixing ingredients can be and helps me maintain the ""beginner's mind"" mentality — staying open to learning new ideas and subjects. That's why, even when I'm not on vacation, I try to make time for my hobbies — like cooking, writing and listening to old records. It turns out that I'm not alone. Many leaders make time for their leisure interests, and research shows that it's beneficial for business.

28,"4 Simple Mistakes That Can Crush Your Creative Side Hustle, From an Expert Who Raised $45 Million to Support Independent Workers","Mar 19, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/simple-mistakes-that-might-ruin-your-side-hustles-success/471317,"
Ben Huffman, CEO and co-founder of Contra, knows what it takes to run a successful freelancing side hustle. Huffman got firsthand experience in the freelancing space as a music producer, working with small labels and, ultimately, Sony Music. The work was fun but ""didn't pay well,"" he tells Entrepreneur, so he started designing apps, pitch decks and websites. Huffman became a ""power user"" on Elance and Odesk, which would merge to become Upwork, and soon ""became fascinated"" with the idea of building a team globally.Image Credit: Courtesy of Contra. Ben Huffman.""I would find projects locally in New York and then hire freelancers from all over the world to help me with the skills I didn't have,"" Huffman recalls. ""I loved the freedom and autonomy of working independently, but even more, I loved working with people from different cultures and backgrounds. Early on, I realized the flaws in the business models of the platforms I used.""



The world was becoming more connected, Huffman explains, and the ""take-rate model"" eBay brought to the fore ""didn't make sense for people and working relationships,"" especially as workers increasingly sought flexibility and employers needed more niche skills. So Huffman set out to create a platform that could address those pain points, and after interviewing thousands of independent workers, discovered they need to think about three things to be successful: creating their identity and credibility, managing their business and finding new leads. Contra, which has raised $45 million from venture capital firms, provides support in all of those areas.Related: How to Start a Freelance Writing Side Hustle


""Contra is commission-free, so our users can keep 100% of their earnings.""""Independent workers can create a profile that showcases their skills and what they can actually do instead of their roles at past companies,"" Huffman says. ""Focusing on projects and skills allows independents to highlight the specific problems they've solved and the value they've delivered. Independents can find new projects from high-quality, vetted clients, manage their business with our free invoices, contracts and proposals, and, most importantly, they can get paid. Contra is commission-free, so our users can keep 100% of their earnings.""Nowadays, nearly two in five U.S. adults have a side hustle, and one in three of them say they use their side hustle earnings to cover everyday expenses, according to a Bankrate survey. Freelance projects can be an accessible, flexible option for people hoping to capitalize on their skill sets, but the most successful will be those who avoid the common pitfalls of the job.Related: 10 of the Most Profitable Side Hustles You Can Start With Little or No MoneyHuffman shares four mistakes that could hinder any side-hustler's success:1. Underpricing your services to attract your first clients""Going down this route can devalue your work,"" Huffman explains, ""and make raising prices much more challenging in the future. Before solidifying your prices, get to know the market you're entering, track industry rates, consider your years of experience and outline your unique expertise; these variables will help you determine a price that works for you and your clients.""2. Not prioritizing your projects the right way""It's important to prioritize projects that fully align with your skill set and politely turn down projects that could be a better fit with someone else,"" Huffman says. ""While many first-time freelancers may regret turning down new projects, taking on too much work can often lead to being overwhelmed and subpar work.""3. Not learning new in-demand skills""Right now, we are seeing a ton of demand for skills like Framer for building websites, video animation and social media management,"" Huffman says. ""There is also a huge opportunity to upskill in the latest AI tools. So much of the world of work is changing because of AI, and there is a huge opportunity to get ahead of it all.""

Not going the extra mile for your clients""Going above and beyond with clients can lead to referrals, more projects in the future and a reputation that will help you build longer-lasting relationships,"" Huffman says. ""To set up any project for success, you will want a well-scoped out set of deliverables and project timeline. Once you have this, you should get everything put into a contract so that you have a framework for your agreement and protection if things get off track.""And one last piece of advice for side hustle success? While growing your network of clients is important, don't forget to cultivate a network of other independent consultants, too. ""Having a community of fellow freelancers to bounce ideas off of and get advice from is invaluable and can lead to new leads in the future,"" Huffman says.

29,"She Never Wanted to Start a Business, But Chronic Insomnia Was Motivation — Here's How She Achieved 8 Figures in Sales and 8 Hours of Sleep a Night","Mar 19, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/bearabys-founder-surpassed-20m-in-sales-gets-better-sleep/471256,"
Dr. Kathrin Hamm, founder and CEO of sleep-wellness company Bearaby, never wanted to be an entrepreneur. After graduating with her Ph.D. in economics, she started as an economist at the World Bank. Her work took her all over the world and provided invaluable insight into the small, medium and women-founded enterprises she tried to convince banks to lend to — but she ""learned firsthand how hard it is, especially in developing countries, for women to get access to finance and start and grow their businesses.""During her time in India and Bangladesh especially, Hamm faced long, ""exhausting"" travel days. She'd ""never been a good sleeper,"" waking easily even as a child, and she developed a chronic case of insomnia. It began ""on a more moderate level,"" with difficulty falling and staying asleep, before the periods of wakefulness became longer and longer, motivating her to look into different solutions.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bearaby. Kathrin Hamm.



She started by investigating various mattress options, but when she dug deeper, she found an article discussing weighted blankets. The piece focused on helping children with sensory issues, Hamm recalls, but it also mentioned that evenly distributed weight on an adult body could support better sleep. Hamm was immediately intrigued — as a potential customer.Related: The No-Excuse Approach to Sleep and Work Performance for Entrepreneurs


""Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""""I came from a consumer lens,"" Hamm says, ""and knowing how hard it is for women to start a business, I [was] like, Yeah, I'm good here. I don't want to start a business or even think about becoming an entrepreneur. Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""However, the purchase process proved difficult. Unable to find options online, Hamm had to go to a pharmacy in Germany, where she's from, to place an order. Six weeks later, a ""big bean bag"" arrived. It was orange and blue and ""very noisy,"" Hamm says. She was reluctant to even try it at first and wondered if she'd made a mistake.""But then I put it on during the day on a weekend, and I just passed out after 10 minutes,"" Hamm says. ""And I woke up more than two hours later, [after] a solid nap, completely passed out, and I'm like, Wow, this is magic. This thing works for me.""


Related: Fighting Sleep Is a Losing Management Strategy. Let Your Employees Take Naps.So Hamm kept using the blanket at night, but there was a problem: Because the blanket was filled with plastic beads to add weight, she often got too hot. The underlying functionality works; the weight on my body works, Hamm remembers thinking, but how it is made doesn't work. After some research, Hamm discovered that the technology, which largely consisted of bead-filled chambers between layers of blanket, had been around for 30 years — ""Nobody had innovated anything about this product.""""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?""Hamm decided to experiment with alternative designs. She drew some inspiration from her time spent in India, ""where there's a culture of making rugs, knitting, crocheting,"" but the ultimate breakthrough came from a conversation with her mom. Hamm had been considering changing the material or adding holes for airflow when her mom said, ""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?"" They would create a thick yarn that could be knit together for natural airflow, eliminating the need for heavy artificial materials that shift around and reduce comfort. That idea led to the development of Bearaby's first small blanket, made from a cut-up t-shirt.


Confident she was onto something, Hamm opted to take a year's leave from her job to focus on the business. ""I didn't want to take too much of a risk, again, knowing that it can get really hard,"" she admits. ""[But] my boss was super supportive, and she said, 'Look, if it doesn't work out, we make a case study out of it.'""Hamm withdrew $120,000 from her retirement fund and raised just over $250,000 from a crowdfunding campaign to fund the prototypes for the first batch of blankets. She also looked into patents, but they were expensive, so she did the drawing herself, then had a lawyer put together a provisional patent application, which entitles the filer to 18 months before they have to pay more money. That went through just a couple of days before launch in December 2018; the blanket sold out in two weeks and was the only product of its kind on the market for a couple of years, Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyRelated: How to Take Advantage of the 'First-to-File' Patent System


Despite the early success, the more than 50 factories that Hamm approached weren't inclined to take on the product. They'd never seen anything like it: It wasn't apparel, and it wasn't bedding. So, for that first year and a half, Hamm rented a small garage outfitted with knitting machines and knitters to churn out the first products. The strong sales helped the business continue to finance production, which was a good thing, too — because people still weren't all that interested in investing in the first-of-its-kind product.""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable.""Hamm leaned into the ""bootstrap"" mentality, which was a blessing in disguise. ""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable,"" she explains, ""to become in tune with our production processes and marketing processes, to be efficient, which sometimes you didn't see at that time in the direct-to-consumer space. Everyone was like, 'I raised that much money, and I'm putting that much million on a marketing spend.' So we never had it, but now, in an environment where money is not flowing [as] freely, we never had that money in the first place, so we are feeling pretty good right now.""Bearaby saw another major advantage in brand loyalty. Hamm notes that people seeking wellness and sleep tend to form an ""emotional connection"" with the blanket,"" and that it's easy to fall in love with a brand that helps you sleep better. Substantial interest also translated into an early retail presence. Just five months in, Bearaby was in West Elm, thanks to customers who walked in and wanted to try the blanket. That happened with Nordstrom, too.

Here's How to Cultivate It.As Bearaby considered expansion, it centered on functional products that would uphold its commitment to quality and sustainability (the company is certified by third-party organizations, including The Global Organic Textile Standard, The Forest Stewardship Council and The Global Recycled Standard). Because anxiety so often goes hand in hand with insomnia, the company landed on its warmables line; boasting a weighted and heated neck wrap, bottle and lap pad, it ""takes the nervous system to zero,"" Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyNaturally, Bearaby's products have become an integral part of Hamm's own sleep routine, and as she's gotten older, she's realized even more just how much sleep she actually needs. ""Now I sleep for a minimum of eight hours,"" she says. ""I'm training myself to get nine to 10 hours of sleep, obviously not every night, but definitely every weekend. Also, [it helps] whenever I get a chance to take a nap, like just a 20-minute nap to reset. [I make sure that I have] these conscious breaks, whether [it's] napping or deep breathing because running a business is a marathon, and if we don't take care of our bodies, we're not able to do that over a very long time.""


""Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""Hamm's five-year marathon with Bearaby has led to over eight figures in sales and more than 10 patents — but it all started with a single, somewhat reluctant leap of faith. And according to the founder, that's exactly what it takes to be successful.""Once you believe in a product, just take a chance and give yourself a year,"" Hamm says. ""It's much more manageable if you [have] a considerable time frame where it's like, Okay, in that year, I'm giving everything I have, 100%. Because sometimes we second guess ourselves. After [a few] months or six weeks, we don't see the success, [and] we start doubting ourselves. You say [I have] one year, and I'm not asking if this is working. Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

        Rowley recognized a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear — like wraps. 
      


        She bought a few thousand dollars worth of fabric and a used serger and opened an Etsy shop, then got to work.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Elle Rowley, founder of Solly Baby, a company that produces sustainably sourced baby wraps made of 100% certified TENCEL Modal and other baby gear. In 2023, Rowley stepped away from her day-to-day role (she now serves the brand as a strategic advisor and is on the board), and the company welcomed Nicole Newhouse as CEO to lead the next stage of Solly Baby's growth.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly Baby. Elle Rowley.When did you start Solly Baby as a side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?



After having my first baby in 2009, I was surprised to find a surge of creative inspiration that I had never known before having kids. My husband was still in school, and I was hungry to start something to supplement our meager student income. By the time I was pregnant with our second child in 2011, the online world was fertile ground for mothers looking to start a side hustle from home. I tried a few different things, but I intuitively knew that there was a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear, so I was pretty focused on that space throughout my pregnancy.I loved wearing my first baby, and I'd heard that wraps were the most comfortable way to wear an infant, so being industrious and broke, I made two wraps out of cheap jersey knit fabric — one for me and one for a friend who was also pregnant. While my crude prototype was far from what the product became, I could see the potential for this long piece of fabric to actually be a fashion accessory for the wearer rather than ""baby gear."" What really sealed it, though, was the first time I timidly ventured out holding my toddler's hand and carrying my baby wrapped on my chest. Before we left the front porch, he was asleep and breathing deeply on my chest. The increase in confidence that I felt with each step was palpable. I felt liberated, and at the same time, I'd never felt more connected to my baby. I knew I was on to something.


What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground?I found a fabric supplier in the fabric district of Los Angeles, purchased a few thousand dollars worth of fabric (thanks to credit cards and a loan from my in-laws), bought a used serger on Craigslist for $50 and opened an Etsy shop. Then, I got to work mostly when my babies were sleeping. I turned our house into a factory to make the first 50 wraps. I signed up for every local handmade market that I could find, which didn't garner great sales results, but the feedback I received from people in real life was invaluable. Lastly, in a decision that felt reckless at the time because of the cost, I hired my favorite photographer to take photos of me wearing my son. I had a nice camera and could have ""made-do"" on my own, but I knew that having beautiful images would help compensate for the many other areas where the brand was weak.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly BabyWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the business, and how did you navigate them?


Growth is expensive: I had no capital other than the $4,000 loan for fabric, and finance is not my area of expertise, so I knew I would need a very cash flow-positive business model. In the first three years, it was very challenging to finance our growth, but I can see what a gift it was now to have that constraint. Because we had no factoring terms with our suppliers or credit lines, we'd have to pay a hefty deposit on our production when we submitted the purchase order. Then, we'd pay the remainder of the balance upon completion. This made growth slow, and we were constantly underselling. As demand for the product grew, we started placing everything on preorder on our website, which gave us enough to pay for the order. This made it so our customers were essentially funding our growth.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the business bring in at that point?Sales had been growing year over year in 2013, but we were still only grossing a few hundred thousand dollars a year and taking home less than $100,000. Daily sales were still very inconsistent, which made it difficult to have a lot of confidence in hiring employees or even believing that this was anything more than a side hustle. I was hitting a wall of exhaustion when my husband and I made the leap of faith to bring him into Solly Baby with me. He'd finished school and was working with another startup, but we both felt his time would be better spent if we focused our efforts together. This shift immediately led to new growth and vision. His help also freed me up to work more on the business rather than in the business. We then hired our first employee, Kortney, who took over customer service and fulfillment in a way that freed my husband and me up to focus on growth.Just weeks after hiring Kortney, and days before I had my third child in the spring of 2014, we released our spring collection, and the demand went through the roof. Sales went from anywhere between zero to $3,000 per day to $2,000 becoming our new daily baseline — and releases bringing in tens of thousands of dollars in a day. We hit $1 million in sales that November, and by the end of that year, we knew this was much more than a side hustle.


You've since turned your side hustle into a very successful business. What does revenue look like now?It's been amazing to experience the growth we have been able to achieve. To see this business grow from my house to an Etsy shop to reaching millions of mothers, parents and families is truly humbling. As we continued to build the team and find our footing in the market, some years, we saw revenue double year over year. Today, Solly Baby operates at $10 to 20 million in annual revenue.What's your favorite part about running Solly Baby? As a mother of four, connecting with, encouraging and providing products for postpartum mothers during a very transformational time of life has always been life-giving work for me. It will never get old to meet a mother or father who says, ""Your wraps changed my relationship with my baby."" Knowing that our products have the power to change the trajectory of a parent-child relationship is deeply rewarding.


Developing company culture and ethos was also very rewarding. I made our company motto ""small things with great love"" several years ago because I hold a deep belief that small things done thoughtfully create the biggest and best things. This is relevant to growing a business and equally relevant to raising children. Seeing this adopted and trickle down into every part of the company as CEO felt very meaningful.What does your routine look like these days? Are there any helpful habits you'd recommend to other entrepreneurs?Keeping a daily routine is my best advice. I am a big believer in getting up before your kids (unless you have an infant — then sleep as much as you can!), exercising, getting ready for the day and taking at least 30 minutes for spiritual or meditative practice.It was easy in the early days to completely neglect myself to meet the needs of my family and the business, but I strongly believe that we would've grown faster and with more intention had I taken better care of myself from the beginning. I was running on empty all of the time, and it just about broke me in the first two years. What's more is that the business was not stronger because of my ""sacrifices."" I became very depressed and anxious and finally shared this with my husband. We made a self-care plan together, and everything quickly improved in my life, personally and professionally.


What's your best advice for others hoping to start a successful business of their own? We're often encouraged to ""think big"" when it comes to business, but sometimes, thinking ""small"" is the perfect way to begin — mainly because it will get you to begin. I don't think I would have had the confidence to start a multi-million dollar, global company at the age of 25, but I didn't need to. I just needed enough confidence to make the first 50 wraps to help pay the rent and a sincere desire to bring mothers and babies closer through the product. That was all I needed to get the ball rolling, and then my confidence and vision expanded with the company. We kind of grew up together, Solly Baby and me.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

31,"7 Strategies for Being More Productive This Year, According to a Time-Management Guru","Mar 15, 2024",Jonathan Small,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/7-strategies-for-being-more-productive-in-2024-according/467752,"
Good news: There are usually 8,760 hours in a year. In 2024, there will be 8,784 hours—that means you'll get an extra 24 hours.How do you ensure that bonus time — and all time — are spent more wisely? To help offer some practical tips to make 2024 your most productive year ever, I spoke to Laura Vanderkam, a productivity guru, podcaster, and author of several bestselling books on the topic, including her most recent, Tranquility by Tuesday: 9 Ways to Calm the Chaos and Make Time for What Matters.Vanderkam draws on research and her own experience as a full-time professional and mother of 5 kids (yes, 5!). Here, she offers some ways to get the most out of your day. To hear our entire interview, visit the Write About Now podcast.



Related: 3 Productivity Tips That Turned Me Into a Multimillionaire1. Track your time""When people say they want to spend their time better, the first thing I always tell them is to figure out where the time is going now,"" Vanderkam says. ""Because if you don't know where the time is going now, how do you know if you are changing the right thing?""


She suggests tracking how you spend every day from 5 am to 4:30 pm for an entire week. This will give you a more holistic view of your time than just looking at a random day.Vanderkam has her clients create a spreadsheet with days of the week across the top and half-hour blocks along the left side. You can do this in Outlook or use the Time-Tracking Sheet on Vandkerkam's website.""Remember to check in every couple of hours and then think back on what you were doing,"" she says. ""A lot of times, time does get away from us. We often have no recollection whatsoever of 30-minute blocks.""2. Ask yourself what you'd like to spend more time doingOnce you've tracked your time, Vanderkam encourages you to celebrate what you're doing right in your weekly schedule rather than coming down on yourself for wasting time.


""Most people are not complete and total disasters, so you should be happy about whatever good routines you have,"" she says.Ask yourself what you'd like to spend more time doing. The more time you spend doing stuff that excites you, the less time you will have to do the stupid, time-wasting stuff like continually checking emails or doom-scrolling through 'X.'3. Schedule your following week on FridaysOnce you see where you're spending time wisely and where you could cut down on wasted time, try to devise a realistic schedule that prioritizes the things you did best.Vanderkam suggests scheduling the following week on Friday afternoon.


""Friday afternoon is when you're unwilling to start anything new, but you might be willing to think about what future you should be doing,"" she says. ""By taking a few minutes to plan your upcoming week, you can turn what would be wasted time into something much more productive.""Also, unlike Sunday nights, when most people plan for the week, you can set up meetings and contact people during work hours. It also lets you think about how you want to spend your weekend.Related: Want to Be More Productive? Stop Trying to Finish Every Task, and Do This Instead4. Give yourself a bedtimeVanderkam has reviewed thousands of time logs and concludes that most people don't get enough consistent sleep.


""It's disorganized sleep,"" she explains. ""We stay up late one night, and then we are crashing the next night, and then we stay up late, and we're crashing—the cycle repeats itself. It's must better to get the same amount of sleep you need every night.""Her solution: Figure out what time you need to wake up, and figure out how much sleep you need (usually 7 hours). Then, count back that number of hours, and that is your bedtime.Having consistent sleep hours will mean that you won't crash at your desk in the middle of a workday.5. Tackle the toughest work firstPeople tend to want to get the small stuff out of the way before they dive into the more complicated activities. In modern office parlance, some refer to this as ""clearing the decks"" (an old naval term).


But this strategy is not productive. Explains Vanderkam, ""There's a lot of easy work that we have to do that doesn't take a huge amount of brainpower, but it's very rewarding in the sense that it is easily done."" An example might be sending out a bunch of calendar invitations. It feels good to scratch off your to-do list, but it doesn't mean you're being productive.A better strategy, Vanderkam says, is getting the more challenging, more consequential stuff out of the way earlier in the day. This way, when you experience the inevitable dip in energy in mid-afternoon, you can use that time to get ""some easy wins."" Like sending out calendar invites or returning emails.6. Make shorter to-do listsMany people make a long, comprehensive to-do list that they can't possibly get done in the course of a day—or even a week.Vanderkam advises making shorter to-do lists that are achievable.


""Consider it a contract with yourself,"" she says. ""If you make a daily to-do list, that means you are committing to do everything on that list by the end of the day.""Another suggestion she makes is to create a ""to-done"" list alongside your traditional to-do list. Two reasons:1. If you take a moment to reflect on your achievements, it's likely that you won't become fixated on the negative emotions associated with not fulfilling your initial goals.2. It will give you a list of accomplishments you can forward to your manager or boss.


7. Schedule something you'll look forward toResearchers at Oxford University found that workers are 13% more productive when happy. Vanderkam is not surprised. She believes ""the ultimate self-care is being interested in your own life."" How can you hope to be more productive when everything in your week is doom and gloom?For this reason, Vanderkam says, ""When doing your Friday planning, make sure you have something in the upcoming week that you genuinely look forward to.""This could be a professional or personal goal—as long as it makes you feel more energized and excited.Listen to the interview:

32,How to Biohack Your Circadian Rhythms and Achieve Peak Mental Performance,"Mar 15, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-biohack-your-circadian-rhythm-to-hit-peak-performance/469380,"
Almost every morning, I force myself out of bed to hit the gym before work. On pitch-dark winter mornings, I can't help but feel like I'm going against nature. In a way I am — it's no secret that light is one of the most significant modulators of our circadian rhythms. If I happen to be working from Jotform's headquarters in San Francisco just after daylight saving time starts each spring, the groggy feeling is stronger than ever.While daylight savings may guarantee more sunlight at the end of the day, it also means darker mornings. That's why many sleep experts didn't agree with the U.S. Senate when it proposed to implement daylight saving time year-round (and as of the writing of this story, the so-called ""Sunshine Protection Act"" is still in limbo). Sunnier evenings may boost spending, but they don't necessarily boost health or cognitive function.The good news is that circadian rhythms are a matter of nature and nurture. There are simple behavioral tweaks we can make to optimize our cognitive performance based on our innate 24-hour cycles. As CEO of Jotform, a company that collaborates across various time zones, I try to be aware of the latest findings from circadian experts so I can do my best work wherever I am and encourage our team members to do the same. Here are some truths about circadian rhythms that have important implications for your thinking and productivity.

  I Moved My 80-Person Company to a 4-Day Workweek Even Though It's Against the Industry Norm. Here's Why We'll Never Go Back.
  
    In 2021, TUX co-founders Dominic Tremblay and Ludwig Ciupka decided to find out if they could reinvent the workweek.

      Key Takeaways    



        Tremblay and Ciupka wanted to ""think beyond the industrial era five-day workweek, two-day weekend."" 
      


        After reading case studies and analyzing their own team's productivity, they decided to eliminate Fridays. 
      


        The model requires an ""experimental, progress-oriented mindset,"" but they'll never go back to a five-day workweek.
      



This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dominic Tremblay. He and his partner Ludwig Ciupka are co-founders of TUX, a creative agency that gives back through its Karma Foundation and boasts clients including Eucerin, Prada, Lancôme Paris, Make Up For Ever, Milk & Bone and Doctors of the World, among others. Image Credit: Courtesy of TUX. Dominic Tremblay.In 2021, we started to think about how we could push TUX further. We're an LGBTQ+-owned company that's been B-Corp-certified since 2017, inspired by many companies that were really innovating in terms of sustainability practices. For us, the next quest became, Could we reinvent the workweek? Could we think beyond the industrial era's five-day workweek and two-day weekend? It was a big decision, so we began the research process.

34,Top Ways I've Learned to Keep Motivation High in an Asynchronous Workplace,"Mar 12, 2024",Tom Medema,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-keep-motivation-high-in-an-asynchronous-workplace/470472,"
The asynchronous work environment was largely forced upon us in recent years, with professionals worldwide having little say in the matter. However, the continued commonality of this geographically extended workplace means we have to make sure that by cutting certain corners of traditional work, we aren't depriving ourselves of personal working life hacks and skills, such as motivation, that should be ever-present in workplaces.From my experience, intrapersonal-type skills tend to be cast aside and devalued in an async environment. Our focus for today is motivation, which is one of them. If we just stop for a second to think about prior conversations regarding our levels of motivation, I believe that most of our memories will jump to a time when a pitfall in motivation brought about the conversation, and thus, occurs at a time when it is almost impossible to successfully maneuver ourselves out of this rut, and onto an inspired, powerful, and motivated path once again.This mustn't be the case, and as a pioneer of async communication and workplaces myself through my role as CEO of Bubbles, I want to make sure we are continuously mindful and self-aware, but that we also collaborate to structure our working environments in such a way that we give each other the highest chance of success and omnipresent motivation. Let me show you how.



Related: Has Technology Killed Face-To-Face Communication? How to Navigate the Nuances of Digital Age CommunicationUnderstanding asynchronous workTo understand optimizing asynchronous motivation, we should first boost our understanding of this newfound technique. I say newfound, but in reality, async communication has been around for donkey's years (relatively speaking), with email and fax, for example, but these processes were never enough alone to fully run businesses from. This is why, with the recent influx of revolutionary async communication methods and tools, such as Bubbles, and the increasing popularity of tools like Slack, we are witnessing a new asynchronous generation and phenomenon among professionals. However, not everyone is keeping up.


In 2022, Buffer's State of Remote Work report revealed that only 38% of companies had an async-first policy, despite 52% of employees desiring an async set-up. Moving and evolving with the times is something critical in my view of a successful business, and trying to always align with what our employees want is something that should go without saying. If we ignore these lighthouse signals, we are likely to witness, ironically, things like a lack of motivation in our teams. Nevertheless, I want to focus on the instances where async has been chosen and help as best as I can, starting with some soft-skills and intrapersonal skills.Related: How to Create an Asynchronous Work CultureFlexibility and employee preferencesThe allure of remote work largely stems from its flexibility. Buffer's report highlighted that 67% of remote workers valued flexibility in time management, while 62% appreciated the choice of work location. This flexibility, however, must be balanced with strategies to keep remote workers motivated and engaged.Empathy and recognition in asynchronous workEmpathy is naturally intertwined with asynchronous working. Providing our employees with vast flexibility and choice of working locations cannot be discredited in terms of a caring approach to each individual, to the extent that these two remote benefits came at the top of an importance list in the same Buffer report. I want to note here, though, that this is not just about 'being nice' to our staff, because the reality is that we will gain masses in return for this thoughtfulness, through boosts in motivation, productivity and desire to impress. This claim that I make is not plucked out of thin air, and in fact, according to Businessolver, a staggering 70% of employees and HR professionals agree that empathetic organizations lead to higher employee motivation. Moreover, 68% of HR professionals believe employee recognition and feedback positively impact retention (SHRM). In an asynchronous setting, where face-to-face interactions are limited, recognizing employees' efforts becomes even more vital to maintaining motivation.


Here are five more strategies for maintaining motivation.1. Establish clear communication channelsClear and efficient communication is imperative for your team to thrive in an asynchronous environment. I am not just referring to the technology here, as although that is the umbrella above this, it is equally important to set expectations for response times and time-based performance.Related: Open Your Digital Doors: Communication and Remote Work2. Build this culture of recognitionRecognition excites people and boosts motivation. Professionals are aware of this to some degree, with Reward Gateway proving that 60% of employees want to see managers or leaders praising their colleagues' work more often. When feedback like this arises from a group who are looking to become a more prosperous and motivated team, we can be sure that regular recognition, whether in one-on-one sessions or daily stand-up, is something to focus on.


3. Promote work-life balanceOne of remote work's main and most widely covered struggles is unplugging after work hours. Again, encouraging a healthy work-life balance and being empathetic with after-hours communication can prevent burnout and maintain motivation.Related: Having A Work-Life Balance is Nonsense. To Reach Your Goals, Follow Another Approach4. Provide opportunities for professional growthEmployees want and need growth and development opportunities even in an asynchronous environment. Keep the conversations going about career paths, and make sure to mentor wherever you can.5. Implement flexible work policiesFlexible work policies are a key motivator, and a highly valued aspect of async, as established earlier. A PR NewsWire report also indicates that 81% of employers see improving talent retention as a motivation for adopting flexible work policies, as well as boosting the pool from which they can hire. Allowing employees to choose their working hours can increase job satisfaction and motivation, meaning you get more from less.So, I hope by now you have clocked on to the importance of not neglecting key aspects of our work lives, such as motivation. This is a lesson that is aimed at helping you and your teammates, so I hope you can go away from this motivation to instill some new values in your asynchronous workplace!

35,Your Employees are Demotivated and You Could Be Responsible — Here are 6 Ways to Keep Your Team Energized and Engaged,"Mar 12, 2024",Roxanne Klein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/unmotivated-employees-heres-how-to-fight-demotivation-in/470561,"
Many articles have been written on motivation. Although important, I also think it is important for business owners to be aware of demotivation. Business owners can demotivate their employees unintentionally.This article aims to make business owners aware of demotivation and hopefully prevent demotivating their employees by accident. Here are six ways to avoid demotivation in your workplace.1. Provide a positive work environmentPersonally, nothing demotivates me more than negative energy. If someone is not positive, it makes me feel negative, and once I feel negative, it is difficult to get out of a negative slump. Employers need to be aware that their employees will become negative if they have a negative attitude. Then, a negative cycle can ensue, and work productivity might be down.



If you are not careful, the next thing you know is all your employees will have a negative attitude. It's important to foster a positive work environment before a negative one starts to spread throughout your company.Related: 5 Ways to Stop Demotivating Your People


2. Give constructive feedbackFeedback given in a non-constructive way can also demotivate your employees. I am a fan of the sandwich approach. This simple approach sandwiches feedback in which you would start with something good the employee is doing. Then, mention to the employee an item they need to work on.When mentioning the items the employee needs to work on, it is essential to have a constructive, non-critical tone. After the constructive feedback, mention another positive item you value about the employee. Although this approach may seem a little elementary, by carefully providing constructive feedback, there is a good chance you will avoid accidentally demotivating your employee.3. Communicate clearly and regularlySeveral negative consequences can occur if an employer is unclear when assigning tasks. First, there is a good chance that the employee will not perform the task correctly. When this happens, the employer will inevitably be upset with the employee and show their disappointment, resulting in the employee being upset and feeling demotivated. All of this could be resolved by the employer correctly communicating the task to their employee.Employers need to remember that their employees are not mind readers. They must be as clear as possible and ensure that their instructions can not be misinterpreted. By taking a little extra time to provide the employee with efficient instructions, the employer can avoid many feelings of demotivation.


Related: 7 Ways Managers Motivate and Demotivate Employees4. Address issues promptlyBe respectful of your employees by addressing issues promptly. If an employee comes to you with a question or an issue that needs to be addressed for the employee to do their job or for the employee to feel valued, be respectful of the employee and address the issue functionality. Demotivation can easily occur if the employee has to follow up with the employer to get answers or directions.At this point, the employee would feel that the employer does not respect their time and would be demotivated by the employer not valuing their time. This situation can easily be avoided by the employer addressing and acknowledging the employee better.5. Practice respectful communicationEmployers should be cautious of how they communicate with their employees. This is both in person and through written communication, such as emails. The employer needs not to be critical and unfriendly. Even if the employer is having a bad personal day, they need to be able to separate their own problems and not take out their frustrations on their employees.


The employer should always be mindful of their language and tone. The employer needs to remember that if they are not respectful to their employees, they will become demotivated, and their work quality will decrease.Related: Why Effective Communication is the Key to Success for Startups6. Be cognizant of your employee's valuesAn employer needs to understand what is essential to an employee. If an employer is not careful and does not recognize their employee's values, then the employee can easily feel that the employer is not the type of employer they would like to be working for. Employers must show legitimate empathy and make the employees feel like they are appreciated. The employer needs to remember that all their employees are different and take the time to understand what is essential to each of them. By doing so, it is less likely that employees will become demotivated.Employers must be mindful of what can potentially demotivate their employees. If they are not, productivity will be decreased, morale will be down, and ultimately, employees will resign and find other employment means. Remember to avoid actions that can demotivate your employees actively.


Create a positive work environment and learn to separate personal issues from work. Respond to employees promptly and do so with respect. Acknowledge receipt of emails and be careful to be sarcastic to employees who might find sarcasm offensive. By being cautious of these items, the results will motivate your employees. Your business will thrive, and your employees will be grateful for working with you.

36,6 Ways I've Achieved a Healthy Work-Life Balance as a Business Owner,"Mar 11, 2024",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-master-work-life-harmony-with-these-simple-steps/469893,"
Collaboration is a powerful tool that has become increasingly essential in the modern business world. Working together with others can help drive growth, innovation, and success. My journey with collaboration caused me to discover some hacks that have improved my work-life balance.This article will explore the importance of these hacks and provide some tips for re-prioritizing your work-life relationship and using it to achieve your goals.Related: Why Strong Collaborations Will Change Your Business



1. Set clear boundariesThe first step to finding balance is to set clear boundaries between your professional and personal life. When you're working, focus solely on business tasks without letting any outside influences distract you.Similarly, when you're out of the office, ensure that work doesn't infringe upon your other activities or relationships. You must understand what lines must not be crossed for both sides of your life to remain healthy and balanced.


2. Prioritize your timeWhen managing your time as an entrepreneur, it's important to prioritize the most important tasks first. This means taking some extra time during the day or week to plan what needs to be done ahead of time so that nothing is left undone or forgotten about. Doing this will help keep task-related stress at bay and give you more freedom in determining how best to divide up the rest of your day or week into a manageable schedule.Additionally, don't forget to add some non-work-related activities into your schedule, such as exercise or leisurely activities — these can help provide much-needed respite from your otherwise hectic workloads.Related: 15 of the Best Time Management and Productivity Books of All Time3. Take regular breaksIt's easy for entrepreneurs to get caught up in their work and forget about taking regular breaks throughout their day. But breaks are essential for maintaining both physical and mental health — they can help reduce stress levels while providing an opportunity for creativity, too.


Try setting reminders on your phone or computer so that you take regular breaks throughout the day – this could mean stepping away from the desk for 10 minutes every hour or even going for a walk during lunchtime, if possible! Taking regular breaks will refresh your mind and body alike, helping you stay productive yet balanced over time.Related: How to Achieve A CEO Level of Focus by Breaking Habits and Taking Breaks4. Learn to say noAs an entrepreneur, it can be easy to overextend yourself by saying yes too often when asked for favors or projects outside of work hours — but learning when (and how) to say no can ultimately save considerable amounts of unnecessary stress in the long run.Don't feel guilty if you need to turn down certain requests; just politely explain why it's not possible at this particular time, perhaps offering alternative solutions depending on what may be suitable instead. By knowing when (and how) to say no without feeling guilty, entrepreneurs can find greater peace of mind while still being able to give back where needed most.


5. Schedule regular 'me time'Making sure that there is adequate 'me time' built into each week is essential – regardless if it's reading a book in silence, going out with friends, or simply enjoying a warm bath after work hours — whatever activity works best for giving yourself some much-needed rest. Having this type of downtime allows entrepreneurs ample opportunity to recharge their batteries before returning to business mode — allowing them to manage better stress levels associated with being constantly busy with numerous tasks at hand.6. Don't neglect your health and well-beingLastly - one key area that entrepreneurs needn't forget about balancing is their health & well-being; don't neglect to eat nutritious food regularly during working hours nor avoid exercise altogether either — these are paramount needs necessary for keeping one's energy levels high while reducing any risks associated from sitting down all day — thus ensuring both physical & mental well-being remains balanced over longer periods.ConclusionManaging a successful career and a satisfying lifestyle outside of work can be difficult but achievable, no matter what stage in business development one might find themselves at now.The key lies in understanding where our limits lie and setting clear boundaries between our personal life and professional obligations accordingly—along with scheduling sufficient 'me' time each week where necessary. Following such guidelines helps ensure balance remains intact over extended periods while promoting productivity and achieving success simultaneously, too.

37,How to Advance Your Brain's Efficiency and Automate Mundane Tasks,"Mar 11, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/why-you-need-to-embrace-ai-to-maximize-your-brainpower/469725,"
Early last year, two economists and two large language models chatted on a panel about the future of cognitive automation. The non-humans, ChatGPT and Claude, held their own, contributing meaningful insight to the conversation. At one point in the discussion, Claude remarked: ""I believe continued progress in AI and automation could take over most routine and even many non-routine cognitive tasks currently performed by humans, enabling unprecedented material abundance while liberating humanity from drudgery and toil.""As I read these lines, I found myself nodding. True enough, cognitive automation — automating mental tasks like administrative work, data analysis and content creation — has the potential to take human jobs. But if adopted conscientiously, it can also complement the work that only humans can do, and free us to pursue more meaningful tasks. The onus falls on leaders to ensure that employees receive the proper education and training to adapt to an increasingly AI-fueled workplace.Related: Always Waiting for the Best Option Is Holding You Back. Here's Why.

39,From Stress to Success — 6 Ways to Turn Your Fears into Resilience,"Mar 8, 2024",Rachel S. Ruby,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-conquer-your-fear-to-jumpstart-success/469018,"
Fear is the biggest obstacle to healing and personal success. Many challenging emotions tend to scare us when going through a trauma like divorce, especially those related to being alone and finances. All negativity and stress can lead to fear, which can actually prevent healing.To overcome fear so healing is possible, realizing the need to take action is imperative. It is common for people going through trauma to make plans as to what they will do to start over, but so many get derailed and don't actually take the steps to make the plans a reality.Related: 4 Ways Intuitive Healing Can Save Your Life — And How to Get StartedHere are some simple ways to take action to get started with the healing work.1. RelaxRelaxing sounds so simple — and it is — but it often gets overlooked amidst the chaos of life. It's important to remember that relaxation does not have to take long, and it will make you feel good — and when we feel good, we want more of that.



Healing is not possible when we are in a victim state or scared. We need to feel all the feelings and then learn to let those that do not serve us go so we can focus on the positive ones and the joy we can create in the new life we envision.Incorporate relaxation into your day every day — even if it's just for 10 minutes. Take a bath, go on a beautiful walk, meditate or read a book. Recognize what feels good and calms you because being in this state during stressful times will help you focus on getting to a place where you feel like this more often… until you heal and feel it the majority of the time.Related: 3 Mental Rules to Help You Understand (and Finally Relax) Your Busy Brain2. Evolve""To evolve"" means becoming your highest and best version. We must consciously evolve to heal, lest we stay where we are. It involves doing things differently and seeking answers from within. In the case of a divorce, you must determine who you are outside of the former marriage and who you want to become in your new life.


Figuring this out involves diving into some deep questions about yourself to figure out what you need to work on to live your desired life. Most people need guidance to tackle some of the emotional states like low self-worth and false beliefs about oneself. Other limiting beliefs include shame, lack of confidence or the belief that we ""can't"" evolve from a caterpillar to a butterfly.3. FailFailure is necessary in order to grow. If we got what we wanted all the time, we would not feel appreciative — and gratitude is necessary not only for healing but as part of a happy life. Try new things, know you might fail, and revel in the lessons learned from that failure. It allows you to fine-tune who you want to be and what you want to create.Related: From Setback to Success — 4 Ways to Turn Your Struggles into Resilience4. RedirectWe are all made of energy; when that energy strays from the positive, we can hit a wall in our healing journey. This is normal and will happen often, so learn how to redirect that energy to set yourself back on the right path.


Depending on where the feeling manifests, there are things you can do to redirect. For example, say you are feeling down and sit on the couch binge-watching Netflix. In the process, you consume half a container of ice cream, and your stomach doesn't feel good. A redirect could be to turn off the TV, turn on some dance music, and get lost in movement. You will likely feel completely different after just a short time dancing (but keep going if it feels good!). Your action is opposite to what you were doing, allowing you to release negative energy.Related: The 5 Greatest Obstacles to Success -- and How to Crush Them5. Have funHealing shouldn't be so serious all the time. When we go through trauma like divorce, it is not uncommon to lose the connection with our inner child, as the process is usually stressful and sad. Just like redirecting energy through dancing, as in the example above, having fun helps us connect with that inner child, which can turn the perspective around.Make plans to have fun — don't just think you will do it. Go roller skating with a friend, shoot some hoops, play pickleball or whatever sounds fun. Try new things, too, and make sure to spice it up. New experiences fulfill a child's wonder and curiosity, so channel that perspective as you make plans.


6. Get helpIt's okay to ask for help; if you have the right support network of people who love and do not judge you, that can be a lifeline. Sometimes, we need professional help – like therapy, coaching, or energy work. You can learn about different ways to get help and see what suits you best. It will make healing much easier.

40,15 of the Best Time Management and Productivity Books of All Time,"Mar 8, 2024",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/15-of-the-best-time-management-and-productivity-books-of/329378,"
Entrepreneurs are always on a quest to win the race against time. As if that weren't stressful enough, we also have to enhance our willpower and strengthen our self-discipline. If not, then all of the distractions flying around will stand in the way of us getting things done.Since I'm an avid reader, I've learned over the years that the best way to improve my time management and productivity skills have been through books. Of course, it can be overwhelming when you're searching online or browsing in a book store for literature that can assist you in living a more fruitful life. That's why I've made the decision easier for you by sharing with the 15 best time management and productivity books of all time.1. ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change"" by Stephen R. CoveyFirst published in 1989, ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" is regularly considered the best book to read if you want to improve your productivity both professionally and personally. It focuses on developing new habits so that you can stay-on-track as opposed to eliminating bad habits. Most notably, defining your goals and priorities.



Covey uses the analogy of placing rocks, pebbles, and sand into a jar to help you define what's really important. If you start by putting the little things, such as the pebbles or sand, the rocks won't fit. However, if you begin with the rock there's enough room for you to put the tinier items around them in the jar.Key quote: ""The key is not to prioritize what's on your scheduling app but to schedule your priorities.""Related: 5 Ways to Be a More Effective People Person2. ""How to Stop Procrastinating: A Simple Guide to Mastering Difficult Tasks and Breaking the Procrastination Habit"" by S.J. ScottIf you're struggling with procrastination, this is arguably the only book you'll need to own. How to Stop Procrastinating is a down-to-earth and uses a specific framework to assist you in becoming action-oriented. Scott also shares his own experiences on how he overcame procrastination and explores the main reasons why we drag out feet.Personally, I enjoyed how straightforward this book. The advice provided isn't too complex. It simply encourages you to does this, then do this, and after do that.Key quote: ""If you're someone who procrastinates, then this bad habit is limiting your success in a variety of ways. If you don't address this issue, then you'll reduce the likelihood that you'll achieve your major goals.""


3.""Eat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time"" by Brian TracyIf your procrastination still persists then Eat That Frog! should help you get over that hump. Inspired by a famous Mark Twain quote, ""Eat a live frog the first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day,"" author Brian Tracy details why and how you should tackle your most challenging task in the morning.Additionally, Tracy shares successful time management techniques like how to set goals, get organized, practice the ""Law of Three,"" and applying the 80/20 Rule.Key quote: ""You can get control of your time and your life only by changing the way you think, work, and deal with the never-ending river of responsibilities that flows over you each day. You can get control of your tasks and activities only to the degree that you stop doing some things and start spending more time on the few activities that can really make a difference in your life.""4. ""The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich""by Timothy Ferriss


Timothy Ferriss shares his step-by-step guide on how anyone can start earning a monthly five-figure income by working just The 4-Hour Workweek. As a result, you'll be able to live the life you actually want without having to be just another participant of the daily rat race.If this sounds too good to be true, Ferriss includes over 50 practical tips and real-life case studies on how you can live more and work less.Key quote: ""Being able to quit things that don't work is integral to being a winner.""5. ""Organize Tomorrow Today: 8 Ways to Retrain Your Mind to Optimize Performance at Work and in Life"" by Dr. Jason Selk and Tom BartowWritten by Dr. Jason Selk, director of mental training for the St. Louis Cardinals, and business coach Tom Bartow's Organize Tomorrow Today, this book outlines the eight most effective ways to optimize your organization. As a result, you'll focus on process-oriented goals that will guide you in maximizing your time and breaking bad habits.

41,"How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did It","Mar 8, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/advice-to-turn-your-side-hustle-into-a-7-figure-business/470819,"
More than half of Gen Zers and millennials have a side hustle, and 80% of them say they need the extra cash due to the state of the economy, according to a recent survey from LendingTree. From driving for rideshare services to teaching courses online, operating cotton candy vending machines, turning your backyard into a dog park, and so much more, there's something for everyone hoping to diversify their income streams — and anyone who might want to launch into full-time entrepreneurship, too.Sometimes, successful side hustlers grow their earnings to the point where they outpace the salaries from their full-time jobs, and it only makes sense to go all in on their new venture. But even people whose side gigs see less initial return might have an entrepreneurial spirit and clear vision that motivates them to commit in full, and with the right strategy and mindset, those businesses can also become highly profitable, hitting six- or even seven-figure months.Below are three women who did just that: Katherine Watercutter, founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge; Julie Berninger, co-founder of e-printables curriculum Gold City Ventures; and Danielle Cohen-Shohet, founder and CEO of booking and payments platform GlossGenius. Their journeys and areas of expertise are different, but they all know what it takes to go from a side hustle — maybe lucrative, maybe not — to a thriving multimillion-dollar business.

Katherine Watercutter: Gold HingeKatherine Watercutter is the founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge. When Watercutter was 23 and worked as a sales representative for a distribution company working with kitchen and bath designers around Indiana, she started the business as a side hustle. Lack of funding proved a major hurdle in the beginning, but today, Gold Hinge counts celebrities including Kristin Cavallari and Kaitlyn Bristowe among its fans. The brand also went viral during TikTok's ""RushTok"" trend, garnering 40 million hashtag impressions and sales in the multi-millions.Watercutter's advice: ""My advice may sound as cheesy as it gets, but don't give up. People in this day and age are impatient and sometimes quick to give up when they feel like they keep failing. There were a few times when I thought I hit 'rock bottom' and exhausted all options, but I found a way around it. I felt like I was failing consistently for three years, and I know many would have given up by then, but business is all about problem-solving.""Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.Julie Berninger: Gold City VenturesJulie Berninger is an Etsy shop owner and co-founder of Gold City Ventures with Cody Berman. Berninger worked as a project manager for large tech companies and planned to be in the industry long term, but the ""financial independence, retire early"" (FIRE) movement inspired her to start a side hustle. She opened an Etsy shop focused on the bachelorette party niche, then co-founded the online course business that teaches other entrepreneurs how to find success on the platform. She quit her 9-5 in 2021 when the income from her ventures replaced her salary.


Berninger's advice: ""Don't start a business by yourself! Pick a business partner and scale faster! Also, don't waste time trying to piece information together on YouTube. Pay for a step-by-step program or a business consultant because your time is valuable.""Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a MonthDanielle Cohen-Shohet: GlossGeniusDanielle Cohen-Shohet is the CEO and founder of GlossGenius, an all-in-one booking, payments and point-of-sale solution that helps beauty and wellness professionals drive bookings and grow their business. In college, Cohen-Shohet did freelance makeup out of her dorm room, and she and her twin sister also collaborated on a digital receipts payments venture. Ultimately, she'd pull from those experiences to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses — and build a software company worth over $510 million in the process.Cohen-Shohet's advice: ""Be fearless. Don't take no for an answer. And, importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.""

42,Having Time Management Problems? Then You Must Do One Thing to Avoid These 3 Consequences,"Mar 8, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/having-time-management-problems-try-this-weekly-habit/469749,"
Nearly everyone wishes they had more time. One of the biggest challenges facing most of my clients is finding enough time to ""do it all."" We have more time-saving tools and resources at our fingertips than ever before. Many of them come in the form of electronic devices that exist to serve us. Yet, most of us report having less time than ever before.Ultimately, time management is just self-management. Those of us who do it well experience much higher levels of satisfaction and success in every area of our lives. My advice? Carve out 1-2 hours early in the week to strategize and plan your time and calendar. Many of us don't make time to do this (because we feel we can't), but that's a mistake. Here's what happens if you don't do this every week.Related: 5 Reasons Why You Need to Learn Time Management for Your Business



1. You'll never connect to your wildest goals and your core valuesWhen you don't regularly make time to check in with yourself, you rob yourself of opportunities to identify what you're passionate about, where your talents lie and what you were put on this earth to do. You'll start to forget your ""why."" The things that must be done today will always feel more urgent than the things you'd like to do tomorrow — but the latter is often far more important.Without alone time to focus on the future, it's incredibly easy to get sucked into the day-to-day minutiae or whatever deadline your boss gave you that's fast approaching. Without intentionally pulling yourself out of the daily grind, you'll never develop a true plan for where you want to end up in five or 10 years and what you stand for. Without that, it's nearly impossible to take the right actions this week to manifest your future self.


If you have an idea of what you'd like to be remembered for, it's imperative that you spend time now crafting that specific vision and how you plan to make it happen. It won't happen on its own. This is also a chance to ensure you're living in accordance with your core values. Many verbally say things like ""family is the most important thing to me,"" but then don't back those words up with action. If you take time to remind yourself of your most important values on a weekly basis, you'll have an easier time prioritizing and committing to them.2. You won't know who to empower and what to delegateWe all have the same 24 hours in a day. Strategy time doesn't add more hours to your week; it only takes time. It doesn't allow your plate to become any bigger, but it does allow you to decide how you'll remove things from your plate. A weekly strategy session allows you to figure out what can be automated, delegated or eliminated. Ask yourself: Is there a way I can use technology to make this process faster? Is there someone around me who is better suited than me to complete this project or task, and who would also view it as a great growth opportunity? Do I have the right people on my team? How am I helping them become ready to take on more?When you make time to ask questions like these, it's amazing what epiphanies you'll have. Private strategy sessions are a great place to make plans for who you'll ask to do what and why it's the right decision — not just for you, but for them. In my days as a senior leader in financial services, I'd use my strategy time to make careful decisions about which direct reports I'd ask to lead our weekly conference calls and monthly meetings, as well as who I might tap to complete special assignments. Until I made this shift, these were all things I felt I had to do myself. It was incredible how many hours I was able to free up on my calendar once I realized that empowering the talent around me is a key part of great leadership.Related: What Are You Wasting Your Business Time On?


3. Your calendar will fill up with other people's most important priorities instead of your ownWhen you make time to strategize and plan each week, you get to load the things that matter most (to you) onto your calendar before others have the chance. As Stephen Covey said, ""Act or be acted upon. It's easier to say no when you have a greater yes in mind."" It's true. It's much easier to turn down an invite for a meeting or an event when you already have a conflict scheduled on your calendar that feels more important to you. Saying no becomes far less personal.Taking time on Sunday night or Monday morning to map out your week and give your most important priorities a place to live and breathe on your calendar strongly increases the chance that those things will get done. It's amazing how much metaphorical gravel and small rocks will fit onto your calendar (between all the cracks) once you schedule your big rocks first. This allows you to be proactive instead of reactive. If you've already been intentional and deliberate about what you want to get done each week and where you feel your time is best spent, you'll be able to articulate those thoughts more easily in the heat of a moment when someone spontaneously asks you if you can spare time for them.If you already feel that you don't have enough time, I understand that making time to strategize around your biggest priorities, plan for the future, and calendar your week feels nearly impossible. But remember: Time is not found; it's made. Don't be a slave to time. Practicing this discipline does take time, but this practice returns more time back to you, especially in the long run. This process will help you (and everyone around you) become stronger. If you consistently make time for this activity on a weekly basis, you'll eventually find that you're ahead of whatever is coming down the pike and you've got time for all the things that matter most, both professionally and personally.

43,7 Proven Ways to Reduce Wasted Time in Your Daily Life,"Mar 7, 2024",Chad Willardson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/7-proven-ways-to-reduce-wasted-time-in-your-daily-life/470430,"
In today's fast-paced world, time is your most precious asset, yet it's alarming to realize how much of that we devalue. Did you know that the average American dedicates 6-8 hours daily to their phones and TV? That's almost a full 120 days per year! This underscores how easy it is to squander our attention.Life is too short, and your relationships are too valuable to spend one-third of it looking at screens. Drawing from my personal experiences, this article explores seven ways to minimize wasted time, leading to a more fulfilling life.Related: 5 Ways You're Wasting Time Without Even Realizing It



1. Silence the noise: Turn off unnecessary notificationsThe incessant buzz of notifications can severely disrupt your focus and productivity. According to a Meyer study, even mental blocks created by shifting between tasks can cost as much as 40% of someone's productive time. I found that once I silenced all alerts — except for essential phone calls and texts — I significantly reduced distractions and got a lot more quality work done in less time.You also feel more in control when you check your different apps and messages on your own schedule rather than reacting to a continuous stream of notifications. Fun fact: I'm writing this article from the patio of a nice beachside hotel in Florida and have ironically been interrupted at least 10 times by friends (from the conference I'm attending) walking by and stopping to talk.


2. Use social media with cautionMaking the bold decision to step away from Facebook and Twitter and drop over 80,000 followers (combined on the platforms) was a big decision but very liberating. During the early days of the pandemic and the 2020 election cycle, I noticed my energy and mental health were not uplifted anytime I scrolled through my feeds. That move reclaimed countless hours previously lost to mindless browsing and reduced my stress levels significantly. I went from four social media platforms down to two (LinkedIn and Instagram) and spent much less time because of that move.3. Don't go see every new movie that comes outThis may sound extreme, but limiting my movie-watching to roughly one per year (if that) was a personal choice that dramatically freed up my schedule. I know, you probably think I'm weird for this one. But this decision was another one that I made over a decade ago, and I haven't looked back with regret at all.Yes, I'm left out of all the conversations about the new movie that just came out. And truthfully, I've never seen anything on Netflix or logged into a Netflix account in my life. I realized how much time people spend talking about movies and sitting around for hours watching movies and decided this wasn't something that was leading toward reaching my goals, and my life would be just fine without it.Related: Become a Productivity Monster by Eliminating These 5 Time-Wasting Habits


4. Let go of the binge-watching cultureBy this point, you may only be reading because you're fascinated (or annoyed) by my suggestions to cut out wasted time. I used to really enjoy coming home from work, taking my shoes off, grabbing the remote control and relaxing on the couch for some television. How many hours did I spend watching TV? No idea. And that's the point. It's so easy to binge-watch shows and later realize we didn't actually do anything at night that we intended to do. The last TV show episode I watched was in 2013, the final episode of The Office with Michael Scott. I felt like nothing could be better than the legend Michael Scott and decided I'd retire from television.According to Neilsen's State of Play report, between February 2021 and February 2022, 817,000 individual TV programs were available to choose from, and Americans watched almost 15 million years — yes, you read that right, years — worth of streaming content. That's in one year alone. Think about what important life moments were missed during that 15 million years of time spent in just 12 months!5. Find balance with the newsOpting out of the constant news stream was a deliberate move to avoid the overwhelm and negativity that can come from the 24/7 news cycle. Staying informed is essential, but it's crucial to find balanced, less intrusive ways to keep abreast of world events without it consuming our lives. Over the years, it seems that news has been more focused on sounding the alarm and spiking fear and worry. Be conscious of how much time you spend being sucked into parts of the news that brings you down all the time.6. Schedule personal prioritiesBy prescheduling workouts, reading sessions, time with my wife and children, and other personal priorities in my phone calendar, I make sure the things that matter to me actually happen. If it's scheduled in your calendar, you're more likely to make time for it. Don't leave the important things to chance.


Related: Distractions Are Hurting You More Than You Realize: Here's Why7. Delegate to boost your efficiencyInvesting in highly competent assistants and team members and delegating tasks that don't necessitate your direct involvement is life-changing. You've got to be willing to let others help you by doing things for you, even if you're good at whatever the task is. This approach not only streamlines your workflows but also frees up time for more significant personal and professional endeavors. You simply can't do it all by yourself.By trying even just a couple of these seven strategies above, you'll cut back on your wasted time and create a more intentional and rewarding lifestyle. Managing your attention and deciding how to spend your time is the ultimate difference between success and regret. Embrace the idea of removing some distractions to see the benefits of judiciously allocating your most valuable resource: your time.

It's Leap Day: the extra day tacked onto the end of February, typically every four years, to account for the Earth's full 365-day-plus rotation around the sun.And it's Thursday, which is a traditional workday for employees and entrepreneurs alike. But does your annual pay reflect the fact you've worked an additional day in the year? Well, that depends — mostly on if you're an hourly or salaried worker.Related: Leap Year: How To Utilize the Extra Day As An EntrepreneurNaturally, employees paid by the hour will be paid for every hour worked; as a result, those bonus hours worked should show up in the next paycheck. Salaried workers, on the other hand, won't necessarily see any pay adjustment.In this case, are salaried employees getting the short end of the stick? Not exactly, according to CNN Business, as many of those employees will see work hours ebb and flow week to week depending on their projects, so it might work out in the end.But it's worth noting that a 2019 Gallup poll found that 52% of full-time workers reported working more than 40 hours a week, while 39% worked at least 50 hours a week, and 18% worked at least 60.Related: Want to Be More Productive?

        In 2006, El Ghatit was working in IT when he got the idea for a sentimental telephone-based business. 
      


        A few months later, he was laid off and decided to focus on growing his side hustle. 
      


        As a side hustle, the venture earned $100,000 per year; now a full-time business, it's on track to see more than $700,000 in 2024.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Alaa El Ghatit, founder of LifeOnRecord. LifeOnRecord is a service that lets people phone in stories, memories and well wishes for someone celebrating a birthday, retirement, wedding or other special occasion. The recordings are put onto a keepsake speaker or a vinyl album.Image Credit: Courtesy of Alaa El GhatitWhen did you start LifeOnRecord as a side hustle, and what inspired it?



Back in 2006, I was working in an IT department of a large employee benefits consulting firm, managing 60 people, and I wasn't feeling fulfilled at my job. I didn't like being in meetings all day, and I wanted to get more hands-on again and work on something more meaningful, but I couldn't see a viable path to doing that where I was.I had been playing around with a telephone system in my spare time and wondered if I could create a business by having people call in and record their favorite stories and memories about a person as a way to celebrate their birthday, retirement, wedding, etc.


Related: He Started a Side Hustle in His Parents' Basement and Won Big on Richard Branson's TV Show. The Business Saw Over $650 Million in Annual Revenue Last Year.What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground? My mother-in-law's 65th birthday was coming up, and I thought she'd enjoy hearing from all her kids, grandkids, friends, husband, etc.So, as a trial, I set up a phone number that everyone could call and gave her the resulting recordings on a CD (remember — this was 2006). We all listened to it together on her birthday in her living room. She loved it, there were tears, and it sparked a lot of stories (18 years later, she still loves it).


I thought the idea had some traction, so I worked on it in my spare time to make it a service.A few months later, I got laid off, and I decided to take some time to try and grow the business. People started ordering, but not in the volume that allowed me to support my wife and four young kids, so after nine months, I took a job as a director of IT for a mid-size company where I could be hands-on and manage a small team.Were there any challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? Navigating the side hustle of LifeOnRecord presented three significant challenges. First, I got used to the security of a corporate salary with the entrepreneurial aspect of LifeOnRecord. I enjoyed both, which kept me from fully committing to LifeOnRecord. Despite the automation and minimal time LifeOnRecord required, the camaraderie of my corporate role left me hesitant to leave until 2022.


Additionally, keeping LifeOnRecord a secret from colleagues fostered an emotional barrier, making me more reserved and unable to share valuable insights across both my worlds. This secrecy persisted until the pivotal moment I decided to quit my corporate job. Surprisingly, upon revealing LifeOnRecord to the CEO, I found unexpected support rather than resistance. The company facilitated a smooth transition, allowing me to gradually shift my focus to LifeOnRecord, with the CEO even providing guidance along the way.Lastly, an early challenge involved defending LifeOnRecord's intellectual property against infringement from a multi-national corporation. Through perseverance and direct negotiation, which took over a year, I secured an agreement from them without legal intervention, and I licensed my intellectual property to them for a fair but significant licensing fee.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money.

Growth was gradual, but people who used the service talked about it with others and developed into repeat buyers. Before I focused on it full-time, it brought in a little over $100,000 a year as a side hustle. With my corporate salary, it allowed us to live comfortably, fund college for my kids and go on trips.How much annual revenue is LifeOnRecord projected to see this year? For me, it is not really about the money and growth but more about me being able to provide a personal, customer-focused experience that I can be directly involved in. Having said that, last year was the first year it was a full-time venture, and it brought in about $350,000, and this year we will more than double that amount. We're always super responsive to customer questions and requests, and I don't want it to get so big that stellar customer service is no longer a priority.How have you approached scaling the company? What has really been key in helping it grow? 


Right from the start, my strategy was all about leveraging technology to scale and enhance the customer experience. Recognizing that customers wanted more control over their contributions, I developed a ""My Recordings"" portal for them to edit, organize or delete their messages. I streamlined the audio enhancement process by partnering with Dolby Labs for top-notch voice clarity and noise reduction, and I expanded contribution options beyond traditional phone calls to include six alternative methods.[While] balancing this growth with my corporate responsibilities, I was mindful not to expand too quickly, aiming to maintain a healthy equilibrium between my day job and LifeOnRecord. This balance allowed me to enjoy the perks of both my professional career and my entrepreneurial venture without overwhelming myself or the business.A key innovation was introducing vintage rotary phone rentals for wedding receptions for guests to leave messages for the wedding couple. Unlike competitors that simply rent out the phones, we integrated these pieces into our broader service ecosystem.

There's a lingering thought that maybe I should have stepped away from the corporate world sooner to fully embrace the entrepreneurial path with LifeOnRecord. The allure of stability and a predictable income often held me back, anchoring me to a role that, while comfortable, perhaps limited the potential growth of my passion project. Yet, with every decision comes a silver lining.Staying in my corporate job perhaps longer than I should have afforded me invaluable lessons and experiences. It was in this professional setting that I honed skills that later became crucial in navigating the entrepreneurial landscape: the discipline of managing projects, the art of negotiation and the ability to lead a team.This period also served as a vital incubation phase for LifeOnRecord. It allowed me to slowly but surely build the foundation of the business, testing ideas and refining the model without the immediate pressure of having it be my sole source of income. In a way, it granted me the freedom to experiment and innovate with less risk, laying the groundwork for what LifeOnRecord would eventually become.


What are you most excited about when it comes to LifeOnRecord's future? Customers have used LifeOnRecord in innovative ways. People have used LifeOnRecord to send out audio thank yous, and brides have recorded their feelings of ""saying yes to the dress"" using LifeOnRecord, then played that recording as they walk down the aisle. I think there are many more ways to market LifeOnRecord that we can explore in the future.What's your favorite part about running your own business today? I love the impact the business has on customers. When I had a corporate job, I felt like a cog in a wheel, but with LifeOnRecord, I created a way for people to make a connection with others. I'm especially grateful when people buy it and record messages for someone with a terminal illness. They say it's one of the few things they can do to show how loved the person is.Beyond that, I like the lifestyle flexibility and not needing to be accountable to anyone other than our customers. I love being identified with it and the excitement that other people have when I share what I do.

48,Jon Taffer's 10% Rule Is the Productivity Hack That Could Change Your Life,"Feb 23, 2024",Dan Bova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/bar-rescues-jon-taffer-shares-a-10-productivity-hack/470135,"
Okay, Jon Taffer fans, it's time to pour yourself a big cocktail. Bar Rescue is back, so let the shouting — er, we mean ""spirited encouragement"" — begin!Premiering Sunday, February 25 at 10 p.m. ET on Paramount Network, everyone's favorite hospitality pitbull is hitting bars across the country to help struggling business owners and staffers get their acts together before their doors close for good. And in a new twist this season, Taffer has enlisted an all-star roster of nightlife, bar and restaurant experts, including actor Danny Trejo and Las Vegas nightspot guru Dustin Drai, to bring even more heat to these troubled kitchens.Related: Can Jon Taffer Fix Franchise Restaurants?



Entrepreneur spoke with the outspoken motivator and business mastermind after he completed filming his incredible 250th episode to get his take on what's new in the bar biz (Are you ready for a robot bartender?) and to find out what gets him so damn fired up every time he steps inside a bar in desperate need of rescue (hint: it has more to do with families than booze.) Here are some highlights of that conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity.Would you like some AI with your fries?""When I go to conventions and restaurant shows, everything is about robotics and AI as a solution for the human labor that owners are having so much trouble hiring for,"" Taffer says. ""I think many restaurants in the next five to seven years are going to be quite robotic — from ordering to delivery to preparation. AI is already used extensively for the back of the house — interpreting data, identifying trends and doing all that kind of work — but I think we're going to start to see a good amount in the front of the house as well. For instance, ordering on a tablet that interacts with you conversationally. 'What are you in the mood for? You might enjoy this.' Robots are already working fryers and flipping burgers, and that's sure to increase. And the interesting thing about robotics is it takes variable costs, and it makes them fixed. I have a fixed equipment cost; I have a fixed maintenance cost, so it alleviates some of the surprises that come up in the industry.""


Related: Bar Rescue's Jon Taffer 'This One Thing Makes a Great Leader'But humans aren't done just yet""Robotics and AI will certainly help in the back of the house, but great restaurants are about connectivity,"" Taffer continues. ""Customers don't connect with a tablet; they connect with great waiters and chefs and owners. At Taffer's Tavern, we're very high-tech in the back of the house, but there is no tech in the front of the house. We designed a concept to protect that connectivity. And something to think about is that there are three types of menus. The spontaneous menu is where you stop and grab a hotdog just because it smells good. The convenience menu is the restaurant that's in the lobby of your office building. Not the best food in the world, but it's easy and it's convenient. And then there's the destination menu, where you travel to a specific location. Those first two menus are going to really embrace and benefit from robotics.""Making an impact with Bar Rescue""Purdue University did a study of restaurant reality shows like ours, Kitchen Nightmares and Restaurant Impossible, and it assessed the success ratio of each. Bar Rescue doubled every other show in terms of success ratio,"" Taffer says. ""And that means a lot to me because behind these establishments are people. These bar owners are paying mortgages and taking care of their families. So success for a bar means that we're helping put kids through college. We are really making a positive difference in people's lives.""


The benefits of helping others""Years ago, I opened my restaurant, Alamo Grill, in the Mall of America,"" Taffer says. ""We were opening our second restaurant in Kansas City, and I needed to pick a training team. So I pick a prep cook, a line cook, a server and a host. We put the team together, and we go on the road. There was a dishwasher named Theo, who was a local kid. The prep cook quit, so I moved Theo into the position, and he was just great. We're in Kansas City having a big meeting with 80 new employees, and each of the trainers introduces themselves. And Theo is there in a suit. He walks up to the podium and says, 'Six months ago, I was a dishwasher, and look at me today.' Man, that was a powerful moment for me. I was more proud than he was! It was a moment of real gratification for me, and when you experience something in life that is so gratifying, you seek more of it.""Related: Bar Rescue's Jon Taffer: 'Reaction Management' Is the Key to Your SuccessThe 10% rule""On Bar Rescue, we do everything in four days, including assessing the business, remodeling, rebranding, redoing the logos, the food, the beverages product, the interior, the training — everything. In four days!"" Taffer says. ""When I talk to big corporations, I always ask, 'What the hell takes you guys so long to do anything?' So I say to everybody reading this that there is not one project, there is not one process, there is not one objective in your life that you cannot accelerate by at least 10 percent. That includes the number of phone calls you make, the number of contacts you make, the number of places that you go, the speed you write something — do it just 10% quicker, and it will dramatically increase your productivity and your time resources. That 10% can change your life.""

49,How Learning to Take Care of Myself Helps Me Take Care of My Business,"Feb 23, 2024",Nellie Akalp,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-learning-to-take-care-of-myself-helps-me-take-care-of/468820,"
In the constant bustle of entrepreneurial life, the idea of self-care too often takes a back seat. That happened to me. However, I realized that self-care was crucial for my personal well-being and the success of my business.I've now learned to embrace self-care because it calms, refreshes and energizes me, ultimately making me more focused and productive. Here are some tips that helped me.Related: Self-Care Isn't Selfish — It's Essential for Sustaining High Performance. Here's How to Avoid Burning Out.



The consequences of self-neglectNeglecting self-care can lead to burnout, a common issue among entrepreneurs. Many business owners don't like to admit having felt burnt out — but I will.Our business was steadily growing when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. As it continued, my typically upbeat attitude began to erode. I felt so isolated being confined to home. I got sad when Covid-19 prevented my kids from having their regular high school graduation.


Many people experienced something similar. But entrepreneurs are used to being in control, and Covid-19 took that away from us. The impact was profound. Losing control made me feel even worse, and I started feeling burnt out and experiencing daily severe highs and lows.Burnout can impact entrepreneurs even without a once-in-a-lifetime trigger like a global pandemic. The key is recognizing when you're burning out before your flame extinguishes. Do you know the signs? According to the Young Leaders Of The Americas Initiative (YLAI), here's what to look for:Lack of creativityFatigueReduced productivityAnxietyDifficulty concentratingHeadachesChange in appetite or weightNegative attitudes toward employees or familyDifficulty sleepingAre you stressed or anxious?You cannot solve the problem unless you uncover the root cause. As our business started to suffer, it was crucial to stop the spiral. Like most of America, we were working from home. I finally realized that although my husband and I had run two successful companies together since college, we could not work in the same room.I was beyond stressed — I felt anxious. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), it's essential to know the difference between stress and anxiety.


Stress is ""generally a response to an external cause, and goes away once the situation is resolved."" Anxiety is a ""persistent feeling of apprehension or dread that doesn't go away and interferes with how you live your life.""The symptoms of stress and anxiety mimic those of burnout. If you identify with the above signs, act now by taking back control of your life.Related: 8 Self-Care Tips From Wildly Successful EntrepreneursTaking control with self-careI realized I had to stop ceding my power and seize control of what I could. First, my husband and I started working in separate rooms in the house. That helped alleviate one source of my anxiety, but I turned to self-care to eliminate the rest.


Self-care is vital for all business owners, but especially for women who often juggle professional and personal responsibilities. Too often, we think of self-care as ignoring others. But self-care is not self-indulgence. Once you accept that it's about making a strategic investment in your success, you can start on the road to recovery.I needed a plan and sprang into action. Food had become one of my coping mechanisms, so I created a daily exercise plan and committed myself to healthy living. I also needed to restore my balance and found meditation was the answer. I now meditate twice a day for about 30 minutes.There are many misconceptions about meditation. Let me try to dispel them:You can meditate whenever you have time. Even three minutes will work.Sitting like a pretzel is not required. Just find a comfortable position.You don't need a mantra or a goal. Just let your mind go.You can use guided meditation or do it on your own.Meditating worked to eliminate my anxiety, sharpen my focus, and boost my productivity. Meditation is so effective at stress reduction that we incorporated it into our workplace and added 10-minute meditation sessions to our team-building activities. This helps enhance collective focus and morale and fosters a culture of wellness.


There are other options for exploring self-care:Rediscover the joy of playfulness: Return to a forgotten hobby, buy an adult coloring book, tackle a jigsaw puzzle or play with Legos. Reconnect with the simple pleasures that ignite your spirit.The sounds of silence: This is particularly hard for entrepreneurs, but set aside time to unplug and disconnect from social media and technology. Savor the peace and clarity that silence can bring.Challenge your comfort zone: Learn a new skill or language. Take dancing or cooking classes. Embracing the discomfort of learning something new can restore your confidence and expand your capabilities.


Practice random acts of kindness: Volunteer at a local charity. Get your staff involved. Become a SCORE mentor. Anonymously pay for someone's coffee. Helping others can get you out of your head.Related: Worried That You Don't Have Time for Self-Care? Here's How to Fit It Into Any ScheduleYou may also need to revisit your stressors. Are you overworked? Feeling isolated? Try:Surrounding yourself with mentors, peers and friends who understand the entrepreneurial journey can offer perspective and alleviate your isolation.Setting realistic goals for your business and personal life. Break larger goals into manageable steps.Learning to say ""no"" is one of the hardest things for entrepreneurs to do. But turning down business when you're overwhelmed allows you to better serve existing customers.Delegating gives you time to tackle crucial work tasks and invest in self-care.While there's lots of advice for self-care all over the internet, remember you're an entrepreneur and should redefine it to fit your needs. Self-care is not a one-time activity, but an ongoing journey of exploration and discovery.

50,SMART Goals May Be Holding You Back — Try This Effective Goal-Setting Technique Instead,"Feb 21, 2024",Sabrina Chevannes,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/smart-goals-may-be-holding-you-back-try-this-method/469569,"
Everyone can set goals, right? Just think about what you want to achieve, give yourself a timeframe, and make that your goal. What's so difficult about it?!Well, let's look at the stats for a moment. I'm writing this article in February, and according to the research, only 36% will have made it this far with their New Year's resolutions. Twenty-three percent will have given up in the first week!And those who actually keep their New Year's resolutions? Just 9%. So, do you think these people are actually good at setting goals?Related: 5 Goal-Setting Guidelines That Drive SuccessWhat is wrong with traditional goal setting?If you were to Google how to set goals, it will most likely tell you to create SMART goals.For those who don't know, SMART means:S – SpecificM – MeasurableA – AchievableR – RelevantT – Time-boundWhile this is a great framework to start with, it has some limitations.First of all, the T (time-bound) is the one I have the biggest issue with. It's definitely necessary to set deadlines sometimes so that you stay on track and keep momentum. However, this added pressure can cause some people to cut corners or slack on the quality. Therefore, things are not done properly and the goal is not really achieved.



The problem is that this deadline is often arbitrary. Where did you come up with this date from? Is it actually relevant?This is the same with A (achievable). What counts as achievable? And if you set your bar too low, you're not really pushing yourself, so then what's the point?The problem with a lot of goal setting is that you're not basing your goals on the right things.Find your WHYThe reason why many people fail in their goals is because they haven't chosen them for the right reasons. Usually, they've based it on something they've seen on social media or something their friends are talking about.


As an entrepreneur, you take a look at what other business owners are doing in your industry, and you can't help but think that you need to be doing something similar. Your biggest competitor has announced that they're writing a book — you MUST write one too! Let's add that to your goals. It MUST be done this year too.But for some reason, you just cannot motivate yourself to get the writing done. You prioritize everything else ahead of it. This is because the motivation for this goal is not intrinsic.If you've not yet seen Dan Pink's TED talk on motivation, then now is probably a good time to do so!Your motivation to achieve your goal has to come from within — it's your passion, your true desire. If you're extrinsically motivated by money, fame or social validation, this will be very short-lived motivation.


Simon Sinek has always told us to ""start with why,"" and this also applies here. Understand why you want to achieve this goal, and why now? If you get to the root of what's driving you, you can tap into that and make sure it's for the right reasons. You are more likely to achieve your goals if you are motivated by the right things.Related: The Art of Setting the Right Goals and Achieving ThemThe right way to set goalsWhen speaking to successful entrepreneurs who regularly achieve their goals, it's clear that they don't just pick lofty things that they want to achieve and try to achieve them. Instead, they see their goals as an identity change and change their habits and lifestyles to match those of someone who would smash those goals.For example, if you want to lose weight, instead of telling yourself that you're on a diet and cannot eat certain things or that you must go to the gym, you tell yourself that you're already a healthy person.


Healthy people don't eat lots of cake. Healthy people regularly go to the gym, even if for a short while. Healthy people don't drink lots of alcohol.If you ""become"" a healthy person, you create healthier habits that essentially change who you are as a person. The goal of losing weight will be a natural by-product of the behavioral change.My goal-setting systemSince acronyms seem to go down well, I created my own acronym for setting goals that work on creating a more lasting effect. My goal-setting technique is called SHAPING:Start small:


Don't try to do too much at once. If you want to write a book, don't say you're going to write for two hours per day. Start with 100 words per day and build it up.Habit formation:Following on from starting small, you need to create habits to help you achieve your goals. So, those 100 words a day will be written every single day. Show up on days even when you don't feel like it. This is how habits form.Accountability:


Tell someone your goals. By creating accountability for yourself, you're more likely to achieve them. Use this accountability partner to also help encourage you to stick to your habits.Personalize:Don't copy trends of what others are doing. Just because it works for them does not mean it will work for you. Personalize your methods to suit your lifestyle.Intrinsic motivation:


Find out what really fuels you. If you understand your true ""why"" — what comes from within — then you can pick goals accordingly and you will be motivated by the right things.No:Learning to say this simple word can be extremely difficult, but it's the most powerful thing you can do. Say NO to anything that doesn't help you achieve your goal.Gamification:


Adding a bit of competitive edge to your goal setting can help wonders. Track calories, expenses, or keep a habit tracker. Give yourself rewards at milestones. If you can see the progress, it will keep you going!Try SHAPING your goals instead of making them SMART, and see if it makes a difference to your results.Related: The 10 Things You Must Do to Achieve Your Goals

51,6 Time-Saving Features on Hiring Platforms,"Feb 21, 2024",Entrepreneur Deals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/6-time-saving-features-on-hiring-platforms/468289,"
Attracting top-notch talent is a critical component of any successful organization, but the search can be expensive and time intensive. The good news is that hiring platforms have revolutionized hiring, making it easier and more efficient for recruiters to identify the ideal candidate.When you're ready to expand your team, consider these creative ways hiring platforms are making recruitment more accessible, efficient, and effective than ever before.1. AI-powered job matching.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized hiring platforms and job matching by analyzing job requirements and candidates' profiles. ZipRecruiter employs advanced AI algorithms that intelligently match job seekers with the most relevant job opportunities.



This feature reduces the time spent manually sorting through resumes and ensures that hiring managers connect with candidates with the right skills and experience for the job.2. One-click job posting.Time is of the essence when it comes to hiring, and ZipRecruiter understands this well. With its one-click job posting feature, recruiters can effortlessly broadcast job openings across multiple platforms, reaching a vast pool of potential candidates in a matter of seconds.


This seamless process eliminates the need for repetitive data entry, enabling recruiters to focus on more strategic aspects of the hiring process.3. Automated candidate screening.One of the most time-consuming aspects of recruitment is sifting through numerous resumes to identify qualified candidates. Hiring platforms now integrate automated screening tools that can analyze resumes and assess candidates based on predefined criteria. This significantly reduces the time spent on initial candidate evaluation.4. Mobile accessibility.As work environments become more flexible, recruiters need the ability to manage the hiring process on the go. Mobile accessibility features on hiring platforms enable recruiters to review resumes, communicate with candidates and track the progress of job openings from their mobile devices. This ensures that recruiters can stay productive and responsive, even when away from their desks.5. Video interviewing.Traditional face-to-face interviews can be logistically challenging, especially when dealing with candidates from different geographical locations. Video interviewing features on hiring platforms enable recruiters to conduct remote interviews, eliminating the need for travel and scheduling conflicts. This saves time and provides flexibility for both candidates and hiring teams.


6. Centralized Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).Keeping track of numerous applicants can be overwhelming without the right tools. ZipRecruiter's centralized ATS consolidates all candidate information in one place, making it easy for recruiters to manage applications, review resumes and collaborate with team members.This centralized approach enhances efficiency and ensures that no qualified candidate falls through the cracks.

52,"Incorporating This Simple Activity Into Your Daily Routine Can Boost Your Productivity, Creativity and Business","Feb 20, 2024",Georgi Todorov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-taking-daily-walks-have-enhanced-my-productivity-and/469343,"
After experiencing burnout in 2017 due to excessive work, I turned to daily long walks in nature as a form of recovery. This simple yet profound activity has since become an integral part of my routine, not only aiding in my personal health but also significantly benefiting my business.In this article, I'll share the most valuable insights I've gained from making daily walks a cornerstone of my lifestyle and how it has positively impacted my business.Now, I'll walk you through my six key takeaways on how incorporating daily walks has transformed not just my health, but the way I do business.Related: 3 Reasons Why Walking Boosts Creativity1. Generating ideasOne of the most transformative benefits of my daily walks has been the surge in creativity they've sparked, leading to some of my brightest ideas. For instance, the names of my two blogs, thrivemyway.com and createandgrow.com, were both conceived during these peaceful strolls. This phenomenon isn't just a personal experience; it's supported by research. A Stanford University study found that participants' creative output increased by an astonishing 60% while they were walking. This demonstrates that the simple act of taking a walk can be a powerful catalyst for generating ideas, even in the most unlikely settings.



2. Improvement of cognitive functionThat's our ability to clearly think, learn and remember. Beyond sparking creativity, daily walks significantly enhance cognitive function — our capacity to think clearly, learn new information and retain memories. Engaging in regular physical activity, such as walking, has been shown to increase blood flow to the brain, fostering neural growth and reducing the risk of cognitive decline as we age. This improvement in brain health is pivotal for entrepreneurs and business professionals, who rely on sharp cognitive abilities to make decisions, solve problems and innovate.Incorporating walking into your daily routine can thus be seen as an investment in your brain's long-term performance, ensuring that your mental faculties remain robust and agile, ready to tackle the challenges and opportunities that come your way.3. Vitamin D and productivityAdopting daily walking habits has significantly boosted my productivity in two distinct ways. Initially, the anticipation of my daily walks motivated me to complete tasks more efficiently, avoiding the tendency to stretch them out unnecessarily. More importantly, there's a scientific basis for this increase in productivity. Regular walking not only refreshes the mind but also enhances cognitive functions, allowing for quicker problem-solving and better task management. This habit has transformed how I approach my work, making my daily routine not just more structured but inherently more productive.This research shows that Vitamin D significantly affects work productivity. By studying over 10,000 healthcare workers, it found those with Vitamin D levels above 40 ng/mL were more productive than those below 20 ng/mL, who experienced lower energy, focus and ability to perform tasks. This highlights Vitamin D's importance for both physical and cognitive health at work.


Therefore, to boost productivity, it's essential to maintain adequate Vitamin D levels. Being outside even on a cloudy day can provide more Vitamin D than staying indoors and relying on sunlight through a window.Related: Here's How You Can Set a Healthy Walking Plan4. Creating a draft for an article (via voice-to-text)Creating articles represents one of the primary tasks to which I allocate my time. Indeed, the process of article writing becomes much simpler with a well-structured outline and a clear topic in mind. I've adopted the practice of using voice notes for sketching out article outlines. By hitting the record button, I dedicate five minutes to verbally outline all the elements I wish to cover in the article.It's quite remarkable to notice the seamless flow of thoughts and speech when you're moving, in stark contrast to the stumbling blocks encountered when sitting down.


5. Listening to audiobooks and podcastsIncorporating audiobooks and podcasts into my routine has been a transformative experience, particularly during my daily walks. This habit has allowed me to delve into a wide array of subjects, from business strategies to personal development, all while staying active. The beauty of audiobooks lies in their ability to turn walking time into a dual-purpose activity: Not only do I get the physical benefits of exercise, but I also engage my mind in learning and inspiration.6. Online meetingsI've always had a preference for in-person interactions, finding that, in many cases, online meetings could be efficiently replaced by an email or a brief Loom video. However, I acknowledge that this is a personal preference and understand that many people thrive on online meetings as their primary mode of communication and collaboration. To adapt and ensure I still work effectively, I began scheduling my online meetings during my walks outside. This adjustment has not only allowed me to maintain my walking routine but also engage in necessary digital interactions. With the advent of 5G technology, concerns about internet connectivity have become a thing of the past, making it seamlessly possible to connect and converse while enjoying the outdoors.Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Increase Their Flow and Boost Creativity and ProductivityIn conclusion, integrating daily walks into my routine has not only been a journey of personal health and creativity but also a strategic adaptation to enhance my business processes. From generating groundbreaking ideas and improving cognitive function to listening to audiobooks and business podcasts, and even reimagining the way I conduct online meetings — each step taken outdoors has contributed significantly to my professional success and well-being.

53,How Taking Up Boxing Transformed My Outlook on Entrepreneurship,"Feb 20, 2024",Sam Saideman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-lessons-i-learned-about-entrepreneurship-from-boxing/469096,"
If you pursue anything hard in life, you've likely dealt with sacrifice, whether that's a sacrifice of personal health, mental health, relationships, time or finances. Likely while chasing that goal, one or more of those things have suffered. When asked what surprised him most about humanity, the Dalai Lama said, ""Man. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health."" He goes on to get far more philosophical and far more depressing, but the above quote is a great testament to the power of chasing dreams without being mindful of what you need to not just survive, but thrive.Now, that's not to say making sacrifices in pursuit of goals isn't a good thing — it's usually necessary. But being intentional about what you're giving up for what you're trying to get is how one lives a life without regrets. This is something that has remained relevant in my daily work to become a better leader, and while I've grown over the years of running businesses and learned along the way, nothing has made me grow and learn more than getting in the ring.A little over a year ago, I was reconnecting with an old friend from college, and he mentioned his new fascination with boxing. I had been around it as a teenager with friends pursuing it, but it had never been something I actively took part in. He convinced me to go with him and retry it in my adulthood. New Year's resolution and all, I went, and the rest was history. That one day in Nashville's Fighters Boxing Gym hitting heavy bags sparked an obsession which has resulted in boxing becoming a large line item on my expenses, more than half my laundry and most of my personality.



Here are the three most important lessons I've learned so far from the squared circle.Related: Knockout Personal Branding Strategies From Mayweather and Pacquiao


1. Resiliency is mandatory for successWorking in a startup environment where every deal matters and sparring in boxing are more alike than you think. For one: You have to have thick skin. No matter how much we try to ""cut off the ring"" with better services and have the client ""on the ropes"" with making a purchase decision, sometimes the potential client changes their direction and hires someone else. Those punches, while they may not hurt as much if you focus on each individual hit, but over several rounds, they start to add up. Learning to keep fighting and not accept defeat is how you force the fight to a decision without getting KO'd. In other words, if you're not resilient and you didn't stumble on hidden treasure, you likely won't last long in business.As an entrepreneur of a startup that never took on investment, my back has been against the ropes more times than I can count. This key lesson of staying resilient and not taking ""no"" for an answer has allowed me to stay determined and motivate my team to develop new verticals without having to close shop or lay people off. I attribute my ability to pivot my company to offering influencer marketing campaigns to brands and musicians/labels in a large way to boxing. Staying adaptable and being unwilling to throw in the towel. Boxing took me there.2. Focused time spent learningFocusing on learning is necessary for all great battles. There are no cutting corners on this one. If you don't put the hours in, you won't prevail. That goes for the time in the ring or in the boardroom. You need to work on the basics of being a good leader as much as you need to work on the fundamentals in the gym. Muhammad Ali said, ""The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses — behind the lines, in the gym and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights."" Muhammad Ali would've been great in any profession. If you don't carve out uninterrupted time to improve, you won't improve.In my years as an entrepreneur, I've struggled to find uninterrupted time for growth. Digging into redlines, a client calls me. Working on a proposal, an employee asks me a question. Learning the importance of unavoidable ""offline"" time has made me more demanding of that in the workplace. I am now able to whiteboard, learn about new lanes or do whatever else I need to without compromising or being half distracted. If you're distracted while boxing, you'll feel it (literally). If you're distracted at work, you'll feel it differently — but both are equally detrimental to winning.

To be truly great, you need a great trainer and cut man, just like an entrepreneur needs great leaders within their business and advisors outside of their business. The people you surround yourself with in either realm must be people who can be supportive and are also not afraid to speak their minds when things need improving. I'm far deeper into my entrepreneurial journey than my boxing journey; however, the coaches I've spent my time learning from, hitting mitts with, and sparring at The Punch Club in Los Angeles and Fighters in Nashville, have been the same type of people I try to surround myself with in business. Don't be afraid to make changes if those people aren't the right fit.It's easy in the workplace to be okay with keeping things the way they are. Justifying actions that shouldn't be justified because of busyness. Boxing has taught me that every voice in the room can make or break winning or losing. It's helped me to be more proactive with making changes when things aren't working.So the next time you're exhausted, worried about staying on your feet and the bell rings — or the Google Calendar alarm dings — be ready to fight with everything you've got left. I know I will be.

54,"I Biohacked My Way to Better Mood, Sleep and Job Performance — and You Can, Too. Here's How.","Feb 16, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-biohack-your-way-to-better-mood-sleep-and/469058,"
I dipped one toe in the water and a sharp pain shot through my system. Knowing that I'd never be able to ease my way in, I quickly slid the rest of my body into the freezing cold water. I took slow, deep breaths — experts say this signals to your brain that ""I'm okay"" and prevents you from going into flight or flight mode. But as my mind ran circles around the physical sensations, I felt anything but okay.Then a funny thing happened: a minute passed, and it felt ever so slightly easier to stay in the water. Thirty seconds later, I emerged with a strange and surprisingly pleasant feeling of calm. I had survived my first cold plunge — and was already wondering when I'd do it again.Cold plunging is just one example of biohacking. A term borrowed from the ""tech hacker"" ethos, it's the science of tweaking your physiology and nervous system for optimal performance. Some types of biohacking may seem extreme, exhibitionist even — like when someone plunges a syringe in their hand to inject themselves with a genome-altering substance. But there are also more subtle techniques that anyone can start using today; that I have incorporated into my routine to perform my role as CEO of Jotform to the best of my body's ability — without losing my mind. Here is a closer look at some of those techniques, plus why I've become a believer in biohacking.

In 2018, The Pink Stuff was a relatively unknown cleaning product with a niche market, produced by Star Brands for only a few hours each month at a factory near Birmingham, England.That changed when Sophie Hinchliffe, an Essex, England-based hairdresser with a penchant for cleanliness, began sharing her home cleaning routine on her Instagram account, @mrshinchhome — eventually, soaring demand landed The Pink Stuff in 30,000 retailers worldwide, The New York Times reported.Related: 5 Tips to Help Curious Marketers Get Started on TikTok



Hinchliffe's practical and friendly cleaning advice, featuring The Pink Stuff, resonated with her audience on Instagram. Her followers, now 4.8 million strong, tuned in to watch grime disappear under the guidance of their relatable ""scrubber in chief."" And although Hinchliffe never made the jump to TikTok, Pink Stuff-related videos did and have been viewed more than 2 billion times, according to Star Brands.@myaa.nic Realistic bathroom clean ASMR #DoritosTriangleTryout #realisticcleaning #cleaningtiktok #cleantok #floorscrub #thepinkstuff #thepinkstuffcleaning #fullbathroomclean #realisticcleanwithme #showerscrub #cleaningasmr #spongesqueezingasmr #scrubbingasmr ♬ original sound - Myaa.nicCustomers eagerly awaited restocks, and soon Star Brands had to significantly ramp up production. Operations expanded to running three lines all day, doubling the workforce, and pushing international sales to new heights. Today, The Pink Stuff is sold in 55 countries and is available at major retailers like Walmart, Home Depot, and Amazon, where it retails for $4.99, with annual sales quadrupling since 2018 to about $125 million, per the NYT.The Pink Stuff joined an ever-growing list of products that have gained popularity on social media for their ability to offer viewers a ""life hack,"" often one that most people didn't even know they needed, such as desktop vacuum cleaners, car trash cans, or a stainless steel watermelon slicer, all of which found an audience on the platform, per Good Housekeeping.However, brands that rely on virality as their sole marketing strategy might find themselves in a tough spot when the novelty wears off and viewers move to the next big thing. Henrik Pade, a managing director at Star Brands, admitted to the NYT that The Pink Stuff's virality is ""a little scary"" because there isn't much control over messaging.Related: TikTok Is the New Normal. 5 Reasons to Add TikTok to Your Content Marketing StrategyMarina Cooley, a marketing professor at Emory University, told the outlet that brands should focus on loyalty for a more sustainable approach.""It doesn't sound like there's an adult in the room, steering the cult,"" she said of Star Brands.

When people talk about retirement, typically, they're referring to a linear path: Go as far as you can in your career, turn a certain age and leave the professional world for good. It might be the traditional model, but these days, it doesn't work for everyone — for several reasons.More than half (56%) of American workers believe they're behind on their retirement savings, according to a recent Bankrate survey. Meanwhile, since the beginning of 2020, prices of everyday goods and services have increased about as much as they did in the full decade prior to the pandemic, per Bloomberg.Related: This Is the Key to the Retiree Lifestyle You Want — and the Income You Need

58,Zoning Out During Your Commute and Other 'In-Between' Times Is Actually Making You Less Happy,"Feb 12, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-maximize-your-commute-for-a-productive-day/468152,"
I used to think of my commute as an opportunity to fully disconnect — to do anything but work. I'd listen to music or podcasts or get my daily social media fix. I'd look out the window and daydream. Then, upon arriving at the office, I'd put on my productive work hat. The trouble was that there was no easy transition between the two mindscapes.We often think of commuting and other ""in-between"" hours as dead zones that we can fill with leisurely activity, but, according to 2019 Harvard Business School research, doing purely pleasurable things on the way to the office actually makes it harder to transition into work mode and may ultimately leave you feeling gloomy about your job — and even more likely to quit!In my role as CEO of Jotform, I've taken this data to heart, and come up with something of a life hack. Today, I treat those buffer zones as, at least ideally, akin to easing into a hot bath rather than plunging into a cold pool and have been witness to resulting differences in motivation and productivity.

      Key Takeaways

        Within six months, he was seeing consistent monthly revenue, then opted to take the business full-time. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Sina Omosowon, founder of the TV-mounting business Shine.Image Credit: Courtesy of Shine. Sina Omosowon. When did you start your side hustle, and what inspired it?



I started my TV-mounting business, Shine, in 2019. I originally started the business as a side hustle to help put myself through school and support my family. At the time, I was earning my Ph.D. in plant evolution, focusing on food crop production and crop improvement. A friend of mine introduced me to TV mounting and showed me there was a growing demand in this space, particularly as more people chose to mount TVs on their walls versus using a stand to help create more space in their homes. I saw an opportunity to make extra money through TV mounting, so I got trained on the basics and started to build out a business from there. My business ultimately helped me pay for school and finish my Ph.D. with no debt.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a MonthWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?After being introduced to TV mounting, I got trained on the basics and shadowed a friend on a few of his jobs. From there, I tried to consume as much information as I could to learn and grow a base of knowledge, watching a lot of YouTube videos and asking questions. As I continued to complete more and more jobs, my confidence grew.When I first started out, it was important to grow awareness of my business and build trust with customers. Without reviews or much experience, I often got customers by giving discounts on jobs. I also learned the importance of being responsive and getting back to customers quickly. I always had my phone on me so that when a request came in, I was able to quickly answer any questions and schedule an appointment.In addition to word-of-mouth, I registered as a pro on Thumbtack, which helped me find customers in my area who needed my services. It was a great place to build out a profile with reviews and photos from completed jobs so potential customers could learn more about me and my business. As I completed more jobs and built up a bank of positive reviews, it became easier to get more clients. Especially as a young entrepreneur, positive reviews help people trust you and give them confidence that you'll do a good job. I now have nearly 1,000 five-star reviews.


I started out doing around two to three jobs a day, and these jobs took more time as I learned different nuances and built up my confidence. Steadily, I started getting more and more customers and became even more efficient at TV mounting, which allowed me to serve more people in a day. Today I can mount a TV in 15 minutes.Related: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWere there any challenges that came with running your side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those?One of my biggest challenges initially was having to spend money upfront to get my business off the ground, whether that's purchasing all the tools or giving customers discounts on jobs to build up a client roster. This initial investment was important, particularly because it's crucial to have the right equipment for jobs requiring construction. Luckily, I was able to recoup the money I spent upfront after a few months of work.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? I started seeing consistent monthly revenue about six months after I started. After getting my Ph.D., I received job offers in the plant science space, but my business was also taking off, so I had to weigh my options. It's always been my dream to be my own boss, so I decided to invest in my TV mounting business and take the entrepreneurial path.How much average monthly revenue do you earn now? I earn about $30,000 per month through my TV-mounting business.You've since turned your side hustle into a full-time business. What do you enjoy most about it?Owning my own business lets me control how I spend my time. I can schedule jobs around family commitments and decide when to work and when not to work. I also really enjoy interacting with people on a daily basis and putting a smile on their faces with a job well done. There's a lot of satisfaction in owning your own business.Related: 3 Secrets to Starting a High-Income Side Hustle in 2024, According to People Whose Gigs Make More Than $20,000 a MonthDo you have any advice for others interested in this gig? What should they know before they get started?


My biggest piece of advice for anyone interested in being an entrepreneur is to make customer satisfaction a priority. When you're just starting out, money should not be the priority. It's more important to satisfy the customer, get good reviews and build up a strong client base who can refer you to friends and family. With consistency and steadfastness, the money will come. Prioritize customer satisfaction, and everything will fall into place.

      Key Takeaways    



        A Georgia-based millennial is earning over $250,000 a year secretly working two remote jobs.
      


        He said his childhood made him want financial security and that overemployment provides him job security.
      


        The IT professional shared his four pieces of advice for overemployed workers.

A Georgia millennial says a desire for financial security motivated him to work multiple jobs in secret. Worker in the story not pictured.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Tomas, a Georgia-based IT worker in his 30s, said his journey to an ""overemployed"" lifestyle began at a very young age.He grew up ""very poor,"" he told Business Insider, and after his mother left his father, he, his mother, and four siblings shared a one-room apartment for two years.



""As I got older I was like, 'I don't want to live like that,"" he said.In 2016, when Tomas had roughly $40,000 in credit card debt and was struggling to pay child support, he decided to look for a second remote job he could work on the sly. Two years later, job juggling had helped him pay off his debt, but he wasn't ready to give it up.


""I kind of felt invincible, and it made me feel like that will be one less thing I have to worry about in life,"" said Tomas, whose identity is known to BI but has been withheld due to his fear of professional repercussions.To this day, Tomas is secretly working two full-time remote jobs that pay over $250,000 a year in combined salaries, according to documents viewed by BI. Doing so has helped him grow his net worth to over $500,000, pay off two new cars, travel more, and find ""financial stability and freedom,"" he said. Tomas added that he'd love to have a third job if he can find the right fit.Tomas is among a small group of U.S. workers — many in the tech and IT industries — secretly holding multiple remote jobs. Working more than one job at once may not violate federal or state laws, but it could breach some employment contracts and be a fireable offense if a worker is ever found out.As layoffs have spread across the tech industry, Tomas said the extra job security that comes with overemployment has become even more important. He's even encouraged some colleagues to look for second jobs and provided advice on pulling it off.


""Companies will terminate you or lay you off without any notice at all,"" he said. ""I now have the belief that everyone should always keep two jobs.""Finding the right job for over-employment isn't easyTomas has had several different stints as an overemployed worker.Roughly a year after he began his overemployment, he decided to take a break. He said one of his jobs became much more demanding and that he wanted to adjust to the workload before he took on a second job again.Additionally, throughout this career, Tomas has worked a mix of full-time and contract jobs, and the latter have typically had an expiration date.


As pandemic fears have eased in recent years, Tomas said he's also worked for companies that required employees to return to the office. Given working remotely was key to his overemployment, he decided to part ways with those employers.These job separations are the main reason Tomas has had roughly seven different jobs since 2017. While he's generally had no more than two jobs at once, he said there were three to four months when he had three jobs — and one month when he had four. All but one of his jobs were remote — he said flexible working hours enabled him to juggle a hybrid and remote role for a while.At his peak, Tomas said he earned close to $400,000 across his jobs in a single year.Four pieces of advice for over-employed workersTomas has four suggestions for people interested in the over-employed lifestyle.


First: Know your job well so you can complete tasks quickly and dedicate time to your other jobs. Second: Figure out which job has more flexibility so you can reschedule those meetings if need be. Third: To appear constantly online for a job, don't rely on mouse jigglers — he said he thinks some IT departments can figure out when workers are using the latter. Fourth: If you think your boss is suspicious of you, it's probably time to leave that job.Tomas said job juggling has been fairly easy in his two current roles. Both jobs have flexible hours, and his shifts start at different times of the day — with only three hours of overlap between them. He said he's only had one or two overlapping meetings that have required him to come up with an excuse for missing one of them.But during a prior overemployment stint, Tomas said he had a boss who seemed to suspect he was job juggling — asking questions like why he was online well past working hours. When these questions didn't go away, Tomas decided to leave the job.Unless he finds one job that pays him over $250,000 a year, roughly his current combined salaries, Tomas said he has no plans to give up his overemployment.""I'm going to keep going as long as I can,"" he said, adding, ""The rewards definitely outweigh the labor.""

61,"The Hidden Cost of Distractions, and How to Short-Circuit Them","Feb 8, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-cost-of-distractions-and-how-to-short-circuit-them/467840,"
On a Saturday afternoon in December, I was working on a puzzle with one of my sons. Every so often, he would get up, walk to the kitchen, open the cabinet and come back with a handful of pretzels. Upon returning, it would take him a few minutes to remember which section he was working on and which type of piece he was hunting for. Eventually, I poured some snacks into a bowl and brought them over.That puzzle got me thinking about attention and its effect on productivity. We can likely all agree that work happens better and more efficiently when our focus is concentrated on one task and isn't hampered by distractions. Intuitively, that makes sense, but in today's increasingly digital world, most of us tend to work like my hungry son — letting our minds wander whenever we're ""hungry,"" and not realizing the cognitive cost of task switching. What we need in response is a kind of life hack.As CEO of Jotform, I'm no stranger to the incessant buzz of notifications (whether emails, social media platform messages or other prompts), and I have learned that it requires more than a New Year's resolution to quiet them: it takes a concerted effort, and only truly works when done in conjunction with my team members. Happily, that process has produced strategies that I'm convinced can help others, but it's worthwhile, first, to take a closer look at what we lose every time we change what we're doing.



Related: 6 Common Reasons You Can't Get Anything Done at Work — And How to Change ThatThe costs of task-switchingAs intelligent as we think we are, our minds are simply not designed to follow multiple trains of thought simultaneously. Professor Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explained to The Guardian in 2022 that humans, in fact, are very single-minded, and with somewhat limited cognitive capacity. In reality, the human brain can only produce one or two thoughts at a time.


Put simply, multitasking (aka ""task switching"") — rapidly jumping from one endeavor to the next — comes at a cost. Computer scientist and author Cal Newport perhaps put it best when he observed that, ""Even negligible context shifts (switching focus from the task at hand to a different [one]) are productivity poison.""Time is the most obvious casualty, and you might be losing more than you realize. Gloria Mark, of the University of California, Irvine, detailed in a 2006 Gallup article that the average amount of time people spent on any single event before being interrupted or before switching was about three minutes. More shocking still was the revelation that it required an average of 23 minutes to return to the original task. (It's worth noting, too, that this research is more than 15 years old, and that digital tools and their inherent distractions have since become even more ingrained in our lives.)Related: Are You Wasting Your Time? The Multi-Venture Entrepreneur's Guide to Time ManagementBut even if a distraction doesn't cost you time — if you're somehow able to get back on track after reading that email or glancing at the DM — you'll likely work with greater stress and frustration. That's what Mark found in an empirical study of university students, conducted in conjunction with Berlin's Humboldt University Institute of Psychology.


Yet another cost of task-switching is performance, or as one Carnegie Mellon researcher memorably (if bluntly) put it, ""the distraction of an interruption [instant message while performing a cognitive test], combined with the brain drain of preparing for that interruption, made our test takers 20 percent dumber.""Adding an interesting twist to the research was that participants who were warned of a looming interruption, even one that never came, improved their performance by 43%. So, preparing for distractions and training to work through them can make the mind sharper.Related: 5 New Products That Help You Avoid Distractions at WorkTechniques for staying focusedShutting off notifications and putting away devices seems like an obvious and effective start advice, but it also runs counter to the collaborative nature of work today.


As Newport told the New York Times in 2023: ""I can't… log off the New York Times Slack channel and make myself more productive, because everyone else is using that as the way for coordinating work, and so we're all stuck there. The only way to get out of that suboptimal equilibrium is to completely change the way the organization collaborates.""Managers and execs, therefore, must make a coordinated effort to implement practices that allow for disconnection when people want to work without distraction, and they can do their part by setting an example. At Jotform, my team knows that I'm unavailable outside of regular office hours except for emergencies. They can email me at any hour, but with the knowledge that I likely won't read it until the morning. You could say that we practice an informal version of France's 2016 right to disconnect legislation (with versions passed in Spain, Italy, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the Philippines since then), which states in part that no one is prohibited from contacting colleagues outside of normal work hours, but no one will be sanctioned for not replying either.The takeaway here is that office hours are a great idea, and you don't have to be a college professor to implement them. Just as I schedule time for uninterrupted, creative work, I carve out an hour or so each day for calls and last-minute meetings. Colleagues can check my calendar and send requests during this designated time. In the morning, when I map out the day, I try to group busy work (like reviewing invoices, replying to emails and scheduling meetings) and tackle it during office hours.Related: 5 Ways to Decrease Interruptions and Increase Productivity


Getting sidetracked by distractions is almost unavoidable now: Algorithms are continually improving and designed to both steal attention and keep it. But take heart: even if you lose focus, it's possible to get back on track. That effort can even help boost productivity, albeit with a bit more stress. The key is preparing yourself for interruptions and minimizing them to the extent possible. By grouping the work that requires short spans of focus, we can leave larger swaths of time for more meaningful work — tasks that fill you up in terms of purpose and pride.

63,Fear Can Hold Us Back – But It Can Also Drive Us Forward. Here's How to Turn Fear Into Fuel.,"Feb 6, 2024",Mohammad Farraj,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/fear-can-hold-us-back-but-it-can-also-drive-us-forward/468284,"
Fear is one of the most natural emotions. In fact, according to Medical News Today, ""The fear response has kept us alive. It is primal, and we should respect it. At the same time, it can be unpleasant and interfere with people's day-to-day functioning.""It often holds entrepreneurs back from pursuing their dreams and ambitions — according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 75% of all ventures fail within their first decade. However, fear should not be the reason that any business fails. Fear can be rooted in a combination of stress and anxiety, which can become a serious mental health issue.To overcome the stress of fears and find success, detach emotions from decision-making. Be rational and focused when choosing a business and planning for success. Though challenging, my experience in starting a business offers insights. Confidence in tasks eases stress. As a new restaurateur, immersing myself in business tasks boosted my confidence and expanded my skills — and it can help you, too.



Related: 11 Fears Every Entrepreneur Must OvercomeHow I balance work and lifeI recall hearing a folk song from the '60s that said, ""Our life is more than our work, and our work is more than our job."" That is exponentially true for me, as the co-founder of a restaurant franchise, as a physician and as a husband and father.


It is important to separate all of our several ""selves,"" compartmentalize them and give each of them the attention they deserve, while attending to the needs and desires of those we care about: our spouses, children, colleagues and in my case, the co-founder of my business.Here are three ways I compartmentalize:When you are at work, be focused on work — request that family and friends only communicate when there's an emergency during work time. The new iPhone voicemail screening feature can help you avoid distracting interruptions.When you are at home, be present with your family — that might mean no devices at the dinner table.When you are out with friends, be a friend — listen, share and enjoy their company.One of the most challenging periods of my entrepreneurial journey was in the early days of launching my food truck, while simultaneously pursuing my degree in dental school and caring for my family.The truck had just begun gaining some traction in the local community. Juggling truck responsibilities, dental exams and family life was challenging. Balancing fresh ingredients, academic deadlines and family time felt like a daily tightrope walk. Despite the difficulty in compartmentalizing tasks, focusing on achieving balance allowed me to succeed. It's normal to feel you could have done more, no matter how hard you try to fulfill all duties.

Technology Is Sucking Your Time Away from Your Success Putting the ""I"" in teamChances are, if you started a business, you began by identifying your personal strengths and weaknesses and assigned yourself a role in the organization chart for your new business that you had confidence you can master.

Getting help when fear of failure becomes anxietyThe three fears all new entrepreneurs share are:Fear of financial lossFear of failureFear of the unknownIn launching my franchise restaurant, I conquered financial fear by investing only what I could afford to lose. Despite the daunting prospect of using my personal credit card amid student loan pressures, clear vision and strategic planning allowed me to decide confidently. Alternatively, you can explore options like applying for a small business loan, providing a lump sum to be repaid over time.There are three basic ways to combat the generic fear of failure all entrepreneurs face:Get real: Confronting failure as a very real possibility is the way to avoid it. What we did was identify all possible causes that could lead failure, then reverse-engineered them — that means do what needs to be done by understanding exactly what not to do.Make a plan: A comprehensive, well-structured plan can instill confidence and help mitigate fears by outlining strategies and contingencies. For example, my goals as chief marketing officer included innovating our social media and furthering its growth to increase our audience reach. I looked to improve our Google metrics.Ask around: Seek guidance from mentors, advisors or experienced entrepreneurs. Start with your current network first. While I had brothers and a father who have started and ran successful business, I would never hesitate to ask for advice and help. Reach out to the local chapters of SCORE, the SBA or your chamber of commerce. Related: Getting Over the Fear of Being an Entrepreneur


The key to overcoming fear in starting a new business is to recognize that while fear can hold us back, it can also drive us forward. Research has shown that fear of failure can also motivate greater striving for success. However, combatting the more serious mental health challenges of entrepreneurial stress requires emotional fortitude and often, professional help.

64,"'Benign Neglect' Is a Parenting Style That Makes Children More Confident, Experts Say — Here's How to Do It Right","Feb 6, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-use-benign-neglect-to-raise-happy-confident-children/468819,"
Many people are familiar with the term ""helicopter parenting,"" where parents become over-involved with their children's lives in an attempt to ensure their safety and success. However, over-controlling parents might be doing their kids more harm than good, depriving them of the ability to navigate challenges and professional environments as they enter adulthood, according to research from the American Psychological Association.So, what's the alternative for parents who want to set children up for the best possible outcome? Enter ""benign neglect"" — a parenting style that nurtures independence in children. It's essentially ""the opposite of 'helicopter parenting,'"" as the ""hands-off approach"" gives kids ""the space to identify, leverage and gain confidence in their strengths,"" Gigi Schweikert, who has more than 30 years of experience in early childhood education and is CEO of Lightbridge Academy, tells Entrepreneur.Related: 4 Signs That Your Workplace Millennials Are Turning You Into a Helicopter Boss

65,Introverts and Extroverts Both Need Solitude to Do Their Best Work. Here's Why — and How to Give it to Them.,"Feb 5, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-power-of-solitude-for-introverts-and-extroverts/466894,"
History tends to mythologize entrepreneurial names in the tech world. We attribute to them black-and-white lifestyle characteristics, with very little room for gray. For example, Steve Jobs was a charismatic and publicly engaged leader, while Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak was an introvert who preferred working in solitude.It's easy to invest in these caricatures, and then inquire as to which camp you belong. Are you an extrovert and a born leader, or a lone wolf better suited to behind the scenes? Do you need to find your ideally complementary co-founder, or is it better to strike out on your own?Before launching Jotform, I worried about whether I had the personality to lead a company. I knew there was a track record of being a proven web developer, but I didn't know if I had the right attributes to be a CEO — to execute the necessary strategic work and successfully communicate a vision. I launched anyway, and 17 years later have discovered that, in pursuit of the right company culture, working in solitude versus a team setting — introversion versus extroversion — is a nuanced affair. I've observed that people seek solitude for various reasons, and that understanding these motivations helped me better appreciate the overall wellness, creative and leadership benefits that can flow from working solo.

66,A Japanese Wellness Technique Could Be the CEO's Secret to Health and Productivity,"Jan 31, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-science-behind-forest-bathings-productivity-benefits/466427,"
In Walden, Henry David Thoreau observed that ""We can never have enough of nature,"" and one of the things I love about working at Jotform's San Francisco headquarters is how accessible nature is. I can take a quick bike ride to a handful of beaches, as well as a pier crowded with sea lions. If I feel like hiking, tall peaks beckon in just about every direction. If I drive about a half-hour north, I can reach Muir Woods National Park, which is more than 550 acres of dense forest. That last spot, in particular, is perfect for what's termed ""forest bathing,"" which, along with morning sweat sessions and power napping, helps me play a longer, happier, more productive and healthier game as an entrepreneur.First term-conceptualized in Japan in the 1980s, forest bathing (shinrin-yoku) was the product of a government campaign to encourage people to find respite from then-rampant tech-boom burnout by taking advantage of the country's extensive protected forests. The idea was, and is, to immerse oneself in the woods and absorb its surroundings using all five senses — to see the trees and take in their colossal magnitude, as well as smell the leaves, listen to the natural sounds, feel the fresh air and taste foraged goods (with an appropriate eye on safety).Related: 7 Reasons the CEO Should Get Outside to Exercise

Q: I feel like work is overtaking my life. I know I'm supposed to ""create boundaries,"" but how? — Jamie, HoustonIf you're feeling stressed, ask yourself this question: ""What activities make me feel happier and more at ease?""Whatever your answers are, those are your nonnegotiables. Please draw boundaries around them. No amount of work or obligation should encroach upon them, because then you won't have the energy or focus to fulfill your work and obligations. For me, my nonnegotiables are my early morning exercise, a long Sunday morning walk with my husband, and the one specific work objective I identify each day.

68,These Invisible Energy-Draining Habits Are Making You — And Your Team — Less Productive,"Jan 29, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/these-invisible-energy-draining-habits-are-making-you-less/465812,"
The pandemic brought about sweeping changes in the workplace. One of the most counterintuitive findings was that for many companies, productivity soared. But in 2022, some of those companies were equally stumped when productivity plunged. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022 saw the sharpest decline in productivity since 1947.While the reason for the drop wasn't obvious, one thing's for sure: For leaders, assigning personal blame isn't the best approach. It causes panic and kills morale. It certainly doesn't motivate employees to get working. A better approach is to roll up your sleeves, identify the obstacles, and figure out how to overcome them together.As CEO of Jotform, I've learned that the most significant productivity drains aren't coffee breaks or social media scrolling. They're often the habits that go unseen. Here are some ways that I navigate invisible energy drains with my team.

70,Bridging the Gap: How AI Can Revolutionize Employee Communications,"Jan 24, 2024",John Hall,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/bridging-the-gap-how-ai-can-revolutionize-employee/468744,"
Make no mistake about it — the lifeblood of any organization is communication. You can think of it as the invisible thread that ties teams, ideas, and success together. However, effective communication remains a constant challenge in today’s hyper-connected world. With siloed departments and geographical barriers, information overload can deter productivity, damage trust, and disengage employees.This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) can make all the difference in the world.The use of artificial intelligence in employee communication is no longer confined to science fiction. Whether it is intelligent chatbots or personalized feedback platforms, AI tools are emerging as powerful allies in building a culture of open communication and collaboration.



In fact, McKinsey & Company found that nearly one-quarter of surveyed C-suite executives are using gen AI tools personally, and more than one-quarter of respondents from companies that use AI say that gen AI is already on their boards’ agendas. In addition, 40% of respondents said their organizations will invest more in AI overall due to advances in generational AI.As such, let’s explore some key ways AI transforms communication within organizations.


1. Dismantling the silos of communication.Suppose employees across departments, geographical boundaries, and even different time zones could seamlessly exchange information and collaborate. With AI-powered communication platforms, this is completely feasible. Several examples include translating languages automatically, summarizing complex documents, and displaying real-time information.An example might be a marketing group brainstorming with a product development team in a virtual space, translating ideas in real-time, and highlighting key points. The use of AI-driven collaboration tools fosters cross-functional synergy and breaks down silos that hinder innovation.Basically, AI can make communication between individuals and teams easier.2. Improved engagement through personalized communication.Employee communication can be challenging because it must address the needs and preferences of each individual. With AI, communication can be personalized in ways never before possible by analyzing vast amounts of data. In addition to tailoring content based on individual learning styles, AI can suggest relevant content based on past interactions.


In other words, AI tailors information to the interests and preferences of every employee. Using AI-powered platforms, employers can deliver relevant news, announcements, and training materials based on employee data, including job titles, locations, and past interactions.Remember, the key to employee engagement is making them feel valued and included.3. Boost efficiency and eliminate bottlenecks.It’s no secret that emails and meetings eat up precious work time. A Microsoft study found that employees spend (and waste) 8.8 hours a week checking, filing, and writing e-mails. In other words, that’s over 20% of the typical workweek trapped in your inbox.A chatbot powered by artificial intelligence can schedule meetings, answer basic questions, and provide instant updates. As a result, employees are freed up to focus on strategic projects, cultivating an environment of efficiency and increasing productivity.


What if employees could ask a virtual assistant to find the latest project document, book a meeting room, or get a quick summary of a relevant policy? If so, you’ll no longer need to search through shared drives or endless email chains. With artificial intelligence, everyone can stay on the same page and focus on what matters most.4. Creating a barrier-free environment.Communication is effective when it is inclusive and accessible. The problem is that language barriers, time zone differences, and varying communication styles often fragment the modern workforce. AI serves as a powerful equalizer.With conversational AI assistants, it is possible to translate languages on the fly, allowing for real-time collaboration across borders. Also, summaries and transcripts of all meetings are generated automatically, regardless of location or schedule. Using sentiment analysis tools, you can decipher email tone and avoid misunderstandings.5. Micro-targeting and segmentation.In the same way that marketers target specific demographics, AI can segment employees based on their characteristics and preferences. By micro-targeting messages, the right information can be delivered at the right time to the right audience.


For example, a targeted campaign on an internal communication platform could promote product launches or training opportunities relevant to a specific team.6. Chatbots and virtual assistants.Have you ever had trouble navigating company policies or finding specific information? Chatbots powered by AI and virtual assistants can act as digital concierges, providing real-time support to employees.By doing so, HR teams are less dependent on employees and employees are more able to find information quickly and efficiently.7. Real-time feedback and insights.It’s no longer necessary to wait for annual surveys or employee exit interviews. With AI-powered sentiment analysis tools, you can monitor employee communication channels, social media platforms, and even internal emails to identify potential issues before they get out of hand.


As a result of this proactive approach, we can intervene and correct course promptly, resulting in happier and more productive workers.8. Democratizing communication.Bridging the communication gap between management and employees is one of the biggest challenges organizations face. Using top-down approaches leaves people feeling unheard and uninformed. Low morale can result from this.To bridge this gap, AI can:
Facilitating two-way dialogue. In addition to answering employee questions, addressing concerns, and providing feedback channels, chatbots and virtual assistants can serve as 24/7 information hubs. As a result of this continuous engagement, a sense of connection and responsiveness is fostered.
Empowering employee voices. Using sentiment analysis tools powered by artificial intelligence, companies can determine how their employees respond to news, policies, and initiatives. Organizations can use this feedback loop to understand employee concerns and adjust communication strategies.
9. Content creation and curation. A major benefit of AI for professionals may be the creation of content. AI algorithms can generate content like writing internal blog posts, updating social media, or creating email templates. Additionally, it’s an excellent tool for writing headlines or simply generating ideas.


Overall, the blank page dilemma is, thankfully, history. In addition to curating relevant content from a variety of sources, AI can suggest articles, videos, and other resources based on the interests and roles of employees.10. Focus group summaries and sentiment analysis.“We have discovered that using very specific prompts when working with generative AI can synthesize focus group and workshop transcripts to provide an alternative look at the information provided in those sessions,” said Joel DiGirolamo, vice president of research and data science at the International Coaching Federation.This, he explained, “provides an inexpensive way to ensure we are mining those sessions thoroughly, which can help to formulate conclusions and related communications.”It is possible to gauge employee feelings and perceptions by using sentiment analysis.


11. Data-driven communication strategies.Gut-feeling communication decisions have gone the way of the dodo. To understand what works and what doesn’t, companies can use artificial intelligence to analyze employee engagement metrics and communication channel usage.In addition to improving communication strategies, this data-driven approach ensures employers reach their employees effectively.12. Microlearning and on-demand training.One-size-fits-all training programs are no longer the norm. A platform powered by artificial intelligence can customize learning paths based on each individual’s skills gaps, learning style preferences, and needs.Using microlearning, employees can access bite-sized training modules on demand, at their own pace, and in the format they prefer, increasing knowledge retention and performance.


The Future of Communication is NowAI’s role in employee communication will become increasingly transformative as it evolves. AI-powered coaching tools can provide individuals with feedback and development plans tailored to their needs.For instance, as a new hire enters the onboarding process, imagine virtual mentors available to guide and answer their questions. Using AI as a dynamic communication partner, employees will feel connected, informed, and empowered at work because AI constantly learns and adapts.It takes a strategic approach to implement AI-powered communication; it isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. To succeed, you must plan carefully, pay attention to ethical considerations, and commit to ongoing learning. With AI integrated into our workplace culture, we can bridge the communication gap, foster a thriving workplace culture, and unleash the full potential of our teams.FAQsWhat are the benefits of using AI for employee communication?When used for employee communication, AI offers many benefits, including:



Improved communication clarity and effectiveness. You can create clear, concise, and easy-to-understand messages using artificial intelligence.
Increased employee engagement. A personalized and relevant communication strategy can increase employee engagement and satisfaction.
Reduced communication costs. Many communication tasks can be automated with artificial intelligence, saving both time and money.
Improved decision-making. Communication strategies can be optimized using AI-driven data insights.
Enhanced employee experience. Artificial intelligence can enhance the employee experience by making it more personalized and engaging.
What are some of the challenges of using AI for employee communication?At the same time, using AI for employee communication presents some challenges, including:
Bias. Algorithms used in AI can be biased, so AI tools should be used ethically and fairly.
Job displacement. It may be possible for AI tools to automate tasks currently carried out by humans, resulting in the displacement of jobs.
Privacy concerns. For AI models to be trained, employee data must be protected.
Overreliance on AI. The purpose of artificial intelligence is not to replace the need for human interaction but to use it as a tool.
Are there any specific AI tools that can be used for employee communication?Vital employee communicationDepending on your specific requirements and budget, various AI tools are available for employee communication. As an example, With Calendar, for instance, scheduling becomes automatic, eliminating back-and-forth emails to find the perfect time. Furthermore, it handles availability across time zones.Here are a few other popular options:



Generative AI tools. Creating personalized content with these tools, such as training materials, emails, and presentations, is possible. A few examples are ChatGPT and Jasper.
AI-powered search tools. In addition to providing access to company knowledge bases, these tools also help employees find the information they need more quickly within the company. Coveo and Lucidworks are two examples.
Sentiment analysis tools. Using these tools, managers can analyze employee communications to understand their overall sentiment and identify opportunities for improvement. In addition to Lexalytics, Medallia is another example.
Translation tools. You can use these tools to translate documents, presentations, and messages automatically. DeepL and Google Translate are two examples.
How can I get started with using AI for employee communication?AI can be used for employee communication in several ways:
Identify your communication challenges. Are there any specific areas where AI could help employees communicate more effectively?
Research available tools. You can find many AI tools on the market. As such, do some research and choose the one that’s right for you.

71,Forget Everything You've Heard About Multitasking. Here's How to Juggle a Busy Day and Still Make Time for Meaningful Work.,"Jan 24, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-juggle-tasks-while-making-time-for-meaningful-work/466104,"
The morning I decided to write this article, I sat at my desk at Jotform and opened a Google document in one browser, then used another to queue up an email for later that day. While I waited for the latter to schedule (there's usually a short lag), I popped into a calendar app and blocked out a couple of hours to focus on writing, and also updated an appointment with my trainer. Then, still riding an early morning motivational high, I silenced my devices and got to work.It's fitting, I thought at the time, that I was multitasking to prepare myself to write an article about that very thing. Today, the act of undertaking and balancing a variety of tasks simultaneously is increasingly considered to actually be bad for productivity, but I think the truth is more nuanced. After all, it's entirely natural to focus on two things at once. Animals — from fish and octopuses to monkeys and pigeons — are multitaskers. Research from Ruhr-Universitaet-Bochum in Germany has found, in fact, that pigeons do it even better than humans.There may be a fine line between accomplishing several things simultaneously and being overcome by distractions, but in my experience, it's possible to embrace both the benefits of multitasking and the importance of dedicating undivided attention to meaningful work — what I like to term ""the big stuff.""

72,What Are You Wasting Your Business Time On?,"Jan 23, 2024",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/what-are-you-wasting-your-business-time-on/467364,"
You're probably wasting time. But you're not alone. About one-third of entrepreneurs spend their time on activities that don't directly affect their bottom line. Some of this time is spent on things like ordering supplies, but it also includes important tasks such as invoicing.One of the business world's biggest time thieves is email. Do you start your day with email, reading and responding to what looks important, then get distracted? Then new email arrives and you just keep going, maybe multiple times all day. According to Microsoft, heavy users of email can spend 8.8 hours a week lost in email land.Then you may find yourself batting at a flurry of tasks, from producing a replacement 1099 form for an independent contractor who showed up at your doorstep unexpectedly to finding the invoice for a payment to a vendor due yesterday.



The reasons the business day can seem like a kindergarten field trip gone wrong include inadequate planning and a lack of systems to organize time and tasks. Not planning ahead can lead to an inefficient workflow.Related: 11 Ways You're Wasting Time Instead of Doing What You Need to be SuccessfulSome examples?You can't keep your bank account full if you don't invoice clients and collect on those invoices.If a home contracting job requires a government inspector's approval before you can start, don't wait to call the morning you want to start. If that job requires your license and bonding information, it should be easy to produce.If you can't find the right version of a document — whether it's the latest living room plan for an interior designer, or the payments made against a large job — can lead to squandered time most businesses can't afford to lose.


Procrastination is the ultimate waste of time. This can be a problem in two ways. You can proactively put things off until later (when you can ""concentrate better"" or your ""schedule is clear""), or you can find yourself fighting to stay ahead of your work, in which case it's easy to neglect these tasks.The power of organizationBusinesses use multiple methods of organization. Any method will be better than none. See which one of these makes most sense for you, then investigate further:Process-oriented structure. Note what you do and document your process for doing it, then review periodically. Provides efficiency.Quality management. Measure what you do. The best-known process for quality management is called Six Sigma, which is composed of defining, measuring, analyzing, improving and controlling (DMAIC).Customer-centric organization. Build your processes to support your customer.In The E-Myth – Why Most Businesses Don't Work And What To Do About It, Michael E. Gerber argued that businesses are started by people who know the technical aspects of the business, but not necessarily how to operate a business. For them, he argued that manuals describing processes are the best tools. Systematizing what you do makes the process smoother. And, when you grow, you can actually hand your manual to someone else who can do things the way you want them done.Related: 6 Essential Time Savers for Overworked Young Entrepreneurs


Successful organizational practicesSince the beginning of commerce, businesses have organized their documentation by segregating, categorizing and sub-dividing necessary documents. This provided an easy-to-remember way to access and share them. Scrolls and ledgers were the first ways to store needed information. Old-school methods like file folders and file cabinets were so successful that they form the basis for how we interact with computers today.As the digital world has evolved, it has provided new tools that are faster and more accurate. Document management systems (DMS) capture key data and store it in the cloud to work with later, wherever you are. Similarly, accounting platforms exist that invoice customers, pay bills, generate reports and prepare taxes. There are tax preparation suites that use the data you enter to file your taxes electronically.The IRS now accepts digital documentation, so you can keep your business-related invoices, receipts and the like in a specific file folder on your computer hard drive, external physical storage such as a thumb drive, or a cloud drive. The most helpful way to organize your data is probably to store expenses based on the items on IRS Schedule C — but any method that makes it easy to find what you need when you need it should be fine.Getting startedJust like starting any other enterprise, the way to get started is to get started.


Identify your problems. Make note of the behavior that needs to change.Make the commitment. Accept that your business will benefit when you waste less time and organize your records. You're reading this article; that's a start.Make it a regular thing. New habits or routines don't take immediately. If email is a problem, block out when you're going to tackle it. Maybe it's the last half-hour before lunch and the last half-hour before quitting. Stick to that schedule.Overcome inertia. Whatever tricks you use, just get started. Do it today, then do it tomorrow. It's often good to link a new habit to a pleasurable one.Related: 8 Tips for Finding Focus and Nixing DistractionsDon't waste your time — manage it effectivelyBad things can happen if you waste time.

Digital assistants, AI, cloud-based tools and document management systems are your friends. You can complete tasks more quickly and efficiently, freeing time to accomplish new tasks.

73,5 Time Management Tips and Tricks for a More Productive You,"Jan 23, 2024",Howie Jones,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/5-time-management-tips-and-tricks-for-a-more-productive-you/468691,"
There’s something to be said about the feeling you get when crossing something off your to-do list. You’re accomplishing one task you’ve set out to complete, which you should feel proud about. But sometimes, there’s simply too much to do, and staying on top of your list feels overwhelming. What do you prioritize? How can you eat, sleep, work out, and run every necessary errand in 24 hours?First, take a deep breath. Remember that time management is a marathon, not a sprint. With enough practice and incorporation of these tips, you’ll create an equally productive and manageable environment. From there, you’ll be able to accomplish whatever comes your way.1. Create a Detailed CalendarWhen you’re balancing a social life, a career, and personal obligations, it’s no wonder your calendar fills up quickly. Factor in your kid’s activities and personal care, like working out, and the hours in your day are already allocated. Luckily, there are calendar tools you can put to work for you. They can help you stay on top of things and better manage your time.



Get started by finding the right calendar platform for your lifestyle. Specific formats or options to create group calendars may make you prefer one. So, try the most popular ones — like Calendar, Microsoft Calendar, and Google Calendar — and see what fits. Test the features and time-saving integrations, and start making your time management calendar.Remember, your calendar is only as good as it is updated, though. Carving out dedicated time to revise your calendar is one of the best approaches to ensure accuracy. From there, you can color code and prioritize until it’s working. Sync it with your loved ones so everyone’s on the same page for a more balanced schedule. Before you know it, you’ll feel like life is a bit more organized and manageable.


2. Know Your PrioritiesIt’s hard to know what to focus on when your to-do list is a mile long. So, it’s critical to identify what your top priorities are to help guide the time you dedicate to each task. That all starts with thinking through what is most important to you and your daily life.Whatever you deem the most critical priorities should be written out so you can easily reference them. That way, if you’re struggling to manage your time, you already have a guide in place. Work is likely a priority since it allows you to earn money that funds your life. Staying active and cooking may top your list since they directly impact your health. Strengthening your relationships with friends and family is important because it motivates you.Remember that your priorities don’t have to be the same every day. They probably will vary depending on factors like how you feel and the time of year. Give yourself the leniency to make last-minute decisions to switch things up if specific priorities change. After that, you can confidently know that your day is aligned with the things you know to be most important.3. Use Time BlockingSome days, you’re bound and determined to get everything done. Before you know it, though, the day has gotten away from you. It felt like no time, but your list is full of unchecked tasks. Sound familiar? Time blocking can help make that feeling one of the past.


The strategy of time blocking is dedicating certain time slots to specific tasks. For example, you can block 30 minutes in the morning to start your day. That might include brushing your teeth, doing skin care, and making and eating breakfast. Then, you may block an hour for a workout and another 30 minutes for a shower.Follow this same pattern for the remainder of your day, remembering to include relaxation time, too. That way, you can focus on the predetermined tasks at hand and complete them before moving on to the next block. If you don’t finish something, you can readjust to fit it in elsewhere. Or even move a less important block to another day to accommodate.4. Set Reminder AlarmsWhen your days are packed, and your brain is running a mile a minute, it’s only natural to forget things. Even though you wrote it down and said it out loud, booking or paying that appointment went undone. Fight against the inevitable frustration of forgetfulness by setting alarms.Say you need to book an appointment for your annual physical by a specific date. While writing down your task in a calendar or to-do list is helpful, an alarm will naturally draw your attention. Simply use your phone and choose a time that works for you — like 9:00 a.m. Then, write a brief description of what the alarm is for. That way, when the time comes and your phone rings, you know exactly what task you need to complete.


Follow this approach for paying bills, canceling subscriptions, and any other time-specific task. You’ll give yourself a better chance of getting it done and have the increased memorability of typing it out on your phone. Plus, you’ll have built-in time dedicated to completing those necessary tasks. That can guide your schedule and help everything run smoothly. After a while, those forgotten tasks will be a thing of the past.5. Cater to Your Motivation LevelsSome days, you’re a well-oiled machine. You knock out your entire to-do list and then some effortlessly, ending the day feeling accomplished. Others make completing even one thing feel like an uphill battle. Both are valid (and normal) experiences as you navigate a busy life.On your best days, soak up the feeling of ease you experience. Tack on a few more to-do’s if you can to get ahead. Add an organization project or a few more pages of reading to your schedule. Make the most of being “on” and appreciate the wins.More importantly, give yourself grace on the days that prove more difficult. Take breaks from productivity to rest your mind and relax. Move your priorities around to ensure your mental and physical well-being are factored into how you tackle the day. Striking the balance of capitalizing on the highly productive days and being flexible on the harder ones is hard. However, learning to accept and even embrace the ebbs and flows of productivity can ensure your newfound habits last.


Take it One Day at a TimeTime management is a skill that’s hard to master. You can get into a groove and feel like your life is in order and then something changes. You move, switch jobs, or have new responsibilities fall on your plate. That’s life. But learning how to navigate these changes and create good habits is what it’s all about.Once you do that, you’ll feel empowered by your ability to adapt. Will you remove late nights or feelings of stress from the unchecked to-do list tasks entirely? Probably not. But you will be better prepared to take on whatever life throws at you. And that is something you can certainly be proud of.Featured Image Credit: Photo by Artem Balashevsk; PexelsThe post 5 Time Management Tips and Tricks for a More Productive You appeared first on Calendar.

74,3 Mental Rules to Help You Understand (and Finally Relax) Your Busy Brain,"Jan 22, 2024",Leah Borski,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-ways-to-understand-and-finally-relax-your-busy-brain/467260,"
A client of mine, let's call her Sandra, came to me for help to handle high levels of stress in her life. She's the CEO of a 70-employee company in a male-dominated industry. That in itself was a lot of pressure. Add the strain of balancing work from home with parenting two small children. In her words, she wanted to be able to create her own calm during the chaos.She felt so overwhelmed, that we needed a simple launch point to relieve her stress. I advised her to start by taking a five-minute relaxation break during each workday. I gave her solid strategies to weave it into her existing schedule right away. For example, we planned the break during regular lulls in her daily itinerary. She didn't need to rearrange her whole life to do this. With a little back and forth, we discovered early afternoon should work best. She never scheduled meetings then and her kids usually took a nap after lunch.But at our next session, she confided that she was struggling. Instead of helping her relax, the downtime seemed to add to her stress. Her busy brain raced out of control. It clamored on about the meeting she just led, her afternoon agenda, what to cook for dinner, etc.

76,Unleashing the Good in Your Workforce: 10 Ways to Encourage Employee Volunteering,"Jan 22, 2024",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/unleashing-the-good-in-your-workforce-10-ways-to-encourage/468652,"
As a leader, you have probably stressed the importance of employee well-being programs for improving the mental health of your employees. According to a study published in the Industrial Relations Journal, that’s not the case.In the study, it was determined that such initiatives had no real impact on employee mental health. Essentially, all those mental health coaching sessions, classes, apps, and other programs didn’t seem to be working to address the growing mental health problems affecting U.K. workers.However, there was one exception. And that was volunteering.And that makes sense. A sense of purpose is key to employee motivation. They must feel that their work matters to the world and their company’s bottom line.Additionally, volunteer work can improve your mental health by making you feel good about yourself through helping others.Overall, employee volunteerism is a win-win situation. Employees gain fulfillment and connect with their values, and their communities benefit.However, how can you, as an employer, motivate your employees to volunteer? Well, here are ten impactful strategies you can try.1. Champion volunteering from the top.There is nothing more inspiring than leading by example. Leadership reinforces the core value of giving back throughout an organization by exemplifying their own commitment to volunteering.In other words, leadership sets the tone — starting with the CEO and continuing down the line. Share your volunteer experiences, participate in company initiatives, and publicly acknowledge employee contributions.



2. Complement company values and mission with volunteerism.Explain how volunteering aligns with your company’s core values and mission. By doing this, employees become more motivated to volunteer and feel that their efforts directly contribute to the company’s goals.For instance, if your business prioritizes environmental sustainability, partner with environmental organizations to plant trees or clean up a park. Employees are more likely to volunteer when they see the connection between it and the company’s values.3. Get to know your employees’ passions.Rather than just listing generic volunteer opportunities, offer your team a variety of options. Use surveys, skills assessments, or informal conversations to understand your employees’ interests and skills.Next, offer various options based on interest, skill level, and time constraints. Also, consider joining forces with local non-profits and charities to support causes ranging from environmental conservation to youth education to animal welfare. For employees with geographic limitations, offer virtual volunteering options for individual or team volunteering.


If you need some ideas, SCORE lists ways small businesses participate in volunteer work. Here are some of my favorites.
Take part in a larger effort. You and your team can participate in a charity race, donate goods to a charity auction, join a community cleanup day, or organize a food drive.
Plan a fundraising event. Almost all community service groups require monetary donations or fund-raising events.
Organize an item drive. Support an organization or cause you are passionate about by organizing an item drive. This could be a school supply drive for a local school or a canned food drive for a local food bank.
Provide mentorship or training programs. Small businesses can benefit significantly from mentoring or training programs offered to local residents in need.
4. Make it easy and accessible for everyone.Making the volunteering process simple is key. After all, busy schedules are a reality that can prevent people from giving back.Therefore, consider virtual opportunities, volunteer days to build teamwork, or after-work projects. Volunteering also based on skills is a great way for employees to contribute their professional expertise. As a result, volunteering is accessible to all, regardless of their skill level or time constraints.Furthermore, remove potential roadblocks by streamlining the registration process and offering resources like childcare and transportation if possible.Most importantly, give volunteers paid time off.Approximately 28% of employers offer paid time off (PTO) to employees who volunteer, according to the Society for Human Resource Management’s (SHRM) 2023 Employee Benefits Survey. On Points of Light’s 2023 Civic 50 – a recognition of companies that are committed to their communities – 82% also offered paid time off for volunteering.The bottom line is that companies that are more socially conscious tend to support their employees more.5. Facilitate team spirit.By organizing company-wide volunteer days, you can foster a sense of community. Participating in a fundraiser, building houses with Habitat for Humanity, or cleaning up a local park may be some options.


Taking part in team volunteering builds camaraderie and trust, improves relationships, and establishes a sense of purpose among employees. As an added benefit, this creates shared memories beyond the workplace.6. Offer skill development opportunities.Giving back isn’t the only reason to volunteer; you can also learn and grow through it. Develop partnerships with organizations that offer workshops or training sessions related to volunteer work.Ultimately, this allows employees to gain new skills, enhance their resumes, and enrich their lives.7. Promote & celebrate.Honor your volunteer champions by giving them a shout-out!


For example, consider including employee volunteer stories on your website, internal newsletter, or social media. It is also possible to create a “volunteer board.” This is where employees can share their volunteering opportunitiesOverall, recognize and reward their efforts by publicly praising their efforts or giving small tokens of appreciation. You can even let them take on leadership roles. The result? A culture of recognition that inspires others to emulate it.8. Partner with non-profits.Build strong relationships with non-profit organizations in your community. As a result, you can create volunteer opportunities tailored to their specific needs. And, this also ensures a mutually beneficial partnership.Additionally, this opens up opportunities for future collaborations and sponsorships.


9. Measure the impact and share it.Make sure your employee volunteering programs are making a positive impact. Calculate how many hours were contributed, how many lives were touched, or how much environmental benefit was gained.Employees, the tangible results of their efforts, morale, and motivation are boosted.10. Think beyond volunteering.You can make a valuable contribution through volunteering, but you should also consider expanding your options. Some examples would be to offer opportunities for employee activism, involvement in company social responsibility initiatives, or even micro-volunteering platforms to support community projects.As a result, diverse interests and engagement styles are accommodated.


Final Words of AdviceWith these steps, you can unlock the full potential of employee volunteerism and create a company that will make a real difference in the world. Your team and your community will thrive when you open the door to employees who want to give back.Keep in mind, though, that this is just the beginning. By combining creativity, dedication, and a genuine commitment to making a positive impact, you can establish a successful volunteer program that benefits your employees, company, and the community.FAQsWhy should I encourage my employees to volunteer?Employee volunteering benefits both your company and your employees in a variety of ways:
Boosts employee morale and engagement. As a result of volunteering, employees are happier and more engaged since they feel like they belong.
Improves company culture. In addition to strengthening a company’s social responsibility image, giving back creates a more collaborative and positive work environment.
Builds skills and leadership. Employees can develop new skills, enhance teamwork, and gain leadership experience through volunteer work.
Strengthens community ties. You build positive relationships with local organizations and residents by contributing to the community. By contributing to the community, you build positive relationships with local organizations and residents.
How can I make it easier for employees to volunteer?Getting rid of logistical hurdles is crucial, such as:



Offer paid time off for volunteering. As a result, genuine support is demonstrated and financial barriers are removed.
Provide flexible opportunities. Ideally, you want to have a variety of volunteer opportunities. These should based on skill level, location, and time commitment.
Make it convenient. Provide transportation assistance and organize volunteering events during work hours.
How can you motivate employees to volunteer?Don’t forget to appeal to different motivators as well:
Communicate effectively. Sharing stories, highlighting opportunities, and demonstrating impact should be done regularly.
Offer diverse volunteer options. Adapt to the interests, skills, and schedules of your employees.
Recognize and reward volunteers. Regularly recognize team members with public shout-outs, team lunches, small gifts, and opportunities for skill development.
Lead by example. For instance, participation of the C-suite in volunteer activities.
Integrate volunteering with company culture. Participate in company events, onboarding, and training to promote volunteerism.
What are some common challenges and how can you overcome them?
Lack of awareness. Identify and communicate existing opportunities and programs effectively.
Time constraints. Consider flexible volunteering options, such as after-hours or during breaks.
Skills mismatch. Identify volunteer opportunities that match employee skills.
Lack of recognition. Volunteers should be publicly recognized and rewarded.
Negative perception. Ensure that workload concerns, pressure concerns, or lack of impact concerns are addressed.
How can you measure the success of our employee volunteering program?
Volunteer participation rate. Maintain a record of how many employees participated and how many hours they volunteered.
Employee satisfaction surveys. Determine the level of engagement and experience of volunteers.
Community impact. Analyze the positive outcomes of volunteer work.
Return on investment. Evaluate the benefits and cost savings of volunteering.

77,6 Ways Business Coaches Set You Up for Achievement,"Jan 18, 2024",Nicholas Leighton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/6-ways-business-coaches-set-you-up-for-achievement/466769,"
One of the greatest benefits of entrepreneurship is the freedom to chart your own path — be your own boss and institute a business culture that reflects your unique leadership sensitivities. That said, such liberty can be a double-edged sword: It also means that owners must be more self-disciplined than the average employee. Without that quality, as well as a structured accountability system, a natural inclination to being, say, overwhelmed or prone to procrastination can quickly derail even the most promising ventures.This often prompts owners/execs to find a professional business coach or mentor. The role of such a person extends beyond motivation and goal setting: The best become trusted allies and partners — truly invested in your success as they offer guidance and support, as well as ensure that clients live up to goals and obligations.A few areas of critical value:



1. Customized goal settingEntrepreneurs tend to dream big and sport lofty ambitions. The challenge is when these aren't well-defined or reasonable. Having realistic and achievable goals is the foundation of accountability, and the right business coach will provide a structured approach to defining benchmarks and then help chart a path to achieve them. This includes setting reasonable deadlines tied to each objective.Related: 6 Ways to Push Your Limits and Accomplish Things You Never Thought Possible


2. Regular check-insA reliable dialog is the heartbeat of the coach/entrepreneur structure. Check-ins should be designed to provide a platform for progress assessment and strategy adjustment. Having this regular communication will also put natural pressure on an owner to avoid procrastination because they will need to report what they have accomplished since the last meeting. If the entrepreneur is struggling to make progress, the coach will then work to identify underlying issues holding them and the business back.3. Strategy pivotsBeing at the helm of a company is a dynamic journey filled with unexpected twists, turns and surprises, and any dramatic change in the industry can leave owners feeling flat-footed. Resulting uncertainty can stall the bold moves needed to rise to these challenges. Gifted coaches provide real-time feedback, accountability and guidance to adjust strategies to take advantage of opportunities or to avoid precarious situations.Related: This Entrepreneur Shares Why an Ability to Change Course Is What Will Set You Up for Success4. Making tough decisionsBeing an entrepreneur requires the guts to make difficult choices, including those related to staffing and budgets. These can be stressful, even painful, especially when downsizing a team or firing a client that no longer aligns with your strategy. A coach can help carefully consider all options, offer direction toward the most effective moves, and once again hold clients accountable for the results.


5. Fostering personal and professional growthIt can be easy to neglect your personal development while focusing on business demands. Good coaches recognize this, and will be experts at helping execs learn, cope and grow. They recognize that improving skills —including leadership style — offers multidimensional payoffs. So, they will help identify development opportunities, particularly those related to education. This way, owners can both flourish in the present and continue to hold themselves and their teams accountable in the future.Related: 7 Ways to Promote a Company Culture of Accountability6. Support overall well-beingFor too many execs, the aforementioned benign neglect when it comes to personal/skills development applies to overall health considerations: They simply don't take care of themselves. Capable coaches understand that owners who are stressed out, burned out and otherwise under pressure can't perform at their best. Many will assist in building a schedule of exercise and health check-ins, along with vital stretches of unplugged/recharge time.

78,6 Ways AI is Influencing Your Everyday Life,"Jan 18, 2024",Howie Jones,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/6-ways-ai-is-influencing-your-everyday-life/468507,"
Artificial intelligence was a trending conversation topic in 2023 and will continue to be prevalent in 2024 and the years following. The evolving technology has continued to create more opportunities to change how we work and organize our lives. The tool has made a home in many households, from automation to routines.Not only is it useful on an individual level, but businesses have found great potential for AI as well. Several platforms utilize AI to analyze data, create efficiencies, and solve problems. It’s a tool that’s accessible to most people too, as it’s become a common feature in smartphone applications.AI seems futuristic, but in reality, it’s something you already use regularly. It may be challenging to even picture life without some of this technology. By exploring the list below, you’ll find that there are many areas where AI is used today in your life. These examples will help you reflect on its use and how to use the technology.



1. Automated RemindersAutomatic reminders are an AI feature that has created a wealth of convenience for many. In your work and home life, some tasks are repeated regularly or semi-regularly. It’s not difficult to create reminders for yourself, but if you have a busy schedule, it becomes tasking to remember. AI allows platforms to make these tasks continuous throughout time and rids the brainwork involved in creating the reminders yourself.Using more advanced tools, like a calendar app, you can utilize artificial intelligence to create even more complex automation. Platforms like Calendar or Microsoft Calendars can provide recommendations for your schedule and plan meetings for you. Some even let you set reminders based on weather, like a notification to water the plants when it’s not rainy. Artificial intelligence is handy in that it can provide these ideas for you, so you’re not doing the problem-solving yourself.


2. Smart Home IntegrationsSmart plugs and lights are some of the more common ways AI has been brought into households. These products come with their own apps so users can connect them to wifi and create automation. Most smart apps allow you to set up automations related to time, weather, location, and much more. These features help consumers save time and create personalized routines in their homes. For instance, if you don’t like coming home from work to a dark house, you can set up an automation that turns on the light at sunset. This type of small action creates convenience and may ease some anxiety.Smart thermostats are another device that incorporates AI and has helped households monitor their energy usage. A simple example of utilization is basing your home thermostat temps on your location. Your smart thermostat can detect when your phone leaves the house and adjust to energy-saving levels. The feature is helpful for when you leave for vacation or other long periods. These aspects help you create a home environment that suits your behaviors and preferences.3. Enhanced WritingAI helps applications like Microsoft Word or Google Docs find and fix spelling errors and count words and characters. There are other platforms like Grammarly that do even more to analyze your writing and provide feedback. In addition to catching spelling and grammar errors, Grammarly also recommends ways to improve the flow and clarity of your writing. These are simple features, but they are beneficial in creating your own written pieces. They are especially helpful if English isn’t your first language or if you don’t have an editor around to help.Email platforms have evolved in recent years as they can predict what you want to say and give suggestions when writing a sentence. Email and SMS providers are providing personalized response options, too, allowing users to respond with a single click. Additionally, tools like ChatGPT use AI to create wireframes and even write full paragraphs for you. Although there is still value to writing content yourself, this technology eases parts of the process and makes communication easier.


4. Smartphone TechnologyFace ID recognition is another way artificial intelligence has become involved in everyday life. Upon phone set-up, users may opt-in to Face ID as a form of password protection. Smartphones will capture an image of your face and analyze it every time you try to unlock the device. This process incorporates AI to compare your current face to the initial image you took when setting up your facial ID. This type of passcode is more personalized to the phone owner and may be more challenging for a hacker to crack.Smartphones have also introduced virtual assistants to the daily lives of many, meaning that AI has been in people’s pockets for a long time. Features like Siri, Alexa, or Bixby will listen to your questions and provide solutions. Assistants are beneficial when you need to be hands-free, like driving or multitasking. They can also set up automation and reminders for you. Virtual assistants have since expanded past smartphone use and are in several devices like computers, speakers, and TVs.5. Online Search AlgorithmsPersonalized search results can be hard not to notice. Most internet users can recall a time when they saw an ad on Google related to a recent conversation or experience. This technology uses AI to monitor your interests, locations, and engagements and prioritizes ads related to those areas. Facebook and Instagram have similar strategies for ad services, making the entire social media experience personalized to each user.Web platforms like Netflix and Amazon have their own ways of integrating artificial intelligence too. Netflix’s AI monitors what titles you watch on the platform and will make recommendations based on your watch history. It will also track what titles you hover on and change the media thumbnails based on what you have interacted with in the past. Amazon has its own algorithm that provides product suggestions based on your purchase history. Although this technology may seem invasive at times, it’s all geared toward creating a better consumer experience and limiting the time it takes for you to search.


6. Smart VehiclesVehicles have already become “smarter” by integrating virtual assistants and smartphone apps. Back-up cameras and lane detection specifically have influenced the safety of drivers while on the road. However, more plans are being developed to improve the driving experience. Engineers are currently developing self-driving vehicles that remove the responsibility of manual driving, including steering, starting, and stopping. The technology is still in development, but it’s continuing to be introduced and tested for full-time use by consumers.Furthermore, AI has begun eliminating the need for delivery trucks and drivers altogether through drone deliveries. Brands like Amazon and Walmart have begun drone delivery efforts in recent years with success. In this process, the artificial intelligence monitors traffic, weather, and package weight to determine the appropriate times and routes for delivery. Drone delivery cuts down on shipping times, is better for the environment, and may even increase employee safety during stormy weather.Make Your Life SmarterThe phrase “work smarter, not harder” accurately describes how AI is utilized today. There are areas of this technology still in development, but it has already improved daily lives in its current state. Businesses have made it easy for anyone to use artificial intelligence using the right platforms or products. Introduce these tools into your daily life, giving you more time for essential tasks.Featured Image Credit: Cottonbro Studio; PexelsThe post 6 Ways AI is Influencing Your Everyday Life appeared first on Calendar.

79,Do Not Leave Your Health in the Cold: The Importance of Staying Active in the Winter,"Jan 17, 2024",Deanna Ritchie,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/do-not-leave-your-health-in-the-cold-the-importance-of/468449,"
We all know exercising is good for our bodies. And I’m sure your doctor also constantly reminds you of this fact. In colder months, however, when it is time to layer up, we often reduce our physical activity.But it’s important to remain active year-round. So, what’s the solution? Make sure you engage in safe, cold-weather activities.Ideally, thirty minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking and biking, should be performed five days a week, according to the American Heart Association. In addition to cardiovascular benefits, regular movement lowers your risk of type 2 diabetes, improves attention span and processing speed, and improves mood.



As a whole, being active contributes to both physical and mental health. However, that’s just scratching the surface. In this article, we will explore the benefits of physical activity in the winter as well as some options for doing it.Winter Workout Wonders: Why You Should Embrace the ChillA healthy, happier, and more productive you, can be achieved by staying active in winter.


The immune system and physical health can be boosted.There is no better time to catch colds, flu, and other viruses than winter. Fortunately, regular exercise can help you keep these unwelcome guests at bay.Through physical activity, our immune system is boosted by increasing white blood cell production, our body’s defense against pathogens. Studies have shown that 30 to 45 minutes of aerobic exercise 4-5 times a week combined with a balanced diet and plenty of sleep actually reduces your risk of getting a cold by 20 to 30%.A winter blues remedy.As well as being hard on our bodies winter can also be hard on our minds. The shorter days and fewer hours of sunshine can exacerbate seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression characterized by fatigue, low mood, and a lack of motivation. Fortunately, exercise has powerful antidepressant properties.As a result of physical activity, endorphins, the body’s feel-good chemicals, are released, elevating mood and combating feelings of anxiety and stress. Taking a brisk walk outdoors can boost your mood and help you positively embrace the winter season.


Maintain a healthy weight. Several factors contribute to weight gain during the winter. Some include shorter days, longer nights, cold weather, decreased exercise, and changes in sleep habits. Our tendency to overindulge on special occasions and the abundance associated with holiday meals can add several pounds to our weight as we enter the New Year.The good news is that exercise can help you maintain your weight or even lose weight despite seasonal temptations.Improve sleep quality.According to studies, “We have solid evidence that exercise does, in fact, help you fall asleep more quickly and improves sleep quality,” says Charlene Gamaldo, M.D., medical director of Johns Hopkins Center for Sleep at Howard County General Hospital.“But there’s still some debate about what time of day you should exercise. I encourage people to listen to their bodies to see how well they sleep in response to when they work out,” she adds.


Enhance cognitive function.Exercise has been shown to increase brain volume in the parts of the brain that control thinking and memory. “Even more exciting is the finding that engaging in a program of regular exercise of moderate intensity over six months or a year is associated with an increase in the volume of selected brain regions,” says Dr. Scott McGinnis, an instructor in neurology at Harvard Medical School.As well as improving mood and sleep, exercise also reduces stress and anxiety, which can boost memory and thinking indirectly. Often, cognitive impairment occurs as a result of problems in these areas.Boost energy levels.Feeling sluggish and tired all the time? Inactivity can worsen fatigue, making it harder to get out and move. Your energy level will rise when you exercise because it increases your heart rate, gets the blood flowing, and releases endorphins.Ultimately, your body thrives on movement, just like your car engine requires regular maintenance to keep running smoothly. It is possible to suffer a cascade of negative consequences if you don’t exercise during winter.


Winter-Friendly Activities: Move Your Body, Have FunIt is essential to find activities you enjoy and that fit your lifestyle in winter to stay active. To get you moving, here are some ideas.Embrace the great indoors.The possibilities for working out at home are endless, no matter what your fitness level or goals may be. For starters, try these ideas:
Bodyweight exercises. No equipment is required for these exercises, which use your own body weight as resistance. These exercises are great for building strength and endurance, and there are endless variations to keep things interesting. Planks, push-ups, squats, and burpees are some examples.
Cardio. Your heart health and overall fitness depend on cardio. If you feel like getting your cardio in at home, you can run in place, jump jacks, do high knees, skip rope, or dance. If you prefer to follow along with fitness videos, you can also try online cardio workouts.
Strength training. Strength training exercises can be performed at home with either bodyweight or free weights if you want to build muscle. Use household items such as water bottles or milk jugs instead of weights if you don’t have them. Rows, shoulder presses, and bicep curls are among the strength training exercises.
Yoga or pilates. You can improve your flexibility, balance, and core strength through yoga and Pilates. In books and magazines, you can find beginner yoga and Pilates routines and online yoga and Pilates classes.
Join a virtual fitness class. You can take virtual fitness classes online at home. You can do this as an alternative to going to the gym if you don’t have time.
Dance. You can burn calories and increase your heart rate by dancing to your favorite music.
Do chores with more vigor. You can reach your physical activity goals by doing housework such as vacuuming, sweeping, and cleaning windows. Besides getting some things done on your to-do list, you’ll also gain some health benefits. You can also work out at home by walking or running up and down stairs.
Depending on your interests and goals, there are many great indoor fitness options, including:
Swimming in an indoor pool
Rock climbing
Joining a cycling, spin, or martial arts class.
Bundle up and head outdoors.There are plenty of outdoor activities to keep you active this winter, regardless of whether you live in an area without traditional winter sports or want a change of scenery.



Go for a brisk walk or jog. If the weather permits, spend some time in nature during the day. Just put on warm clothing and enjoy a stroll through a park or a neighborhood that is safe.
Hit the slopes. Winter sports like skiing, snowboarding, and snowshoeing are great for exercising while also enjoying the winter cold.
Have a snowball fight or go sledding. With friends or family, have a playful snowball fight or sled ride. Not only will you get some exercise, you’ll probably laugh while doing it.
Make it fun and social.
Buddy up with a friend or family member. You can stay motivated and enjoy exercising more if you have someone to do it with.
Join a winter sports league. You can stay active and meet new people by playing basketball, volleyball, or indoor soccer. Or, if you want to stay outside, join a hockey team.
Take an outdoor boot camp or a winter nature photography class. This keeps your body moving, and you might even meet some new people.
Volunteer your time. Volunteering at a local soup kitchen or shoveling snow for elderly neighbors are good deeds and give you some exercise.
It doesn’t matter how small the change is — it can make a huge difference. Try to fit in short bursts of exercise throughout the day, and gradually increase the durations and intensities of your workouts. But, most importantly, find activities you enjoy.FAQsWhat are some common winter exercise excuses?Winter is a time when excuses pile up like snowdrifts when it comes to exercising. To get you moving, we need to dispel the following myths:
“It’s too cold!” Don’t forget to dress in layers, buy appropriate winter gear, and pick activities based on the weather. You can walk, ice skate, or snowshoe just as much as you can run in the summer.
“I don’t have time.” The smallest bursts of activity can add up. Work out for 10 minutes during your lunch break, do bodyweight exercises while watching TV, or take the stairs rather than the elevator.
“I don’t have a gym membership.” Staying active doesn’t require expensive gym memberships or fancy equipment. Join a community fitness class, explore your local park, or use free online workouts.
“I hate exercising alone.” Join a group fitness class or find a workout buddy for motivation and social interaction. As well as getting active and having fun with friends, winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding are great ways to stay active.
How can I stay active in the winter?Finding activities that you enjoy and can fit into your schedule is the key:
Outdoor activities. Whether you want to walk briskly, ski, ice skate, or shovel snow, bundle up and head outside.
Indoor activities. Getting fit can be as easy as joining a gym or fitness class, trying home workouts with online videos or apps, dancing to your favorite music, or climbing stairs.
Winter sports. Many indoor leagues and recreational options are available for sports like basketball, volleyball, and swimming.
Social activities. Join a hiking group, take an active class, or walk your dog with a neighbor.
What are some tips for staying motivated in the winter?
Set realistic goals. You can gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts by starting with small, attainable goals.
Find an activity you enjoy. You’ll be more likely to stick with it if you do this.
Exercise with a friend or family member. Staying motivated and accountable is easier when you have someone to exercise with.
Reward yourself for your progress. Keep yourself motivated by celebrating your accomplishments.
Dress appropriately. Wear layers of warm clothing and proper footwear to stay comfortable in the cold.
Listen to your body. You shouldn’t push yourself too hard, and you should take rest days when you need them.
Is it safe to exercise in cold weather?While exercising in cold weather is generally safe, it’s essential to take precautions:



Dress in layers. Stay dry and comfortable by wearing layers of warm, breathable clothing.
Cover your head, hands, and feet. Frostbite is most likely to occur in these areas.
Be aware of the wind chill. The wind can make it feel colder than it really is.
Start slowly and gradually increase your intensity. As your body adjusts to the cold, it takes time.
Take breaks indoors if you get too cold. Make sure you don’t overdo it.
I’m not very active; can I still benefit from staying active in the winter?Absolutely!Having even a little activity is better than having none at all. A small change, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator or walking for 15 minutes a day, can have a significant impact.Image Credt: Daniel Frank; PexelsThe post Do Not Leave Your Health in the Cold: The Importance of Staying Active in the Winter appeared first on Calendar.

80,How to Set Up Effortless Recurring Time Blocks in These 4 Calendars,"Jan 16, 2024",Angela Ruth,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/how-to-set-up-effortless-recurring-time-blocks-in-these-4/468392,"
Keeping track of daily, weekly, or monthly appointments is sometimes too much for your brain to handle. You may have every intention of remembering these regularly occurring events but may unintentionally book over them. Or a colleague may book a meeting during a time when you’re actually not available. While you may be able to reschedule the meeting or the event, it can add unneeded stress to your life.This is where setting up recurring time blocks to your digital calendar can be used. Blocking out specific portions of your day can help you better manage your schedule. For instance, you can block out time when you need to drop off your kids at school. Or, you may block out your lunch hour to prepare a nourishing meal and take a quick walk around the block. Creating time blocks for designated heads-down time can ensure you are undisturbed during your most productive hours.Adding recurring blocks to your calendar can also assist with the time management technique aptly called time blocking. With this strategy, every hour of your day is scheduled for a particular task. From 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., you may make a cup of coffee, pack your kid’s lunch, and send them to school. From 8:00 a.m. to 8:45 a.m., you may be taking an online yoga class between 8:45 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. before settling into work. By scheduling out your entire day, you control how you spend your precious time and optimize your productivity.



Setting up recurring time blocks is fairly simple and can be completed in a few minutes. However, the process varies depending on what digital calendar you are utilizing. Below is information on how to set up effortless recurring time blocks and how to sync across the most commonly used digital calendars.Google CalendarIf you are one of the 500 million Google Calendar users, know that setting up recurring time blocks is relatively easy. To set up a new repeating time block, click ‘create’ on the upper left-hand corner of your screen. Then, add the event title and any other pertinent details, such as links. Click the down arrow next to ‘does not repeat’ and select how often you’d like the event to repeat, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. Be sure to hit ‘save’ before exiting the event.


To repeat an existing event, such as a workout class or therapy session, go to the ‘edit’ section under the desired event. From there, click on the down arrow next to ‘does not repeat.’ Again, select how often you’d like the event to repeat and then hit ‘save.’ Note that Google Calendar has a maximum of 730 occurrences for each time block — a significant amount of time for you to determine if the block is working for you! For either new or existing time blocks, you can edit the event’s details and save them across all of your devices.Many individuals have different Google Calendars for different parts of their life. A Google Calendar for work may be shared amongst colleagues, while one for your child’s soccer schedule may be shared with your nanny and partner. You’ll want to ensure the time block is synced across all your Google Calendars for particular appointments and events. To do so, go to ‘settings’ and then select your calendar that you’d like to sync with another. Click on the calendar and then ‘share with specific people’ to add alternative email addresses — such as personal or work — to sync with.Microsoft Outlook CalendarFor those using Microsoft Outlook Calendar, toggle over to the Calendar tab on the home screen. From there, select ‘new appointment’ and enter the appropriate details for the event, such as location. Select the desired ‘start time’ and ‘end time.’ Under ‘options,’ click on ‘out of office’ under ‘show as’ so colleagues see the slot as blocked. Then, click on ‘recurrence’ under ‘options’ to choose your frequency, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. Hit ‘save’ and close out of the appointment window.Synching the time block across your Microsoft Outlook Calendars is a two-step process. First, you’ll export the time blocks from one calendar and export them. Then, this exported data is imported and merged into the desired main Microsoft Outlook Calendar. To export data, click ‘file,’ ‘ options,’ and ‘advanced.’ Under the ‘export’ dropdown, select ‘export a file to’ and then ‘next.’ Choose ‘Outlook Data File (.pst)’ and then ‘next’ to get to ‘save exported file’ and then ‘finish.’


Once you have this exported calendar information, you can import it to your centralized Microsoft Outlook Calendar of choice. Again, open the ‘file’ tab and click ‘open’ and ‘import.’ Go to ‘Import from another program or file’ and hit ‘Next.’ Click on ‘Outlook Data File (.pst)’ and then ‘next’ and ‘browse’ to find the recently exported file. Now, under the ‘options’ tab, click on ‘do not import duplicate items’ to ensure your calendar merges appropriately.To finish the import, click ‘Select the folder to import from’ and then choose the ‘Calendar’ folder. Make sure the ‘include Subfolders’ check box is cleared. Then, go to ‘import items into the same folder’ and ‘finish.’ As you can see, this can be a tedious process, so be sure to give yourself ample time to complete this exporting and importing process.Apple CalendarIf you are an Apple Calendar fan, setting up recurring time blocks is easier on your Mac laptop than on your iPhone. Go to the Calendar app and double-click on the event that you’d like to repeat. You’ll see a ‘repeat’ pop-up menu where you can select your desired frequency. If you want the time block to recur every other day, go to ‘daily’ and enter the appropriate number of days between each event. If you want the event to occur on the 15th of every month, hit ‘monthly’ and enter the same day for each occurrence; you can choose when you want the event to stop by selecting the ‘end repeat’ pop-up menu.Setting up iCloud for Apple Calendar is the easiest way to view and sync multiple Apple Calendars. You can view and edit your Apple Calendars across your Mac, iPhone, and iPad and log into the iCloud.com web browser. Any change that you make on one device will automatically sync across all your devices, preventing any double bookings from occurring. You can share your Apple Calendars with others using iCloud, allowing specific individuals to edit and collaborate with your designated calendar.


Note that utilizing iCloud this way isn’t the same as syncing a time block across various calendars. To ensure an important time block is maintained across your work, personal, and family calendars, it may be most straightforward to set up the same recurring block across all the calendars.Calendar.comCalendar.com is a scheduling and productivity software designed to simplify your day-to-day. The user-friendly desktop and mobile application makes scheduling and viewing your upcoming appointments a breeze. For Calendar.com users, adding recurring time blocks is just as simple as any of the other major platforms. To add a time block, go to your main calendar and select a desired time slot. From there, add the pertinent details and how often you want the block to occur.Calendar.com’s goal is to reduce the number of digital calendars you’re managing. Because of this, you can have your work calendar and your personal calendar within the same account. This means you won’t need to sync or merge your calendars to ensure the recurring time block is accounted for across all your calendars. This is a huge benefit, particularly for those who don’t want to go through the hassle of exploring and importing calendar data routinely. And if you have access to a family calendar or a spouse’s calendar, you can connect them to your main Calendar.com with the pro plan.ConclusionAdding recurring time blocks can be a game-changer for organizing your regularly scheduled activities. Additionally, these blocks can help you stay focused, boost your productivity, and provide a better work-life balance. Try adding time blocks to your preferred calendar platform and see how your life is improved.

81,How To Slim Down Your Schedule and Reclaim Your Time,"Jan 15, 2024",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/how-to-slim-down-your-schedule-and-reclaim-your-time/468383,"
Do you feel like your days are crammed with too many commitments and obligations? Have you ever blurted out “I never have enough time.”Well, you’re far from alone. The results of a OnePoll survey show that 60% of people do not have enough time for work, chores, and errands. In addition, with self-care, side hustles, and FOMO (fear of missing out), it’s no wonder we’re burned out. In fact, an astounding 89% of workers have experienced burnout within the past year.What if you could slim down your schedule, shed the clutter, and reclaim some of your precious time? Well, it’s possible. Plus, you don’t have to cut corners or become a machine.



Interested? Of course you are. Here are 15 practical strategies for slimming down your schedule without further ado.1. Understand your time thieves.Before you start fiddling with your calendar, you need to know what you’re dealing with. In other words, analyze your current time commitments.
Log your activities. Keep a detailed time log for at least one week. Keep track of everything you do, including work meetings, errands, social calls, and leisure activities. You must be honest, though! During this audit, you will discover your organization’s time hogs and hidden drains.
Identify your values. What is truly important to you? Is it family, career, creative pursuits, or just having time to yourself? By understanding your values, you can prioritize activities that align with them.
Recognize the “shoulds.” What are some things you do just because you feel you “should”? Get to the bottom of your commitments driven by guilt, obligations, or social pressure. Do you really benefit from them?
2. Prioritize with a laser focus.Back then, my siblings and I had to do homework before watching cartoons because it was a “must-do.” Well, get back to that way of thinking regarding your schedule.Find out what matters most to you, what is most important in your life, what is most important to you. After that, write them down so you can use them as a guide.The next step is to compare your commitments with your priorities. Is that committee meeting in line with your passion for art? How does that late-night work email affect your family dinner dreams? It’s time to let go if these commitments aren’t really priorities.In short, prioritize ruthlessly, keeping only meaningful activities.


3. Make sure your schedule is free from “fluff.”.Whenever you perform tasks irrelevant to your day-to-day success, they are known as “fluff.” This refers to time-wasting activities that don’t contribute to your productivity.What is the best way to get rid of fluff? Become comfortable saying “no” to tasks, recurring meetings, and other tasks that don’t add value to your schedule. Also, during the day, set limits on what you are willing to do. Be aware of when to say “yes” and when to say “no” as part of this process.I understand that the things on your schedule right now probably seem important to you. However, I hope you will challenge this belief. You can begin by choosing one item from your to-do list … and then not doing it.4. Master the art of saying “No, thank you..”As a follow-up to the previous point, saying “no” is not selfish; it is strategic. The goal is to protect your precious time so you can dedicate it to what matters most.If you’re having trouble with that, remember that practice makes perfect. So, you can start small. Politely decline a dinner party or an additional project, for example. Every “no” is a brick in your wall of priorities.Also, you don’t need to explain a gentle “no.” It’s sufficient to say, “Thank you for thinking of me, but I am currently focusing on…” Eventually, you’ll see how quickly your schedule shrinks.5. Learn how to batch and delegate like a productivity ninja.I cannot emphasize this enough. It’s not possible to multitask. In reality, it’s a myth that lures you into a world of distracted attention.Instead, batch similar tasks together. For instance, answer emails in a focused block and return calls during a designated time. By avoiding context switching, you can save precious mental energy.


Do not hesitate to delegate as well. Do you have a partner who can do the grocery shopping for you? Would a team member be able to handle that data analysis? Allow yourself to do the activities only you can do by delegating wisely.6. Look for outsourcing opportunities.It’s impossible to create more time. Help is available, however. In other words, you can declutter your schedule by letting someone else handle it.In order to maximize benefits and minimize risks, it is essential to find the right outsourcing opportunities. Consider these tips: Consider these tips:
Define your needs. Determine which tasks or projects you want to outsource.
Assess your budget. Saving money shouldn’t be the only reason to outsource. In addition to quality, expertise, and potential long-term benefits, consider the overall value proposition.
Weigh the pros and cons. There are times when outsourcing isn’t the best option. Determine whether it aligns with your business goals, communication needs, and level of control.
Cleaning your office or home, for instance, is something you might want to hire someone to do. Alternatively, you can hire a freelancer to handle your social media.7. Embrace technology and tools wisely.You can streamline tasks and improve organization by using:
Tools for project management.
Time management tools.
AI text generators.
Tools for recording and uploading videos.
Social media management tools.
Through effective use of technology, manual effort can be reduced, time can be saved, and productivity can be improved. You can streamline your daily processes and minimize the time spent on them when you choose and integrate the right tools.8. Control the technology monster.At the same time, our attention is constantly fragmented by notifications, pings, and alerts. As such, set boundaries for your tech use by:
Disable notifications for non-essential apps.
Check your email and social media at specific times.
Make time during the day (like mealtimes or evenings) to be tech-free.
9. Plan your perfect day.Now that you’ve trimmed your schedule and set priorities, it’s time to plan a day that nourishes your spirit.



Schedule intentional time. Whether you enjoy reading, exercising, spending time with loved ones, or pursuing a passion project, set aside time for these activities.
Embrace white space. Give yourself room for spontaneity, for unexpected opportunities, and for simply being present. It is sometimes the unexpected experiences that enrich us the most. Allow yourself to be open to the possibility of “maybe.”
Create routines. Maintaining a consistent routine for sleep, exercise, and other essential activities reduces stress and frees up your mind.
Mind your boundaries. Carve out time for yourself and learn to disconnect from work. It’s important to give your mind and body space to recharge..
Celebrate small wins. No matter how small your progress is, acknowledge it. Pat yourself on the back for each step you take toward reclaiming your time.
10. Cut down on meetings. There’s a reason why people hate meetings. They’re the number one productivity killer. Therefore, depending on your role, here are some ways to reduce them:
Be ruthless with scheduling. Meetings should only be scheduled if they are absolutely necessary. You might want to consider email threads, asynchronous updates, or short one-on-ones as alternatives.
Set clear agendas and stick to them. Be sure everyone understands the meeting’s purpose and what preparations need to be made ahead of time. By doing this, things can remain focused and on track.
Encourage active participation. Keep everyone engaged and avoid passive listening with tools like polls, breakout sessions, and collaborative documents.
End early if possible. Do not feel obligated to drag out a discussion that wraps up earlier than expected. Be respectful of everyone’s time and end the meeting on time.
11. Understand how to say “Enough.”Our days are often crammed with to-do lists and obligations because we overschedule ourselves. As such, don’t add more to your plate once it’s full. Recognize when it’s full and stop adding more.Having said that, don’t be afraid to leave on time, skip an event if you’re exhausted, or even take a nap. Taking time to rest and rejuvenate will make you more productive and happier in the long run.12. Spend time on what matters — you.Do not let self-care and leisure slip through the cracks. Organize your schedule to make time for the things that nourish your soul.Whether it’s reading a book, walking in nature, or spending time with loved ones, don’t skimp on these activities. In fact, add them to your calendar like you would an appointment with your doctor or client.13. Unsubscribe from the “Comparison Game.”It is important to realize that social media is not reality, but a highlight reel. Be careful not to compare your the challenges you face behind the scenes with someone else’s carefully curated online persona. Instead, keep your focus on yourself, celebrate your accomplishments, and be kind to yourself.14. Having less stuff means having more time.Of course, “less stuff = more time” is a simplification, and experiences will vary from person to person. Despite this, owning less can save you time in the following ways:
Reduced maintenance. When you have fewer things, you don’t have to clean, organize, or repair as much. It will save you time dusting knick-knacks, folding clothes, and fixing gadgets.
Decision fatigue minimized. You can devote more mental energy to more meaningful decisions when you have fewer choices surrounding what to wear, eat, and do. Reading, creating, or simply enjoying the present moment is more enjoyable when there is less time spent deliberating over what shirt to wear.
Simplified routines. A minimalist approach often results in streamlined routines. Fewer plates means fewer dishes, fewer clothes means less laundry, and packing for a trip is a breeze with a capsule wardrobe. As a result, more time can be spent on more important things.
Streamlined living. The less clutter in your living space, the more organized and spacious it will feel. By using this method, you can find lost items faster and prepare for guests faster, saving you precious minutes throughout the day.
Increased focus. There is less visual distraction when a space is clutter-free, which makes it easier to concentrate. When it comes to work, study, or creative endeavors, this can be especially beneficial.
Reduced stress. Being constantly reminded of possessions can contribute to anxiety and stress. As a result of owning less, you can experience improved mental well-being and be able to spend less time dealing with stress.
By adding this chore to your calendar, you will ensure that you regularly clean and declutter both your home and workspace.


15. Review and revise regularly.Creating and updating your schedule isn’t just a one-time event; it’s an ongoing process based on your changing priorities and needs. Be sure to review your schedule regularly and make any necessary adjustments. Try new things and see what works best for you.FAQsHow do I know if my schedule needs decluttering?There are a number of signs that your schedule might need to be decluttered, including:
A feeling of constant stress, overwhelm, or exhaustion.
Not being able to focus on your tasks or feeling scattered.
Due to overscheduling, you miss deadlines or commit to projects.
You don’t have enough time for yourself, your loved ones, or the activities you enjoy.
A constant feeling of running behind or never having enough time.
What are the benefits of decluttering my schedule?The following are some of the benefits:
Anxiety and stress are reduced.
Productivity and focus are improved.
A greater amount of time for relaxation and self-care.
A better night’s sleep.
Improved relationships.
A greater sense of control over your time.
There are more opportunities to be spontaneous and have fun.
How can I identify what to remove from my schedule?Reviewing your current commitments is the best course of action. It involves reviewing your calendar, to-do lists, and any other scheduling tools you use. Particularly, identify tasks, events, or meetings that:
Aren’t aligned with your priorities or goals?
It is no longer of service to you.
Feel draining or unsatisfying.
It can be delegated or outsourced.
For personal or professional development, they aren’t essential.
What are the best ways to say “no” without feeling guilty?The following tips will help you say “no” gracefully:
Don’t be afraid to be honest and direct about the reasons for your refusal.
Consider alternative solutions or suggestions whenever possible.
Thank the person for taking the time to understand your request.
Respectfully communicate your boundaries.
Keep in mind that it’s okay to prioritize your own well-being and needs.
How can I make sure I stick to my decluttered schedule?Here are some tips for staying on track:
Keeping track of your commitments is easier with a planner or calendar.
Remind yourself of important tasks and deadlines.
Establish routines and habits that support your schedule.
Identify accountability partners or support groups.
If you stick to your goals, reward yourself.
Make adjustments as needed and be patient with yourself.

83,5 Calendar Hacks for Optimized Productivity in 2024,"Jan 11, 2024",Angela Ruth,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/5-calendar-hacks-for-optimized-productivity-in-2024/468209,"
Your digital calendar can work harder for you, thanks to new technological advancements. In a previous life, you may have been satisfied with a separate app for your email and a separate app for your calendar. But jumping from one application to another is an inefficient waste of time.This is just one feature that today’s leading digital platforms, including Google Calendar, Calendar.com, and Microsoft Outlook, are addressing. Other features in 2023 ranged from facilitating easier meeting scheduling to enhancing the client booking experience. These smart features can help you achieve your productivity goals in 2024. Read on for five calendar hacks to start implementing today.1. Streamline One-on-One SchedulingFinding time to meet with another person should be easy, but conflicting schedules often make it challenging to find an available slot. In July 2023, Google Calendar improved its scheduling capabilities with the “Offer Times” option. This new feature only supports one-on-one meetings and is available to everyone who uses Gmail and Google Calendar. It eliminates the need to toggle back and forth between your draft email and your Calendar view.



Fill in the appointment or event details as usual to unlock this feature. Navigate to the side panel and select one or multiple available blocks in your schedule. Select ‘add to email’ so your available blocks display to the recipient. Once the email is sent, the requested recipient can select a time that works for them with a simple click.2. Schedule Team Meetings in SecondsIf scheduling team meetings is causing headaches, then Calendar.com may have the solution for you. This scheduling software recognizes that sending back-and-forth emails to find a time to meet with everyone is unproductive. These emails waste everyone’s time, often leading to frustration and annoyance.


Recently, Calendar.com rolled out new software technology that allows you to schedule team meetings quickly. Add the invite request and the designated colleagues you want to meet with. From here, you’ll automatically see when everyone is available and can create the invite for the time that will work with everyone’s schedules.Calendar.com’s goal is to reduce the number of digital calendars you’re constantly flipping between. Therefore, when you’re booking a meeting with multiple individuals, you know that their calendars are truly accurate and up-to-date. And coming soon, Calendar.com will release Calendar Analytics for Teams and Advanced Team Analytics.3. Set and Customize Working LocationsIn today’s hybrid world, you may not be working in the same location every day. You may have designated days that you’re working from home and other days in the office. If you meet with clients regularly, there may be sections in the day where you won’t have a home base. You may hop between coffee shops as you travel from one client to the next. Thanks to a new update in Google Calendar, you can now set and customize working locations for various places throughout your day.Before this recent update, you could only select one work location per day. Now, your colleagues can see exactly where you will be at different points in your day. On the Google Calendar web browser, go to ‘create’ and then ‘working location.’ From here, you can select a default location — your primary working spot, such as an office or home.


Use the ‘add time’ button to set designated times when you plan to work in this location. For instance, you may work from home from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. but then commute to a client meeting in the afternoon. Locations can also overlap, which is particularly helpful for work travel. You can designate that you’re in the New York City office location and add parameters to your working hours at the office.4. Enhanced Viewing OptionsIn September 2023, Microsoft began rolling out the New Outlook for Windows. The sleek, user-friendly interface is designed to coordinate numerous email accounts easily in one easy-to-navigate place. The New Outlook allows any IMAP email server, including Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, and Hotmail.com, to be integrated with Microsoft.A primary benefit of the New Outlook for Windows is the ability to add events to your calendar directly from your email. This can come in handy when booking restaurant reservations, traveling, or scheduling a doctor’s appointment. You won’t have to manually add the information to your calendar. These events can be marked as “private,” so your colleagues can’t see why you are booked.Another new feature is the Board view, allowing you to see multiple calendars simultaneously from Microsoft Teams, Planner, and SharePoint. You can also view To-Do tasks, contacts, and sticky notes. Again, this means you won’t have to constantly toggle back and forth between different Microsoft screens and your Outlook Calendar view page.


5. Require Payment for Client BookingsIf your business requires appointment bookings, then this tip is for you. Google Calendar is now integrated with Stripe, a payment processing system that can handle all of your client payment needs. With this integration, you can now require clients to pay in advance when scheduling their appointments in Google Calendar. This will help mitigate last-minute cancellations and simplify payments for you and your clients.This feature requires you to connect a Stripe account to Google Calendar. To do so, click on “settings” followed by “general” and “appointment schedules.” Click on “connect to Stripe” and follow the instructions on Stripe’s website to complete the process.Then, you can manage your payments and cancellation policy directly in your Google Calendar. Navigate to either create or edit an appointment schedule. Open up the ‘payments & cancellation policy’ window and ensure ‘require payment when booking’ is checked off. Enter the amount required for the appointment in your desired currency. You can also add your cancellation policy so individuals know what they will be charged for a canceled appointment. Click ‘save’ and exit the screen to complete the appointment booking process.Productivity TakeawaysImplementing these calendar hacks will help you stay on task, but being more productive requires some initiative on your end. If you get distracted throughout the day, you may consider time blocking. This time management system divides your day into specific tasks for designated time chunks. Once the time is over, you move on to the next task, no matter if you’ve finished the prior one.


Color coding your calendar will allow you to better visualize where you spend most of your working hours. With this gathered information, you may be able to reassign tasks or reprioritize what needs to get done. Mapping out your calendar with regularly scheduled appointments is another option. This helps you maximize your time while also considering your personal life, such as vacation days and your favorite workout classes.No matter your calendar platform of choice, there are ways to optimize and improve how you are managing your time. The bottom line? With the right calendar tools in place, you can get more done in less time. Ultimately, that can lead to feeling more accomplished at the end of 2024.Featured Image Credit: Pixabay; PexelsThe post 5 Calendar Hacks for Optimized Productivity in 2024 appeared first on Calendar.

If you're like most Americans (71% according to Sleep Foundation), you probably make your bed every day or almost every day.It might even be one of the first things you do after you wake up — and research shows that having a consistent morning routine can lower stress, increase energy and make you more productive. What's more, a survey from Best Mattress Brand revealed that 34% of people who make their beds were ""very productive"" at work compared to 21% of those who neglected the task.But making your bed every morning is one habit that could actually do more harm than good — and may even endanger your health, according to sleep experts at Zoma Sleep.

85,How to Turn Your Workweek Chaos Into Fine-Tuned Coordination,"Jan 10, 2024",Deanna Ritchie,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/how-to-turn-your-workweek-chaos-into-fine-tuned-coordination/468159,"
You’ve got a busy workweek ahead of you with a jam-packed schedule, so it’s essential to implement efforts to stay organized. As such, there may not be much wiggle room when you consider what’s on your professional calendars. While you swear you’re going to make a dent in your to-do list, it never seems to go down by much. It doesn’t help that you missed a meeting last week where you were supposed to present. And you don’t know how you’re going to play catch-up while tackling everything you’ve penciled in this week.If this sounds familiar, rest assured you’re not the only one struggling with effective time management. Roles have gotten more complex and task-heavy as companies consolidate human resources. Plus, people want immediate answers in an age where technology creates instant conveniences. It’s especially difficult to keep pace in client-support roles, whether they involve service or sales.However, all is not lost if your schedule feels more out of control than in sync. You can learn different ways to approach your workweek schedule and the way you work. Let’s look at how to take your calendar from chaos to a well-coordinated system.



Centralize EverythingChances are your company has a robust tech stack. You’ve got a customer relationship management platform, project management software, and a collaboration tool. In addition, there are email, sales databases, and digital calendars galore. While all these tools serve a unique purpose, using multiple platforms can scatter your data.You know the pain if you’ve had to search through different platforms to find the information you need. And it’s no wonder you’re surprised by the meeting notifications that pop up during what should’ve been your lunch hour. It’s hard to keep everything together and know what’s ahead if your data isn’t in one place.


Calendar and contact syncing tools help solve this problem by consolidating data between platforms. For instance, CiraHub’s solution automatically syncs changes from one platform to another. If you update a contact in your organization’s Global Address List, it automatically routes those changes to your sales database. You don’t have to make manual updates twice or waste time figuring out which source is correct.For those who have multiple calendars, the solution can centralize each schedule and to-do list. Say you’ve got assignments with due dates housed in a project management tool. Simultaneously, you have pending meeting invites and reminders on your Google calendar. By automatically syncing those schedules together, you eliminate the chance you’ll miss something. You’ll also cut out the need to manually list your daily and weekly tasks.Schedule Tasks According to ThemesYou may have heard about time blocking to prioritize your work. With this technique, you organize your day into various blocks. You devote each block to specific tasks or activities. As an example, you might go through your emails for the first hour. After a hard stop at 10 a.m., you focus on lead generation for two hours.You devote the next block to meetings and schedule your least-intensive tasks for the end of the day. Day theming is a similar practice to time blocking. The difference is you schedule an entire workday to a single theme. For instance, you might organize your week according to task category, project, or client.


On Monday, you work only on assignments related to content strategy. Alternatively, you could devote Mondays to the fiber network expansion project. If you break down your themes by each client, Mondays could be about the new coffee shop business you’re onboarding.Day theming allows you to expand the idea of time blocking into larger chunks so you notice more progress. Instead of seeing multiple mountains go down a bit, you can focus your full attention on a single category. Day theming gives you room for deeper concentration, which can reduce stress levels.Prioritize Work by Intensity LevelSay you work in a role where your responsibilities take various levels of concentration. You’re a claims adjuster for an insurance company, so you have to complete evaluations, send correspondence, and review estimates. You also have to deal with litigation reports and negotiate claim values with attorneys. Each of these tasks requires different levels of concentration, with some also involving potential emotional strain.Depending on how your energy flows, you might find it easier to get the most intense tasks out of the way early. Tackling your claim evaluations and negotiations first thing in the morning ensures you don’t run out of steam. You’re able to complete them faster this way and with more accuracy. Then, as the day continues, you can match your lowered energy levels to your routine tasks. These don’t require as much concentration.


Prioritizing your work according to intensity can elevate your productivity. By focusing on what’s most important, you won’t be as tempted to overschedule yourself. Know when you’re most productive and dedicate your top priorities to these time slots. As long as you’re realistic about how much you can get through, you won’t feel as buried. If specific tasks aren’t as critical, delegate them or schedule them for after your high-intensity responsibilities. As a result, you can improve your schedule and have a smoother workweek.Schedule Downtime During Your WorkweekNo one can keep the engine running 100% of the time. Jumping from task to task without breaks is unrealistic and harmful. When you don’t take breaks, your stress levels can increase and lead to burnout. Experiencing burnout may negatively impact your job performance and ability to get things done.About 59% of the American workforce reports feeling moderate levels of burnout on the job. When burnout happens, it’s easier to feel overwhelmed when you see a full calendar and task after task coming your way. Your chances of feeling disconnected from the work are higher. Consequently, you’re not as invested in the outcome.In response to burnout, you might find yourself approaching each assignment more slowly. You could end up procrastinating, spending time on distractions like social media posts and daydreaming instead. By building breaks into your schedule, you give yourself time to decompress throughout the workweek. You have moments to think through challenging assignments and situations. By walking away for 10 to 15 minutes, you can process and defuse the stress you may be experiencing.


Sometimes breaks also allow you to rethink your approach. New ideas may come to you during a walk outside or a chat in the break room. Breaks give you a chance to socialize, ask colleagues for their input, and relax. You can go back to your desk with renewed energy, focus, and control. When you’re able to manage feelings of being overwhelmed, you’re less likely to shut down and abandon your productivity goals altogether.Set Time Limits for MeetingsNearly everyone knows how meetings can turn into time hogs. What should’ve been a Slack or an email becomes an hour-long discussion. Worse, nothing comes out of it. Most attendees aren’t sure where the group is headed and what they need to follow up on.Establishing hard stops for meetings can often prevent these scenarios. So can setting an agenda from the get-go. Hardly anyone likes to accept meeting invites where nothing seems to be thought out. They might attend out of obligation but aren’t clear on how they can contribute.One strategy is to automatically decline meeting invites without an agenda if you don’t believe you’ll have something to contribute. This strategy frees up your workweek schedule for more pressing tasks and helps you avoid the temptation to multitask during meetings. However, a better approach for all is to manage meetings more effectively company-wide.


Try setting a time limit of 15 minutes when lengthy discussions aren’t necessary. Unless you’re brainstorming, you can probably get through most meetings in 15 to 20 minutes. Distribute the agenda beforehand so contributors can prepare. Finally, take a page from Steve Jobs’ book and make it a practice to invite only those who have a contribution to make. The Apple CEO was so committed to this principle that he once turned down a meeting invite from President Obama because the group was too large.Simple Workweek Scheduling TechniquesTask-driven work environments aren’t new. Still, roles where competing tasks are involved are becoming more intense. You have more to juggle and keep tabs on. Finding ways to coordinate calendars and information can be a challenge if you don’t have the right tools.Fortunately, there are ways to elevate your workweek schedule and get everything under control. With calendar syncing technology and organization practices, you can simplify the busiest schedules. Give these tools a try and see the difference they make.Featured Image Credit: Photo by Yan Krukau; Pexels; Thank you. The post How to Turn Your Workweek Chaos Into Fine-Tuned Coordination appeared first on Calendar.

86,3 Ways to Keep Yourself Accountable When Applying for New Jobs,"Jan 9, 2024",Deanna Ritchie,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/3-ways-to-keep-yourself-accountable-when-applying-for-new/468078,"
Applying for a new job can be a full-time job in itself. The amount of research required to find a company that you’re excited about and then a job that you’re qualified for can take a long time. Once you’ve found the position, you have to fill out the written portion of the application, ensuring your resume is up-to-date and your cover letter is exceptional. Through the interview process, you need to look up who you’re meeting with and think about questions that you want to ask along the way. In some instances, a sample test may be required before you’re offered the job.Going through all these steps for one job is exhausting, let alone multiple jobs at different companies. Depending on your situation, you may be juggling this while working at your current company or finishing up college. To avoid getting burned out during the process, it’s essential to stay accountable. This means keeping everything organized and in place. Essentially, this will help you concentrate on submitting your best possible application each and every time. This article aims to guide you through the application process, equipping you with the accountability tools you’ll need to succeed.1. Set Personal Mini DeadlinesMany job applications will have external facing deadlines, with a hard date where all interested individuals need to submit their materials to apply. While these are important to meet, you first need to set personal deadlines. When you’ve committed to start looking for a new position, create mini deadlines for you to work towards. These deadlines should be for requisite items such as updating your resume and getting character references. These are tasks that need to be accomplished before you can turn in any application.



When applying, having these mini personal deadlines in place will help you work backwards when it comes to meeting any externally facing job deadline. This will avoid you scrambling to get everything together before turning in your application. Other mini deadlines to create include doing proper research on each company you’re applying to and setting aside an interview outfit. No matter if you’re interviewing in-person or remotely, you’ll want to wear something that you feel confident in. But if the outfit is in the laundry, you’ll be rushing to put together something else that you love just as much.Once an interview is scheduled, set a mini deadline to practice what you want to say. While your answers shouldn’t feel rehearsed, it can be beneficial to say aloud what you want to get across. Make sure you can answer succinctly why you are the best fit for this particular position. And, be sure you can also answer how you will enhance the team. Having two to three questions to ask the interviewer is always a good idea, as long as the questions haven’t already been answered. Rather than asking about health benefits or salary, ask about what the team structure looks like or what the morale is like at the company.


2. Use Your Calendar to Stay On TaskWith all these mini personal deadlines to keep track of, you’ll want to have an organized methodology in place while you apply for your new job. You may be interviewing for multiple jobs around the same time. This is too much information for anyone to remember, particularly if you’re already working full time. With a digital calendar, you can set reminders for these deadlines. This helps to ensure that you’re prepped and planned for whatever the application may throw your way.Whether you’re using Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Calendar.com, or another platform altogether, create a label for your interview tasks. This color-coded label will help you recognize what needs to get done before a certain date. If you have an in-person interview a week from today, think about what you will need to accomplish before then. Put your mini deadlines on your calendar, such as refining your personal mission statement and researching the panel of interviewers. Setting reminders for yourself a few days before a major deadline can also ensure you’re holding yourself accountable.But if you’re struggling to keep track of all your new job opportunities, know that there are tools available to help. Personal career development platforms such as Teal can assist in tracking all your potential job applications, reminding you to send follow-up emails, and autofilling repetitive questions. Through AI technology, it can even analyze your resume and provide insights for areas for improvement as well as suggest position-specific bullet point achievements. Think of this tool as your accountability sidekick to your job application journey — one with guaranteed highs and lows.3. Find an Accountability PartnerEven with all these mini deadlines and sophisticated tools in place, you may not feel inspired during the job search. You may lose momentum after hearing a “no” from a specific company or finding out they decided to hire internally instead. Scanning LinkedIn for days upon days may leave you feeling more disappointed in what is available. These ruts are part of the process, unfortunately. And getting yourself out of them may mean finding someone that you can openly share and discuss your qualms with.


They say an accountability partner can help people with their health and wellness goals. Well, the same mindset can be used for your professional goals too. While this person may not be signing up for 6:00 a.m. spin classes with you, they can be there when you need a reliable sounding board. Having an outside accountability partner can keep you on task during the process, inspiring you even if things aren’t going as planned.Finding an accountability partner for the job search is a bit different than finding one for your health journey. You want to find someone that won’t let your current employer know that you’re looking elsewhere. Thus, a current manager or coworker isn’t necessarily the right option. At the same time, you want someone that understands the industry you’re applying for. Therefore, a family member or friend may also not work out well. A career mentor, outside job hunter, or former coworker are all great options, as long as you feel comfortable sharing the journey with them.Tips and TakeawaysStaying accountable while applying for a new job isn’t easy. Many people go months and months just browsing for prospective opportunities before they actually make any type of move toward this leap. Switching jobs within your current industry can make it all the more challenging. This is mainly because as you may not want to share your future career plans with your current manager. That said, there are tools and resources in place to keep you accountable throughout the process.Staying organized is crucial to success. You want to put your best foot forward, so missing an external facing deadline isn’t ideal. Some companies may take note of this and penalize you for future opportunities. Using a digital calendar and a software platform to organize all of your applications can be beneficial. Take note of who you are meeting with and see if you have any mutual connections via LinkedIn.


Most importantly, remember that you are interviewing for the position just as much as they are interviewing you. If you don’t fall in love with the company or team, it may not be the right fit. Stay positive, seek opportunities that excite you, and hold yourself accountable in order to land your dream position.Featured Image Credit: Photo by Sora Shimazaki; Pexels; Thank you. The post 3 Ways to Keep Yourself Accountable When Applying for New Jobs appeared first on Calendar.

87,3 Major Time Wasters for Leaders — and How to Overcome Them,"Jan 8, 2024",Brandy Ferrer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-major-time-wasters-for-leaders-and-how-to-overcome/467158,"
You've made it to the end of yet another 12-hour day, and as you think about all the scrambling, hustling and fire-fighting you did, you wonder — what exactly did I accomplish?You're not alone, many of us hustle all day, every day. We run from meeting to meeting, fire to fire, only to get to the end of the day feeling like a hamster on a wheel, exhausted and wondering where the time went.There is a better way, and it starts by understanding how you're spending your time and why you're spending it that way. Here are the three greatest time killers for leaders and how to overcome them.



Related: 101 Time Management Tips to Boost Productivity Every DayHow are you adding value?Chris is the CEO of a successful company. Chris's vision, ingenuity and tireless work are the heart of the company's success.


As the company celebrates 10 years in business, there's just one problem. Somewhere in the mix, Chris has moved away from focusing on the vision and has been swept up in the day-to-day, task-level minutia. Instead of focusing on strategy, planning or building the right relationships, he's wrapped up in hiring the receptionist, weighing in on trivial decisions and attending every. single. meeting.This is not the highest and best use of Chris's time. In focusing on task-level work instead of vision, Chris is no longer maximizing his value to the company. In fact, his desire to be actively involved in everything has become a detriment in the form of bottlenecks and dropped balls.Letting go of task-level work isn't easy. It feels good because it's familiar and because it's easy to see progress. When you busy yourself with easily accomplished tasks, you get that dopamine hit.But being busy isn't the same as adding value.If you are the visionary for the company, your value is in strategy, planning and relationship building, so that's where you should be spending your time.So the question is, how are you adding value? Here are some things to consider:Does the way you spend your time align with your role? Are you spending your time doing $17/hour work or $200/hour work?Does the way you spend your time play to your strengths and allow your team to play to theirs?Are you doing the work that is expected of you (from your team, your company, your board, investors, etc.) in your position?How are you moving the needle?Once you recognize where you're spending your time and the value you're adding (or not), you can make the necessary adjustments.Chances are, your team is comprised of smart, capable people. Trust in them to get the work done. Evaluate any task-level things on your plate. Is there an opportunity to delegate or cut back on your involvement? This allows you to offload meetings and projects in which your value isn't maximized.


Revisit how your day is structured so that you're working on the things that move the needle first and doing the things that suck the life out of your day later.Related: 4 Time Wasters That Kill Your ProductivityDelayed gratification and the to-do listI love to-do lists. More importantly, I love crossing things off my to-do list. Before starting my consultancy company, I lived and breathed that list, and I craved that feeling of accomplishment and pride when I could cross something off.As a leader, crossing 100 things off your list every day doesn't matter if they're not the right things. And I've learned the hard way that the things I'm responsible for simply cannot be successfully accomplished in a single day, a week, a month or longer.


Most of a leader's work is not task-level. Projects, planning and managing people are nuanced, continuous activities — not tasks to be crossed off a list.However, many leaders, as a means of showing their value and chasing the satisfaction of immediate accomplishment, hold on to task-level things way longer than they should. And those task-level things clog up the calendar and draw attention away from your most important work.It's time to rethink the to-do list. This requires a shift in mindset, from chasing the dopamine hit of crossing menial tasks off a list to embracing delayed gratification.Revisit how you make your to-do list. Make sure you're capturing the tasks or milestones that move projects forward. Break your projects down into weekly bites — that way you can see the incremental progress you're making and you get the dopamine hit of crossing things off. Play with the time frame of your task list. Instead of a daily to-do list, make a weekly, monthly and quarterly list.


Stop including never-ending, time-sucking tasks like ""catch up on email"" on your to-do list. You will never get caught up on email, Slack or team messages. Instead, be intentional about how and when you check messages. Designate specific times during the day when you will review emails, and set a timer for 30-45 minutes so you don't accidentally fall down the rabbit hole.Embrace the delayed gratification of completing bigger, more strategic projects. Make sure you celebrate those wins!Related: Need More Hours Every Day to Grow Your Business? Then Quit These 7 Time WastersProblem solver to the rescueLeaders tend to be great problem solvers. We love to swoop in with our creativity and vision to fix things or add perspective. Sounds great on paper, but in doing the swoop, leaders can miss details or context, delay decision-making, take on more than they can manage or make a bigger mess of things — all of which wastes precious time for you and your team.


Avoid jumping in to fix problems, especially those things you just don't have the bandwidth or expertise to see through. Remember those smart, capable people on your team? They're probably good problem solvers, too. Support and coach them when needed, and empower them to make decisions in their areas of expertise.Leaders who are clear on their value and understand the importance of maximizing their time and effectiveness as well as the effectiveness of their teams, drive efficiency and team engagement. Just as importantly, leaders with an eye on leveraging their value are able to get off the 12-hour-a-day hamster wheel and do the strategic, needle-moving work that matters.

89,Mobile Calendar Hacks for On-the-Go Productivity,"Jan 4, 2024",Angela Ruth,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/mobile-calendar-hacks-for-on-the-go-productivity/467886,"
Working from home sometimes turns into working from the road. You can send a Slack message before your plane takes off or reply to a few quick emails while in an Uber. No matter where you are in the world, having a smartphone means you have access to your work.This can benefit those looking to squeeze as many productivity hours into the day as possible. For business leaders, CEOS, and managers, having access to work means that any team member can contact you if needed. It also means that you can optimize how you spend your day. Working from a car, plane, or train may mean you won’t miss out on as much leisure or family time.And no matter if you’re traveling for business or pleasure, working from your phone is somewhat of a norm these days. Pulling out your laptop isn’t always possible, especially when you don’t have access to the Internet. This mobile style of work allows for better efficiency and, in some cases, productivity — as long as you are set up for success. Below are four mobile calendar hacks for on-the-go productivity.



1. Set RemindersYou’re out and about, running from one client meeting to the next when you forget to send your weekly status report. At the office, you have a desktop reminder pushed to notify you when you need to send your boss a quick update. However, when you’re on-the-go it’s easier for something like this to slip your mind completely. Setting calendar reminders on your phone is always a good idea.How you set reminders varies based on your phone and calendar platform. If you have an Apple iPhone and are using Apple’s Calendar, go to the app and create a new event. When entering the details, you’ll see a reminder setting option. The default is 15 minutes before the scheduled event. You can change this default under ‘settings.’


Android and iPhone users who are partial to Google Calendars will follow the same instructions. First, go to the Google Calendar app and select the plus button on the right-hand side of the screen. From there, go to the “reminder” section. You can set a date, time, and frequency for the reminder, such as every Friday morning to send your status report.The directions for Microsoft Outlook for Android and iPhone users are fairly similar. Open the Microsoft Outlook app and toggle over to the Calendar. Then, create a new event and fill in the appropriate details. Apple users will then open the “Remind me” dropdown menu to select a time to be reminded. Android users will scroll to the “alerts” dropdown menu to choose a time. Again, the default for both Apple and Android users is 15 minutes before the scheduled event.2. Share Your CalendarWhen you’re working from your phone outside the office, the last thing you need is a colleague to ask when you’re free for a Zoom meeting. Or, better yet, find out they’ve gone ahead and scheduled a team meeting during a time when you’re not available. Meeting scheduling and rescheduling are inefficient uses of time and downright annoying for everyone involved.Sharing your calendar with a specific set of coworkers or your entire team means others can see when you are truly free. It’s a more collaborative, efficient way to get things done and allows for better communication. A colleague can see, for example, when you’re planning to take off for the upcoming holidays. They won’t need to ask if you can take a call or if you can join for the client presentation.


All major digital calendar platforms, including Calendar, Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and Apple Calendar, allow for sharing. For each platform, you can select which calendar you want to share and with whom. When sharing, it’s always a good idea to use some restraint for your own privacy’s sake. Use the ‘free/busy’ setting to ensure your colleagues can’t see your personal information. When a project is complete or you move teams, adjust your shared settings to ensure only those needing access to your calendar have it.3. Use Offline ModeHave you ever needed to access your calendar but were unable to do so because of poor Internet connection? This can happen when you’re traveling or simply commuting to and from the office. In these instances, using your mobile calendar offline can be beneficial. Offline mode means that whatever you change, edit, or add to your calendar will be saved on your phone. It won’t sync to your other devices until you’re back on Wi-Fi.What you can edit and see during offline mode differs slightly for each calendar platform. For those using Google Calendar offline, you can find events, make changes, and respond to appointments. However, you aren’t able to send an email to attendees, and nothing will sync until you’re back online again. Offline mode is only available on the Gmail app, not the browser setting.Microsoft Outlook users can only see their primary calendar offline, with no sub or shared calendars. You can only view the immediate prior, current, and future months. Also, you may not receive all of your calendar reminders. Apple iCloud users can only edit and view calendar details if the calendar has recently synced to your iCloud account. So, although offline mode isn’t a permanent solution, it can be handy when you’re out and about.


4. Respond RapidlyWhen you receive a phone call from your iPhone or Android, do you ever send an automated reply when you cannot answer? These prewritten quick responses can make it easy when you only have a second to look down at who is calling. The same concept can be used for Google Calendar users on Android or iPhone devices.To utilize this rapid response feature, open up Google Calendar on your mobile phone and tap the menu icon on the upper-left-hand side. From there, go to ‘settings’ and then select ‘general.’ Scroll to ‘quick responses’ to view the default pre-written responses. To send a response, tap the envelope icon from the event, find your response, and hit send.The current default responses are: ‘Be there in about 10 minutes,’ ‘Go ahead and start without me,’ ‘Running just a couple minutes late,’ and ‘Sorry, I can’t make it. Will have to reschedule.’ Unfortunately, you can’t add a new response from the list, but you can edit a current response. Please think of the short sayings that you typically send and replace them with an existing one to meet your specific needs.TakeawaysHaving the ability to work from anywhere is a blessing. You are no longer tethered to your office desk to be working. With new developments in app software and better worldwide Internet coverage, you can be productive with your smartphone. Consider these calendar tips the next time you’re out and about, whether commuting or traveling internationally.

90,Privacy-Preserving Calendar Merging Tricks,"Jan 3, 2024",Howie Jones,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/privacy-preserving-calendar-merging-tricks/467832,"
You have a lot going on. You’re figuring out summer vacation plans in January — with your in-laws while scheduling yearly reviews for your team and juggling childcare pickup. Because of this, your digital calendars are likely some of your most-used apps. You may check your various calendars first thing in the morning, anticipating all you must complete that day. And while digital calendars won’t make your to-do list any shorter, they can help you accomplish more.That said, having multiple calendars can cause more confusion, so many choose to merge them. Merging calendars simply means combining digital calendars from multiple aspects of your life. You may have a shared Apple iCalendar that you share with your spouse for personal appointments. While your friends may all utilize a shared Google Calendar to schedule happy hours and dinners together. At work, you and your colleagues may use Microsoft Outlook for email and calendar purposes. You simplify your life by choosing one centralized platform to house all your calendars.Combining and Merging CalendarsCombining your personal and professional calendar can help you stay more organized and, therefore, more productive. You’ll spend less time flipping from one calendar to the next and more time checking items off your to-do list. There’s also less chance of missing an appointment or double-booking yourself. After merging, you can also share specific calendars with selective people. Sharing calendars can streamline collaboration and communication efforts while minimizing the chance of rescheduling meetings and events.



Now that you understand why you may want to consider merging and sharing your calendars, it’s important to understand the privacy implications of doing so. Whenever you share your calendar with someone else, you open your life to them. While this is typically fine with a partner or family member, it may not be something you want your colleagues to access.The bottom line? The more people with access to your calendar, the more likely you’re setting yourself up for a privacy leak.


Yet this shouldn’t deter you. With the right settings in place, you control who sees what on your calendar. Here are some top privacy-preserving calendar merging tricks to keep your information close to the heart.Opt-in for “Busy” SettingsYour calendar is your personal agenda. Unless you decide to share it with someone, you don’t want anyone to have access to it. And even if you do decide to share your calendar with colleagues, you may not want them to have a voyeuristic view into your entire life. They don’t need to know when your next dental cleaning is or where date night with your husband will be.Many digital calendars have a free/busy permission setting, letting you control what others can see. Calendar.com offers a “busy” setting to show the time block on your calendar, but it won’t show what the event actually is. Google Calendar users can also enable this free/busy setting by choosing the default visibility setting of your choice. A “private” event will hide all the details, including the title. To make all events on your calendar private, go to the “setting and sharing” section and click “see only free/busy.”Separate Your CalendarsAnother way to maintain some privacy is to share only select calendars with others. While merging everything into one calendar can benefit you, that doesn’t mean you have to share them with everyone. For instance, you may have a family calendar with extended family members to mark down birthdays and help schedule reunions. Having your nephew’s birthday on the same calendar as your work one may be distracting. Creating separate sub-calendars for different parts of your life can be an easy solution.


If you’re a Microsoft Outlook user, go to your desktop’s main “home” tab and hit “add calendar.” A new blank calendar for you to name and edit appropriately will appear. Apple iCalendar users will follow a similar pattern by going to “file” and hitting “new calendar.” After you’ve created and named your new calendar, you can go ahead and share it with whomever you please accordingly.Transfer Ownership of CalendarsIf you’re a leader or manager, you may still be owning some calendars you don’t necessarily need to own. As teams grow and organizational shifts occur, new people step up and into leadership roles. Even if you still need to be in attendance at some meetings, it doesn’t mean you need to have ownership over the team’s main calendar. But instead of deleting the calendar entirely, you can simply transfer ownership to another individual. This is one less calendar that you need to be concerned about from a privacy perspective.To make a transfer with Google Calendar, go to “my calendars” on the left-hand side of the desktop application. Then, add whoever you want to own the calendar by clicking “options” and “settings and sharing.” You can then “share with specific people” and enter the corresponding email addresses of the person or persons you want to hand control over to. Then go to “permissions” and select “make changes and manage sharing” before sending.If you use Apple iCal, export the calendar to a separate file before sending it to them. To export on an Apple computer, go to “file,” then “export,” and then “calendar archive.” The calendar will be exported to a .icbu file. The new calendar owner can import this information by going to “file,” “import,” and uploading the file. To avoid any privacy breaches, permanently delete the calendar file from your computer after the new owner has properly imported it.


Routinely Check Your SettingsLike most digital applications, calendar platforms are updated regularly to improve performance. New advancements and developments are intended to enhance how you use these applications and better protect your stored data. A new software update may mean that some of your settings are pushed back to default settings. While you may think that your “busy” setting is enabled, that may no longer be the case. That’s why whenever your calendar platform of choice updates, it’s a good idea to recheck your privacy settings and ensure a privacy-preserving calendar.But in addition to updates, checking your privacy settings also ensures you’re being selective about granted access. You may have needed to share a calendar with a colleague for a particular project. Now that the project has ended, they no longer need shareable access. Make a note in your calendar to check your settings at least once a quarter. Doing so will lessen the chance that the information you want to keep personal actually remains personal.Conclusion: Protect Your PrivacyData breaches, cybersecurity attacks, and phishing scams mean that privacy is top of mind these days. Fortunately, platforms like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Calendar.com are enhancing their security so you remain in control of your data. Before merging and sharing your calendars with others, be diligent. Opening up your personal calendar to just anyone on your team or your family may have repercussions down the line. Follow these tips and check your settings often to ensure your personal and professional lives remain separate.Feature Image Credit: Photo by Pixabey; PexelsThe post Privacy-Preserving Calendar Merging Tricks appeared first on Calendar.

2024 is just around the corner, and with it comes fresh starts, new goals, and a renewed focus on AI and productivity. Though, conquering your to-do list and maximizing your output is like running a 5K in your flip-flops.But here’s the thing. You have a secret weapon at your disposal. What’s more, likely — you’re already familiar with it.The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a sci-fi concept. Rapidly, it’s becoming a tool to streamline workflows and enhance efficiency. In the battle against procrastination and burnout, AI can automate everything from tedious tasks to optimizing your schedule.



In what ways can AI assist you in achieving your 2024 goals? Well, let’s take a closer look at how AI can supercharge your productivity.1. Tame the Email Beast with AI-powered AssistantsThe AI revolution has finally put an end to overflowing inboxes and endless email threads. According to some estimates, people check their email 36 times an hour, which means they spend around 23% of their work time on it. Suffice it to say, this is welcome news.While AI is not yet ready to work unsupervised, here are some ways you can use it to manage your email.
Inbox prioritization. You can let AI identify the most important emails based on past behavior, sender, and keyword searches. As a result, you can focus on critical and urgent emails first.
Smart replies and compose. You can even use AI to draft complete emails by understanding the context and suggesting appropriate phrasing for standard emails like “Thank you” or “I’ll get back to you shortly.”.
Unsubscribe easily. A one-click unsubscribe option is available after AI identifies spam and marketing emails.
Schedule emails. Are you tired of sending emails at 3 am? Artificial intelligence can schedule your email notification more conveniently, so no one (or you) is woken up by it.
Automate repetitive tasks. Setting up meetings, following up on emails, and managing your calendar can be handled by AI.
Stay organized. You can use AI to categorize your emails by sender, topic, or project. By doing this, you will be able to organize your inbox and find specific emails more easily in the future.

How can I build a successful human-AI productivity partnership?Here are a few tips to get the most out of AI.
Start small. Don’t try to revamp your entire workflow at once. Gradually incorporate more AI tools into your routine — starting with one or two.
Be clear about your goals. How will AI help you achieve your goals? You can choose the right tools and track your progress by defining your goals.
Don’t be afraid to experiment. Hundreds of AI tools are available, so don’t be afraid to experiment with a few to see which works best for you.
Focus on quality, not just quantity. Avoid getting caught up in productivity rat races. Take advantage of AI to work smarter, not harder, and prioritize quality over quantity.

93,Working Long Hours Leads to Burnout: Time to Ditch the Hustle Culture,"Jan 2, 2024",John Hall,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/working-long-hours-leads-to-burnout-time-to-ditch-the/467769,"
We often consider long hours to be a badge of honor in our fast-paced, achievement-oriented world. As a society, we glorify the “hustle culture,” where working late and sacrificing personal time are seen as necessary steps to success.Suppose, however, that this relentless drive for productivity is actually leading us to burnout and not brilliance.Let’s Talk Hustle CultureHustle culture, also known as grind culture or toxic productivity, means constantly striving for success and pushing yourself to the limit. With little regard for rest, self-care, or work-life balance, it’s characterized by intense focus on productivity, ambition, and success.



Some workplace environments or workplace cultures, such as entrepreneurship, promote hustle culture. As well as working beyond the normal 40 hours a week, it may also interfere with an individual’s personal life. Eventually, you may feel exhausted, stressed, and unfulfilled as a result of it. Ultimately, hustle culture leads to stress and fear, impairing you and/or your employees’ performance.Hustle culture manifests in the following ways:



Taking on excessive responsibilities out of obligation.
Being hesitant to use sick days and even your full lunch break.
Taking calls, texts, and emails after hours.
Although Elon Musk and Gary Vee advocate hustle culture, it can have negative effects on mental and physical health. Besides being detrimental to our health, hustle culture can lead to burnout, and increase social isolation. Furthermore, it can have adverse effects on mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and stress.The Paradox of ProductivityThe more hours you work, the more output you’ll get, right? That’s not true. This myth has been debunked by numerous studies, revealing a disturbing truth.According to a Stanford University study, productivity plummets once a workweek exceeds 50 hours. Over time, efficiency and output decline with every additional hour, with the 60-hour mark proving particularly detrimental.Moreover, a Qualtrics survey based on a Qualtrics survey for Slack revealed that forty percent of 10,333 workers work after hours regularly. Additionally, half said they are under pressure to do so mostly because otherwise they do not have enough time or have too many competing priorities, not because they wish to work more hours.


Employees who log off after the normal workday, however, scored 20 percent higher in productivity compared to those who felt obligated to continue working.In other words, think of it as running a marathon. During the first few miles, you start strong. After a while, fatigue sets in, your pace slows, and finishing becomes difficult.The same is true with work. You don’t come up with brilliant ideas or complete tasks with laser focus during those long, tiring hours. Often, you’re prone to errors and distractions, and are just trying to “get through it.”Additionally, work-life imbalance can negatively impact personal relationships and quality of life, resulting in decreased happiness and overall well-being.


Burnout: The Inevitable CrashThe inevitable consequence of chronic overwork is burnout, which is characterized by emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion. A variety of symptoms can be seen, including:
Physical symptoms. Insomnia, fatigue, headaches, and digestive problems.
Emotional symptoms. Loss of motivation, anxiety, irritability, cynicism.
Cognitive symptoms. Low creativity, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness.
The problem of burnout goes beyond personal health. There are also significant organizational implications:
An increase in absenteeism and presenteeism. Specifically, working while unproductive due to illness.
A higher turnover rate of employees.
A reduction in collaboration and innovation.
Work quality deteriorates and errors increase.
We Do We Fall into the Hustle Culture TrapSo why do we continue to believe in the myth of the productive overachiever? This cultural blind spot is caused by several factors:
The cult of productivity. To-do lists, time management tools, and productivity hacks fill our days. That pressure to “do” continually makes us want to work longer and accomplish more.
Social norms. Long working hours are often celebrated in our workplaces, implying that dedicated employees are measured by their physical presence rather than by their actual performance.
The “always-on” culture. Our inboxes are constantly flooded with emails and notifications, and we are expected to be available 24 hours a day. A sense of urgency is created by this, making it difficult to truly disconnect.
FOMO. In order to keep up with others, we work long hours and achieve success. Competitive pressure can lead to extended work hours, even when they aren’t actually productive.
The glorification of overwork. For ambitious and driven individuals, hustle culture can be hard to resist, as it celebrates the idea of working hard.
Personal aspirations. The desire to constantly prove one’s worth is common among individuals who define their self-worth through their work.
Breaking Free from the Hustle TrapThe first step towards challenging the hustle culture? Raising awareness about its negative effects. It is important to educate ourselves and others about the science behind overwork and its adverse effects.


Awareness alone, however, is not sufficient. We need to break free from the myth of the marathon worker, so how do we develop a culture that is sustainable and well-balanced?You can take the following steps as an individual or as an organization:For Individuals:
Set clear boundaries between work and personal life. Make sure your work and personal lives are clearly separated with set schedules. When you are not at work, avoid checking work emails or making calls.
Invest in your well-being. You should make time for activities that will nourish your body, mind, and soul. You could do this by exercising, meditating, spending time in nature, or connecting with family and friends. Ensure that you get enough sleep and eat nutritious foods as well.
Prioritize ruthlessly. All tasks are not created equal. Decide which tasks are most important to you and focus on them first. Free up your time and energy by delegating or eliminating less important tasks.
Learn to say no. In case you’re already overloaded, don’t hesitate to decline additional work politely.
Take breaks. It is essential to take regular breaks to maintain focus and prevent burnout. Try moving around, walking outside, or simply closing your eyes for a few minutes.
Practice time management. A 40-hour week and eight-hour day are advocated by Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. “That’s all you need,” he said. “If you can turn that into having 2–3–4 hours of uninterrupted time, you’ll run circles around people who are working twice as long, just thrashing all over the place, spinning their wheels, and producing a lot of smoke.” Rather than aimlessly working long, hard hours, Hansson believes time management is more effective.
Be open and honest in your communication. If you need assistance, discuss your workload and concerns with your supervisor.
Disconnect from technology. The constant checking of emails and notifications creates unnecessary stress. Avoid checking work-related notifications outside of working hours by scheduling specific times.
Challenge the culture. Make your voice heard about unhealthy work practices and promote a culture that values sustainable productivity and well-being.
For Organizations:Individuals are not the only ones responsible for creating a healthier work culture. It is also the responsibility of organizations to promote work-life balance and prevent burnout.The following are some things companies can do:



Implement flexible work arrangements. You can allow employees to work remotely, set flexible hours, or take compressed workweeks.
Encourage employees to take time off. Help employees recharge and disconnect by providing paid time off and break rooms.
Set realistic expectations.  Make sure employees know what they’re supposed to do and don’t overload them.
Focus on output, not just hours worked. Do not evaluate employees by the number of hours they work but by their achievements.
Create a culture of well-being. Encourage open communication about mental health with your team. You can also provide resources and support for mental health, as well as opportunities for stress management.
Lead by example. In order to set a good example, managers should take breaks, use their vacation time, and avoid working after hours.
Overall, workplace cultures that value well-being and productivity can lead to happier, healthier, and more productive employees.ConclusionIgnore the myth that long hours lead to productivity. Setting healthy boundaries and prioritizing our well-being will help us create a more fulfilling and sustainable work life. It’s time for us to break free from the hustle trap and embrace a work-life balance that allows us to achieve true success and productivity.Keep in mind that your health and well-being are the most valuable assets you have. Put them first before a few extra hours at work.FAQsIs it true that working long hours leads to burnout more than productivity?It is clear from research and data that long working hours are inversely proportional to productivity and directly related to burnout. In spite of the fact that individual cases may differ, several studies support this idea:



According to the already mentioned Slack survey, those who work extra hours are 20% less productive than those who stop working at the end of their standard work day, often a 9-to-5. Moreover, they reported 2.1 times more work-related stress, 1.7 times less satisfaction with their work environment, and two times more burnout.
Burnout is significantly increased by working more than 40 hours per week, with the effect becoming stronger at 60+ hours per week.
In addition to contributing to stress and burnout, employees who work long hours often skip breaks.
Why do long hours lead to burnout instead of productivity?This phenomenon is influenced by several factors:
Decreased cognitive function. Working long hours affects focus, problem-solving skills, and creativity negatively.
Increased stress and anxiety. Working tirelessly can cause emotional exhaustion and cynicism as a result of undue pressure.
Work-life imbalance. Working excessively disrupts personal life, causing stress and negatively impacting overall health.
Diminished motivation. The result of working beyond capacity is often lower morale and decreased motivation, which results in unproductive hours.
What are the risks of always working hard?When you’re passionate about what you do, working long hours may not seem like a burden at first. It is risky to stretch yourself too thin over the long term.Working over 55 hours a week increases your risk of stroke by 35% and heart disease by 17%, according to the WHO.There is even an official cause of death for overworking (known as karoshi) in Japan. Due to guilt and work pressure, employees who work long hours and don’t take any time off suffer from karoshi.


Are there any exceptions to this rule?Depending on the nature of your work, some professions require occasional extended hours, such as startup founders, healthcare, or emergency services. To prevent burnout even in these cases, regular breaks, proper scheduling, and strong support systems are essential.What if I’m already experiencing burnout?When you feel burned out, you should:
Seek professional help. Support and strategies for coping with burnout can be provided by a therapist.
Reduce workload. It may be possible to delegate tasks, take a leave of absence, or change your role with the help of your manager, colleagues, or clients.
Focus on self-care. Make rest, relaxation, and healthy activities a priority.
Connect with others. Don’t be afraid to talk about your struggles with family and friends who are supportive.

However, these are often handy tools to utilize — like reminder notifications.When you create an event in your calendar app, you can create a reminder. This will appear as a push notification, making a sound and popping up on your screen, whether computer or phone. This kind of notification will ensure you won’t forget about an upcoming event or deadline.



Additionally, you have several options for when to make this reminder go off. It could be anywhere from five minutes to multiple hours before the event. Most calendar software also lets you have more than one notification for the same event. This means you could have one reminder go off an hour before, then a second 30 minutes beforehand. This aspect is very customizable, so you can remind yourself in the way that works best for you.2. Color-CoordinateThere’s a reason why color-coordinating is such a popular method of organization. It’s super easy and can make any system more efficient. This is especially true when it comes to your calendar, as well.


How exactly do you go about color-coding your calendar? Whether you use paper or virtual, you can categorize types of tasks by color. For example, you could use blue for meetings, green for doctor appointments, and red for work deadlines. Whenever you add an event in one of those categories to your calendar, use its color. Pretty much every calendar software has this feature, with multiple colors to choose from.Using a color scheme to organize your calendar makes identifying events and priorities easier. You can skim through your events to look for something specific, all through looking for its color. Some software also allows you to look at one category at a time, making your search even quicker.3. Peek at Your Calendar AnalyticsOne of the best ways to make your calendar more efficient is by checking its AI-generated analytics. This is a fairly new concept to scheduling software. Calendar analytics are essentially a breakdown of how you spend your time.Not every software has this feature available yet, though Google Calendar and Calendar offer this. Calendar’s version contains helpful assessments of your time, breaking down meeting distributions and the people and places you frequent most. This can help you realize what is taking up most of your time, and you can react accordingly.


This is the easiest way to get an overall glance at how you’ve been spending your time. And if you don’t like what you see, you can take action to change up your schedule or time management. This is especially helpful if you manage a business or team within your workplace.4. Share Your CalendarOdds are, you work with other people at your job. To get more done as a team, learning how to streamline your time together is important. So much time is wasted weekly that you probably don’t even realize. This often occurs from too many meetings or taking a while to plan a meeting or project.One of the most challenging group efforts is finding a time when everyone can meet. Each team member has their own schedule and priorities, which can easily clash. However, this is where a shared calendar system can save the day.Some calendar software allows you to grant others access to your schedule so they can see when you’re busy and free. When you can look at everyone’s calendars in a team, you won’t bump into the age-old problem of having to ask for availability.


5. Use a To-Do ListA to-do list may sound so old school, but it’s a tried-and-true method of efficiency and organization. By writing down all you need to do in a set period of time, you can visualize all your tasks. You’re less likely to forget something this way, plus checking off an item is so rewarding. While a paper list works fine, you can upgrade to the 21st-century version: Google Calendar’s Tasks.This feature combines an online calendar and a to-do list into one. Having these two aspects of time management systems in one place helps keep yourself extra organized. Pulling up Google Calendar means you’ll have access to your calendar and tasks in the same window.Create a task by clicking on the blue Task icon on the right-hand side of the calendar. You can name your item, add details, and mark when it’s due. You can have Tasks remind you when something needs to be done. You can also add subtasks to any item, breaking up a project into smaller pieces for ease of use.Adding a task will show up on your calendar like a regular event, but clicking on it will reveal its to-do-like nature. This is how you can put more detailed events on your calendar. For example, using Tasks is a good option if you want to mark a deadline on your schedule. This way, you can open it up and see all the project’s details in a way that a calendar event wouldn’t cut it.


6. Sync Your Personal and Work CalendarsYou’ve probably heard the phrase, “Don’t mix business with pleasure.” Or, maybe you’ve received the popular advice to “leave your personal life at home” when you get to work. While these can be good strategies to create a work/life balance, mixing your calendars can also help.Syncing your personal calendar with your work calendar doesn’t mean combining those two aspects of life. Instead, doing this can actually help prevent you from double-booking or overreaching work into personal time. For example, you can schedule around that dinner party or your kid’s school event if you can see everything in the same space.Even if you use two different calendar software for work and your personal life, you might be able to sync them. Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Apple Calendar, and Calendar all have ways to integrate with other scheduling programs. You’ll never have to look back and forth between two calendars again!Do Some DiggingThere are so many calendar apps out there with so many features that it’s impossible to list them all. Every software has its own unique features to maximize productivity and efficiency. Some programs are designed with teams in mind, like Microsoft’s and Google’s. Whatever you use, make sure you’re exploring its features to make your schedule more efficient. If your calendar isn’t working for you, it’s not doing enough. Take some time to look at all your scheduling software options and familiarize yourself with them. You’ll be boosting your productivity and efficiency in no time.

95,"Stay Active, Practice Mindfulness: How To Create a Healthy Schedule and Routine","Dec 29, 2023",Carma Khatib,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/stay-active-practice-mindfulness-how-to-create-a-healthy/467712,"
An array of sweet treats, snacks, and desserts after every meal. A dinner table lined with an assortment of meats, freshly baked breads, and warm roasted potatoes and vegetables. Drinks galore, from mulled wine, sparkling wine, and fruit cocktails, to warm cups of cocoa during cold evenings.Whether sugary or savory, the holidays are typically a time of temptations, presenting us with multiple opportunities around every nook and corner to overindulge in a variety of food, snacks, and beverages.From the seemingly endless dinner parties and lunch dates to the office holiday party and trays of steamy cookies to sample when out shopping, the holiday season is a time of celebration and tantalization.



Each year, as the holiday period rolls around, we’re often conditioned to throw our regular exercise routine out of the window, only to reap the repercussions thereof in the new year. And once we’re back in our normal routine, and notice that our pants are sitting a bit more snuck than usual, we often feel a sense of regret towards ourselves.Creating a Healthy Schedule During the Holiday SeasonWhile the holidays are a time of celebration, we often neglect our physical and mental well-being. It’s not just you, a lot of people tend to overindulge during the festive period.One survey from The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center found that nearly two-thirds of those surveyed claim that they tend to overindulge in food. Even more, around 45 percent said they typically take a break from their exercise routine, with more than half saying they feel tired, and have less time for themselves.In fact, in another study, some two in five American adults say that their stress levels increase during November and January compared to other times of the year.Whether it’s having more time to spend at home with family, simply clearing your schedule, getting some alone time, and finally tackling those items on your to-do list, the holidays are usually busier and filled with all sorts of temptations, leaving little time to focus on our own needs.Peter McMullin, President of Sibu Sea Berry Therapy, a specialty supplements and functional foods company says, “Although the holidays are meant to be celebrated with friends and family, it’s also a time to reflect on the year that was and begin to plan for the new year. Setting new goals and looking towards ways you can improve yourself.”


Peter and his brother, Dusty McMullin, are two second-generation entrepreneurs working at their father, Bruce McMullin’s company, Sibu, which he founded — back in 2004.Time to deck the halls and get yourself back into action, setting boundaries, and learning how to schedule exercise, practice mindfulness, and have more balance this holiday season.Plan an Active Holiday SeasonWhile the work year and all the stress and anxiousness that comes with it is now behind you, you can begin to look towards planning an active holiday season that allows you enough time in your day to do more active things, such as exercising, walking or going to the gym, but still have time on your hands to rest.If you’re planning a staycation this year, start by planning a weekly workout schedule for several days of the week. If you already have a workout schedule, try and follow through with it as much as possible. For those looking to be a bit more active, see how you can fit a workout or two into your schedule instead of sitting around the whole day.For people who may be traveling this holiday season, try to plan your itinerary to include things such as exercise, whether that’s walking or going for a run. Make sure to pack the right activewear, such as running shoes, pants, and a comfortable shirt.Have a Balanced Meal PlanAs already mentioned, we tend to feel extremely tempted with all sorts of food and drinks during this time of the year. While it’s not always easy turning a blind eye to these temptations, try and incorporate a more balanced meal plan throughout normal weeks.Instead of having something heavy for every meal, plan your meals to incorporate a variety of fresh produce, lean meats, low-carb dishes, and drink lots of water.According to Dusty, Vice President of Operations at Sibu, he says, “Food is our medicine. Having a balanced meal allows us to feel good and energized. Combining that with exercise ensures we stay fit and active without overindulging unnecessarily.”


Try to source healthier alternatives and purchase products that are lower in sugar and are made from natural and organic ingredients. While it may be easier, and sometimes cheaper, to buy something pre-made, rather opt to make things yourself at home so that you know how much you’re consuming.Practice a Steady Healthcare RoutineThe cold weather, lack of sun, and shorter days can demotivate anyone. Having to spend most of your days indoors or inside a car while traveling can steadily take a toll on your body.Taking a bit of time each day to incorporate a steady healthcare routine can help keep you in shape while being able to care for your well-being. Although exercise is perhaps the best medicine, other things, such as moving your body regularly, stretching before and after sitting for long hours, and even a proper skincare routine can make you feel more relaxed and in touch with your body’s needs during the festive period.Doing something small each time, whether that’s doing a home workout or trying to remember to apply your moisturizer before bed and layering some SPF during the day, will help keep your body and skin in top shape.More than this, setting up these small things will help you create a routine in your daily schedule and teach you how to foster new healthy habits, such as good skincare or regular exercise, even if it’s only for several minutes of the day.Keep Your Eating Habits in CheckFood forms a big part of the holiday season. We’re often prompted to indulge in syrupy pancakes for breakfast, copious amounts of warm beverages, and hefty lunches and dinners. Our plates are stacked, and you somehow always find room for dessert afterward.Yes, there are plenty of opportunities to indulge. However, it’s also important to remember that having a more balanced approach will allow you to notice what foods you should be eating more of and which you should keep to a minimum.Make sure you start every day with a healthy breakfast, with servings of grains, protein, and other important nutrients, such as dairy and fiber. You can incorporate fresh fruit in your morning breakfast, allowing you to pick and choose from various food options before your day even starts.


Snacking during the day is fairly common, but instead of diving into a tin of cooking and popcorn, try and opt for lighter, less sugary products such as fruits, wholegrain biscuits, or even a healthy sandwich. Plan to incorporate an assortment of vegetables and other fresh items at the dinner table for each meal. Skip the dessert every second night, or replace that with a healthier alternative.Overconsumption of alcohol could also be another contributing influence. Try to avoid drinking more than usual or even too much. Replace alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic options, or perhaps a fresh juice with less sugar. Remember to drink plenty of water throughout the day and replace your coffee with tea now and again.Remember to Take Your Supplements and VitaminsThe early mornings and late nights, having a busy schedule, and trying to balance work-life responsibilities can leave you feeling tired and often exhausted. Many U.S. adults and younger children now use supplements and vitamins as part of their daily healthcare routine, as a way to improve their well-being and general health.New studies have shown that more than half of American consumers now take specialty supplements, including things such as natural Omega-7 supplements, Omega-3s, melatonin, and fiber.“Changes in lifestyle and diet over recent years have seen more people opting to consume specialty and non-specialty supplements for an added dose of energy to help give them a bit of a boost during the day,” says Peter McMullin. He continues sharing, “Our lives are already busy; supplements and vitamins help us feel better and keep our bodies in check. They wane of illness, and protect us against disease, especially when we’re more susceptible to things such as the common flu.”Whether you’re taking a dietary supplement or even a vitamin, remember to take these now and again or at least once per day. Please keep them in a place where they can always be visible, such as in the kitchen or your bedroom. You can even set a reminder for yourself on your cell phone to ensure you don’t forget about them.Keep Your Mental Health in CheckDuring this time of the year, many people are prone to experience higher levels of stress and anxiety, often due to feelings of isolation, being overwhelmed with a busy schedule, or having to juggle work and family responsibilities at the same time.One survey of around 1,000 Americans found that eight in ten feel more stressed during this time of the year compared to other months.


More than this, financial stress, in more recent years due to the sudden rise in the cost of living, has also become a burdensome experience for many people. In one survey, a robust 75 percent of Americans said they are experiencing stress from rising prices and holiday spending.Whether you’re feeling stressed, anxious or simply overwhelmed, remember to take time for yourself. Schedule in downtime when you need it, and get out more during the day. Take yourself out for lunch, or give yourself a break from technology, by walking or spending a few minutes in the park each day.How to Focus on Your Mental Health During the Holidays:Know when You’re Feeling TriggeredThere may be moments when someone or something might trigger you, leaving you to spiral endlessly out of control. At best, it’s advised to identify the things that trigger you and try to avoid them as much as possible.Have a Mindful BreakawayBreak away from the ordinary or your routine. Give yourself, and your mind a break when you need it. Your mindful breakaway can be something small and simple, such as baking or even going for a drive and listening to music. Reading can also be another great way for you to feel more relaxed and shut out all the noise.Talk to SomeoneIn times when you’re feeling anxious, have someone you can talk to. Whether this might be your partner, a friend, or even a family member, keep these people close when you need them the most.Keep in Contact with A ProfessionalFor those of us who might be seeing a professional and licensed therapist, try to contact them during the holiday season. Even if you’re not heading in for a face-to-face session each week, try to arrange to meet virtually or at least have a phone call now and again. Make additional arrangements beforehand, ensuring you will always have contact with them when necessary, and see if you can book sessions far in advance.Don’t Have High ExpectationsThere will be times when things don’t go as planned, and that’s normal. Don’t have high expectations for everything that may need to happen during the holiday season, as this could only lead to feelings of disappointment. Make sure to have an open mind about everything, and approach each problem or scenario with a fresh perspective.Go Easy on YourselfWhatever your plans may be this holiday season, be easy on yourself. Don’t overbook yourself, only leaving you feeling overwhelmed, tired, and constantly having to put out multiple fires all at once. Even when incorporating exercise into your routine, start slow and gradually build yourself up to something more advanced. Be patient, and focus on the things that fill you with feelings of joy and contentment.


Spend Alone Time with Your PartnerHaving an entire house or packed schedule could easily mean that you have less time to spend with your partner alone. Now and again, try to work in a few hours where just the two of you can do something by yourselves. Go for dinner, or take yourselves out for a quick coffee. Read together, or watch a movie. Go for a walk, and take the dogs with you. The more minor things matter at the end of the day.Set BoundariesThis may be one of the more challenging things, but setting boundaries with your family and friends can also be another way to keep yourself from feeling overwhelmed. Learn to say no to things and stick to the things you think are necessary for you to feel relaxed. If someone is overstepping a boundary, don’t react, instead communicate this with them in a calm way.UnplugOne of the best ways to feel more relaxed is to unplug yourself completely. Switch off your phone and computer. Find a quiet space where you can relax and feel safe. Take time to do nothing and think of nothing. Make more time for yourself, unplug, and give yourself a moment to relax, even during the holiday season’s chaos.Keep a RoutineAnother way you can keep your mental health in check is by setting up a routine and trying to keep to it as much as possible, or at least the parts you are comfortable with. Whether it’s going to the gym in the morning or scheduling a few hours for yourself, whatever your routine may be, try and keep to this as much as possible, as this will help you foster better boundaries with others and establish healthy habits.Final ThoughtsNow that the holiday season is here, it’s time to keep our health and well-being as one of our top priorities. Try to keep a healthy and steady diet, incorporating fresh ingredients and keeping overindulgence to a minimum.The best way to feel healthier is to have balance in your life. Make sure you track what you’re eating and drinking, and combine this with a good exercise routine. Give yourself some time to rest, and schedule a few hours to rest now and again.Before you know it, the holidays will be over, and you’ll be left feeling more exhausted and perhaps a little bit heavier than before. Try to foster healthy habits and develop a routine that works best for your needs.Featured Image Credit: PexelsThe post Stay Active, Practice Mindfulness: How To Create a Healthy Schedule and Routine appeared first on Calendar.

97,Hygge Your Way to Productivity: 10 Danish Words to Elevate Your Workplace,"Dec 28, 2023",Deanna Ritchie,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/hygge-your-way-to-productivity-10-danish-words-to-elevate/467651,"
Cultivating a positive and productive work environment is increasingly paramount in an age of stress and burnout. What better nation to learn from than the Danes, consistently ranked among the happiest in the world?Don’t believe me? According to the World Happiness Report 2023, Denmark ranked second among the happiest countries. Furthermore, US News ranked it fifth among countries viewed as happy by global survey respondents.So, why are the Danes so happy? This is where Danish vocabulary comes into play.



The Danish language is filled with words that capture the essence of well-being and togetherness. So, is your workplace ready for a dose of hygge (pronounced hoo-gah)? Here are 10 Danish words that can enhance your productivity, workplace, and life.1. HyggeAs explained in a previous Calendar article, Hygge is derived from the Norwegian word hugga, meaning ‘to comfort’ or ‘to console,’ similar to the English hug.” In addition, it is a defining characteristic of Danish culture.


This relates to a feeling of coziness, contentment, and well-being caused by simple pleasures and meaningful connections. It’s not just about aesthetics; it’s about creating a safe, welcoming environment where people feel comfortable being themselves. Think of flickering candlelight, warm blankets, and steaming hot cocoa accompanied by laughter.Hygge can be incorporated into the workplace by encouraging team bonding activities such as potluck lunches, game nights, or even just taking breaks to chat and drink tea.2. ArbejdsglædeDanish job satisfaction is so serious that it’s referred to by a singular word — arbejdsglæde (“ahh-bites-gle-the”). Though Danish in origin, it is understood throughout the Nordics to mean “happiness at work.”It consists of two parts:



Arbejde: Means work
Glæde: Means joy or happiness
The Danish work ethic encapsulates flexible hours, flat organization structures, and low power distances, all focusing on helping workers thrive – not just survive.Its meaning, however, goes beyond simply describing job satisfaction. It can also refer to the satisfaction of a job well done at the end of a long day.3. PytThis is a Danish cultural concept that is pronounced “pid.” It is usually used as an interjection to convey that something does not matter or carry much weight.It means “never mind” or “don’t worry about it.” These expressions, however, fail to convey its positive connotations.


As a stress management technique, Pyt focuses more on cultivating healthy thoughts. Most commonly, it is a reaction to a daily inconvenience, frustration, or error.“Pyt buttons” are used by Danish teachers to assist students in letting go of minor frustration. As a result of this approach, children learn to cope with small setbacks and to accept that nothing is perfect.Similarly, ‘Pyt’ is a Scandinavian word for happiness. A significant aspect is stepping back and resetting your mind and soul.4. OverskudIn its literal sense, overskud, pronounced owa-skood, means simply “surplus.” But when used descriptively, overskud refers to someone capable of achieving extraordinary things because they have extra energy, headspace, or capacities.


A healthy mind and body and the motivation to make extra efforts are the keys to achieving overskud. In other words, delivering a great result after multiple all-nighters that aren’t sustainable isn’t overskud. The same goes for buying expensive presents for colleagues and family members.Moreover, the word is used when people are incapable ble of tackling an event, task, or obligation.Instead of saying “I’m swamped,” Danish people might say they don’t have enough overskud to go to a party or have mulled wine to celebrate the holidays. Simply put, it means that something sounds fun, and you’d like to do it but lack of energy to do it.5. UmageThe word umage (pronounced oo-may) means to put in that extra effort to make someone else happy. It may be in the work we do, in the home we live in, or in the relationships we have. The essence of umage is giving someone an exceptional performance or great experience by pulling on your inner strength.


Whether at work or at home, it can be easy to get into a routine of doing what needs to be done. When work or chores aren’t going well, it can be easy to shrug them off and say “it’s good enough.” However, umage means going the extra mile to be the best.Is this a call to embrace perfectionism or an invitation to overwork yourself? Of course not. It’s all about being the best version of yourself that you can be.6. SamfundssindThe Danish word samfundssind roughly translates to “community-mindedness” in English. The word is a compound noun made up of the words ‘samfund’ (society) and ‘sind’ (mind). It dates back to 1936, but Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen brought it back into prominence during the pandemic.“As Danes, we usually seek community by being close together,” she said. “Now, we must stand together by keeping apart. We need samfundssind.”


It is possible for a sense of community to be expressed through participation in activities that are beneficial to the community. It is possible for these activities to be informal, spontaneous, or locally arranged.For example, you could volunteer during your downtime or organize a coat drive at work. As a leader, you should ensure that your team is continuously learning and upgrading their technology skills.7. FaglighedThe term ‘faglighed’ refers to the knowledge, skills, and competencies one possesses within a particular subject, field, craft, or occupation.In addition, it can refer to:



An individual’s knowledge, skills, and assumptions about a specific field, area, or occupation.
Areas of scientific or academic study.
Fulfilling academic goals to the best of one’s ability.
A changing understanding of what faglighed is.
It is for this reason that this word is so brilliant. Essentially, it means that everyone brings a unique set of skills to work, which can be applied to varying degrees depending on the situation. In English, “professional capability” or “integrity” would be the closest synonyms.As a result of incorporating “faglighed” into our everyday language, we can acknowledge that we all possess valuable skills and knowledge and discuss how to make them as applicable as possible to the workplace.8. LegeAlthough lege has many meanings in Danish, it refers to playing when there are few rules, allowing for creativity. The term lege, pronounced layg, differs from spille, which refers to playing an instrument or a game.Lego derives its name from the Danish words ‘leg godt.’Despite not being top of mind, play is essential for adults, too.According to research, play at work reduces fatigue, boredom, stress, and burnout in individuals. Aside from work, play can add joy to life, relieve stress, boost learning, and give you a sense of connection to others and your surroundings.Therefore, make time for informal games, team-building activities, and even impromptu dance parties.9. TaknemmelighedThe Danish word Taknemmelighed means “thankfulness” or “gratitude.” It stems from the Latin word gratus, which means to be thankful or pleasing.


There is a belief that gratitude is a character trait that is essential for our well-being. According to research, gratitude changes our brains and how we view the world. Being grateful may reduce our stress levels, help us sleep better, and make us more optimistic.As a leader, you should express your appreciation for your team’s hard work and contribution in order to motivate and inspire loyalty. Also, be sure to celebrate the success of your team, large and small, and say “thank you.”If you aren’t in a leadership position, you can start a gratitude journal and write “thank you” cards to family, friends, or colleagues.10. SparringSparring is a so-called “false friend.” In other words, it exists both in English and Danish, but has a different meaning in each language.


Originally, sparring meant boxing with someone in both languages. In English, sparring can also refer to friendly competition or a verbal challenge and is defined as having serious but friendly arguments. However, sparring has more positive connotations in Danish because it is a form of mutual support and inspiration.Basically, sparring refers to exchanging ideas but can also apply to other forms of supportive exchange. For example, sparing with your spouse or business partner over a budget.The Bottom LineTake advantage of these simple tips and Danish words to live a happier and more fulfilling life, both at work and away from it. It’s all about enjoying the simple things in life, connecting with others, and embracing the warmth of friends and family.FAQsWhy adopt Danish words in the workplace?In any workplace, Danish culture emphasizes concepts such as well-being, collaboration, and balance. By adopting specific Danish words, you can:



Express nuanced ideas. In Danish, some words express unique concepts without direct English equivalents.
Promote positive values. Danish words often emphasize a healthy work-life balance, collaboration, and well-being.
Foster creativity and innovation. It is possible to spark fresh thinking and encourage innovative solutions by introducing new words.
How can we incorporate these words into our workplace culture?A few practical tips are listed below:
Use them naturally in conversations. You can replace “skill” with “faglighed,” “feedback” with “sparring,” and “balance” with “overskud.”
Highlight examples. Describe situations in which employees displayed courage, sparred productively, or maintained overskud.
Embed them in company values. You can stress the importance of these words in your company’s mission statement or core values.
Organize themed events. Host “Faglighed Fridays” for experts to share their expertise or “Sparring Sessions” for collaborative problem-solving.
Won’t this sound forced or gimmicky?As long as it is authentic, no.Make sure you understand the true meaning behind every word and use it in everyday situations organically. It’s not just about using buzzwords, but also enriching your vocabulary.Are there any Danish words I should avoid using in the workplace?Although Danish is generally lighthearted, some words might have specific connotations or contexts. In order to avoid any misunderstandings, use positive and universal concepts.Image Credit: Munis Asadov; PexelsThe post Hygge Your Way to Productivity: 10 Danish Words to Elevate Your Workplace appeared first on Calendar.

99,4 Christmases? How to Keep Everyone Happy During the Holidays And Christmas,"Dec 22, 2023",Abby Miller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/4-christmases-how-to-keep-everyone-happy-during-the/467510,"
The holidays can get tricky once your family starts growing and you build new relationships with friends. You want to see your parents and your in-laws. You, of course, can’t wait to hang out with your friends. Your kids may have parties and gatherings to coordinate. And what about that work party? If you don’t have a strategy, you’ll start to feel pulled in a million directions, and you’ll start dreading the holidays and Christmas.To avoid this potential gloom and doom, you can devise a plan. You might have four Christmases to celebrate, but you aren’t four people. You’re only one person, albeit very empowered, so you’ve got to prioritize and prepare. Then, set boundaries, be firm, and get everyone on the same page. Finally, get organized and determine that you will have a lovely, fun-filled, dare–you-say relaxing and restful holiday. You deserve it!1. Prioritize Your Christmas PlansYes, the first thing you need to do is prioritize. You cannot do everything; face it, you have no time machine, and you can’t clone yourself. You’ll have to say no to some holiday fun. There’s always next year for that Nutcracker ballet or this tree-lighting event. You’ll also probably have to get creative with certain gatherings. Consider having a short brunch with some of your friends instead of dinner and drinks that will last all night, for example.



You can be firm and direct and still be warm when you let your people know what your holiday calendar will allow. You’ll also have to be honest with yourself — there are some family members you’d rather not spend a long weekend with. There will also be friends you’re dying to spend a day with, but you’ll have to squeeze them in for coffee. Look at your calendar in advance, and then be realistic about what you have time for. The word “no” can often make you feel much better and much cheerier than you realize.2. Create a Family Christmas Calendar and Keep It UpdatedA shared calendar is one of the most incredible inventions technology has offered busy working people in the modern age. Most calendar apps today, like Calendar, Microsoft Calendar, and Google Calendar, offer you this option. And while a shared calendar option is excellent all year long, it can be a lifesaver during the holidays. If you haven’t already, create a shared family calendar for everyone attending the same events and gatherings. This list could include your immediate family, your significant other, or a large friend group.


Once you have the shared calendar, add the events you’ve all agreed on. Be sure to include the date and time, of course, but also any specifics. Whether the event is casual or dressy and whether it will involve a meal or require warm clothing are essential details. Also, if anyone on the calendar is expected to bring a gift, a dish, or anything else, add that to the event post. When you write every detail like this, people will have a resource to refer back to as the date approaches. It will also save you from having to constantly remind people of everything.3. Design a Single Party Template for All Christmas EventsWhether you have 4 Christmases or 24, you can create a single master template for holiday events. In your calendar app, create a template with all the essentials you’ll need followed by blank spaces to be filled in. Then, for each separate party, you can send this template out to everyone attending. Each attendee can participate, making the event a collaborative one. Your list can include items like your theme, what foods to bring or have catered, the location, gift exchange ideas, and more.When you get everyone involved, you can relax a bit. You don’t have to be the one making all the decisions. Once collaborations are complete and everyone has agreed on the items, you can create a final, filled-out template. Then, you can add that template to your shared calendar. Better yet, you can assign that task to someone else. Now, you’ve got everyone on the same page and feeling involved.4. Have FunWhen you arrive at one of your holiday events and are fully prepared because you were so organized, have fun. Indeed, make it a point to create fun experiences. Remember those lists you helped design with ideas for games, food, and gift exchanges? Get involved and ensure the good times roll. Technology is a beautiful, wonderful, powerful tool, but it can also be a curse. Many holiday gatherings can become dull, with everyone staring at their smartphones.


Take it upon yourself to ensure the holidays are happy, and you’ll likely watch others follow your lead. Get the games started and throw yourself into them — don’t be afraid to be silly or to lose. Gather everyone around the table, or tables, to eat the food you all chose and brought. Remark on various dishes, and force yourself to step out of your comfort zone and try new things. Scheduling and organizing can be beautiful, but you should also ensure you enjoy those items on your calendar.5. Don’t Forget About YouSpeaking of joy, don’t forget to schedule and take time for yourself. You probably forget that part if you’re a natural giver, a people pleaser, or even a type A control freak. Getting caught up in making everyone else’s holidays run smoothly and feel magical is so easy. And you’re probably really good at it and really proud of yourself, as you should be. But it would be best if you got to share in that magic, and the truth is that a happier, well-rested you is more capable of making others happy as well.So, while you’re at your calendar, planning, and organizing, schedule in time for yourself. You could give yourself a few hours to shop alone, for others, or for yourself. Set aside a morning to snuggle in bed, read a good book, or watch Christmas movies. You might even want to start penciling in exercise; it’s a great stress reliever, and you’ll get a jump on your New Year’s resolutions. Whatever self-care means to you, make time for it, for yourself, this holiday season.Let Christmas Be the Most Wonderful Time of the YearIn the end, the holidays have become synonymous with stress, and in many ways, you can’t change that. You likely do have many parties to attend, others to throw, and fun events you want to join. You’ve got gifts to buy and possibly kids to enchant with an elf on the shelf and holiday cookie bakes. Decorations have to go up, and lights need to twinkle. But there can be a method to all the madness.


Getting organized in advance and getting everyone on the same page can make a world of difference. Not forcing yourself to say yes when you really want to say no will clear up space on your calendar. Using that calendar wisely will allow you to have a whole holiday rather than a busy one. You can experience joy rather than anxiety. Wait — imagine this — you can be genuinely present this season, reveling in the most wonderful time of the year.Featured Image Credit: Photo by Nicole Michalou; PexelsThe post 4 Christmases?

100,5 Time Management Strategies That Will Help You Crush Your Workweek in 2024,"Dec 21, 2023",Howie Jones,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/5-time-management-strategies-that-will-help-you-crush-your/467399,"
It’s coming. As we get through the holiday season, we hear whispers of “New Year, New You.” You plan how to be a better person in the new year. You’ll have more time for friends and travel, or maybe you’ll get a big promotion. All it takes is a whole new you.Why is it always a new you? Probably because “New Year, same you with better time management” isn’t as catchy. Achieving the things you want depends on how you use your time. If you want to make positive changes at work in 2024, you’ll need to reassess your time management skills. There are likely changes you can make at work and home that will make you a better employee. In this article, you’ll learn about some strategies you can implement to make those changes.Plan AheadMost of us have heard the saying, “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.” As cliche as it may sound, it’s not untrue. Heading into your workday without any sort of plan is a recipe for an unproductive, frustrating day. You’ll spend more time deciding what to do next and preparing for it than actually doing your work. Instead, roughly lay out your day with some flexibility in case something unexpected arises.



Start the planning process for work and home by listing everything you need to do. Then, assign them an amount of time based on how long they actually take. For example, getting dressed for work in the morning takes 30 minutes because you don’t know what to wear. Or, invoicing takes hours because you didn’t log your time as it happened.In both of these situations, planning ahead would have saved you time and effort. Good planning will also relieve stress and reveal time pockets you can use to take on new, more exciting tasks. Finding this available time can make you a more valuable employee.


Keep a Digital CalendarThe best way to know your available time is by keeping a shared calendar. While there’s nothing wrong with a physical planner, you may consider going the digital route. Consider a shared scheduling tool like Calendar, Google Calendar, or Microsoft. On any of those, you’re able to team schedule, meaning you can see multiple people’s availability and activities at once.You’ll be able to find the best times for meetings without losing time to back-and-forth emails. Shared scheduling tools can also be used to time block, setting aside time for specific actions like checking email or doing desk work. When those blocks are visible to anyone with access to your calendar, you’re less likely to be bothered. You should notice higher productivity since you aren’t losing time to interruptions.This increased productivity can also carry over to your home life. Use your shared scheduling tool for your family to keep track of appointments, practices, and activities. You’ll see who has some free time and who doesn’t. This will prevent overload and keep tasks more evenly distributed.Prioritize and Eat That FrogYou can only get so many things done in a day; unfortunately, they won’t always be what you enjoy doing. To get through it all as painlessly as possible, figure out how to prioritize your daily tasks. While you’ll want to consider the due date, it’s not the only factor you should look at.


You may follow a quote attributed to Mark Twain and popularized by Brian Tracy, “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” “Eat That Frog” is a method to prioritize your work by tackling the most challenging task first. Most of us are experts at putting off until the last minute the tasks we’d instead not do. Whatever the reasons for putting them off, our avoidance tends to worsen them and interrupt the rest of our workflow.Instead of running away from tasks you don’t like this year, face them head-on. Take Mr. Twain’s advice and start your workday with the thing you are looking least forward to doing. Once it’s done, you’ll only have the work you like to do left. Finishing the workday with assignments you enjoy will also make it easier to unplug from your day once you get home.Develop a Sleep RoutineHustle culture tells us that sleep is bad for productivity. Get up early and get your work started. Stay up late and keep grinding. However, sleeping as little as possible will negatively impact your work. You may struggle to write an email, nod off in a meeting, or snap irritably at your coworkers. To avoid these things from happening, develop good sleep hygiene that supports your work schedule and goals.While it may sound juvenile, this starts with setting a regular bedtime. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the average adult needs seven to nine hours of sleep. Count those hours back from when you need to get up to find your bedtime. Then, consider how much time you spend on your pre-bed routine and how long it takes to fall asleep. With all that information, you can establish when to start getting ready for bed.


While you should stick to that time most days, there may be occasions when you need to make an exception. If you have an early meeting or a family member needs to go somewhere before work or school, you can adjust your schedule accordingly. Having a flexible routine will set you up for success during work. Not only will you be better rested, but you’ll feel more in control of your day.Communicate Boundaries on Your TimeWhen making changes to your life, you must communicate them to those around you. For example, you can’t blame your spouse for keeping you up late if they didn’t know when you wanted to start getting ready for bed. You also can’t blame your coworkers for interrupting your workflow if they didn’t know you had blocked off focus time. It all comes down to communication.When building a new routine, you must let those around you in. Clear communications will prevent unwanted intrusions on your time, making you more productive. People will know when you are available to chat or take on more work without having to play a guessing game.Effectively communicating can also prevent work creep. If your schedule is full, respectfully let your supervisor know you’re unavailable for new projects. Alternatively, ask for their assistance in reprioritizing your tasks, again communicating existing responsibilities. Ensure there is time in your day when you aren’t available to work so you can focus on the other parts of your life. A good work/life balance will make you happier and a better employee.


As you implement new strategies, review how they work for you and your life. Some may be a perfect fit, and some may need adjusting before you can make them a permanent change. Evaluate what works day-to-day and what effects they have over a longer amount of time.Establishing better time management is a process. Along the way, you’ll see small improvements that make a big impact. You’ll become more efficient, have more time for things, and have a clearer head. All of this will make you feel like a whole new you in 2024, ready to tackle whatever work comes your way.Featured Image Credit: Miguel Á.

101,How I Pulled Myself Out of Burnout and Turned My Ambitions Into Reality,"Dec 21, 2023",Andi Cross,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-i-pulled-myself-out-of-burnout-and-turn-my-ambitions/465158,"
More than half of American workers say they're currently experiencing burnout. To meet the status quo of the modern corporate world, many put their passions on hold and compromise their life for their work. The concept of a work-life balance goes out the door.Once in this position, I decided to uproot my life in an effort to blend my passion and profession and defy the corporate America status quo. After more than a decade working in New York, I moved to Australia, started a consultancy, became a certified divemaster and ultimately focused my efforts on supporting mission-driven, impact businesses conserving and restoring the planet. Today, my team and I are on a two-year expedition called Edges of Earth, which is the culmination of five years of life upheaval and shifted career priorities.This pursuit of bringing together passion and profession is called ikigai. It's a Japanese framework that helps us think about our life's purpose in four ways: what you love, what the world needs most, what you're good at and what you can be paid for. Here's how I used this framework to get me out of a colossal state of burnout.



Related: 4 Basics for Making the Move From Corporate Job to EntrepreneurUncover your ambitionDiscovering your ambition doesn't happen overnight. It requires trial and error in figuring out what you want to dedicate your time and effort to. While we all have passions and strengths, it's invaluable to explore various avenues to figure out what is the right fit. Over 11 years at digital and marketing agencies, I filled lots of different roles to understand where I could contribute best.


These experiences offered insight into how businesses work and where I wanted to slate in, while highlighting certain voids in my life. Although sometimes frustrating, the years of training and exploring are extremely vital in figuring out what ambition means to you.Ground your ambitionsAssessing your aspiration's viability and understanding the real-world challenges you're up against enables you to make smart decisions from the start. An initial vision might require tweaking, but revising towards a fitting approach is always better than forcing things that don't work.For example, my consultancy saw numerous iterations, transitioning from exclusively serving ocean nonprofits (an extremely small pool of clients) to offering services to a wider range of mission-driven entities and leaders. That trial and error period doesn't stop once the ambition is uncovered — it's only just beginning.Set achievable goalsRealizing your ambition is a marathon, not a sprint. By segmenting the journey into attainable goals, the path becomes more navigable. My team and I are constantly envisioning the future and working backward to maintain a balance between initiating action and gaining momentum.


Rigorous project management is indispensable, helping to provide laser focus on the right now and not getting lost in the bigger picture. It's easy to get distracted by the end goal. But with the right management levers in place, that can be mitigated.Related: Living With Purpose: Here's How Entrepreneurs Can Win The Battle Against BurnoutChoose the right peoplePinpointing those who resonate with your vision and goals is perhaps the most arduous task of them all. A mismatch can cause setbacks in the time it takes you to realize you're working with the wrong collaborators.Upon finding the right fit, invest in them. Encourage their autonomy, foster their best work and support their growth — as building trust within a team demands this. It's our responsibility to uphold our commitments. Choose people that want to partner with you as much as you want to partner with them.


Be okay with saying noBuilding a corporate career, I was under the impression that saying ""yes"" when everyone else was saying ""no"" would elevate me. And for a while, that was true. However, with this comes the burden of not knowing when to push back.If there are red flags — occurrences that go against your vision and values — then there needs to be a way to recalibrate. And sometimes a hard ""no"" is what's needed most. Sometimes, a ""no"" is what gets you farther ahead in the long run, even if it feels like a few steps back in real time.Embrace the setbacksFailures shouldn't overshadow our identity or cripple momentum. Instead, they should enlighten us and offer wisdom. Each setback has made my team more resilient, allowing us to absorb a lesson learned and come out the other side more determined than before.Throughout our expedition, we've encountered changed plans, dissolved partnerships, faced abrupt shifts and pushed through tough conversations. It's impossible to be perfectly aligned with everyone we encounter. Sometimes change hurts, but let that hurt be fuel to the fire.


Related: How Your 'Box of Possibility' Can Help Drive Your Entrepreneurial PassionCelebrate every winEvery victory must be celebrated, regardless of size. These moments reaffirm that the diligent groundwork, even when it seemed so minuscule compared to our larger ambition, was invaluable.In the shadow of celebrated successes highlighted in the media, we often overlook the myriad of small, essential victories that constitute someone's entrepreneurial journey. Achieving these milestones demands immense effort without shortcuts, making every win deserving of wholehearted celebration.Stay curious and always learnContinuous learning is the ultimate key. Recognizing we don't have all the answers and that the journey is about the ongoing pursuit of knowledge keeps us humble and interested. For example, every location we visit on our expedition offers insight that helps refine our strategies and collaborations — keeping us on our toes and far from burnout in the process.


Simply put: If you have an ambition that you want to make a reality, go for it. Left unattended, it becomes the persistent ""what if"" echoing in the background. But it's equally important to pursue it with preparation, ensuring you have the requisite skills, insights and validation to some degree that your efforts will resonate. Not just for you, but for the wider world and those you hope to serve.

102,Avoid These 10 Business Habits to Increase Workplace Productivity,"Dec 20, 2023",Mario Peshev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/10-bad-business-habits-that-destroy-productivity/466381,"
Project schedules are often crucial for success, and any setbacks can be costly, both financially and in terms of one's reputation. While many elements can contribute to project delays, some of the most common culprits are business activities that impede progress.Let's delve into ten business actions that can obstruct project efficiency.Related: 10 Bad Habits Preventing Your Business From Succeeding



1. Excessive meetingsAs an advocate for asynchronous communication, I have strong views regarding meetings. They are necessary for communication, but too many can be counterproductive. Long, frequent meetings without clear aims can lead to decision gridlock and time wasted. To combat this, plan only necessary gatherings with well-defined objectives and promote explicit conversations.You may streamline your meetings by focusing on outcomes, deliverables and individual roles and obligations. You may also adopt performance-driven approaches to propagate work productivity further down the hierarchy. Roadmaps, which specify the upper-level scope, vision and timeframes, are the foundation upon which projects are constructed and executed.


2. Excessive analysisAnalyzing every aspect of a project can result in analysis paralysis. While comprehensive planning is vital, excessive scrutiny can decelerate progress.Embrace Agile Techniques: Embrace agile methods for iterative planning and adaptability.Set Milestones and Due Dates: Divide the project into milestones with well-defined deadlines to maintain concentration.Implement Decision-Making Framework: Institute a decision-making framework to deter never-ending debates.Strike a balance by focusing on key aspects and avoiding unnecessary micromanagement.Related: Why Do Entrepreneurs Need to Take Quick Decisions3. Bureaucratic red tapeOverbearing bureaucracy, including layers of approvals and paperwork, can hinder project momentum. To mitigate the negative consequences, consider streamlining your processes and authorizing team members to make decisions within their areas of expertise.


Identify bottlenecks in the approval process, then simplify decision-making. Reduce the required approvals and ensure that permissions are granted promptly and only when needed.Leverage digital tools to automate routine administrative tasks. Consequently, there will be less paperwork, and team members can focus on tasks that add value.Related: How to Employ Radical Candor in the Workplace With 5 Simple Steps4. Ambiguous communicationInconsistent communication can result in misunderstandings and setbacks. Inadequate communication is the leading cause of project failure in 37% of cases. This statistic underscores the importance of effective and transparent communication in project management.


Furthermore, of the $135 million at risk for every $1 billion spent on projects, $75 million is on the line because of poor communication. The substantial financial risk serves as a reminder of the potentially severe consequences of ineffective communication.Related: 7 Leadership Communication Blunders That Could Make or Break Your Company5. Scope creepFrequent alterations to project scope can significantly prolong timelines. Scope expansion, or the broadening of project objectives beyond the initial plan, is a prevalent issue that can substantially lengthen project schedules.Define the scope upfront and manage change requests to prevent scope creep. Begin with a well-defined project scope to minimize misunderstandings.


You may also establish clear processes for assessing and documenting scope changes. Continuously monitor progress against the established scope to identify and address scope expansion early.6. Inefficient resource utilizationThis issue encompasses all project resources, including technology, finances, and materials, beyond manpower. Inadequate resource management can result in costly outcomes, including bottlenecks, delays, and even project failure.Continually assess and evaluate your resource needs throughout the project's duration to meet this challenge. Don't merely allocate resources at the project's outset and forget about them. Be prepared to make quick adjustments as needed.Related: How to Allocate Resources When Everything Is 'Priority 1'


7. Inadequate planningInadequate planning can lead to confusion and delays in the future. Invest time in comprehensive project planning, which includes risk assessment and mitigation strategies.This includes clear project objectives, a roster of responsibilities and deliverables, and realistic timeframes. Incorporate provisions for risk analysis and reduction into your project strategy. Develop contingency plans to address potential risks that could jeopardize the project. Project planning is an ongoing process that necessitates regular review and adjustments.Related: 7 Time Management Strategies for Busy Entrepreneurs8. MicromanagementExcessively controlling team members can lead to frustration and stifle creativity. Often, this is an indicator of ineffective leadership and perfectionism, both of which convey a lack of trust in the team you are working with.


Channel your inclination to micromanage by strengthening your leadership. Appoint experienced project managers who can effectively guide the team and make informed decisions.Striving for perfection may only result in endless revisions and delays. Set practical quality standards and concentrate on efficiently achieving project goals.Have confidence in your team's capabilities and allow them the autonomy to complete their tasks.Related: How to Strike a Balance Between Micromanaging and Under-Managing


9. Absence of ResponsibilityWithout clear accountability, tasks may fall by the wayside. To address this issue, establish accountability mechanisms, set deadlines, and hold team members accountable for their contributions.Define each team member's duties and responsibilities meticulously. Ensure that everyone understands the expectations. Establishing clear deadlines fosters accountability, as team members are more likely to take ownership of their responsibilities.Schedule regular check-ins or meetings to monitor progress and discuss obstacles. This makes it possible to identify accountability issues early and provides a prompt means of rectifying them.10. Failure to learn from errorsRecurrent delays can occur if we fail to learn from past mistakes.Conduct thorough post-project assessments for each project. Examine what worked and what didn't, and take note of areas in need of improvement.To wrap up, remember that efficiency is about getting more done with less hassle. Project schedules matter; any hiccups can cost money, effort, and reputation. By dealing with these common roadblocks in your work, you're setting the stage for smoother project management.Related: 5 Lessons You Learn From Your Business MistakesDrop the business activities that slow you downMake it your goal to spot and tackle problems early on, and you'll ensure that you keep your projects moving forward.

103,How to Avoid Scheduling Conflicts During the Holiday Season,"Dec 20, 2023",Angela Ruth,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/how-to-avoid-scheduling-conflicts-during-the-holiday-season/467400,"
We have done a lot this year — and we only have about 11 days left of these joyous festivities and family gatherings. However, this flurry of activities can often lead to scheduling conflicts. Balancing multiple commitments during this time of year requires careful planning and communication. Take proactive steps to ensure everyone can enjoy the festivities without missing out on anything. We’re at the end now — just hurry and get your obligation part done.This article will explore common scheduling issues that arise during the holidays. It will offer actionable advice on how to avoid them, ensuring a seamless and stress-free celebration for all.CommunicateEffective communication is the cornerstone of avoiding scheduling conflicts during the holiday season. The excitement of planning festivities can lead to assumptions that everyone is on the same page regarding dates and times. This slip-up can result in overlapping schedules, leaving participants stressed and torn between commitments.



To prevent issues, it’s important to establish clear lines of communication with all parties involved. Whether it’s a family gathering or a holiday event with friends, openly discuss the schedule well in advance. Create a group chat or email thread where everyone can contribute. This ensures that everyone is informed and can voice any concerns or conflicts. Encouraging open communication lays the foundation for a smoother holiday season with fewer scheduling hiccups.Sharing the schedule with all participants is a practical and modern solution to mitigate conflicts. In the digital age, technology offers numerous tools to help. Utilize shared calendars or scheduling apps that allow everyone to collaborate seamlessly. A centralized digital hub where all can view and update details ensures that everyone is informed.


Encourage active participation from family members and friends, making the scheduling process a collaborative effort. Many scheduling tools, such as Calendar, Microsoft Calendar, and Google Calendar offer group scheduling. This promotes transparency and distributes the responsibility, reducing the likelihood of oversights and scheduling clashes. Effective communication and shared scheduling platforms empower everyone to contribute to the planning process. It creates a harmonious holiday experience for all.Consider Travel TimesTravel times are a crucial aspect of holiday planning that often goes overlooked. The joy of festive gatherings can be dampened if participants rush to reach an event. Or, worse, if they arrive only to find it is already over.It’s important to factor in travel times when coordinating holiday schedules to avoid such pitfalls. This consideration becomes even more crucial when families and friends are dispersed across different locations or time zones. Understand the time it takes to commute between places, accounting for potential traffic delays and being mindful of time zone differences. These are key elements in creating a schedule accommodating everyone’s unique circumstances.In the era of global connectivity, virtual gatherings have become a norm. It’s equally important to consider travel times for participants joining celebrations remotely. For instance, suppose a guest is in the central time zone. He gets off work at 5:00 p.m. and must travel across town to get home for the virtual celebration. Consider that, and don’t schedule the event for 6:00 p.m. Eastern time, as he will be late.


Unintentionally scheduling an event when someone is still in transit can lead to frustration and exclusion. By thoughtfully factoring in travel times, whether physical or virtual, the holiday planner demonstrates a considerate approach. They maximize the potential for all parties to enjoy the celebration without the stress of rushed arrivals or missed connections.Book in AdvanceBooking in advance is a strategic move that can significantly contribute to a stress-free holiday season. As the demand for special events surges during this time of year, procrastination can result in missed opportunities and scheduling conflicts. Plan ahead for gatherings, such as holiday services, lighting ceremonies, caroling, or other popular events. This will ensure that everyone can participate without the disappointment of last-minute unavailability.Securing reservations or purchasing tickets well in advance not only guarantees a spot. It also provides ample time for all involved parties to mark their calendars and make necessary arrangements.Booking in advance allows for a more complete consideration of everyone’s schedules. It provides a clear timeline for planning additional activities around these events, reducing the likelihood of conflicting commitments. Perhaps it’s reserving a table at a restaurant, securing tickets to a holiday play, or booking a venue for a gathering. Early planning contributes to a smoother, stress-free holiday experience regardless of the event.


By booking in advance, individuals and families can ensure that the season’s most anticipated events are firmly scheduled. This proactive step will allow flexibility in other aspects of their holiday calendar.Be FlexibleFlexibility is an invaluable mindset during the holiday season, often filled with unpredictable circumstances and varying schedules. Traditions indeed hold a special place in our hearts. However, being open to the idea that schedules may need adjustments can significantly reduce stress and create a more enjoyable holiday.For instance, maybe the usual routine involves opening presents in the morning. Embracing the flexibility to shift this tradition to the afternoon can accommodate diverse schedules and ensure that all participants are included. Recognizing that unforeseen events may disrupt well-laid plans allows individuals to adapt and maintain the season’s spirit.Being flexible also means understanding that holiday celebrations may unfold differently than usual. Work commitments or family obligations may change the timing of events. Embrace these changes with a positive attitude. This mindset will encourage a focus on the joy of being together rather than a rigid adherence to a specific schedule.


Flexibility is the secret sauce that allows individuals and families to navigate the ebb and flow of the holiday season. It also ensures that the spirit of togetherness prevails despite any unexpected twists and turns.Make New TraditionsIn the face of busy holiday schedules and the potential for conflicts, making new traditions can be a practical solution. Holding onto cherished customs is important, of course. However, adapting to changing circumstances often requires a willingness to create alternate traditions that better suit the available time and commitments.For example, if the usual holiday feast seems challenging, try a potluck-style gathering where everyone contributes a dish. And a “planned” potluck is just fine to do. This lightens the load and allows for a more collaborative and inclusive celebration. There’s beauty in making new traditions. It lies in the opportunity to craft experiences that are both meaningful and attainable within the constraints of everyone’s schedules.Creating new traditions can also be exciting to bring a fresh perspective to the holiday season. Explore different types of holiday activities, adjust the timing of events, or incorporate new elements into existing traditions. The possibilities are endless.


Perhaps the family decides to do a charitable activity together. They may volunteer at a local shelter or organize a donation drive. Families can tailor their holiday experiences to accommodate everyone’s schedules by making new traditions. They can also develop a sense of unity and shared joy. Ultimately, the essence of the holiday season lies in the connections made and the memories created. Forging new traditions can be an excellent way to ensure those moments last.Scheduling the Holiday SeasonThe holiday season is a time for joy, connection, and celebration. You can navigate the potential pitfalls of scheduling conflicts by taking proactive steps. Remember, the key is to approach the season with a spirit of collaboration and adaptability. Ensure that everyone can participate in the activities without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.Remember–only a few more days until the holidays are over. Make them great right now, today. With thoughtful planning and communication, you can make this holiday season a time of shared joy and cherished memories.Featured Image Credit: Tim Douglas; PexelsThe post How to Avoid Scheduling Conflicts During the Holiday Season appeared first on Calendar.

105,How to Squeeze in Everything for the Holidays Without Losing Your Sanity,"Dec 19, 2023",Hunter Meine,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/how-to-squeeze-in-everything-for-the-holidays-without/467224,"
With all the holiday cheer upon us — it means it’s time to bust out the Ibuprofen and put on your game face. “The most wonderful time of the year” can morph into the most stressful time of the year if you’re not careful. It’s easy for the holidays to become a blur of last-minute vacation organizing, belated party planning, and frantic gift-wrapping. But in almost every case, holiday havoc can be avoided with a bit of advance planning. Here are some time-saving tips to help you squeeze in everything during the holidays without losing your sanity.Secure Travel Plans as Early as PossibleWhether heading to a beachside resort or flying to Grandma’s house this Christmas, make your travel arrangements now. Some of the busiest travel dates fall between December 21 and December 27. Therefore, you may want to book your flights before or after these dates, if possible. Remember that this isn’t the time to wait for last-minute traveling discounts. Procrastination could lead to canceled holiday vacation plans if airlines sell out of available seats.Secure all your transportation and accommodation arrangements well in advance whenever possible. Don’t forget to notify your employer of your traveling plans and get them approved as needed. Many employers use team scheduling apps such as Calendar, Google Calendar, or Microsoft Calendar to stay organized year-round. Input your vacation plans into your team calendar as soon as possible to get first dibs on vacation dates. If you wait too long, you may need to change your holiday travel plans to ensure your employer isn’t short-staffed.



Set Task Deadlines Based on Order of PriorityNot everything on your holiday to-do list is of equal priority. For example, booking flights and hotel arrangements are probably more pressing than buying gifts from neighbors. Set task deadlines in your calendar to ensure you don’t get distracted by small tasks and overlook the big ones. These should be prioritized based on order of importance.To begin setting task deadlines, create a master list of everything you need to do to prepare for the holidays. Write down completion dates following each item in your list so you know when things need to be done. Some dates may be set in stone (like an upcoming holiday party you’re hosting), while others may be more flexible. Next, number the items based on how pressing and important they are. Finally, input your to-do list in order of priority into your preferred calendar app and set deadline reminders for each task.


Create a Budget and Stick to ItApproximately 1/3 of Americans go into debt every year around the holidays. Gifts, airline tickets, and hotels can all add up quickly. According to CBS News, the average holiday debt is nearly $1,550, which can take months to pay off. It’s little wonder that reducing debt is one of the most popular New Year’s resolutions. To avoid losing your sanity due to excess holiday spending, create a budget in advance and stick to it.Many people spend more when shopping online than at a brick-and-mortar store. Online stores often require a minimum purchase to qualify for free shipping, which incentivizes you to spend more. Plus, virtual carts have unlimited space, making buying more easier than you would in person. Keep a running tally of all your holiday spending, and stop making purchases when you reach your budget maximum.Meal Prep to Save TimeHoliday meal planning and preparation are huge stressors for many people. If you want to save time and decrease anxiety, prepare your meals in advance. Decide what recipes you want to make and print out ingredient lists to limit unnecessary shopping trips. Keep in mind that grocery stores often get extremely busy around the holidays. You may also discover that popular ingredients are nearly impossible to find if you wait until the last minute to buy them.Some items, such as fresh produce, may not keep longer than a few days in the refrigerator. But most of your dry ingredients can be purchased weeks in advance without spoiling. Check purchased ingredients off your list so you can see at a glance what you still need to buy. Ensure you have room in your refrigerator or freezer to store meals once you make them. Don’t forget to send out meal assignments at least a week in advance if you’re organizing a potluck dinner.


Designate Tasks to OthersRemember the old saying about how many hands make light work? This adage is never truer than it is around the holidays. Whether you’re arranging a work party or a small celebration with family and friends, task designation is essential. If you try to do everything yourself, you’ll most likely end up stressed, irritated, and completely worn out. You won’t even have the energy to enjoy the holidays with the people you love most.To stay sane this holiday season, bring trusted friends and family members into the event planning and execution stages. You might hand off the venue scheduling responsibilities to an astute, organized best friend. Your creative sister-in-law might love to be in charge of table decorations and party décor. Your brother might enjoy planning games and activities to keep everyone engaged. Assign tasks based on each person’s strengths and interests to ensure everything goes smoothly.Prioritize SleepIf you typically run at full speed 24/7 during the holidays, it’s time to re-evaluate things. You’ll eventually burn out when you spend too much time burning the candle from both ends. To keep your energy levels high, giving your mind and body a chance to rest and recuperate is essential. That means you need to prioritize sleep and ensure you’re getting sufficient shuteye for your body’s needs.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that adults sleep at least seven hours each night. But remember that the quality of your sleep is just as important as the quantity. To improve your sleep, consider keeping a regular sleep schedule, even through the holidays. You might also ask Santa to bring you a high-quality mattress, so you experience fewer aches and pains at night.


Eat Healthy MealsSome people thrive on the hustle and bustle of the holidays. They love running from place to place, crossing items off their gift lists. But remember that even the most well-tuned vehicle can’t run on gasoline fumes for very long. To properly fuel your body, you need to eat a healthy, balanced diet rich in nutrients.Gingerbread cookies and festive pies are delicious holiday treats, but make sure they’re not your primary source of energy. Instead, focus on eating lean protein, colorful vegetables, and energizing whole grains. Don’t forget to include fiber-rich fruits and healthy fats in your diet to keep you satiated. This will help you resist the urge to munch on candied pecans all day.Throw Perfection Out the WindowIf there’s one thing in life you can count on, it’s that things don’t always go to plan. If you’re dead-set on perfection this holiday season, you’re almost guaranteed to be disappointed. You may not have the perfect weather forecast during your Christmas getaway. Or, you might experience your first Pinterest fail when trying to recreate a charming elf-shaped cake. Remember how to roll with the punches and recognize the beauty in imperfections.Humor is often the key to making the most of less-than-idyllic situations. Don’t take yourself too seriously; learn how to laugh when things go wrong. You’ll have a much more enjoyable holiday season if you know how to savor every imperfectly beautiful moment with the ones you love.


You’re doing it wrong if you feel like you need to be put in a straightjacket after the holidays. Use these helpful tips to manage your time, set clear priorities, and maintain your sanity this holiday season.Featured Image Credit: Photo by Duygu; PexelsThe post How to Squeeze in Everything for the Holidays Without Losing Your Sanity appeared first on Calendar.

106,Forget Burnout — This Is the Silent Career Killer You Actually Need to Be Worried About.,"Dec 19, 2023",Lissele Pratt,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/forget-burnout-you-need-to-combat-this-silent-career/465503,"
We've all heard about burnout. It's that all-too-familiar sensation of being trapped in a never-ending cycle of stress, exhaustion and overwork.But what if I told you there's something sneakier, stealthier and often more devastating lurking in the shadows of our careers? It's called ""rust out,"" a silent career killer that thrives in the mundane, the uninspiring and the unfulfilling.Here's the lowdown on this workplace phenomenon, what it is and how it differs from burnout. Let's explore why rust-out affects some groups more than others and provide best practices for managing and combating rust-out.



It's time to shine a light on this career saboteur and empower ourselves to break free from its insidious grip.Related: 3 Insights From the First Large-Scale Study on Burnout and Entrepreneurs


What is rust-out?Rust-out is the feeling of uninterest and disconnection from your work. It occurs when the tasks you're doing fail to challenge your skills and abilities, leaving you feeling listless, apathetic and bored. Some telltale signs include:A constant sense of disinterest in your work.Decreased enthusiasm for new challenges.Frequent irritability with colleagues or tasks.A perception that your daily routine has lost its spark.A persistent feeling of professional stagnation and unfulfillment.While we focus on avoiding burnout, we might unknowingly expose ourselves to the silent killer of rust-out — a career corroded by monotony and boredom. Rust-out may not scream at you like burnout, but its impact is just as devastating.Who is most affected by rust-out?Rust-out doesn't discriminate, but it seems to have a particular affinity for women. In an era when we champion gender equality and diversity, it's disheartening to see women bearing the disproportionate burden of its consequences.While working in the city, I often felt the weight of an unfair burden, having to outwork my male colleagues for the same career progress. This sense of injustice can take a toll and gradually lead to uninspired feelings as if I'm slowly rusting away.


It's not just my experience. A recent study highlighted that women are consistently judged to have less leadership potential than their male counterparts, resulting in a 14% lower likelihood of promotion each year. Given that women tend to stay in entry to mid-level positions longer than their male counterparts, they'll likely eventually feel unchallenged and become less enthusiastic about their roles.Additionally, what may surprise some is how common rust-out is among those who embark on the entrepreneurial journey. It's not uncommon for passionate founders to start with grand visions of building something exceptional, only to realize that they've inadvertently created a never-ending job for themselves rather than the fulfilling and liberating enterprise they had in mind. This underscores that rust-out isn't confined to corporate careers. It can silently affect entrepreneurs as well.Related: How to Spot Entrepreneurial Burnout (Before It's Too Late)Best practices for managing rust-outIf this is hitting home and you're recognizing the signs of rust-out, there's hope. Drawing from my experience as a mentor with Virgin Startups, here's the advice I offer my mentees grappling with rust-out. These proactive steps can help you regain your enthusiasm for your career.


Embrace your reality:As the saying goes, you must understand your problems to solve them. Rust-out is no exception. It's important to acknowledge that sense of disconnection and monotony that seeped into your work. By recognizing this challenge, you take the first vital step to reclaim your professional enthusiasm.One thing that really helped me was maintaining a work journal. Pouring your thoughts and daily experiences onto its pages can be a powerful tool for uncovering patterns and identifying the factors contributing to your rust out.You can also talk to someone you trust — a friend, colleague or mentor. Sharing your experiences can provide valuable insights and emotional support as you navigate the complexities of rust-out.Finally, take some time to reflect on your values. Are they in harmony with your current work situation, or is there a misalignment? This assessment can reveal whether your rust out stems from a values disconnect.


Discover what fulfills you:Your self-audit isn't merely about identifying rust-out triggers; it's also an opportunity to unearth new interests and sources of excitement that can reignite your professional passion. So, why not add these newfound interests to your plate?Sometimes, when you're deep in the throes of rust-out, it can be challenging to pinpoint what truly excites you. In these moments, take a step back to a time before you entered the workforce, perhaps even back to your childhood. What did you genuinely enjoy doing? Did you relish helping your family prepare dinner? If so, consider enrolling in a cooking class. Were you a passionate dancer during your school days? Maybe it's time to explore joining a dance team. And if, like me, you're fueled by a desire to help others, think about mentorship or volunteering as a way to reignite your sense of purpose.Take charge:To conquer rust-out effectively, you've got to seize the reins and take charge. Start by setting new professional goals that excite and challenge you. Seek out projects that reignite your passion, or consider whether changing your career path is the bold move you need.Don't go it alone. Engage in open conversations with your supervisor or confide in a trusted mentor. Their insights and guidance can be invaluable in helping you navigate and control your rust out. Remember, taking the initiative to tackle rust-out head-on is a testament to your resilience and determination. You can transform this challenge into an opportunity for personal and professional growth.


Related: I Was Experiencing Extreme Burnout Until I Practiced These 3 Things to Come Out StrongerFinal thoughtsRust-out may be stealthy, but it's not invincible. It's time to shed light on this career saboteur and take action.Remember, your career is too important to let rust-out hold you back. So, if you're feeling like you're rusting out, this could be your wake-up call to identify areas that require change and embrace this discomfort as a catalyst for personal and professional growth.

Work on a personal project.Are you still working on that novel you started years ago? What about that online course you bookmarked? Have you forgotten about the DIY furniture revamp you planned? Bring them back to life!While on break, you can finally get started on that personal project you’ve been putting off. Get started by setting realistic goals, breaking them down into manageable steps, and dedicating a few hours each day to making progress.It’s okay if you don’t finish that project you’ve been putting off. The momentum of finally starting your project will help you finish it.2. Challenge yourself.Make a goal for yourself that you want to achieve, whether it’s physical, mental, or emotional, like signing up for a 5K or learning a new language. Taking risks and breaking out of your comfort zone can boost your confidence and resilience.3. Become a bookworm.Do you have trouble finding time to read? Now is the perfect time to do the following:



Dive into that “to-read” pile. Don’t be afraid to dust off your paperbacks and e-readers. Enjoy gripping thrillers, philosophical masterpieces, or lighthearted rom-coms to spark your imagination and expand your horizons. There is also a social element to book club discussions, providing an opportunity for insightful discussion.
Explore a new genre. You don’t limit yourself to your usual literary genres. Take a trip to the past with historical fiction, explore the future with science fiction, or discover poetry. Your literary palate might expand if you discover a new favorite genre.
Listen to audiobooks. Take advantage of your holiday travels, commute, chores, and walks to learn. Listening to audiobooks allows you to absorb knowledge and stories without holding them. Another way to stimulate your intellect is to listen to podcasts on a broad range of topics.
4. Write your story.Everyone has a story to share — even you. There is always something to share with the world, whether it is your life experiences, hobbies, or professional advice.Take advantage of your break by starting a journal, a blog, or a novel. Perhaps you could even use your creativity to create a fictional story or poem that captures the season’s magic.5. Embrace the inner artist.No. Your goal shouldn’t be to become the next Picasso. Nevertheless, you can still paint, draw, and sculpt.Consider taking a class, joining a local art group, or simply experimenting with different mediums to increase your artistic skill level.6. Boost your health.During the holidays, we often overindulge. The holidays can still be enjoyed, but you can balance this out by joining a gym, taking a new yoga class, or simply taking a daily walk in the crisp winter air.Be sure to focus on your mental health as well. Practicing mindfulness or meditation, for example, can bring you inner peace. As such, welcome the new year with introspection and set intentions.7. Detox your digital life.Take this time to finally unsubscribe from unnecessary emails, organize your files, and take a break from social media. After that, reconnect with the real world and rediscover the joy of disconnecting.8. Deal with your financial to-do list.It’s no secret that finances can be a source of stress for many of us. Take advantage of your break by taking care of any financial tasks you have been putting off.


Consider reviewing your budget, creating a spending plan for the upcoming year, preparing your taxes, or researching ways to save money on everyday expenses. In the new year, you can feel empowered and have peace of mind if you take control of your finances.9. Recharge and reconnect.When you are not working, it is best to spend your downtime recharging and reconnecting. The following are some suggestions you might find helpful:
Plan a solo retreat. Get back in touch with yourself by disengaging from the digital world. Spend a weekend at a cozy cabin, head to a nearby park, or simply relax at home. Take time to unplug, reflect, and rediscover the joy of solitude.
Spend time with loved ones. Don’t forget to spend time with the people who matter most to you. Make the most of the season by hosting a festive gathering, playing board games, or simply curling up by the fireplace and sharing stories. Enjoy the moments of connection during the holidays and strengthen the bonds that make them memorable.
Embrace the power of nature. Enjoy a walk in the crisp winter air, stargaze on a clear night, or simply sit by the fire. Being surrounded by nature brings a sense of calm, reduces stress, and boosts creativity.
10. Reflect on the past year.While you are on break, take a moment to reflect on the past year. Was there anything that went well? Is there anything you could have done differently? Do you have any goals for the new year?Setting future intentions can be achieved through journaling, meditation, or even simply reflecting over a cup of hot tea.Professional DevelopmentWinter break is a chance to relax, reflect, and grow, but it can also serve as a time for professional development. The following are a few tips for making the most of your time off:11. Declutter and organize.Like raisins in a fruitcake, clutter accumulates at your workplace throughout the year. Take advantage of your break to declutter and reclaim your space.Make a list of what you no longer need, donate or sell it, and create a storage system for the rest.

Network like a pro.Take part in industry events, reconnect with old colleagues, or reach out to mentors if you can. Ideally, you should build professional relationships that will improve your career prospects.


13. Update your resume and LinkedIn profile.The break is the perfect time to polish your career documents and make yourself stand out in the job market.14. Learn a new industry skill.Learn more about your field through an online course, a workshop, or a shadowing experience.

Strengthen your soft skills.Despite the importance of hard skills, soft skills have become more important.In the workplace, soft skills are attributes and interpersonal skills that enable us to function effectively.

Choose activities that bring you joy. Just because something seems productive, don’t force yourself to do it.
