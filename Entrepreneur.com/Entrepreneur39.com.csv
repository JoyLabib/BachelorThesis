Now His Flea Market Stand Has Turned Into 3 Permanent Locations.","Apr 15, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-his-company-grew-from-a-flea-market-stand-to-3-locations/472688,"
Mathew Wong, owner of Tea and Milk, initially struggled to meet high costs and customer demand when building his New York City bubble tea business. But by educating his customers and providing quality products, he transformed a single shop into a well-known, values-based brand.The shop's original 10-by-10-foot space at the Long Island Flea Market has given way to three permanent locations across New York City, including storefronts in Chelsea Market, Brooklyn, and Astoria. In the process, Mathew built out a centralized kitchen for sandwich making, an event catering service, and a huge community of boba lovers.Related: The Counter Service at Yo' Mama's Is Just As Unique As Its Name. Here's Why People Come Back for the Experience as Much as the Food.



One of the biggest keys to success for Tea and Milk is their focus on integrity. Mathew and his business partners travel to Asia to source and learn more about their ingredients, visiting tea farms to learn about everything from the tea-making and manufacturing process to the ceremonies that celebrate the cultural role of the ancient drink. Mathew then uses his travel experiences to educate his customers about the products so they feel good about their purchases.Even though Mathew and his team believe in the importance of well-sourced ingredients, the right tea leaves can be quite expensive, and they've had to learn to work around the rising cost of goods.


Mathew reads all of Tea and Milk's financial statements to keep up with margins. His background in accounting has taught him that even though it can be overwhelming to face discouraging numbers head-on, it's crucial to understand how your business is performing so you can make necessary adjustments.""[If] you're reading a [profit and loss statement] and it's scaring you, it's very likely because you're not doing something that you need to do, such as marketing, educating the customers, training your staff,"" Mathew said. ""You need to have standard operating procedures in order to push forward. There's no other way around it.""Related: The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers Not to Be QuietIn terms of educating customers, one of Tea and Milk's biggest obstacles is that customers often aren't used to the taste of premium ingredients, so the more they know about the product, the more likely they'll be satisfied with their purchase. This goes hand in hand with getting to know customers' preferences as well.


""We want [customers] to trust the brand,"" Mathew said. ""So [when you] order something that you didn't like, you get something else that you do like. Then you build trust with that person, and eventually, maybe [they'll] try it again.""Despite the challenges that using authentic ingredients has posed, Mathew sees his products as a worthwhile investment. He has situated his shops intentionally across the city to fill gaps in bubble tea offerings in several New York neighborhoods.""We go into neighborhoods that we believe are starving for a certain type of brand. We saw Bay Ridge (Brooklyn), we saw what it was lacking, and we wanted to go in there to be the brand that can offer something different.""He encourages customers to support the local businesses in their neighborhood however they can. If you're not able to spend money at a local spot you enjoy, writing a review or telling your friends to visit can have a lasting impact.


""If you want the business to stay, you have to help support in a way,"" Mathew said.Mathew is a big believer in the power of acknowledging and engaging with customer feedback. While critical reviews can sting, he makes sure to respond to as many as he can to show that he cares about his customers, commenting back in a timely manner while giving himself room to cool off if he needs it.He also encourages business owners to lean on friends and partners for support. Having started Tea and Milk with two of his friends and now operating the business with a co-owner and general manager, Mathew finds it invaluable to have people to brainstorm with about new ideas and improvements. He has also built a network of other small business owners for conversations about business challenges and potential collaborations.Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront


""There's always going to be times where people don't agree. But at the end of the day, you have to be very open to these conversations,"" Mathew said. ""The type of people who want to be in your ecosystem will always be there.""In addition to the importance of authentic ingredients and products, Tea and Milk believes in:Staying on top of your schedule and finances. While it can be stressful, looking at the bigger picture and being proactive can help you navigate your business through unexpected challenges.Leaning on fellow entrepreneurs for support. It's important to find and have the right people in your corner when thinking about how to expand and improve.Keeping your eye on the prize.

1,Men Are Seen as Experts More Often Than Their Women Counterparts — and It's Time to Break Those Gender Biases.,"Apr 5, 2024","Kara Alaimo, PhD",https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-amplify-womens-wisdom-and-voices-in-a-mans-world/471783,"
I once sat next to a senior executive at a lunch during a conference and chatted with him about the subject of the research I do as a communication professor. He immediately began quoting a piece about the topic that he had just read in The New York Times – which I had written myself. The possibility that I was the author didn't seem to have occurred to this man when I had told him my area of expertise was this exact topic.The problem, of course, is that when people in our society picture experts, they often think of (white) men.I heard this complaint endlessly when I interviewed women across the country about their experiences using social media for my new book, Over the Influence: Why Social Media is Toxic for Women and Girls – And How We Can Take It Back. These women often told me something I have experienced myself: When they posted about topics related to their professional expertise on social media, their posts got little engagement; yet when men in their fields posted about the very same thing, they seemed to get a lot of reposts.



Research backs my findings up: When women use social networks to advance their professional careers, they often end up with fewer followers, reposts and resulting opportunities than the men in their fields. Why? In Entitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women, Cornell philosopher Kate Manne writes that often men are considered to be the ones in possession of knowledge in our society. Too often, women simply aren't seen as experts.Related: 8 Ways To Empower the Next Generation of Women Leaders


This can help explain why, when people are looking for a professional — whether they need to hire someone, want to follow people on social media to learn more about a topic or are making an appointment to see a doctor — they so often turn to men. To overcome this implicit bias, women's knowledge needs to be given greater visibility in our society. If people were constantly reminded of women's wisdom and accomplishments, eventually, they would come to see women as experts, and would therefore turn to women for their expertise more.All of us can help make this happen. Women who are experts in our fields should recognize that the more we can share our knowledge publicly — whether it's giving a talk at the local library or writing an op-ed about important work we are doing — the more we can help reshape these perceptions. Serving as a guest speaker in schools, from elementary schools to graduate classes, is another great way of making our knowledge visible. We should also post regularly about our work on social media and emphasize its value to society, so people can see the important contributions we are making.We can all also help by following more women on social media and sharing the posts of women more. To help us get started, I've posted a list of ""feminists to follow"" on my website. They are a diverse group of women doing amazing things in many different fields. The database SheSource, created by the Women's Media Center, is also a good resource for finding women experts in many different areas.What's more, we should try to boost other women in our professions, such as by nominating them for awards or writing Wikipedia bios about them, so their knowledge becomes visible to others outside our fields. One woman I profiled in my book, Jess Wade, has created Wikipedia pages for over 1,800 women and minorities working in science and engineering. She told me that simply having a Wikipedia page can be ""transformative"" to women's careers, because it allows people to find them when they're looking for nominees for things like awards and fellowships.


Related: How We Can All Elevate Women and Give Them a Voice in the Business WorldEmployers also have an important role to play. Companies should book women staffers for media interviews and speaking engagements and share their expertise on their official social media channels. They should feature the work women are doing on their websites and ask women to handle public-facing activities like earnings calls with investors and congressional testimony.Employers should also make it easier for women to attain leadership roles, such as by ensuring that people at all levels of their organizations can achieve work-life balance. As I've warned before, the expectation for executives to overwork is one of the major factors that holds women back in our careers, because so many of us need to balance our jobs with major caregiving responsibilities. They can do this by not expecting executives to be available 24/7 (economist Claudia Goldin's work demonstrates the value of having professionals like lawyers and accountants take turns being ""on call"" for client emergencies). Chief executives should also model the expectation for staffers to take time off for things like family vacations and children's sick days by doing so themselves.Our society's tendency to look to men for expertise is one of the things that holds women back in our careers. But we can all help give women's knowledge and accomplishments greater visibility, which will cause people of all genders to view women as experts and turn to women for expertise more.

Even though more and more women are getting into crypto, whether by investing or working in the field, they're still a rare sight in the big chairs.According to 2023 reports, amid market fluctuations and layoffs, women constitute about 26% of the cryptocurrency industry's workforce and hold only 6% of its leadership roles, with men dominating CEO positions at 94%.

3,"Here's What You Need to Create a Dynamic, Innovative and Resilient Work Environment","Apr 2, 2024",Adam Markel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-create-a-dynamic-innovative-and-resilient-work/471671,"
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) is crucial for promoting innovation, satisfaction and success. To build a dynamic and resilient work environment, it is important to embrace different points of view and encourage inclusivity because such actions foster a positive culture, improve teamwork and draw in top talent.A change-proof mindset, on the other hand, is a strategic approach that promotes resilience and adaptability in the face of ongoing corporate change. A change-proof attitude is crucial for organizations to effectively navigate uncertainty and embrace innovation.These two concepts play pivotal roles in achieving innovation, something we will talk about in detail in this article.Related: Great Minds Think Unalike — 3 Ways to Drive True Innovation Through DiversityThe power of diversity in driving innovationThe power of diversity in driving innovation is immense and undeniable. In the realm of business and creativity, diversity acts as a catalyst for innovation, igniting the spark that leads to groundbreaking ideas and transformative solutions. It's not merely a matter of including different races, genders or cultural backgrounds, although these are crucial aspects. The essence of diversity's power lies in the amalgamation of varied perspectives, experiences, and ways of thinking and harnessing the collective wisdom that emerges when people with different viewpoints collaborate towards a common goal.



Industry giants like Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson credit part of their success to a diverse workforce, and they did it by harnessing the power of varied perspectives not just to drive innovation, but also to create products that cater to a wider range of needs.Embracing a change-proof mindsetEmbracing a change-proof mindset in business is akin to preparing a ship and its crew for a voyage across uncharted waters. It's about cultivating resilience, adaptability and an unwavering commitment to navigating the inevitable storms and uncertainties that lie ahead. This journey begins with leadership that not only embraces change but sees it as an essential ingredient for growth and innovation.Leadership must embody the change-proof mindset. This means demonstrating a genuine openness to new ideas, a readiness to pivot when necessary and a deep-seated belief in the power of resilience. Leaders must be the torchbearers of adaptability, showing by example how to embrace uncertainty rather than shy away from it. They must create a culture where failure is not seen as a setback but as a stepping stone to greater success. This culture encourages experimentation, where every attempt, successful or not, is valued for the lessons it brings.Embracing a change-proof mindset is about more than just surviving the storms of change; it's about setting sail toward new horizons with confidence and resilience. It requires leadership that inspires, a culture that empowers and an unwavering commitment to growth and innovation.


Related: From Passive to Resilient — These 7 Strategies Will Empower Your Team to Thrive Through ChangeSynergy of DEI and a change-proof mindsetThe synergy between Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) and a change-proof mindset is not just a strategic advantage; it's a transformative force that can redefine the landscape of any organization, propelling it towards unparalleled innovation, resilience and success.Diversity in thought and experience challenges conventional wisdom and pushes boundaries, leading to breakthroughs that would be impossible in a homogenous setting. Equity ensures that this diversity is more than just present; it's active, with every voice having the weight and the platform it deserves. Inclusion binds these elements together, creating a culture where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. This is the fertile ground on which innovation thrives.Now, when you infuse this DEI environment with a change-proof mindset, you amplify its potential exponentially. A change-proof mindset is characterized by resilience, adaptability and an unwavering commitment to growth and learning. It's about seeing change not as a threat but as an opportunity. This mindset ensures that the organization is not just surviving but thriving amidst change, leveraging the diverse perspectives and ideas that DEI brings to navigate and capitalize on the uncertainties of our world.


The synergy of DEI and a change-proof mindset creates an organization that is dynamic, resilient and innovative. One good example is the American multinational technology company, Google, because it promotes DEI and a change-proof mindset through its ""Unbiasing"" efforts, for example. This approach contributes to the creation of new products and services, such as AI-powered language translation tools.The same goes with IT and networking giant, Cisco, which exemplifies DEI and a change-proof mindset with its commitment to inclusivity through programs like the ""Conscious Culture Initiative."" Cisco encourages adaptability and innovation, which is largely evident in its networking solutions.Practical strategies for implementationWhat can organizations do to enhance DEI efforts? Below are some actionable steps that can be taken:Leadership commitment: Secure leadership buy-in for DEI, making it a strategic priority.Training and education: Provide regular DEI training to all employees that will help promote awareness and understanding.Inclusive policies: Review and update policies to eliminate bias and promote inclusivity.Diverse recruitment: Implement diverse recruitment practices to attract the best talent in the market.Employee resource groups: Establish and support employee resource groups for networking and support.Organizations that celebrate resilience, support ongoing learning and encourage flexibility can also aid in the promotion of a change-proof attitude. Establish a culture where obstacles are seen as chances for development and where staff members are encouraged to accept change. Emphasize the advantages of adaptability, quick thinking and forward-thinking behavior regularly. Give diversity in hiring and team composition top priority to connect DEI projects with a more comprehensive innovation strategy.Related: How to Promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Your WorkplaceOvercoming challenges and building momentumThe use of DEI and change-proof programs frequently encounter obstacles such as the necessity for ongoing education and unconscious biases that impact decision-making. A lack of quantifiable measures, imprecise communication and inconsistent leadership commitment can all impede success. It will take consistent work, open communication and a dedication to fostering an inclusive and flexible working culture to overcome these obstacles.To overcome resistance and build momentum, start with transparent communication regarding benefits. Encourage leaders to set an example, create inclusive policies and come up with measurable goals. Promote open dialogue between individuals, address concerns, and celebrate small wins to gradually shift attitudes and build sustained momentum for positive change.

4,Why Leaders Today Need to Foster a Blameless Culture to Boost Workplace Productivity — And How,"Apr 1, 2024",Mary Hubbard,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-leaders-today-need-to-foster-a-blameless-culture-to/471715,"
We have arrived at a nexus point in the relationship between employees and employers where two shifts are reshaping the traditional hierarchical leadership model. Thanks in part to the democratization of publishing through social media, young people feel more empowered over their careers than ever before. At the same time, these generations are confronting waves of fear and self-doubt. Business leaders must find intelligent and flexible ways to respond to this emerging reality because the old ways limit individual contribution and innovation.These two trends may appear paradoxical, but they are actually linked: As younger people increasingly realize they are more than their jobs, they are confronting an ingrained reluctance to challenge the status quo for fear of losing their job or being embarrassed in front of their peers. Yet these fears will not hold back change. In my role coaching and mentoring tech leaders, I have seen a push to create a more accessible and neutral workplace culture where everyone's opinion and participation are valued equally.This is crucial because the traditional leadership model will stifle the very innovation that Gen Zers, especially, are showing an aptitude for as digital natives. Leaders must establish a blameless culture that gives all generations the sense of safety to communicate openly and take risks. It starts with leading through humility.



Related: Why Every Leader Could Benefit From Adopting a Gen Z Mindset1. Own your own mistakes for greater trustIn traditional American corporate culture, executives can appear inaccessible and maintain an image of unquestioned authority. Issues arise when leaders are emotionally driven and illogical, so they end up negating their people or treating them poorly. Then, when employees come to me, they express insecurity about communicating in groups and fear a negative review or even getting fired. As a result, they don't escalate, challenge, innovate or show up for their team.


Recent research by the London School of Economics found that around a third of Gen Z and Millennial employees described themselves as unproductive due to a lack of support from their bosses. And where there was at least a 12-year gap between manager and employee, workers were almost three times more likely to be unsatisfied with their jobs. Results like these are symptomatic of a you-versus-me divide that has opened up between employees and leaders.To bring workplace culture back to a place of neutrality, managers have to convince people there will be no punishment for escalation or for promoting new ideas at the risk of failure. However, employees are more likely to believe a leader when they model the humility and transparency they want to see in others. That means owning their own mistakes publicly and showing employees they are willing to walk back changes when necessary. With 88% of managers admitting to concealing their mistakes to a Harvard Business Review study, there is work to be done as the old-school ideas about hierarchy in business continue to break down.2. Encourage people's self-worth for mutual benefitExecutives who fail to grasp the zeitgeist risk their company becoming a less desirable workplace. MIT Sloan Management Review research, for instance, found that corporate culture was the most reliable predictor of attrition. The failure to promote inclusivity and people feeling disrespected were two of the main factors contributing to a toxic work culture, which was ten times more relevant than compensation when forecasting turnover.There are always stories behind figures like these. My brother, for instance, felt the sting of being misunderstood when he won an award as a top representative at a major pharmaceutical company. Just as he was going to collect the prize, he was intercepted by the president, who took one look at his black suit and white Doc Martens and said to him: ""Those shoes are inappropriate. I never want to see you in them again.""


Without missing a beat, he replied: ""Well, I walked into over 150 offices in these shoes, outselling every other company rep."" My brother understood that today's leaders should encourage individuality and confidence when they are bringing demonstrable success. McKinsey agrees, with its research showing that the culture at leading innovators is full of creativity, excitement and optimism.The caveat is that younger generations cannot rely on a job to provide their self-worth. It is well known they want to work for companies driving social change, yet I have seen the desire for greater inclusivity create a false conflict between being direct and confident in their expertise and being kind. There is a shift happening, and I encourage employees to follow the lead of their contemporaries and own their skills and values.Related: If You Want Your Business to Succeed, Get Gen Z to Like You — How Gen Z Will Impact Business and Marketing Decisions in 20243. Align personal and organizational goalsIn my role with a large social media platform, I meet many creators and influencers, as well as reps from merchants and big brands. As a result, I have witnessed how the old employee contract is changing. So many of these young entrepreneurs started from nothing, and their stories are the same. They say, ""Instead of selling for you, I'm sourcing inventory and selling my stuff—I am the asset now.""


It is far from the world Boomers inherited when they were with companies for 20 to 30 years. Gen X still has the subconscious bias that if they work hard and stay loyal, the company will look after them. But in a global jobs market where people can literally work from anywhere, loyalty has become more transactional. For instance, Gallup described Millennials as the job-hopping generation and found that 60% are open to new opportunities despite being currently employed.So, my message to leaders is to let go of the mindset of owning employees and instead see your role as enabling their talents. Engage people in regular, constructive dialogue to align personal and organizational goals so they are seen as complementary. When employees know their value and feel safe to innovate, they are far more likely to become collaborative partners and make their personal value proposition a win-win for both parties.

Her Product Was in Macy's Within the Year — Seeing Nearly $350,000 in Sales.","Mar 28, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/her-shocking-discovery-led-to-a-side-hustle-and-over-300k/471768,"
In 2022, Elenor Mak, now founder of doll company Jilly Bing, was busy balancing her business development role at a healthcare company and raising her 2-year-old and 4-year-old children. Back then, she ""was definitely not looking to start"" a side hustle. She'd founded an ecommerce fashion company in the past and knew what it took to get a business up and running. But that changed when her young daughter Jillian began playing with stuffed animals and dolls.Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak.""It reminded me of my own childhood,"" Mak tells Entrepreneur. ""You're playing with dolls; you're trying to make sense of the world. She was bossing her dolls around, like, 'Eat your dinner. Wash your hands.' Acting like a mom. Not in those words, but at age two, sort of using those words, simpler versions of those words.""



Related: How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did ItOne day, Mak's mother gave her granddaughter a ""beautiful blonde, blue-eyed doll."" When Mak asked her why she'd chosen that doll instead of one that looked like her daughter, her mother said, ""It was the prettiest one on the shelf."" Despite knowing her mother meant well, Mak found those words ""so heavy,"" a reminder of her own experience with lack of representation as a child.


""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak decided to buy her daughter a doll that looked like her and figured it would be a straightforward process: Because I live in San Francisco, and it's 2022. But it wasn't. Her local toy store didn't have one. Neither did the second she visited. Or the third. The toy aisles at major retailers like Target and Toys""R""Us seemed as though they ""had not evolved"" since Mak was a kid, nearly four decades before.""There were just rows and rows of Caucasian dolls, brunettes, and then at the very end of the aisle, you would have these dolls that I think were intended to be Asian because they were holding a panda bear,"" Mak recalls. ""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak looked to Asia for more options, but asking her relatives what they could find only turned up ""Eurasian-looking dolls,"" she says, adding that ""dolls largely represent what society thinks is beautiful, and in Asia, what's beautiful is still the Caucasian sort of features."" Mak remembered wishing she were beautiful like the dolls she had growing up, and ""her mommy bear instincts"" kicked in — she was determined to get her daughter a doll that looked like her, even if she had to make it herself.

Although she admits the creative component wasn't where she excelled (""My 6-year-old son is a better artist than me,"" she quips), she had a clear vision when it came to the business side and the potential for major demand: ""The Asian American population is one of the fastest-growing — we're 7% of the country's population.""And how hard could it be to make a doll in an age where we're churning out Teslas and developing AI? She recalls thinking. As it turns out, ""it's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll,"" Mak says. Fortunately, her business background helped her develop an essential ""superpower"": ""finding really good people."" Mak did cold outreaches to Asian designers at large toy brands and leveraged her own extensive network to connect with professionals who could bring the dream to life.

Mak conducted a lot of research over the next several months, speaking with Asian families and looking at photographs of kids and dolls to really try to understand what parents wanted. ""It's not just about saying, 'Oh, this doll's Asian,'"" Mak says. ""But what mattered to them? What were the features? What were the backstories?"" In December of that year, the prototype for Jilly Bing, named for Mak's daughter Jillian and the Chinese word for cookie, ""bing gan"" (Jillian's first word), was ready to share with the world.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a Month""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child.'""Jilly Bing started shipping dolls in August 2023 — and sold out of its stock of 2,000 within six weeks. Greta Gerwig's blockbuster hit Barbie had also put the spotlight on dolls that summer, ""opening up the national conversation"" and presenting ""an opportunity for us to change the narrative for not just our Asian children, but all children,"" Mak says. At that point, Mak realized the ""high-risk, high-effort"" passion project she'd worked on as a side hustle for the past couple of years — taking late-night business calls after her kids were asleep and balancing it all with her full-time day job — would benefit from her undivided attention.Jilly Bing also appeared on the Today show around that time, and the positive response was ""overwhelming."" ""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child. Life would have been so different if I had a doll that looked like me growing up,'"" Mak says. ""Even non-Asian parents writing [in to say], 'Oh my gosh, I think my kids should have dolls that look like their friends.'""By early this year, Jilly Bing was on shelves at Macy's; the retailer reached out after the Today segment. ""It's a company I grew up with,"" Mak says, ""so it was just really wonderful that they saw the value of Jilly Bing so early on.""

6,Why DEI Still Matters for Small Businesses and Startups,"Mar 28, 2024",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-dei-still-matters-for-small-businesses/471543,"
All businesses want to succeed, but there is something many of them may not realize can support their growth. They say diversity is our strength as a society and encourages new ideas and perspectives. Well, I am here to tell you that the same things — diversity, equity and inclusion — can give businesses an edge. Some small company owners may think focusing on making sure their business and culture are unbiased, fair and welcoming to all types of people is just about being politically correct. Let's see how centering on these values — what I will call DEI for short — can truly help startups and smaller companies be stronger and more profitable over the long run.Related: Prioritize DEI and Crush Your ROI Goals — How Inclusive and Authentic Marketing Drive Business GrowthAttracting top talent is getting more competitiveOne big reason why DEI is important for small businesses is because attracting top talent is constantly becoming more competitive. Nowadays, when people, especially the younger generation, are looking for jobs, they do not just look at pay and benefits. They also want to work for companies whose values match their own. Top candidates may leave a small business or startup to work for organizations that value DEI; hence, the latter risk losing out on excellent applicants. As smaller businesses look to expand, having an inclusive culture and a diverse team can help them attract the most incredible talent available.



A better reflection of your customer baseHaving a more diverse workforce can help you better understand and service a broad consumer base, which further motivates startups to focus on DEI. It will be more difficult for employees to relate to and address customers' demands from different backgrounds if they all have similar experiences. On the other hand, a diverse team of employees from various backgrounds may offer insightful advice on connecting with and pleasing clients from all backgrounds. More satisfied customers and growth prospects will follow from this.Related: The Burden of Breaking Barriers is Pushing Black Leaders to Breaking Point. This DEI Expert Reveals Where We Are Going Wrong.


Improved creativity and innovationResearch repeatedly shows that having a varied group of people with different viewpoints, experiences and backgrounds fosters greater creativity and more creative problem-solving. A workplace where all views are heard can help spark innovative solutions that may not originate from a homogeneous group. This is beneficial for smaller companies and startups that are attempting to remain dynamic and come up with fresh ideas. Diverse perspectives produce more creative products, services and methods, essential for any expanding business.Setting the right example for othersEven if your small business is just starting now, you can set the right example when it comes to DEI from the beginning. While some established companies may find it hard to change their culture, new startups can build inclusion into their foundations. Leading with strong DEI practices from day one allows you to attract like-minded customers, partners and investors who want to support companies demonstrating fairness and equality. It also prepares you to be a responsible community member and role model for positive change as your company succeeds.Related: 4 Ways Inclusive Leaders Can Respond to the Weaponizing of DEILegal and regulatory complianceFocusing on DEI for small businesses is also essential simply for legal and regulatory compliance reasons. As anti-discrimination laws and regulations continue to strengthen over time, companies of all sizes must ensure equitable policies and an inclusive culture. This reduces the risks of unfair treatment claims that can damage brands or result in lawsuits. Having defined DEI best practices and annual training shows that even a young company is operating ethically and by the law from the start.Some practical ways small companies can improve DEI:Commit from the top. The CEO and other top leaders must fully support and champion DEI from day one. They will need to communicate to all employees that promoting diversity and inclusiveness is a core value of the company. Leaders must provide the motivation and resources for DEI efforts to take root within the organization truly. When managers demonstrate their investment in these issues through their words and actions, it will encourage everyone else to get on board.Support employee resource groups. Employee resource groups (ERGs) allow workers with shared backgrounds or life experiences to connect, raise awareness on issues impacting their communities, and advise company leaders. Small teams can sponsor one or two ERGs made up of volunteers. This allows employees to lead in promoting inclusion from peer to peer while getting necessary support and visibility from high levels.Audit hiring and promotion practices. To address potential biases or inequities, small businesses must examine how they hire, develop and promote workers. Companies can review applicants and leadership demographics over the past few years. Do these numbers properly represent the diverse pools of talented individuals in their industry and community? Are there patterns indicating unfair barriers that held some groups back from equal opportunities? By reflecting on hiring metrics, businesses gain insight into whether implicit prejudices need addressing to establish a more just system open to all.My advice would be to analyze how balanced and welcoming your business is, look for low-cost ways to enhance fairness and continue working on DEI as your operation expands. If you prioritize DEI and focus even a little each month on improvements, your business will be on the right track to attracting and keeping talent and customers for the long run.

7,4 Tips for Growing Your Women-Owned Small Business in 2024,"Mar 19, 2024",Veronica Fernandez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-ways-to-grow-your-woman-owned-business-in-2024/470624,"
Every day, women across America are turning their dreams into reality, starting businesses with a simple spark of an idea and a persistent drive to succeed. If you're a woman who owns a small or medium-sized business (SMB), you have contributed to the transformative force shaping our economy. Not only have women-owned businesses significantly boosted the U.S. GDP, but you've also created nearly half of all new businesses for the past three years straight. However, your entrepreneurial journey goes beyond the numbers. To be a woman in business is a testament to resilience, courage and an unwavering spirit of self-advocacy.Despite your contribution to the economy, overall, women entrepreneurs are still plagued with challenges, even more than their male counterparts. The National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO) found that women entrepreneurs – especially women of color – often face challenges accessing funding, building a support network, balancing business and family life, cultural biases and owning their accomplishments.As we celebrate International Women's Month, it's essential to recognize how far you've come as a business owner and the resilience you hold to turn obstacles into opportunities. To continue your momentum, here are four powerful strategies to propel your business forward.



Related: 3 Ways Women Empower Other Women (and 3 Ways They Don't)1. Prioritize building your networkYou don't need to attend a networking event to make solid connections. Often, building a meaningful network for your business can happen in unexpected places. You never know who you may meet in an elevator, at a coffee shop, or on a plane. So, having a quick and concise elevator pitch of your product or service will be crucial as you move through the world. These conversations don't have to feel forced. Effective networking doesn't always center around what you can gain for your business; it's about building lasting relationships, sharing knowledge and offering value.


These interactions can foster a powerful sense of solidarity, particularly for women in business. Connecting with other women entrepreneurs and customers can offer a fresh perspective on your business or provide new opportunities to create a supportive ecosystem within your community. By embracing this spirit of collective success, you can enhance inclusivity in your network and champion success for everyone involved.Related: Networking: The Most Important Thing Women Should Do for Their Careers -- But Aren't2. Establish your business identityEstablishing what your business is about goes beyond identifying a logo or tagline; it's about defining what makes you unique and leveraging that in every interaction. If you haven't already, do some research and recollection. Consider your business' strengths and what sets it apart from everything else. Research is essential to establishing your brand, and you may need to continually invest in your own knowledge as you run and grow your business.Having a clear mission is also important as you build your brand. While this doesn't come overnight, it can be a guiding compass for yourself and your commitment to your customers. Setting goals and identifying your core values will help propel your business forward. Always remember to embrace mistakes as opportunities for growth and learning.


3. Leverage financial resourcesEqual access to capital has been a long-documented barrier for women entrepreneurs, hindering their ability to start and scale their businesses to their full potential. Times are changing, but not fast enough. Of the 42,000 small business loan applications approved by the SBA in 2023, only 21% represented women-owned businesses. Furthermore, the approved loans for women-owned businesses accounted for only 16% of the total $20 billion allocated funds.In light of these setbacks, there are resources out there dedicated to supporting your success. Set some free time aside to research organizations that offer free resources and educational tools to help boost your business. Grant programs like Fundica's recent collaboration with Visa offer underserved small business communities access to additional sources of working capital, which can be a game-changer in overcoming financial hurdles. There are also VC firms specifically focused on scaling female-founded startups – for example, Anthemis' Female Innovators Lab Fund helps design, source, and grow female-founded embedded finance startups.As a woman in business, your entrepreneurial journey won't always resemble a linear trajectory to success. While it may feel like you have to take some steps back, the lessons you gain in between foster the resilience and resourcefulness needed to take strides forward.Related: 5 Ways to Support Women-Owned Businesses


4. Don't be afraid to make changesWhen you analyze your business metrics over time, you're bound to spot areas where you can improve. Keeping a pulse on the evolving needs of your customers will help you get ahead of most of these improvements, turning challenges into opportunities for innovation. What once worked for your business in the past may not work for new generations of customers. That's why it's vital to treat every customer interaction as a learning experience and take their feedback in stride.For example, Visa's recent Global Shopping Index found that 76% of U.S. shoppers would not complete a sale if they didn't have access to the digital features they wanted, like preferred payments. Adapting by implementing digital payment tools can help streamline your customers' payment experience and may even give you the ability to reach more customers in other regions.Start by taking a test-and-learn approach when you implement a new change, whether that's with your marketing, product/ service offerings or your business operations. Don't be afraid to experiment with AI-enhanced technology, either. These tools can enhance and automate customer care for your business and provide personalized product or service recommendations based on your customer's behaviors and preferences. And remember that you are the unique ingredient in your business, but you are not in it alone. There are all sorts of resources available to help you start, run and grow your business. In addition, there is a community of other women business owners facing similar challenges and joys who can help propel you to success. Now is the perfect time to shape the future of your business.

8,The Counter Service at Yo' Mama's Is Just As Unique As Its Name. Here's Why People Come Back for the Experience as Much as the Food.,"Mar 15, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-customer-experience-at-yo-mamas-is-just-as-unique-as/471207,"
The environment at Yo' Mama's, a comfort food restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama, is just what it sounds like: a warm space that makes customers feel at home. Owned and operated by Crystal Peterson and her family, the establishment wins over customers through its quick and engaging counter service.Crystal and her mom got their start selling food at jazz festivals in Florida back in 2011. When they moved into a brick-and-mortar in 2014, Crystal developed her unique business model through market research.""I actually [ate] at every single restaurant I could think of that could be comparable to [mine] and [looked] at what was missing,"" she revealed. ""Was it the customer service aspect? Was it the portion size? Was it the flavor?""



What she found was that counter service is a win for both the owner and the customer. When guests aren't waiting thirty minutes to order their food, Crystal doesn't have to stress about turning tables and can provide the quality customer service that is so crucial to success.It's also important to understand your customer base. Crystal's restaurant tends to draw in travelers and workers looking for a bite to eat during their mid-day break. Because of this, she aims to create a ""getaway"" space where customers can relax in the middle of a busy day and enjoy a delicious meal without worrying about long wait times.


Yo' Mama's regulars, like Yelp Elite Delia S., love the way Crystal and her staff approach customer service, greeting customers at the counter and walking them through the menu.""I remember the interpersonal contact that this restaurant does on a consistent basis,"" Delia said. ""The vibe I got was, 'We're excited you're here. We appreciate your business, and we also want to make this an establishment where you will continue to visit and tell other people about it.'""Key to Yo' Mama's top-tier service is Crystal's involvement in the business's day-to-day operations. She knows that morale starts from the top and makes an effort to be at the restaurant as often as she can, engaging with her staff and customers.""What I've known is that workers work better when the owner's in the building,"" she said. ""You get a better product, so the customer is more satisfied.""


Crystal has also made her business a hit by focusing on a niche. Her gluten-free menu attracts people who can't satisfy their dietary needs at just any restaurant, and it also creates an element of surprise and delight for customers who don't come in looking for gluten-free food and still enjoy their meal.This focus on accommodating dietary restrictions has helped Yo' Mama's create a strong community where every diner feels included.""I've literally had customers that have come in and cried because their kid has never been able to eat in a restaurant because they are gluten intolerant. And they [can] actually sit there and enjoy a meal with them instead of having to bring a snack in for them to eat or get[ting] food from another restaurant [to] bring to them.""Building this kind of welcoming and accessible space for the local community aids Crystal's ultimate goal as a business owner to support the local economy. She emphasized that if you and your neighbors don't spend your money where you live, nobody else will, especially if everyone commutes to larger cities or towns.


""You have to be a citizen, and [being] a citizen equates to using your money right by your house instead of going to the other side of town,"" she said.Spending money at Black-owned businesses, who are often hindered by stereotypes, is especially important. Delia makes an effort not only to visit local Black-owned businesses but shout them out on Yelp whenever she can, letting people know that these spots are for everyone to visit and enjoy.""Oftentimes in restaurants, I don't think the playing field is fair. As a Yelp Elite, I am more drawn to trying as many of the smaller, often Black-owned restaurants that our city has to offer because there's such a large Black community—but that doesn't mean that only Black people are eating Black food. Restaurants are spaces that have the ability to traverse across class, race, region. You go into Yo' Mama's, and you see a diversity of people there gathering around this comfort food.""Delia also makes sure all her reviews are thoughtful, filling gaps on Yelp Pages by uploading missing photos of dishes and menus and choosing not to post about negative experiences unless she has valuable tips for owners or other guests.


Crystal brings this same level of intentionality to her review responses as an owner. She has found that some consumers only review a business when they want to express frustration or have expectations that Crystal can't satisfy, like an issue with her pricing. She chooses not to let these customers bring down her energy or service-focused mindset. By managing her emotions in the face of backlash, Crystal is able to engage with customers in a more productive way.""Some [customers] are coming in looking to lose. Some of the problems that people have don't even include me. So if I can control my emotions to change your emotions, then maybe we can win this and you can actually enjoy the experience.""In addition to an inviting restaurant atmosphere, Yo' Mama's believes in:Understanding your customers and your role in the business community. Gain an edge by researching your competitors and thinking about how you can fill gaps in their offerings.Restaurants as a space for diverse, inclusive community. Accommodating the needs of all your customers, including those with dietary restrictions, can help everyone who enters your space feel seen and welcome.Being flexible in the face of chaos. Navigate unexpected business obstacles by keeping the well-being of your customers and staff at the forefront.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Crystal and Delia, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.

9,5 Surprisingly Critical Employee Skill Sets in Demand for 2024,"Mar 14, 2024",Jason Zickerman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-invaluable-soft-skills-to-seek-in-your-next-hire/470695,"
A reporter once asked professional development guru Dale Carnegie how he was able to pull off hiring 43 millionaires. Carnegie responded that those people were not millionaires when they were hired. Rather, he had identified their potential and cultivated them into the successes they ultimately became. Carnegie, whose leadership insight was clearly ahead of its time, added, ""Men are developed the same way gold is mined. Several tons of dirt must be moved to get an ounce of gold. But you don't go into the mine looking for dirt. You go in looking for the gold.""The trick for business leadership and hiring managers is knowing what great potential looks like. And in all likeliness, you can't glean that from a resume, as the promise of an employee's greatness isn't necessarily evident from their current skill set or perhaps even their past jobs. Sure, experience and hard skills are important, but there are more powerful indicators of long-term success — gold, if you will — that are far better telltales of an employee's ability to flourish.The interesting thing here is that employees often aren't even conscious of their capacity for growth. While it is surely in one's best interest to have self-awareness related to one's natural talents and deficits, the onus is on leadership to recognize the potential for greatness within their employees. But often, those who should know best simply miss the ball when assessing and nurturing talent.



Many people, particularly those new to management, focus too heavily on identifying weaknesses and overcoming deficits in their employees. This is the dirt that Carnegie was referring to. Regardless of how successful we are, everyone (and I do mean everyone) possesses at least some challenges and shortcomings. We also all have certain behavioral profiles that work wonderfully in certain situations and not so great in others.As managers grow into true and effective leaders, they recognize that focusing on employees' faults rather than their potential is a losing game for everyone. For instance, a performance improvement plan (PIP) aims to address an employee's deficits rather than how to leverage their talents better. True or not, many workers feel that PIPs simply document their failures as a precursor to being let go. So, while PIPs are ostensibly designed to foster progress and growth, they often have the opposite effect due to their focus on the dirt. While the stats don't currently seem to exist, it would be interesting to learn what percentage of PIP recipients ever move on to advanced positions within that organization. I imagine it is astonishingly few.


More evolved and successful managers instead work purposefully to find and foster the strengths in each member of their team. Their job is to identify that gold in each individual and put them in positions where they can maximize their strengths for the betterment of themselves and the company.I know, I know. Your pushback is, ""What if the employee is actually untalented or unredeemable in some way?"" That reflects as much on the hiring process and HR management as it does on the employee in question. If a business finds itself making lousy hires after bad hires, the process is broken or is ironically due to talent deficits within the hiring manager. Somewhere along the line, the wrong attributes are being favored instead of the right stuff.Related: High Performers and High-Potential Employees Are Not One in the SameThe following are a few soft skills worth their weight in gold that you should look for in your next great hire.


1. Adaptability and resiliencyAn employee's ability to adapt is an exceptionally valuable characteristic and a strong indicator of long-term success. Adaptability means that an employee is not only quick on their feet, but also reflects an innovative, agile and agreeable spirit. Resiliency is reflected in their capacity to bounce back from misfires and overcome obstacles.2. CommunicationVerbal aptitude, writing ability and listening skills are invaluable talents that you should look for in every employee, regardless of their pay grade. Your entire team's ability to express themselves to others ultimately leads to better connection, improved collaboration and a more compelling company culture.Related: How to Delegate Effectively Without Ruining Your Team3. CreativityCreative thinkers are natural innovators. They not only offer fresh ideas and approaches but also inspire others to do the same. Creative thinkers tend to be your best problem solvers and are catalysts for organizational improvement and growth.


4. Leadership potentialWhile leaders can certainly be developed, natural leaders possess some key traits long before they ever climb the corporate ladder. Those best positioned for future leadership roles are wired to inspire those around them, demonstrate initiative and take ownership of their decisions regardless of their current title.Related: Feel Like an Imposter? Practice These 5 Habits to Beat Your Imposter Syndrome5. Continuous learningA hungry mind is a tremendous asset and a clear indicator of a growth mindset. An employee's drive to attain new knowledge reflects an incredible array of transferable skills, including increased capacities in problem-solving, collaboration, critical thinking and innovation. So, keep a keen eye out in your hiring process for job candidates with curious minds.As you begin to focus on the right skills in your hiring and employee development initiatives, you and your entire organization will surely be rewarded with all the riches you deserve.

10,6 Ways I've Achieved a Healthy Work-Life Balance as a Business Owner,"Mar 11, 2024",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-master-work-life-harmony-with-these-simple-steps/469893,"
Collaboration is a powerful tool that has become increasingly essential in the modern business world. Working together with others can help drive growth, innovation, and success. My journey with collaboration caused me to discover some hacks that have improved my work-life balance.This article will explore the importance of these hacks and provide some tips for re-prioritizing your work-life relationship and using it to achieve your goals.Related: Why Strong Collaborations Will Change Your Business



1. Set clear boundariesThe first step to finding balance is to set clear boundaries between your professional and personal life. When you're working, focus solely on business tasks without letting any outside influences distract you.Similarly, when you're out of the office, ensure that work doesn't infringe upon your other activities or relationships. You must understand what lines must not be crossed for both sides of your life to remain healthy and balanced.


2. Prioritize your timeWhen managing your time as an entrepreneur, it's important to prioritize the most important tasks first. This means taking some extra time during the day or week to plan what needs to be done ahead of time so that nothing is left undone or forgotten about. Doing this will help keep task-related stress at bay and give you more freedom in determining how best to divide up the rest of your day or week into a manageable schedule.Additionally, don't forget to add some non-work-related activities into your schedule, such as exercise or leisurely activities — these can help provide much-needed respite from your otherwise hectic workloads.Related: 15 of the Best Time Management and Productivity Books of All Time3. Take regular breaksIt's easy for entrepreneurs to get caught up in their work and forget about taking regular breaks throughout their day. But breaks are essential for maintaining both physical and mental health — they can help reduce stress levels while providing an opportunity for creativity, too.


Try setting reminders on your phone or computer so that you take regular breaks throughout the day – this could mean stepping away from the desk for 10 minutes every hour or even going for a walk during lunchtime, if possible! Taking regular breaks will refresh your mind and body alike, helping you stay productive yet balanced over time.Related: How to Achieve A CEO Level of Focus by Breaking Habits and Taking Breaks4. Learn to say noAs an entrepreneur, it can be easy to overextend yourself by saying yes too often when asked for favors or projects outside of work hours — but learning when (and how) to say no can ultimately save considerable amounts of unnecessary stress in the long run.Don't feel guilty if you need to turn down certain requests; just politely explain why it's not possible at this particular time, perhaps offering alternative solutions depending on what may be suitable instead. By knowing when (and how) to say no without feeling guilty, entrepreneurs can find greater peace of mind while still being able to give back where needed most.


5. Schedule regular 'me time'Making sure that there is adequate 'me time' built into each week is essential – regardless if it's reading a book in silence, going out with friends, or simply enjoying a warm bath after work hours — whatever activity works best for giving yourself some much-needed rest. Having this type of downtime allows entrepreneurs ample opportunity to recharge their batteries before returning to business mode — allowing them to manage better stress levels associated with being constantly busy with numerous tasks at hand.6. Don't neglect your health and well-beingLastly - one key area that entrepreneurs needn't forget about balancing is their health & well-being; don't neglect to eat nutritious food regularly during working hours nor avoid exercise altogether either — these are paramount needs necessary for keeping one's energy levels high while reducing any risks associated from sitting down all day — thus ensuring both physical & mental well-being remains balanced over longer periods.ConclusionManaging a successful career and a satisfying lifestyle outside of work can be difficult but achievable, no matter what stage in business development one might find themselves at now.The key lies in understanding where our limits lie and setting clear boundaries between our personal life and professional obligations accordingly—along with scheduling sufficient 'me' time each week where necessary. Following such guidelines helps ensure balance remains intact over extended periods while promoting productivity and achieving success simultaneously, too.

11,How to Transform Your Car Into an Alternative Workspace,"Feb 23, 2024",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-transform-your-car-into-a-productive-office-space/468759,"
Now that my children are getting older, I find myself meeting their needs less at home and more outside the home — more specifically, instead of braiding their hair, helping them with their homework or making them a snack, they're now looking to me to drive them to their activities and chauffeur them and their friends around town. As much as I love being a full-time mom, this has created a bit of a conundrum for me as a full-time business owner: How can I remain as involved in my kids' lives as I've always been while still getting in my required daily allotment of work?Enter the newest trend in American professional culture: mobile work time. And by ""mobile,"" I mean literally taking some work on the road with me in my automobile.Granted, using your car as an alternate workspace isn't conducive to certain duties and functions. When you need to hunker down and attend to serious tasks that require serious attention, there's no replacement for the permanent office space where you keep all the many tools of your trade. But as for a lot of the ""filler tasks"" that fill your days? You might be surprised at just how many you can accomplish from your car!



Related: Working Remote? These Are the Biggest Dos and Don'ts of Video ConferencingThe rules of the roadTo be clear, I'm not talking here about conversion to digital nomad life, the kind of roaming remote occupations made possible by vehicles like Nissan's e-NV200 WORKSPACe, launched in 2016.


Nor will I cover the spate of new products designed to keep us working efficiently wherever we are. There are numerous sources you can access that will point you to all the mobile equipment and technology you could ever need.Rather, for those of us who are still mostly office-bound, I'm just talking about squeezing more juice out of the fruits of our labors by taking advantage of the benefits of working on the go, including:It makes productive use of what would otherwise be dead time.It expands the boundaries of when, where and how you can be more efficient and time-effective.It gives you a break from the office, a change of scenery, without necessarily having to break from work.It provides time limits on tasks you want to limit (like phone calls you want to keep brief).Adobe agrees that certain tasks lend themselves particularly well to working out of your car: marketing and social media management, virtual assistance, writing and content creation, and sales and business development. No wonder I'm such a fan — as the CEO of my PR firm, that's what I do most of the time.Examples of prime opportunities to work out of your carHere are some recent instances when I was able to convert in-vehicle time to high-performance spans of work output.


Waiting in the cell phone lot at the airport. Over the holidays, I went to pick up family flying in. When their delay turned from 20 minutes to 40 to an hour, I happily found time to check and return all the phone messages that were awaiting me.Parked in the lot of an athletic field. One of my kids has an hour-long soccer practice two days a week. It hardly makes sense for me to drop her off and turn right around to pick her up, so I now stay parked beside the field, where I can not only keep an eye on her but also get a solid hour of uninterrupted work done. I now dedicate this ""wait time"" to going through my email box and paring it down. (I do the same thing when the kids want to hang out in the mall for a while.) It's made a significant difference in my inbox management.Breaking at highway rest stops. When you have to take longish drives, the breaks advised to stretch your legs and rest your back are an opportune time to multitask. Walking in circles around the lot, getting some steps in, I dictated half a dozen voice memos to myself on things to follow up on when I got back to the office, then several more to my staff, which I texted to them on the spot for timely implementation.Intentional turnoffs between client visits. On my last trip to Nashville to visit a handful of clients in person, I used the rental car as my ""think tank."" While driving to my different appointments, I turned off the radio, looked straight ahead and let my mind do its creative thing: PR campaign ideas, pitch themes, content creation. By the time I purposely pulled over before reaching my next meeting, I had several good brainstorming thoughts to jot down about my last meeting.Stealing away in the driveway or garage. Over winter break, the house just got too loud with all the kids home from school. I wanted to make a good first impression on a potential new client, so I grabbed my laptop, headed out to the garage and attached the portable organizer I store in my car for just such purposes to the back of my front seat. I conducted the call in peace, totally calm, without distractions, and landed the client. Granted, it was winter in upstate New York, so I warmed up the garage first with our space heater!Related: 21 Productive Things to Do on Your CommuteThe end of the roadLastly, a few tips I've learned from experience:For safety, I suggest backing into parking spaces so you can keep a better eye on your surroundings.Move to the passenger seat or back seat for room and comfort.Email yourself documents ahead of time that you know you'll need quick access to.Pre-plan to have a reliable hot spot where you're going to ""park it"" as well.Consider carrying along a collapsible file folder in your car to keep notes and paperwork organized per client when you're away from your desktop file system.You should never, ever attempt work duties that will distract you from driving when you're actually behind the wheel, motoring from point A to point B. Safety is obviously the paramount concern. But when you're not in transit, it's worth exploring how much you can get done on the road!

To their delight, the Haskin's neighbors embraced the concept. Situated in the beautiful Fall Creek neighborhood, the market's outdoor setup is near a golf course and several walking trails, drawing tons of people and their pets into the space every Sunday morning.Jonathan and Andrea prioritize being present in their space and providing a personalized experience for every visitor. Getting set up two hours before the market opens and staying until the last group trickles out, the pair walk around to greet and share their story with customers. In the market's early days, their daughters sat at the entrance making bracelets for shoppers as they walked in.


This community feel is what drew in reviewer Forest B., now a regular visitor of Fall Creek Farmers Market. ""All of the vendors were so personable, willing to share advice and their specific stories,"" his review reads. ""I particularly enjoyed the cultural diversity. So much to learn at each booth.""With 20+ vendors spanning global cuisines, there is no limit to the kind of food you can sample at Fall Creek Farmers Market. On his first visit alone, Forest tried a Colombian coffee blend, two empanada flavors, Vietnamese egg rolls, and an Italian ice dessert. The cherry on top was getting to engage with the vendors themselves, learning firsthand about their products and journeys.Related: 4 Reasons Why You Should Enter the Health and Wellness Industry""One [vendor] that's not mentioned in my review is the Indian couple who serve prepared foods there,"" Forest said. ""They are a little bit older. That's completely different, say, from the couple who owns Frostbite, which is the Italian ice vendor. They're youngsters and [are] actually looking to you to provide them information on your journey here in the United States. So you just learn quite a bit about the people. Sometimes people are a little surprised to find out that you know a lot about topics in their areas, but the way you learn a lot is by talking to people and being open and receptive.""


Forest's experience is a perfect example of Jonathan and Andrea's educational ecosystem in action. First and foremost, the market aims to teach its visitors about the importance of fresh, quality food. The Haskins ensure their vendors share this passion and make an effort to educate every customer who visits their booth. 90% of Fall Creek's vendors farm and ranch full-time. Some even take agriculture classes at Texas A&M.""They live it as we do,"" Jonathan said. ""And it starts from the inside. We are really passionate about immersing ourselves into the market, and we are very selective with who we allow [to be] a part of our team.""Jonathan and Andrea's goal is to be the tipping point that pushes customers into the world of local food shopping, and they've found that preparation is key. They engage with customers online ahead of each sale to make sure they have all the information they need for a smooth visit. Because offerings shift each week to spice things up for shoppers and ensure seasonal produce stays front and center, Jonathan and Andrea provide a list of vendors and produce options in advance to help customers plan their meals and build out their grocery lists before arriving at the market.Related: How This Healthy Food App Scored a $200K Investment


The most faithful customers do around 80% of their food shopping at Falls Creek Farmers Market, which was the vision the owners had in mind when they set out to build a business.""It's not a craft show. It's not a bake sale. You can actually come and get your pastured eggs and real items,"" Jonathan said. ""Knowing where your food is from is a big deal. It's like getting a root canal or heart surgery. So it feels really good to be able to serve and to be able to give them access as we have it.""Not only is shopping locally good for your health, but it's good for the local economy. Forest stressed the importance of spending your money and time at small businesses.""Business owners typically are here from other countries. [They] come from backgrounds in which there was virtually no safety net, so they bring their knowledge to the United States. When I'm looking at these businesses, I'm looking at how I can learn more so I can help other people in the community continue to start these small businesses that make our economy run.""


Beyond making visits, reviewing is a powerful way customers can show support. Jonathan and Andrea take every review they receive to heart, always looking to expand the offerings and inclusivity of their space. They find it important to stay receptive to feedback, keeping the dialogue with customers open, genuine, and full of love.In addition to prioritizing customer education and building community, Falls Creek Farmers Market believes:Passion starts from the inside. Put love and care into what you do and it will trickle down to your partners and employees—and ultimately your customers.Preparation is key. Communicate online with your customers ahead of a sale so they know what to expect. Plus, make time to help out with any problems that come up.Supporting local is a great way to learn new things. Opening up your mind and heart to small businesses might just help you discover an important lifestyle change.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Jonathan, Andrea, and Forest, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl.

One of my sons has a colossal book of bedtime stories. Each night, we try to tackle a couple of them. I'm always amazed at how the takeaways of those children's tales remain relevant for grown-ups, including entrepreneurs.Take The Emperor's New Clothes — the classic cautionary tale about the perils of groupthink. The adults are so eager to please the emperor that they stifle their opinions, even when the plain truth is as clear as day. It falls to an innocent child to offer a different, honest perspective.I've seen similar situations in boardrooms, between colleagues and leaders. That's why with my company, Jotform, one of my goals is to continually foster diverse ways of thinking. Working with people who have different cognitive styles is key to boosting performance. But, as research shows, we tend to do the opposite. Instead, we team up with likeminded professionals.

15,The Burden of Breaking Barriers is Pushing Black Leaders to Breaking Point. This DEI Expert Reveals Where We Are Going Wrong.,"Feb 16, 2024",Nika White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-burden-of-breaking-barriers-is-pushing-black-leaders-to/468172,"
With each passing year, there's always a ""first"" Black someone. The first Black mayor. The first Black billionaire. The first Black astronaut. No matter where we look, Black Americans are breaking barriers as the ""firsts"" in many major industries. Those who have broken barriers know firsthand how powerful one can feel in the arenas of business, education and science when they are the ""first"" to do something.But there are burdens, too — some of which affect not just the individual making waves but many generations of entrepreneurs and leaders to come as well. Here are some of the perks and perils that come with being the first.The power: you break barriersOne of the most renowned female entrepreneurs was Madam C.J. Walker. She was the first Black millionaire having earned her fortune as a beauty entrepreneur popularizing first-of-its-kind hair tools geared towards Black women. Today, the Black hair industry is a multi-billion dollar industry filled with Black entrepreneurs from every corner of the country selling everything from styling products to lace-front wigs. Those entrepreneurs stand on the shoulders of Madam C.J. Walker, whose entrepreneurship employed more than 40,000 Black women at the time and left a lasting legacy in the haircare space. We all need a ""first"" to break barriers in an industry for the floodgates to open for the rest. 



Related: 5 Qualities of Black Excellence Overlooked in the WorkplaceThe burden: they try to tear you downThe persistent challenge of being the first has come from adversity — within and outside of institutions. The latest Harvard University president, Claudine Gay, is a good example. Having served the shortest tenure as president in the history of the institution, Gay was ousted by conservative writer, filmmaker, and activist Christopher F. Rufo. Fueled by Rufo's accusations of plagiarism plus controversial congressional testimony about whether Harvard's free speech policies permitted or forbade speaking about harm to Jewish people, Gay was ousted. Flames of anger and protest about Gay being a Black woman president, as well as her controversial views, made her a target from the day she assumed the position. After much scrutiny and an investigation into plagiarism, Gay resigned on January 2, 2024. Being the first, especially in institutions that are used to being led by a certain gender, race, or class of people, can make some feel threatened and afraid of change. This is just one of the burdens individuals like Claudine Gay had to face.


Related: Managing a Black Woman? Here's How to Become Her Success Partner and Ally.The power: you influence changeConsidered one of the top abolitionists of his day, Frederick Douglass is a powerful example of how being the first can lead to lasting change. After escaping slavery in Maryland in the 19th century, Douglass used his impressive ability to read, write, and speak to influence and organize the abolition of slavery in Massachusetts and New York. At the time, not every current or freed slave was so articulate. The abolitionist movement needed a leader who was well-spoken, highly intelligent and could communicate the future of the abolitionist movement to those who wanted to take part. Frederick Douglass was that individual. His first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, published in 1845, became an instant bestseller and afforded him the financial means to legally buy back his freedom. Because of Douglass' galvanizing words and ideas, the North became a crucial region for thought leadership around the abolition of slavery. Being the first to open a conversation about change and using one's voice to catalyze that change is a power that firsts, like Douglass, get to enjoy. The burden: you become the ""exception""While many entrepreneurs stand on the shoulders of others, not every entrepreneur can rise to the same level as Jay-Z. Known for his iconic rap music and later for his entrepreneurial endeavors, Jay-Z has garnered an impressive net worth of $2.5 billion. While Jay-Z has used his fame and fortune to give back, open doors for other Black artists and entrepreneurs, and contribute significantly to the music industry, he has the burden of being the ""exception."" Many Black entrepreneurs struggle to make ends meet while working towards their dreams. They still experience uphill battles with racial stereotypes, glass ceilings and funding challenges. While other entrepreneurs struggle, the mainstream can say, ""Well, Jay-Z made it; why can't you?"" Being the first and the ""exception"" can make the journey to entrepreneurial success seem hard to reach for others. It can also give rise to a toxic narrative riddled with stereotypes and perceptions about race, ability and success. Sometimes, being the ""first"" raises the bar to a level that others struggle to achieve.Related: 6 Ways to Offer Allyship to Black Entrepreneurs Final thoughtsFor Black Americans, the battle to become free and to be seen as fully human and worthy of respect and success has been one that history has told well. We have many examples of excellence and perseverance to reflect on, from owning a record label to helping abolish slavery. The power the firsts have enjoyed is contagious and has inspired many Black entrepreneurs and changemakers to do something great. But adversity, barriers to entry, exclusion, fear of change and other issues have burdened even those who have experienced great success. Black Americans should keep fighting for greatness even at the risk of being torn down and being labeled the ""exception."" But institutions that put forth the first Black president or a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) officer in positions of power should have the awareness and courage to protect and stand by those firsts — even when calls for their resignation or departure are being echoed from every corner of the institution. Only through the perseverance of the firsts and the protection and courage of the institutions in which they serve can meaningful breakthroughs be maintained and preserved for generations to come.

16,Prioritize DEI and Crush Your ROI Goals — How Inclusive and Authentic Marketing Drive Business Growth,"Feb 16, 2024",Larry Adams,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-inclusive-and-authentic-marketing-drive-business-growth/468948,"
The evolution of DEI over the past several years has been marked by corporate fickleness, with several brands and businesses pledging public commitments and setting up frameworks that have since fallen short of true impact and action. In its first wave, DEI was seen as a moral imperative and compliance issue; the second wave will reveal how the brands that made DEI a true priority will start to see the payoff, literally, in the pockets of shareholders.It's more important than ever to make sure your brand content is authentic and racially appropriate — not just for your brand reputation, but to build and maintain a loyal and active consumer base.When diversity and inclusion are recognized as a strategic advantage, it rewards the boardroom and beyond. True DEI not only benefits employees and society at large but also translates into tangible financial returns for shareholders.



Related: Companies Are Deprioritizing DEI. Why They Shouldn't and How to Recommit.Opening the apertureThirty-nine percent of your purchasing audience is multicultural, which means inclusive communication can unlock this market. When you reach a wider audience, your ad dollars go further, new customers are acquired, and shareholders are happy.


Entrepreneurs who are looking for new ways to drive their business forward, look no further than DEI. It's easy to understand the importance of diversity and inclusion across the board, but these efforts are often misunderstood when it comes to marketing.That's why I founded XStereotype, an AI-powered platform that helps businesses predict how effective content will be across demographics. We've quantifiably proven that inclusivity sells. The more inclusive your advertising is, the more money you'll make.Our data shows that these traditional demographic markers hold less and less power over purchasing behavior. Socioeconomic status, region and education don't impact intent to purchase as much as lived experiences, including markers of ethnicity, gender, emotion and more. These are more significant signals as to whether or not they'll make a purchase.Our data reveals a strong correlation between positive emotional responses and positive interpretations of diversity in content. In fact, of the ads we've analyzed, purchase intent scores improved by 10% across the board for ads that received high inclusion scores. And that just makes sense: People are more likely to buy from your brand when they see themselves reflected in the content they're consuming.


From ""targeting"" to ""inclusion""Now is the time for brands to update their marketing strategies from ""targeting"" to ""inclusion."" When we're ""targeted"" as a demographic, we're often treated as a monolith — that's where the dangers of stereotyping can come into play.Targeted media can make us feel like a walking statistic, as opposed to consuming content that resonates with us and makes us feel heard. Targeting is the old way of approaching marketing: It leads to negative brand sentiment, and it's innately segregating.Many brand leaders make the mistake of trying to laser-focus on just one target audience, when in reality, the ads and content that work best appeal to all audiences. To optimize your ROI, reexamine the inclusivity of your message and brand personality.Companies that close their aperture and put their dollars solely towards more targeted groups are going to shrivel up and shrink and shutter. Opening the aperture is the way to survive: Since 39% of your purchasing audience is multicultural, why not speak to them too?


Related: The Key to Developing More Informed and Inclusive DEI Marketing StrategiesInclusion sells. Authenticity sells.Here's a basic example: Let's say a local hair salon has posters in their windows showcasing the beautiful styles they offer. Solid strategy, right? But what if these photos only feature white women, and half of the local community are people of color? A Black woman might walk past that salon every day without stopping in — not because she doesn't need a trim, but because the ads don't resonate. Authentic representation matters — not just because it's inclusive, but because it gets the consumer through the door.You don't need to create a whole new product or service, just make it more relatable. It's not that these audiences don't want or need what you're selling; it's that your value proposition didn't speak to them because they couldn't connect with your content.This is the benefit of being inclusive: You make your ad work harder, smarter and better. Multicultural understanding will help these ad dollars go farther and reach a greater audience. Your marketing budget will be optimized when focused on developing content that speaks to a broader audience in a real, non-stereotypical way.


So, next time you're wondering how to boost sales or really nail that next product launch, consider the audiences you might be missing. Prioritize diversity, speak authentically, and watch DEI turn into ROI.

17,How the Happiest Cafe in Virginia Beach Fosters Charm and Community,"Feb 16, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/virginia-beach-entrepreneur-on-what-makes-happy-cafe-unique/469809,"
When Tomeka Wallace opened Happy Cafe in Virginia Beach, Virginia, she wanted to fill a coffee void. With nowhere in her hometown to get a cup of coffee up to her standards, she decided to take action. What began as a small cafe and sandwich shop became a diverse eatery serving breakfast, lunch and dinner in a cozy setting.The evolution didn't happen overnight and wasn't without some growing pains. Wallace's initial focus on healthful items like salads and smoothies proved difficult to sustain, even with a gym across the street.""We had people come in and say, 'You don't have soda? You don't have homemade sweet tea? You don't have fries?'"" she says.



Restaurant hours were another operating decision that Wallace struggled with in the early days. Although Happy Cafe used to stay open until 8 p.m., Wallace moved closing time to 3 p.m. when she realized that the dinner crowd was too small to sustain business operations for 13 hours a day.Ultimately, through trial and error — and an unwavering commitment to her customers — Wallace found her sweet spot. She taught herself how to navigate the kitchen, cooking up a delicious burger recipe and roasted potatoes to stand in for the fries people asked for. She even added dinner items to her menu to satisfy customers who missed her evening hours. Her tasty menu and friendly service have built a base of loyal customers and reviewers, including Yelp Elite Odester H.


""One of my favorite restaurants in the 757,"" Odester's review reads. ""If y'all haven't checked them out, you are missing out on a delicious, local, Black-owned, woman-owned restaurant. I went with a friend for dinner, and everything was delicious… The customer service is top-tier. The owner is so kind, and the entire atmosphere has you coming back.""Related: They Barely Had Enough Money to Set Up One Van. Now This Cleaning Company Is a Five-Star Operation With a Loyal Customer Base. Here's Their Secret to Growth.Wallace and her mother, who co-manage the restaurant, are huge believers in the power of good customer service. With an open kitchen, Wallace can greet customers from behind the grill as they walk in. Her mother is Happy Cafe's ""server mascot,"" drifting from table to table to make sure everyone is comfortable as they settle in.""There's three things. People come in for the ambiance [and] service. And food is always last,"" Wallace says. ""If we nail it with the service, but say there's something on the floor or a table may not be clean, they'll still come back because the service was good. If the food was messed up but the service was good, they're gonna come back. So service is everything.""


The welcoming community that Wallace and her mother have built keeps Odester coming back to Happy Cafe meal after meal. She appreciates that the owners know her personally and always take the time to ask how she and her son are doing.""They're not just there to say, 'What do you need? What do you want?' They're fine if you're [there] for an hour, two hours, three hours. They want you to have a great experience.""Wallace also brings this hospitality into her online presence. Even if it takes her a week or two to get to everything, she is determined to respond to all Yelp reviews and ""make it right"" with customers, whether that requires a staff meeting to discuss a mishap or adding a new menu item.These efforts don't go unnoticed. Customers like Odester value the personal touches Wallace adds to her reviews.


""Once you spend your money, the transaction is done. But the fact that she takes the time to go on Yelp, just saying, 'Hey, thank you so much,' it definitely makes you feel valued,"" Odester says. ""I haven't had too many responses from owners, so when they do [respond], I'm definitely going to come back. It makes me feel like, 'Okay, you value me [as] more than just a dollar.'""Related: Inside the Spa Where Calming Treatments Are Served Up With Craft BeerWallace likes to invest her limited time outside the kitchen in platforms like Yelp rather than social media, finding that review engagement is a productive way to draw in customers who are ready to spend.""I look at some places, and they have 50,000 followers, but do you have 50,000 people coming to your establishment within 30 days or within six months? If I'm doing things to get a big audience on [social] platforms, is that coming in monetarily? Say if we did an ad with Yelp, or I post that we're open, we get people coming in. That's where it matters to me.""


Online platforms are a great way for businesses to advertise what makes them unique. Like many reviewers, Odester is eager to invest in local, minority-owned businesses, and she appreciated that Happy Cafe conveyed its status as a Black-owned and woman-owned business via Yelp attributes. By searching for these attributes on Yelp, she's able to not only find places like Happy Cafe but also share them with friends, family and like-minded reviewers.Related: 'Why Are We Shouting?' Inside the Online Community That Is Helping Entrepreneurial Moms Connect, Collaborate and Stay Sane""When my friends come into town, they already know we're going to Happy Cafe,"" Odester says. ""And from me doing that, my friends now go on their own. I see them posting on Yelp, and they're at Happy Cafe, and I'm like, 'Why didn't you tell me you were going to Happy Cafe? I would've come!' Sharing businesses [lets] folks know that they're here and they're here to stay. So let's breathe life into them and do what we can do to make sure that [Happy Cafe] is here for 50, 60, 100-plus years.""Along with friendly and hands-on customer service, Happy Cafe believes in:


Staying flexible. Don't be afraid to try new things and scale back on changes as you figure out what works best for you, your staff and your customers.Responding to reviews. Engaging with customers online can improve your business operations and customer retention, helping customers feel like they are more than just a dollar sign.Develop a digital presence.

18,Why the National Football League Is a Leader in Social and Corporate Impact,"Feb 14, 2024",Craig Kielburger,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/why-the-nfl-is-a-leader-in-social-impact/469239,"
The expectations for this year's Super Bowl were high, but I don't think anyone predicted that this year's event would turn out to be America's most-watched program since the moon landing, with an astounding 123.4 million viewers tuning in to the big game.While the Taylor Swift effect certainly was a factor in achieving that staggering number, there is more to the modern NFL than celebrity fans, touchdowns and tailgate parties. The league has grown into a case study for a corporation seeking to support its communities across the country.The NFL has been a long-time supporter of charitable causes, but in recent years, it has significantly ramped up its player safety, social responsibility and social justice initiatives.



A visit to the NFL's Community page on its website shows the breadth of the league's initiatives, from environmental sustainability to domestic violence education, youth fitness, early cancer detection and prevention, and building character in young people.I learned of the massive scope of the NFL's social responsibility work through another of its initiatives, Inspire Change, the league's social justice platform. Its goal is to reduce barriers to opportunity, particularly in communities of color. It operates at all levels of the league, from current and former players to the NFL teams and their owners and up to the league head office.


Related: A Former NFL Plays Says 'Indentity Shifting' Is the Key to SuccessInspire Change facilitates NFL investment in organizations, programs and initiatives that reduce barriers to opportunity, anchored in four pillars: Education, Economic Advancement, Community-Police Relations, and Criminal Justice Reform.My connection to the program came from a partnership between Inspire Change, my organization (Legacy+), and the Martin Luther King III Foundation.Martin Luther King III, his wife Arndrea Waters King, and their daughter Yolanda Renee King were seeking ways to commemorate the upcoming 100th birthday of Martin's father, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The result was Realize the Dream, a bold new initiative that aims to transform, unify and uplift America by rallying communities to perform 100 million hours of service by the 100th anniversary of Dr. King's birth.


In seeking to amplify Dr. King's vision of unity and launch the historic community service program, the NFL was an obvious choice. No other platform has the reach or worldwide profile held by the NFL. In 2023, the league averaged 17.2 million viewers per game for its 272 regular season games, creating a potential viewing audience unmatched in North America.Those significant audience numbers rise exponentially during the playoffs, so we worked closely with the NFL to launch the five-year service campaign during Wildcard Weekend, which coincided with MLK Day 2024.The game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Tampa Bay Buccaneers opened with a commemorative coin toss with Martin Luther King III, Arndrea Waters King and Yolanda Renee King.A series of events and activations took place over the weekend, with MLK decals and Dr. King's iconic ""Be Love"" message affixed to the helmets of all 318 players participating in the weekend games. The ""Be Love"" and ""It Takes All of Us"" messages were also stenciled into the end zones for all games.


The game opened by the Kings drew an audience of over 29.2 million viewers. While that number seems low compared to the viewership for the Super Bowl, the game was ESPN's second-most watched NFL game in its history. Public service announcements aired over the weekend on all the networks covering the games (ESPN, ABC and CBS), with over 180 million viewers taking in the games and viewing the powerful Realize the Dream messaging.Beyond its ability to reach tens of millions of viewers, we looked for the NFL's support due to its work to raise awareness on diversity and equity issues. Along with Inspire Change, the league is on the record in committing to increasing the number of black head coaches and executives so that the diversity on the field is reflected back on the sidelines and in owners' boxes.To that end, the league adopted the Rooney Rule in 2003. Named after a former Pittsburgh Steelers owner who also served as the chair of the league's diversity committee, the rule set out hiring and interview requirements for filling coaching and front office positions to ensure more minority candidates were considered and hired.Related: Why All of Us Need to Join the Fight for Workplace Diversity


The NFL's support for Realize the Dream is yet another positive step in accelerating the league's commitment to diversity and inclusion, and it may already be reaping benefits.Within days of the launch of the campaign, the New England Patriots named Jerod Mayo as their new head coach, the Atlanta Falcons hired Raheem Morris to lead their team, and the Las Vegas Raiders elevated interim head coach Antonio Pierce to full-time status.While those three hirings happening so close to the launch of Realize the Dream could be written off as coincidence, they may also reflect how the league's open commitment to diversity can influence the actions of ownership, teams, and players.That is the power of corporate impact initiatives that permeate an entire organization. It would be one thing for the NFL to make a lump sum donation to Realize the Dream or some other cause, but the level of buy-in was visible on team uniforms and helmets, in the end zones on the field, all while tens of millions of viewers watched from homes and restaurants.


While corporations making donations to charitable organizations is a commendable way to try and give back, concrete actions like those being taken by the NFL deliver true impact and will ultimately be the drivers of change.

19,The Difference Between Startup Success and Failure Comes Down to This One Thing,"Feb 12, 2024",Hilt Tatum IV,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-difference-between-startup-success-and-failure-comes/468936,"
In every company, employees are an invaluable resource. Not only are they the ones who help startups hit the ground running, working fast and furious to meet outrageous goals, but they also bring an incredible background of education, experience, abilities, creativity and more.These are the intangible factors that make human capital such a critical piece of the startup puzzle.As a former entrepreneur and now an investor who helps startups realize their dreams, I know how a talented and motivated workforce can mean the difference between a successful business venture and one that fails.



Let's discuss how human capital can be the secret weapon for a thriving startup.Related: Beyond the Basics: 5 Surprising Qualities Investors Seek in a Winning Team


Invest in people and their skillsWhile entrepreneurs have great ideas, they need a team with the right abilities to take their vision from a concept to a viable product or service. That means finding the right people with particular skills and experiences to drive innovation and solve problems others can't.Personality, attitude and work ethic are crucial. That's one element of human capital that can't be ignored. You can hire someone who is the best in their field, but if they create division and strife in your team, it won't work.Conversely, your startup's success depends on people who know what they're doing and do it well. It's hard to build a strong company with good people who aren't contributing to the day-in-day-out technical needs of the organization.It's a balancing act you must evaluate correctly the first time, as hiring the wrong person can set your company back. And in the fast-paced startup environment, that doesn't bode well for future investments.


Attracting and keeping top talentAnyone familiar with startup culture knows that it can get pretty vicious when you're trying to hire the best talent. It's highly competitive, with many fledgling companies vying for precious capital.That's why creating a culture that attracts the right candidates is essential. With so much transition over the past decade, there are not many ways startups can differentiate themselves in a tangible sense, such as working virtually, ping pong tables, free food, etc. With most companies already offering those things, it becomes more about selling your vision and what the future could hold with the right people on board. Appealing to a candidate's sense of self-worth and intrinsic value can go a long way to bring them on.However, once you have them in the fold, the game's not over yet. According to Founders Circle, the average employee tenure in high-growth startups is two years. If getting them in the door wasn't hard enough, keeping them there is even more challenging.This attrition rate makes sense. Startup life is a grind, and it can quickly take a toll on everyone within the organization. That's why employee engagement initiatives are so important. As an entrepreneur, you have to remember that you have real people working for you, and even the most devoted among them have needs.


Talk with your team members individually and have honest conversations about how they're doing, how the company is doing and how your team can help each other through challenging periods. Ask them what they need or if there's any further education or learning that might help them in their roles. You have no idea how the simple act of taking time to attend to your employees, treating them as people and not resources, can motivate them to keep their eyes on the prize.Related: Here's What's Brewing in the Minds of Startup InvestorsA culture of continuous learningWhile the scheduling and budget constraints of running a startup can be brutal sometimes, it's still important to carve out opportunities for your people to focus on enhanced learning and skill development. Giving employees the chance to pursue their passions and improve their craft is an integral part of the human capital process.If you think about the technology and software industries, change and evolution are constant. It only makes sense that you want your team to stay updated on the latest trends and developments, bringing these new insights into your organization. You want your team to evolve with the technology they're working with, so allow them time to focus on the latest updates and integrate those ideas into their daily work.


Not only is this an essential investment in your company, but you're also sending your people the message that you value them and their careers. You want them to be the best versions of themselves and give them opportunities to build on their knowledge and experiences.That can be scary, as it's always a possibility they may take all this new knowledge to another organization. But that's a risk you should be willing to take if it means improving your product and service while bolstering your company culture.Building a winning teamAs mentioned, I've been on both sides of startup life as an entrepreneur and an investor. In my experience, I have found and firmly believe that no single individual can get all the work done, nor do they have the talent to do so.As a leader within an organization, it's your responsibility to recognize that you can't do it all, and you shouldn't have to. Finding the right people makes an incredible difference in the work you do. That includes building a diverse and inclusive team. A robust and diverse team is a good signal to investors of a healthy organization, and it also pushes your team to think in new, innovative ways crucial to development.


Every person in your organization should be seen as a strategic ally and resource for your company's continued growth, development and success.

""Be nice, be clean, and be present."" This is the mantra of Philip and Sibs Harrell, owners of Sundae Scoop, a mom-and-pop ice cream shop in Virginia Beach, Virginia.Customer service is the number one priority for these business owners. Whether chatting with customers or selecting and training staff, Philip and Sibs focus on creating an inviting community space for friends and families to gather.Related: 7 Essentials of Great Customer Service



""At the end of the day, being in the community is what an ice cream shop is about,"" Philip said. ""We represent every culture that's in our area. That's where the ube ice cream comes from, or the coquito, or rum raisin. Each one of those [flavors] is gonna respond or touch something in someone that they remember from their childhood.""Sundae Scoop's warm and engaging customer service has earned the business a 4.8-star Yelp rating with nearly 100 reviews (at the time of writing). Most reviewers discuss positive experiences they've had interacting with Philip and his friendly staff, including Yelp Elite Aneesa P.


Arriving right after the store had opened for the day, Aneesa chatted with Philip as she ordered her ice cream. He shared the story of the shop, helped her pick out the perfect gluten-free flavor, and even helped her snap the perfect photos and videos to accompany her review.""I felt like we really connected,"" Aneesa said. ""He wasn't just like 'Here's your ice cream. Go.' He was like, 'Hey, I want to let you know, behind the scenes, the story of how I came up with this idea.'""Philip and Sibs see positive reviews like Aneesa's as a key tool for boosting staff morale. When a scooper gets called out by name for contributing to a positive customer experience, Philip and Sibs are the first to let them know.""They're young kids. They're very self-conscious,"" Sibs said. ""So it feels really good when people give them their big-ups and name them.""


Philip and Sibs spend a lot of time not only encouraging existing staff but also hiring scoopers who will contribute to Sundae Scoop's hospitable culture. They ask all job candidates to thoroughly read the reviews and take note of what people love most about the shop. They want to make sure all new and potential hires are ready to deliver the peppy, friendly service Sundae Scoop promises.Related: How Chef JJ Started a Rice Bowl Revolution in HarlemAs a community-driven space, Sundae Scoop is active in the Virginia Beach area, partnering with local schools and businesses on events like ice cream socials. Philip and Sibs are also committed to mentoring fellow small business owners, connecting with other businesses through community groups and promoting them on the walls of their shop. In his three years running Sundae Scoop, Philip has helped three other businesses get off the ground.""They took the risk too. They took that leap of faith,"" he said. ""So if someone like myself or my wife can come along and help them on their journey, that's all the better because it's building a stronger community.""


Philip has found these relationships especially important to cultivate as a Black business owner. He speaks to the fear of the unknown that can surface in the Black business owner community when you don't know who to turn to or what resources are out there.Related: 3 Strategies This Vietnamese Noodle Shop Has Used to Thrive in Minnesota""I always encourage people just to join something,"" he said.

And you need to be able to use advice from all of them and put it together.""Supporting Black-owned businesses was part of Aneesa's motivation to visit Sundae Scoop. Being one of a handful of Black women in her field, she was able to connect with Philip over what it's like to be successful in a white-dominated space. Aneesa stressed the importance of writing reviews to ensure that great Black-owned businesses don't get closed down due to a lack of support.


""We all have to support each other, not bring each other down,"" she said. ""[It's] really important to me to be able to let everybody know, 'Hey, we can own all of these spaces and also be successful as well.'""Philip and Sibs remind themselves every day of their commitment to being groundbreakers in their community with a mural on the wall of Sundae Scoop. This reimagining of the famous painting ""Under the Wave off Kanagawa"" represents a line from artist and rapper Tobe Nwigwe's song ""EAT"" that reads: ""[We] don't just ride the wave, we create it.'""""[Sundae Scoop] is our way of creating our own waves, of making our own path and making sure that we're going to be okay,"" Philip said. ""At the end of the day, just be good, support each other, and help each other where you can, and I can almost promise you that it's going to come back your way.""In addition to the power of warm and engaging customer service, Sundae Scoop believes:Reviews are the roadmap to success. Positive feedback can be used to set key expectations for staff, and critical feedback can be used to make important changes to operations or processes that make the customer experience easier or more enjoyable.Friendly staff play an important role in creating positive customer experiences, and training them on your processes and values is a key part of your customer service strategy.

21,Celebrating Black History and Culture Is the Right Thing to Do — and Good for Business. Here's How.,"Feb 7, 2024",Christine Alexis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/celebrating-black-history-and-culture-is-the-right-thing-to/468891,"
In an era where cultural consciousness plays a pivotal role in shaping consumer perceptions, Black History Month offers a significant platform for brands to demonstrate their commitment to the Black community. However, beyond the ethical and social advantages, there lies a critical question for executives: ""What is the return on investment of Black History Month marketing efforts?""Black marketing should not be confined to just one month. These efforts should be part of an organization's overall multicultural marketing strategy. And as a proud Black marketer, I understand the countless ways brands can authentically celebrate Black culture without alienating Black consumers. Not only is the inclusion of Black consumers in marketing the right thing to do — it's also the most profitable.Related: 3 Authentic Ways Brands Can Celebrate Black History Month



The financial impact of diversity and inclusion initiativesThe Black consumer market, with its projected buying power exceeding $1.8 trillion, stands as a testament to the economic potential of this demographic. This figure not only surpasses the annual GDPs of nations like Mexico and the Netherlands but also highlights why this market cannot be overlooked. For companies, Black History Month offers a strategic window to connect with this community.The crux of effectively engaging with this market, particularly during Black History Month, lies in developing marketing campaigns that authentically resonate with the Black community. According to McKinsey, research shows that ""Black consumers are much more likely to seek out and place emphasis on brands that are trustworthy, have a clear social mission, appeal to their cultural values and generally have credibility among the Black community."" By aligning marketing initiatives with the values and expectations of the Black community, companies can cultivate a loyal customer base, which is instrumental in driving sales and enhancing long-term revenue streams.


Enhancing consumer engagement and loyaltyThe effectiveness of culturally conscious marketing is also evident in consumer engagement and brand loyalty metrics. For example, it's 6 to 7 times more expensive to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing customer. This places a high premium on customer loyalty, particularly within demographics known for their brand allegiance, such as the Black community.A study by Google found that 66% of Black consumers are more likely to return to a brand with advertising that authentically reflects their race/ethnicity. Similarly, a Deloitte study found that 57% of consumers are more loyal to brands that commit to addressing social inequities in their actions. Also, an Adobe survey revealed that 38% of respondents are more inclined to support brands that showcase diversity in their advertising. Additionally, 34% of consumers have boycotted a brand at least once due to a lack of representation in advertisements or actions. These statistics highlight the importance of authentic engagement, especially during culturally significant periods like Black History Month.When brands engage in marketing that genuinely celebrates Black history and culture, it reflects the company's ethical marketing practices and aligns with sound financial principles. Cultivating loyalty within a community known for its strong brand connections translates into repeated business and increased spending — factors that are crucial for sustained financial success. It's also important to note that loyal customers often become brand ambassadors and can organically extend the brand's reach.Related: Unpacking the Black Demographic Shift and Why Marketers Must Re-Examine Their Strategies


Impact on long-term brand equity and reputationInvesting in culturally conscious marketing and demonstrating a genuine commitment to the issues facing the Black community can significantly elevate a company's long-term brand equity and reputation. Research conducted by Sprout Social shows that most consumers (70%) believe it's important for brands to take a public stand on social and political issues. This strategic approach establishes a brand's reputation as a leader in social responsibility. Genuinely supporting issues impacting the communities in which a company serves creates a resilient brand image that is adaptive, socially aware and deeply trusted by consumers.Navigating potential pitfallsSuccessfully navigating the challenges in multicultural marketing, especially during Black History Month, is essential for maintaining brand integrity and earning audience trust. A 2022 study by Insider Intelligence showed significant skepticism among Black internet users in the United States towards the motives behind large corporations' Black History Month promotions. The study revealed that nearly one-third of the users were skeptical about the intentions of social media-run businesses that launch such campaigns, pointing to a crucial need for authenticity in these marketing efforts.Another significant pitfall is cultural appropriation, which can be mitigated by incorporating diversity within the company's structure. Hiring a diverse staff not only provides a range of experiences and perspectives but also contributes to better decision-making and business practices. This approach is supported by a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) study, which found that companies with diverse management teams saw a 19% increase in revenue compared to their less diverse counterparts.To effectively circumvent these potential pitfalls, brands must adopt a proactive and thoughtful strategy. This involves engaging with cultural consultants, forming partnerships with community leaders and fostering ongoing dialogues with the communities they intend to reach. This comprehensive approach ensures that marketing campaigns are not only culturally sensitive and relevant but also authentically resonate with the target audience.

It encompasses improved brand perception, increased consumer loyalty and long-term market positioning. As society increasingly values corporate social responsibility, integrating cultural consciousness into marketing strategies becomes not just an ethical imperative but a business necessity. In celebrating Black History Month, brands can demonstrate their commitment to diversity and inclusion while driving tangible business results.

22,DEI Initiatives Are Dissolving — Here's How Managers Can Step Up and Reverse This Unsettling Trend,"Jan 11, 2024",Ayesha Whyte,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/dei-initiatives-are-dissolving-how-leaders-can-reverse/465726,"
A recent disturbing trend has emerged that threatens our collective progress: the dissolution of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. This unsettling shift has far-reaching negative impacts, stifling the advancement of women of color and undermining the richness of diversity in our workplaces.However, this is not only about work. It is about what we as a society espouse as our values. If individualism, ingenuity and equality are integral cornerstones of who we are, then ensuring all perspectives are heard and that all people are equally valued should be instinctual. Diversity is the engine that drives innovation, empathy and creativity. It fosters stronger decision-making and problem-solving by bringing a variety of viewpoints to the table, leading to more comprehensive and effective solutions.DEI strategies are not just nice to have, they are a requirement to ensure that everyone, regardless of their background, has an equal opportunity to contribute and succeed. When DEI initiatives are allowed to wither away due to underfunding and underutilization, we take steps backward, moving away from the progress that has been hard-fought for decades. That backtracking is a societal loss as well as a corporate one.



Related: Companies Are Deprioritizing DEI. Why They Shouldn't and How to Recommit.The negative impact of DEI dissolution on companiesAs reported by NPR, companies facing economic pressures have cut DEI jobs. Indeed has seen DEI job postings drop by a staggering 38% since July 2023.


This trend is not isolated to a few companies. The number of diversity and inclusion initiatives at U.S. companies jumped from 29% in 2019 to 43% in 2021. That rate has since dipped, and the number of companies with DEI programs has dropped 33% since 2020.This dissolution of DEI initiatives has far-reaching negative impacts on companies. Employee morale can plummet when DEI initiatives are slashed, particularly among minority groups. When companies don't invest in DEI, it sends an obvious message to employees about where the company's priorities lie. This can lead to a sense of disillusionment and decreased job satisfaction, ultimately resulting in reduced productivity.Innovation, too, suffers when diversity is not valued. A diverse workforce brings different perspectives and ideas to the table, fostering creativity and problem-solving. Without this diversity, companies risk becoming stagnant and falling behind in an increasingly competitive market.Market share can also be negatively affected. As consumers become more socially conscious, they are more likely to support companies that align with their values. A company that does not prioritize DEI may lose out to competitors that do.


The role of managers in reversing this downward trendAs the trend of dissolving DEI initiatives continues, it's time for managers to take a stand. Managers have a unique opportunity and responsibility to champion DEI within their teams and departments. By doing so, they can help reverse this disconcerting trend and create a more inclusive corporate landscape.Research overwhelmingly supports the benefits of diverse and inclusive teams. Companies in the top quartile for ethnic diversity are 35% more likely to outperform their industry peers. Likewise, companies with more diverse management teams have 19% higher revenues due to innovation.How can managers foster such diversity and inclusion? Implementing unconscious bias training is one effective strategy. This type of training helps employees recognize and overcome their inherent biases, fostering a more inclusive workplace. A study by Harvard Business Review found that companies that use unconscious bias training are more likely to hire and promote women and racial minorities.Mentorship programs can also play a pivotal role. By pairing employees with mentors who can guide their career development, companies can ensure a more diverse leadership pipeline. A study by Cornell found mentorship programs can increase the representation of underrepresented groups in management by 9-24%.


Ellevator, a private membership organization, is leading the charge in creating community and learning opportunities for women of color. As reported by Essence, this innovative platform aims to uplift the skills and networks of women of color, helping them advance in the workplace.Ellevator's approach addresses the unique challenges faced by mid-level career women of color in the professional world. By providing tailored support and mentorship, it aids in overcoming obstacles such as unconscious bias and limited access to opportunities. This personalized approach is crucial for the success of development programs for women of color.Related: Many Companies Are Backtracking On Their Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Programs. Here's Why That's A MistakeUpholding DEI: A manager's role in sustaining inclusivityDiversity, equity and inclusion are not mere corporate buzzwords but crucial elements that drive innovation, market share and employee satisfaction. As we have seen, the dissolution of DEI initiatives can have far-reaching negative impacts on companies.


At this critical crossroads, managers play an instrumental role. Through actionable strategies such as investing in the advancement of underrepresented populations, inclusive hiring practices and sponsorship/mentorship programs, managers can foster a diverse and inclusive environment that benefits everyone.

23,How to Lead a Multigenerational Workforce to Success,"Jan 8, 2024",Gisele Marcus,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-lead-a-multigenerational-workforce/467050,"
Global trends in employee experience and recruiting are evolving at a breakneck pace, not least in terms of team diversity. People from multiple walks of life — and with different educational backgrounds and beliefs — increasingly share both virtual and physical spaces, and ideally work together for a common cause. This dynamic was underscored by a 2022 U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics report forecasting that the number of workers ages 75 and older will increase by 77.5% by the end of 2023 and that the number identifying as neither black nor white — whether multiracial, Asian or other — would increase by 23.1%.We're also seeing the evolution of multigenerational teams. A decade ago, companies tended to prefer more homogeneous groups — in which older organizations and enterprises retained older staff members, while bright young startups hired younger minds. Now, it's not uncommon to find five generations working side by side: the Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials and Generation Z. Managing such a workforce can certainly present leadership hurdles, but it can also open new areas of opportunity.Related: 5 Generations in the Workplace (and Why We Need Them All)



Leadership challengesManaging a staff representing various age groups requires innovation in both team building and culture creation, as each group brings its own set of norms, in-jokes, biases and language. A Baby Boomer raised in post-war frugality, for example, will think about money differently than a Gen Z member who might be just discovering the world of work.Ageism might be less famous and talked about than sexism and racism, but it's still a pervasive prejudice. Without managerial training in sensitivity and empathy, biases can wreak havoc when different age groups work together. And yes, it typically affects older generations, who might face discriminatory treatment or unfair dismissal, but biases toward younger generations also exist. Younger team members are frequently labeled as lazy, flaky or entitled, yet the U.S. Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 does not protect workers under 40. And, according to research by the BBC, older generations may be judging younger ones both too harshly and by standards that are no longer considered the norm, leading to ageist remarks like ""Generation Snowflake"" or the ""entitled Millennial.""


As a result of these challenges, you may be hesitant to fully commit to building and managing a multigenerational workforce. According to a 2020 article by Deloitte, ""The Post-Generational Workforce: From Millennials to Perennials,"" 70% of organizations claim that leading such a crew is important for their success, but only 10% say they're ready for it.But if you can take the leap, opportunities await. Companies that approach age differences through a positive lens can find new ways to deliver optimal creativity, fuel knowledge transfer, boost revenue and nurture happier and more fulfilled staff members.Meeting the needs of a multigenerational teamDiversity is not merely a metric to be tracked; it is an essential component of businesses that hope to prosper in correspondingly diverse marketplaces. So, strategies are best to ensure that different generations have a chance to shine and belong.Related: How to Create a More Inclusive Workplace


• Prioritize emotional intelligence: Creating a sense of belonging in the workplace requires a high level of this essential personal characteristic, also referred to as EI. In order to nurture it, one must be able to identify and understand his, her, or their own emotions in order to effectively hold space for others'. It also means being able to recognize and admit to biases, so as to effectively spot biases at work among individuals and/or organizations.Emotional intelligence can be taught, but the key is reinforcing this behavior within teams by consistently modeling empathy. This point is backed by research: A Catalyst survey of just under 900 U.S. employees found that ""50% of people with highly empathic senior leaders report [frequent feelings of] inclusion at work, compared to only 17% of people with less empathic senior leadership.""• Work on openness by maintaining a curious mindset: An open mind is critical to managing a diverse team and encouraging positive communication among its members. It's vital for employees to be open to hearing the thoughts and ideas of colleagues whose experiences differ.Ageism can be a barrier here, too, for both leaders and colleagues, and the former group would be well advised to listen democratically — to avoid discounting younger employees' ideas as being perhaps ""too idealistic,"" and older teammates' input as ""too traditional."" Instead, the focus should be on the merits of ideas, and how any and all might springboard a company or department forward.


I referenced a Deloitte study above, and it's helpful to spotlight that company as an example of maintaining such a curious mindset. In addition to being a standard-bearer in research, it's also at pains to reflect on previous findings and statements, and its 2020 report urged other companies to think outside of the generational label and view their workforces as havens of diversity.Related: How to Create a Thriving Workplace by Leading With Authenticity• Take pride in successful methods of resolving issues: When managing multigenerational or other varied teams, resolving issues quickly to reduce the risk of resentment and future conflict is essential. Consider IBM as a case in point: Lawsuits continue to be filed against the tech giant by older workers alleging age discrimination, claiming that its goal was to replace them with younger candidates.Encouraging forgiveness in the conflict resolution process is vital. All generations will make mistakes; biases simply sneak up sometimes, and employees should be encouraged to address resulting negative feelings directly, and in a safe place. Leaders should hone communication skills to investigate issues, explore the feelings of all involved and tirelessly build new and ever-better environments.

24,Are Your Christian Holidays Excluding Your Staff? DEI Expert Reveals How We Can Equitably Handle Time Off For The Company.,"Dec 21, 2023",Nika White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/are-your-christian-holidays-excluding-your-staff-dei/466749,"
It's that time of the year again when ""Let's circle back in the new year"" is the recurring mantra around the office while employees schedule their much-needed time off. If you're responsible for approving requests for paid time off, you may have seen some interesting dates — some that don't seem to align with Christmas and other Christian holidays. You may have encountered requests around the three other December holidays that aren't Christian-centric and that HR and hiring managers often overlook.Before you hit ""deny"" on that PTO request, make sure you aren't saying no to someone's religious holiday needs. There are three religious and cultural holidays in December that may have slipped your mind. Here's how to stay on top of your employees' requests for holiday time off and keep your business afloat at the same time.Brush up on Hanukkah, Kwanzaa and Bodhi DayAlthough 63% of Americans identify as Christian, that leaves 37% who don't — many of these people celebrate religious holidays and periods that aren't Christianity-centric and here are three that you should be aware of.



HanukkahThis Jewish holiday period begins this year on Thursday, December 7, 2023, and runs through Friday, December 15, 2023. For several days, different themes are celebrated, candles are lit on the menorah, there's daily reading of Scripture, recitation of some of the Psalms, and singing of special hymns. All of which take time off and dedication to fully enjoy. If you have Jewish employees at your company, be sure to respect their needs for family and tradition during this period.KwanzaaKwanzaa is a pan-African holiday that started in the United States in the 1960s. This holiday period begins this year on Tuesday, December 26, and ends on Monday, January 1, 2024. It includes celebrating a different value every day during that period, wearing symbolic colors, reciting sayings from great black thinkers, African drumming and sharing a meal from the African diaspora. Be sure to honor the paid time off requests of those who celebrate Kwanzaa.


Bodhi DayBodhi Day is a Buddhist holiday that occurs this year on Friday, December 8, 2023. Bodhi Day commemorates the day of Buddha's enlightenment. It involves lots of prayer and meditation, reading scriptures, decorating trees with colorful lights, and having meals with family. Be sure to respect those who ask for this day off in 2024 and beyond.Ask what employees needSometimes, employees submit PTO requests and don't give context or explanations of their religious or cultural holiday needs. If you, an HR professional, or a manager have a good relationship with someone who is a religious minority, be sure to start a conversation about what that person needs this holiday season.Some employees want time off to pray; others want time off to travel to faraway places to celebrate with loved ones, while others would appreciate an office party to commemorate the period. However, employees choose to celebrate and practice compassion, understanding, and strategic planning to honor their religious needs while keeping business running as usual.Create staggered time off schedules around religious holidaysIf you have Buddhist employees who want Bodhi Day off or employees who celebrate Kwanzaa towards the end of December, you can artfully create staggered schedules that honor cultural holidays while keeping the company employee roster organized.


Ask employees to submit their PTO requests at least one month in advance to give managers and directors time to strategize. That way, employees have time to hear back about their requests, and managers can ensure no balls are dropped while coordinating coverage. This is good practice in general but especially important during the holiday season.Final thoughtsFor those of us in the United States, living in a Christian-centric society means that many of us might forget that not everyone celebrates Christmas. The holiday season is full of festivities that span beyond Christianity and should be respected and honored in a similar fashion.For those in charge of managing paid time off, be sure to be mindful of what non-Christian holidays are occurring, which employees celebrate certain holidays, and how to keep business going through the holiday season. Your workforce and their families will thank you.

It was about creating the life that I wanted after feeling stuck with my social work job.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?


I started my side hustle in 2018. I had just learned about the coaching industry from a friend who was sharing some with me, and I began to dive more into the industry. I found my inspiration for this business from my own story. Daily, I was using skills around sales to build that same level of trust quickly with those that I served. I also wanted to help other people build their businesses. I became inspired to serve other women of color: We can all build this life of freedom together.Related: This Millennial Dad Just Wanted to Help His Daughter Care for Her Bearded Dragon. Then His Cricket-Breeding Side Hustle Exploded — Earning $27,000 in One Month.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I first dove into doing as much learning as possible about the coaching industry, as this was the side hustle I was choosing. I listened to podcasts and gained as much knowledge as possible. From there, I started to use my story in order to promote my coaching. I would showcase myself commuting to work and working before and after my 9-5 to show how others could build their side hustle as well. I would go live on Instagram all the time, and people knew me for my rants and passionate speaking. I began to build a brand slowly about what I was coaching and quickly gained clients.


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Learning not to resent your 9-5 is so key. You want to make sure that you see your job as the biggest investor in your business and not the enemy of your business. It helps keep that financial pressure off of your business so you can build a strong business instead.I also learned how to manage my time well so that I was doing well in both areas. I kept the time between the two very separate.Another challenge was the three-and-half-hour commute I had to work as well as the long hours as a social worker. I learned to make the most of this time.


Finally, I learned that if I wanted to be able to make a side hustle a full-time business, I needed a financial plan. I worked to save a year's worth of expenses for business and personal so that I would not feel that strain on my side hustle if and when it was time to quit my job.Related: She Started Her Side Hustle to Solve a Serious Problem With Outdoor Furniture. It Blew Past Her Full-Time Job's Income — to $66,000 a Month.How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass that of your full-time job?I was consistently seeing monthly revenue pretty quickly. I would say it took a few months to get to that point. About a year later, I was hitting six figures and even got to $300,000 a year when this was still a side hustle. In 2020, at $300,000, I decided it was time to go full-time. I had far surpassed my social worker salary about a year and a half before.


You've turned your side hustle into a full-time business. How much average monthly or annual revenue does it bring in now?Today, I am bringing in $1.5 million with this as my full-time gig. This is my second year in a row hitting a million dollars or more.What's your advice for other side hustlers who hope to turn their ventures into successful businesses?1. Start out with one offer and one marketing platform and get really good at it.


Do not try to have every single marketing platform and tons of offers that you will try to sell. Focus on one side hustle offer and platform and get really good at it. Then once you are established, you can start to add more in, but this is a new skill. Give yourself time to be a master.2. Take on the identity of what you want.If you want to be a six-figure business owner, be that in your identity. Act like this. Talk about how you do this side hustle for work. Be proud and take on the mindset that this is going to be successful. Mindset is very powerful.3. Don't expect your job to bring you happiness.


Remember that your job is investing in your business by letting you make decisions in it without being your only income. Respect it and perform well until the end.4. Have a financial plan.As mentioned, I saved a year's worth of life and business expenses. This made it so that if I did not make another sale, I had runway. This just eases the pressure and stress once you go full-time so that you can make clear decisions.5. Learn the art of sales.


Sales will be something you need to learn. It is a skill, and it does not have to be something we do not like. Instead, lean into learning it by listening to podcasts or finding others who share how to sell well in your industry.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill.

27,Why Promoting Gender Diversity is the Key to Success for Your Business,"Nov 21, 2023",Greg Waisman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-promoting-gender-diversity-is-the-key-to-success-for/465047,"
In today's business landscape, gender imbalances persist as an issue, as most companies continue to be male-dominated. Numerous studies have consistently affirmed this disparity, highlighting that women face challenges when commencing new roles and throughout their tenure in various companies. Such inequalities manifest in several ways, including biases in hiring, career advancement opportunities, and compensation.UK statistics indicate a 14% gap in median gross hourly earnings between full-time male and female employees across all industries. Another prominent issue is underrepresentation of women in leading positions. Statistics show that, on average, because of the gender disparity in promotions, men tend to end up holding 60% of manager-level positions against women's 40%. And as we go up the career ladder, this gap only grows with each level.Creating inclusive environments that ensure equal opportunities is key to realizing the untapped potential of women in driving innovation and growth for businesses on the global stage. Let's take a look at why this is the case.



Promoting gender diversity translates to improving business performanceIt's not exactly recent news that gender diversity promotes innovation in individual companies and across industries as a whole. McKinsey's predictions state that global GDP could increase by $13 trillion by 2030 if the global workforce becomes equally gender-diverse.A big part of operating a business is learning how to operate in times of economic upheaval. The more diverse your team is, the greater the chances that your company will be able to survive in a variety of different circumstances. Having a mix of genders, ages and nationalities means you have access to different perspectives and approaches born from various experiences. Studies indicate that companies with a more diverse gender composition of their teams are more adaptable, showing a 48% positive difference in performance.


Drawing on personal experience, I am confident that having a multinational and highly diverse team is one of the most important factors that helped my company survive difficult times during the 2022 market turmoil. We found out a long time ago that a diverse gender composition in leadership positions and the team overall creates a better decision-making process.Previous research suggests that women hold an advantage when it comes to taking initiative and motivating others compared to their male counterparts. Add in a greater drive for self-improvement and achieving results. We see that women are natural problem-solvers, well-suited for leadership and keeping all team members pointed in the same direction - towards new achievements.For these reasons, a diverse team can be a tremendous asset to a company during tumultuous periods, as both genders bring their own perspectives and ideas to the table. With distinct mentalities and approaches, team members can tackle challenging situations from various angles, leading to a wider range of potential solutions. This comprehensive approach allows the team to navigate through adversity with greater ease.Related: To Increase Gender Diversity, We Need to Go Back to School


Creating a respectful corporate culture to drive gender equalityWith all of the above in mind, here comes a big question: what can businesses do to promote a culture that acknowledges and respects gender diversity?Well, there are several approaches that can be taken here, the first of which is to create a comfortable environment in your company for both genders. Any and all violations of male/female rights and manifestations of harassment must be excluded so as to build up the most comfortable conditions possible for people to work in.For example, in my company, we have paid a lot of attention to the widespread awareness of equal opportunities for both women and men since our foundation. Those who cannot follow these principles embedded in our corporate culture leave our company or are not hired.Moreover, we have made a point to periodically conduct training sessions on building the right diversity environment. Such sessions emphasize the significance of creating an inclusive workplace that values and harnesses the diverse perspectives and talents of all genders. This ensures fair representation and a broader talent pool, fosters innovation and enhances the overall success of your organization.


If you wish to create a specific attitude that would stay prevalent across all levels of your company, you, as a founder, must showcase it through personal example. Founders and top management must treat everyone equally, regardless of their gender, and maintain regular communication that sexism and unequal treatment stand against your corporate culture.Importance of maintaining gender diversity when hiring C-Level executivesThrough education and training, it's important to create an equal attitude among the entire team towards women and men when hiring new people for any position, including senior ones. As a business leader, it is necessary to instill an understanding among all members of your organization that there are no positions inherently male or female in nature. They are all suitable for both genders.My company has an equal number of women and men in leadership positions. We have been closely monitoring and doing our best to maintain this ratio because a diverse workforce composition plays a big part in our success.Furthermore, we support many initiatives related to the correct positioning of our female leadership both in the company and externally. Our executives are regularly submitted as candidates for women-oriented awards and participate in leading events as speakers.


Creating an inclusive culture is key to the success of your businessHaving a diversified team that does not discriminate due to gender or other factors is invaluable in creating a business that can adapt quickly and effectively to the constantly shifting circumstances of modern-day businesses. Inclusivity is crucial if you wish to succeed in your endeavors.A multi-gender team provides a diverse pool of perspectives, experiences, and talents, which serves to drive innovative problem-solving. By embracing the presence of both men and women in its workforce, your company can gain access to a wider range of solutions, ultimately enhancing its ability to sustain long-term success.

28,Prioritizing DEI Is the Secret to Future-Proofing Your Business,"Nov 17, 2023",Paul Rubenstein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-dei-commitment-boosts-company-success/464235,"
We are in the midst of a diversity, equity and inclusion reconsideration, with some states now actively targeting such programs in the wake of the Supreme Court's Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College ruling on affirmative action. Throw in shifting popular opinion on this issue, and we seem to have reached an inflection point. It might seem tempting for companies to follow the pendulum and bend to popular pressures, but in my opinion, that would be the wrong course.In fact, now more than ever, smart organizations and their HR teams are doubling down on sustained DEI strategies. They understand that the surest way to get value from people is to cultivate an environment where everyone can contribute. And this is not only the right thing to do: Study after study has shown that it's also the profitable thing.Shifting windsDiversity, equity and inclusion jumped to the forefront in the weeks following the 2021 murder of George Floyd. His death led to mass protests around the country, the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement and pressure on corporations to take a stance.



The result? About half of the firms on the S&P 100 pledged to dramatically increase diversity. Giants like Meta committed to hiring 50% of its workforce from underrepresented communities, doubling the number of Black and Hispanic workers. Job ads for chief diversity and inclusion officers nationwide swiftly rose more than 100%. Suddenly, it seemed, incremental progress had been replaced by an avalanche.Fast forward three years, and these efforts are no longer being championed in the same way. Some found rationale in the Students for Fair Admissions decision, but in reality, momentum changed as soon as the headlines went away. Just look at the downturn in tech throughout 2022: Among the first people and programs cut were those working on DEI.


Sadly, both of these pendulum swings were knee-jerk responses to external factors. Achieving real progress, however, requires slow and sustained effort, and to do that, companies must base decisions on facts and numbers, not public pressure.Related: Want to Attract Diverse Talent? You Need to Work on Your Employer Brand — Here's Why.Data as the true path to DEIThose early pledges and statements might have been admirable, but many were vague and difficult to track accurately. In many instances, where most of the associated money was spent remains a mystery.We live in an age of rich digital footprints — in customer data, for example, which fuels the ability to track and use fine-grained information about buyers. A similar level of insight is increasingly available in the context of employees. With people analytics, it's possible to move beyond rote racial and ethnic breakdowns and map progress toward a broader brand of diversity.


For instance, consider the power of organizational network analysis (ONA), which measures collaboration among people. Companies can fill quotas and feel good about themselves, but ONA provides a way of knowing if diverse employees are getting seats at the table.Related: Does Mandatory Diversity Training Work? A DEI Expert Reveals The Pros and Cons.Such tools responsibly monitor a person's experience at work (for example, analyzing calendar invites to see who is brought into important meetings and who is left out). ONA can also passively monitor internal platforms, looking for staff members who are under-utilized or worse, isolated. Companies can go even deeper into that information to understand how people of diverse backgrounds fit in, and then determine how to help them feel included.An equally vital strategy is bringing a quantitative lens to pay equity. Despite good intentions, pay gaps remain a challenge across many organizations, in which compensation decisions are often based on a mix of habit and intuition. Considering how many state and local jurisdictions are now getting serious about pay transparency, organizations need to step up, and data can help as well. Companies can start with smart compensation tools that analyze how much team members are being paid (and, more importantly, how much they should be paid) based on performance, potential, tenure and comparables. Notably, such quantitative lens recommendations are rooted in hard data, helping to remove human bias.


A wider gazeFinally, to push DEI forward in this post-affirmative action era, we have to get beyond broad definitions of what it means to be diverse, equal and included. Improved people analytics plays a central role here, evaluating a workforce across dimensions traditionally overlooked. One consideration might be determining how parents are doing in the workplace and/or focusing on new immigrants or people with disabilities.Factors like age, sexual orientation and socioeconomic background affect a person's job experience. When companies rely on broad pledges to boost diversity metrics, they ignore the other vital aspects of the people they take on as team members. Better data ultimately translates to broader insights and a better worker experience.Related: Know a DEI Skeptic? Use These 3 Strategies to Engage ThemThe payoff? When it comes to DEI, strong companies aren't seeking accolades or simply responding to popular pressure. They're motivated by an intrinsic understanding that equitable treatment is the right thing to do — from human and business standpoints. Ultimately, paychecks don't drive loyalty or performance, but employee experience does. In that sense, prioritizing DEI will always be investing in a better future — for your teams and your company.

29,Stop Trying to Retain Employees With Flashy Perks. Rethink Your Organizational Structure Instead.,"Nov 15, 2023",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/boost-company-culture-by-rethinking-your-organizational/464291,"
As any savvy owner or manager knows, company culture plays a foundational role in organizational success, and as a business leader, I consider it a vital investment.The factors that contribute to both establishing a culture and changing it can be extensive and not always easy to identify. Often, it takes failure to get professionals to truly evaluate theirs. I've seen businesses put a great deal of effort into establishing a positive environment through strategies like team-building exercises, after-work parties, office spaces meant to facilitate community — even repetitive mantras. While all of these can help team members connect, in my experience, they too often have insignificant impact on company culture broadly.One of this key asset's most defining factors is also one of the most frequently overlooked: the structure of the organization itself. As the old adage goes, we often don't see the forest for the trees. The bedrock structure of an organization is often so ingrained that it's taken for granted, but there are many ways to organize (or reorganize) a business that can radically improve its overall work environment.



Related: Company Culture is EverythingHere are four ways to do that:


Leadership structure analysisA great deal of a company's culture is owed to its leadership, both individual executives/managers as well as the leadership structure as a whole. Its style and composition directly affect how an organization runs, how teams and individuals are treated and how problems are solved.Traditional structures tend to be directive, with decisions made at the top level and dispersed down through levels of management to teams responsible for carrying them out. While there are benefits to this system, it allows little room for those not in leadership to voice ideas or provide feedback. The result is that they have little ownership over their roles, leading to low levels of personal investment.More collaborative structures, by contrast, allow for communication among all levels of leadership and empower individuals to make decisions on their own level, which gives a greater sense of ownership over their roles, and both better buy-in with shared company goals and boosted employee retention.Team compositionJust as culture stems from leadership, it's also grounded in teams. Traditional teams comprise a group of people with specific skills directed by a leader to achieve a goal. Usually, these groups are fairly isolated from the rest of the company and work mainly within the team itself. While this arrangement can be effective, it often doesn't foster high levels of collaboration and creativity.


So, take note of team diversity within your company. For example, if you need to complete a project or solve a problem, rather than assigning it to an existing team, consider forming a new and possibly more diverse one by determining which staff members would bring unique value. A group of diverse individuals with a variety of skills and viewpoints will foster both creativity and cross-department collaboration. We started this approach at the beginning of the year, and by bringing together various department leads, were able to improve the business product, create better SOPs and improve both employee satisfaction and client retention.Related: Want Your Team to Excel? Play Games With Them (Yes, Games) to Advance Their Performance to the Next Level.Shared goals, shared responsibilityWithin any organization, there are a variety of goals that individuals are trying to achieve. Despite our best efforts as leaders to get everyone working toward the same ones, people will, of course, have competing interests and/or may not be suitably aligned.Companies and teams that collaborate well work toward shared objectives, and in my experience, nothing will kill that collaboration faster than needless competition. When team interests compete with others', or if an individual's interest acts in conflict, overall results suffer.


In order to foster collaboration over such competition, you need to account for both leadership and team structure to align people toward a common goal, both within teams and as an entire organization. Giving them shared responsibility for targets and the freedom to make decisions and solve problems fosters both inventiveness and dynamism.Flexibility and resilienceSuccessful company cultures are resilient in the face of challenges and change. Both are constant, unavoidable factors in business, and a strong culture is one that's flexible and adjusts as necessary. Change might take the form of new systems or technology, industry changes and shifts in leadership or team personnel, and in each of these situations, a culture that collaborates well is more likely to be pliable, resilient and successful.Related: How to Build a Company Culture That Retains Loyal EmployeesAs entrepreneurs, it's incumbent upon us to not only acknowledge the profound influence organizational structure has on company culture, but also to proactively build systems that encourage collaboration, diversity, shared responsibility and adaptability. By taking these steps, we empower companies to thrive, both now and in the long run.

30,I took my daughter to Daymond John's Black Entrepreneurs Day. Here's what we learned.,"Nov 10, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/i-took-my-daughter-to-daymond-johns-black-entrepreneurs/465230,"
Have you experienced ""Take Your Child to Work Day"" as a kid or parent? It wasn't really a thing when I was a kid. But now, as a parent with a flexible schedule, I can often find opportunities to share a glimpse of what I do for work with my children.Most recently, I brought my 7-year-old daughter to Black Entrepreneur's Day, an event curated by Daymond John. A few weeks earlier I told Daymond how she was inspired to start her own business after reading his children's book, Little Daymond Learns to Earn.To my surprise, he made a personalized video to congratulate my daughter on her new business and invited her to attend Black Entrpreneur's Day at the Apollo here in New York City.



Founded in 2020 by Daymond John, Black Entrepreneurs Day is the ultimate celebration of Black business and entrepreneurship.


This year's event was highlighted by insightful conversations with Black business icons including Cedric the Entertainer, Whoopi Goldberg, SHAQ, Anthony Anderson, Cari Champion, Sloane Stephens, and many more.Here are three lessons anyone – including my daughter – can learn from the experience.Failure isn't devastating, it's just annoying Growing up, my wife's favorite movie was Sister Act. This might be due to the fact that she went to Catholic school. Anyway, my daughter and I were able to meet Whoopi Goldberg, the star of my wife's favorite movie.I asked Whoopi what advice she would give to anyone – entrepreneurs included – who suffered a setback. Her reply was short but powerful: ""Failure isn't devastating, it's just annoying.""


As a stoic with a high level of resilience, this resonated with me. Sure, I do get annoyed when things go wrong. I'm not going to deny that emotion and pretend like nothing is wrong. In fact, avoiding that emotion makes things even harder on me.Research from the National Library of Medicine supports this belief.""Avoidance is typically considered a maladaptive behavioral response to excessive fear and anxiety, leading to the maintenance of anxiety disorders.""In other words, if you avoid acknowledging a setback, things may continue to spiral out of control.But while recognizing the impact of this failure is crucial, it's also important to not get stuck.Instead, make a decision to acknowledge, adapt, and then advance. Like Whoopi said, it's not devastating – it's just annoying.Failure is data, so long as you learn from itMy daughter and I also met Cedric The Entertainer, a comedian and actor known for wearing unique, fashionable hats.


Like many entrepreneurs, he decided to turn his passion into a business. And although he has experienced some success, he admitted his line of hats haven't achieved the success he hoped for. Reason being, it's very expensive to produce the type hats he likes at scale.Fortunately, he didn't let that prevent him from taking on new challenges. And for his next venture he partnered up with Anthony Anderson, a fellow comedian and actor. Together they launched AC Barbeque, a line of premium barbeque and seasoning rubs. Their new business is growing at a steady pace as a result of their commitment to delivering a quality product that can be developed and delivered at an affordable price.What can you learn from this? You might fail in some of your business ventures too, but failure is a great teacher, so long as you learn from it.You only fail if you don't tryWe were also able to see Carli Champion, a journalist and television personality who currently hosts The Cari Champion Show on Amazon Prime Video Sports Talk. If you're an ESPN fan you may also recognize her from her days as an anchor on the network.


In 2012 she joined ESPN as the new host of ESPN2's live debate show First Take. As the show's host, she moderated debates between sports pundits Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith. But she wanted to do more than just moderate, she wanted to be a journalist.After proposing ideas for stories to ESPN, she made her journalistic debut for the network in 2014. But she didn't stop there. Instead, she spent the next six months petitioning ESPN to become an anchor on SportsCenter, ESPN's flagship program. In 2015 Champion was promoted to this prestigious position.So how can you apply this to your own pursuits? Fiercely advocate for the recognition and rewards you deserve. If you ask, the answer will be yes or no. If you don't ask, the answer will definitely be no.So start making bolder asks, and remember the only way to truly fail is not to try.

31,Want to Attract Diverse Talent? You Need to Work on Your Employer Brand — Here's Why.,"Oct 20, 2023",Nika White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/want-to-attract-diverse-talent-you-need-to-work-on-your/459203,"
Now more than ever, this question of what a business' values, perspective, and stance are on certain social issues is under the microscope of diverse applicants. According to Monster.com, 86% of applicants actively engaged in a job search care about an employer's reputation with regard to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The same survey found that 62% of applicants would turn down a job offer if their employer did not support DEI.In this hiring climate, where hundreds of thousands of jobs have been added to the economy in 2023 alone, employees are looking for their perfect match and feel certain they can afford to wait until they find it. Without communicating DEI as a key value of your business on online platforms, you could be turning off high-value applicants who could join your team.So, how can businesses like yours stand out in the vast sea of ""now hiring"" signs and attract the best of the best diverse talent? The answer is clear: Develop an employer brand.



What is an employer brand?Employer branding is a marketing and communication strategy that builds an emotional connection between the potential employee and the employer by demonstrating a positive image and reputation in its marketing.Employer branding involves the rhetoric that's written on the company's website, the posts it touts on LinkedIn, and the word-of-mouth reputation that represents its staff makeup, values, and commitments.


When a diverse applicant sees your newly posted job description and is curious about your business, they likely go to your LinkedIn profile or website to see if yours is the kind of organization they'd like to be a part of. One of the ways companies can present themselves in the most positive light to these applicants is by discussing their values and initiatives around DEI.However, there are several missteps companies make when engaging in employer branding that could turn diverse employees off in seconds.Related: How Employer Branding Can Help Your Company Be Perceived As A Great Place To WorkHow employee branding could be turning off diverse candidatesFrom the brand's policies to its website messaging, these five mistakes may cause diverse candidates to dismiss your job posting before they even apply.


1. Your business doesn't have a DEI statement on job applicationsIf you don't have a DEI statement at the end of your job applications, you're sending the wrong message to diverse candidates. This statement can be simple and should say something to the effect of ""We're an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees, regardless of race, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital status or veteran status.""As basic as this statement may sound, it acts to lower the perceived barriers to entry for some diverse applicants. It's the first step in DEI-centric employee branding that serves as a handshake to diverse candidates. It communicates that ""all are welcome"" and that one's identity doesn't qualify or disqualify someone from being here. It's a small step that can lead to more diverse applicants applying for your open role.2. Your business doesn't offer ERGs, BRGs, or wellness groupsAn employee resource group (ERG), business resource group (BRG), or wellness group is an important component of promoting a sense of belonging in a company. Diverse applicants are looking for businesses that offer affinity groups, especially if the staff makeup has a sizable group of individuals who share a similar identity.It doesn't always have to be about race, gender, or other common identities. Groups can also be formed around shared values like faith, health, sports and more. The goal is to demonstrate that your business is making a good-faith effort towards promoting community and belonging, and these are important components of a desirable workplace, especially for diverse applicants. Having a page on your business's website or social media showcasing special groups that employees can join can help your business stand out and appear more welcoming to diverse applicants.


Related: How to Utilize Employee Resource Groups for a More Diverse3. Your business doesn't offer a flexible work environmentIt's 2023, and more applicants are looking for flexible workspaces, whether they're a parent or someone looking for more work-life balance (or work-life blend, as I call it), companies who brand themselves as flexible or accommodating workspaces are more attractive to potential employees than those who enforce rigid work schedules and mandatory in-office days.Since the world was taken by storm by the Covid-19 pandemic, more diverse applicants, including people of color, those with disabilities, and gender minorities, began looking for ""safer"" spaces to work. Minorities have always had to face microaggressions and adapt to the dominant culture in the workplace. However, having more flexibility around their office environment and schedule has helped those individuals find a work-life blend and has eased the burden of daily microaggressions and code-switching in the workplace.Related: How Code-Switching Hurts People of Color in the Workplace


4. Your business doesn't offer outside-of-work activitiesWe all like to have fun and enjoy quality time with others. Companies that brand themselves as ""fun"" workspaces or ones that offer outside-of-work activities like company outings, retreats or sports activities can attract more diverse applicants and likely retain them longer. Although not every employee should have to participate in these activities, it's nice to have the option for diverse candidates who are seeking community in the workplace.These activities aren't just for show; they allow employees to bond and cultivate a true sense of belonging and community. Belonging is a critical element of a diverse workplace and should be promoted. Most companies do the bare minimum in offering outside-of-work activities. The consequence is that it can lead many minorities to feel isolated or disconnected from their coworkers–and this certainly does not attract or retain diverse talent.5. Build an employer brand that attracts — not repels — diversityYour business could have some of the best benefits packages and offerings available, but if you're not actively discussing them, writing about them on your website and on social media, and sharing them in company emails, your employee brand isn't going to benefit.Don't neglect to speak about issues potential employees care about, like maternity and paternity benefits, flexible hours, and remote working, as well as diverse representation at all levels of the organization.


These components of an employee brand can make or break your business's competitiveness in the hiring market. Be the brand that stands out and attracts the best of the best by honing your employer brand and letting diverse employees come to you.

32,Does Mandatory Diversity Training Work? A DEI Expert Reveals The Pros and Cons.,"Oct 19, 2023",Nika White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/does-mandatory-diversity-training-work-a-dei-expert/463641,"
As a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practitioner, I enjoy hosting and attending DEI trainings — or, as I like to call them, experiences — as much as the next person. Whether they touch on gender or racial equity or strategize on skills to build inclusion and belonging, there's something energizing about being a part of such pivotal conversations.However, not everyone walks into DEI experiences as energized as I do. Some don't know why an experience is mandatory, or they wish that it wasn't. Perhaps they feel that because of their identity, they may be judged or attacked. Or they're so triggered by the topics covered in the experience, that they wish they didn't have to engage at all.Related: Your Employees Are Probably Feeling Triggered at Work



While these are normal reactions to DEI experiences, I think it's worth exploring some good reasons to make them mandatory and other reasons why it may not be such a great idea.Pro: When people know better, they do betterOne major benefit of mandatory DEI experiences is the informational aspect of them. Not everybody is well-versed in DEI, how to cultivate belonging and inclusion, or specific ways to show up as an ally for others. Until they know how to practice DEI principles, they may not know how to do better.


However difficult the topics may be, giving everyone the foundational principles of DEI can help some people understand them, use them, and think critically about how to show up better in the workplace and beyond.Pro: DEI experiences are good for complianceFor leaders who are constantly weighing how to cultivate safety and belonging in a diverse workforce, mandatory DEI experiences can set the stage for how we should treat each other in the workplace.For example, suppose your workplace has DEI protocols on how to be kind and respectful to LGBTQIA+ employees. In that case, all employees should have a baseline understanding of gender pronouns and basic interaction principles. An issue where an employee has crossed a line is much easier to identify and remedy when a DEI experience is mandatory, and the knowledge is shared with all parties. However, always keep in mind that compliance shouldn't be the only reason for hosting a DEI experience but rather a good reason, among others.Related: Here's What Your Diversity Training Might Be Missing


Pro: DEI experiences set the foundation for a more diverse workforce and clienteleIf you know you'll be growing your workforce or attracting more diverse clients in the future, set your business up for success by having a mandatory DEI experience on the docket.For example, suppose you know your business will begin to work with a more international clientele. In that case, it's a good idea to train your employees to become more knowledgeable and competent in that particular culture. Preparing your workforce to interact with more diverse clients, fellow employees, and stakeholders can help create more fruitful and seamless interactions in the future.Con: People can feel forced to ""think"" a certain waySome people hesitate to engage in DEI experiences because they may view it as indoctrination. People come from different backgrounds, so requesting someone use a specific term or be mindful of behavior when engaging with certain groups can feel uncomfortable or forced for some people.DEI experiences shouldn't make everyone think the same way or make someone feel ashamed of who they are or where they come from. The goal is to build a behavioral foundation where people from different backgrounds can coexist and respect one another under certain principles and best practices. There's a good kind of discomfort that helps participants grow in certain situations, however, if a DEI experience begins to feel too confronting for certain groups, reconsider the agenda of that experience and try again with a new strategy or DEI practitioner.


Related: From Faith to Politics: How to Navigate Difficult Conversations in the WorkplaceCon: Not all DEI practitioners operate the sameWhile one group may love a certain DEI practitioner, another group may be completely turned off. If you make a DEI experience mandatory and the employees don't enjoy it, it could have adverse ripple effects.Keep in mind that mandatory experiences with a practitioner that the group didn't enjoy aren't always the best way to get the message across. Delivery and style make a difference, so before choosing a DEI practitioner, be sure to do your research on their background and style so you can decide who would be best for the employees in your company. But be wary of asking practitioners to dilute content to avoid the good kind of discomfort we discussed earlier. Sometimes, what's uncomfortable to hear is the best message a practitioner can deliver.Con: DEI experiences aren't everyone's preferred way to learnWhile some people enjoy in-person experiences, others prefer to read or watch videos instead. Consider offering mandatory DEI experiences to those who enjoy in-person sessions, but leave room for those who prefer a different method to opt out in exchange for reading some material, taking a quiz or watching a film.


As long as people are engaging with the work in their own way and absorbing critical information about what's expected of them, it's fine. The goal is to make sure best practices for building inclusion, belonging, and respect across differences are available to employees in whatever way they prefer.Final thoughtsWhen it comes to DEI, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. While mandatory experiences can bring people together and help them think through strategies for building community and cultivating respect across differences, others may not choose to spend their time that way or prefer to engage with the topic in another way. There's nothing wrong with having multiple avenues for presenting DEI information — in fact, I recommend it. What's most important is that people engage with the information and make a good-faith effort to show up kinder, more inclusive, and more respectful in the workplace and beyond.

33,The Key to Developing More Informed and Inclusive DEI Marketing Strategies,"Sep 25, 2023",Christine Alexis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-build-more-informed-and-inclusive-dei-marketing/458668,"
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) have moved beyond trendy terms to become vital pillars of modern-day business models and marketing strategies that can truly move the needle. Many companies have recognized its importance, with 80% of United States employers having DEI strategies underway.Yet, there's room to strengthen the impact of these initiatives. One way to do this is by understanding that while individual diversity is invaluable, it doesn't automatically confer specialized expertise in DEI. Recognizing this difference creates an opportunity for companies to refine their DEI marketing strategies to be more inclusive and informed, laying the groundwork for impactful campaigns in the future.Related: 10 Ideas to Drive Your DEI Initiatives in 2023



Why DEI matters in today's business environmentCompanies have started recognizing that diverse perspectives can drive innovation, open new markets and positively affect the bottom line. According to a McKinsey report, the most diverse companies are more likely than ever to outperform less diverse peers on profitability. In fact, top-quartile companies in ethnic and cultural diversity outperformed those in the fourth quartile by 36% in profitability.The complex web of DEI marketingDEI marketing is more complex than adding diverse faces in promotional materials or releasing statements during heritage months. This specialized field has multiple dimensions that range from understanding legalities to deep-diving into societal norms, biases and stereotypes. A PwC report revealed that 85% of companies consider DEI a strategic priority, highlighting the increasing need for true expertise.


Lived experience is not equal to professional expertiseDiverse employees often bring invaluable lived experiences and perspectives that can enrich any conversation around DEI. However, this lived experience should be separate from professional expertise. The skills required for effective DEI marketing span market research, analytics, branding strategy and a nuanced understanding of legalities around diversity and representation. Professional certifications such as Certified Diversity Professional (CDP) or Certified Diversity Executive (CDE) exist to cultivate this specialized skill set.Tokenism: The shortcut that falls shortThe assumption that every diverse employee is a walking DEI manual leads to tokenism, a cosmetic approach to diversity that does more harm than good. Not only is this ethically problematic, but it also can hinder business performance. According to an analysis of over 80 studies spanning 25 years published in the Academy of Management Perspectives, tokenism can have a negative impact on individual and business performance.Related: How to Make Your Content Marketing InclusiveThe indispensability of professional trainingThere are multiple avenues for acquiring DEI expertise. Various professional organizations offer specialized certifications, such as the Certified Diversity Professional (CDP) and Certified Diversity Executive (CDE). These credentials signify a comprehensive understanding of DEI principles, from legal considerations to market analytics. The Global Diversity and Inclusion Benchmarks (GDIB) is another widely recognized standard that offers a framework for organizations to measure and improve their DEI initiatives.


Alongside these options, accredited universities have joined the fold by providing specialized diversity, equity and inclusion certification programs. These certifications and academic courses provide a strong foundation for marketers specializing in this important area. Professional qualifications in DEI are not ornamental; they are instrumental. Individuals with these credentials are trained to handle sensitive topics carefully from rigorous study, not just personal experience.Shared responsibilities and inclusive allyshipIn an increasingly socially conscious marketplace, the spotlight is on brands to articulate and enact values of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in their marketing endeavors. According to Sprout Social, most consumers (70%) believe it's important for brands to take a public stand on social and political issues. True DEI marketing is a shared responsibility, calling for an inclusive form of allyship that involves everyone, irrespective of their background.While those with lived experiences can bring critical cultural insights into marketing strategies, such perspectives should be complemented with formalized DEI marketing expertise. Doing so safeguards the brand against legal complications and optimizes financial performance by ensuring that campaigns are both socially responsible and legally compliant.Cultural pitfalls: Stereotyping and appropriationWith inadequate expertise, even well-intentioned DEI marketing can go wrong by perpetuating harmful stereotypes or engaging in cultural appropriation. In fact, a YPulse survey shows that 64% of young people agree that cultural appropriation is a problem in the U.S., and recognizing the cultural roots of trends is vital for brands. In a landscape with high stakes and expectations, brands must approach DEI marketing with more than good intentions. Truly effective campaigns require a blend of informed expertise and genuine inclusivity, ensuring the brand's survival and long-term success.


Related: Why Companies Are Failing in Their Diversity, Equity and Inclusion EffortsEconomic implications of getting DEI wrongWith a buying power of $3.9 trillion among minorities in the United States, the cost of getting DEI marketing wrong isn't just a loss of ethical brownie points but a missed financial opportunity of massive proportions.While lived experiences offer invaluable insights for DEI marketing strategies, relying solely on them as the qualification for being a ""DEI marketing expert"" is problematic. Though these experiences can provide a unique understanding of the cultural nuances and sensitivities involved, DEI marketing is a multi-layered discipline that encompasses a range of skills, including consumer psychology, legal compliance and data analysis. Professional training and certification in these areas, often available through accredited universities and specialized programs, equip individuals to navigate the complexities of DEI in the marketing landscape.While lived experiences are a critical component to consider, they should form just one part of a more comprehensive, evidence-based approach to DEI marketing. Operating otherwise potentially exposes the organization to legal pitfalls and reputational damage. Companies that want to succeed in today's diverse marketplace need to fill the expertise gap by employing qualified professionals who can develop DEI strategies that are both ethical and effective.

34,"If You Want to Join a Franchise That Is Truly Diverse, These Are the Top 100 to Consider","Sep 20, 2023",Tracy Stapp Herold,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/if-you-want-to-join-a-franchise-that-is-truly-diverse/458409,"
Franchisors are increasingly recognizing the value of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), both at the corporate level and within their franchisee ranks, and they're finding creative ways to do so. To honor those brands that we think are doing it best, we've created our ranking of the top 100 franchises for diversity, equity, and inclusion.Unlike most of our other rankings, which rely on objective data run through a formula, this more subjective list has been determined editorially — and for that reason, rather than being numbered, the brands are listed alphabetically. Each brand had to opt into consideration for the list and provide us with as much information as possible to help us make our choices. Factors we considered include: incentives to help franchisees from underrepresented groups join the system; diversity among franchisees; diversity within the leadership team; and other programs or initiatives undertaken related to DEI.Related: The 50 Franchise Companies Doing the Most to Champion DiversityWe spoke to a few of the brands on the list to get to know more about how they're advancing DEI within their organizations, and what advice they would give to other franchisors who want to do the same. Make sure you dig deeper to get to know any franchise brand you're interested in as well. This list is not intended as an endorsement of any particular opportunity, so it's important to do your own thorough due diligence before investing. That should include reading the company's legal documents, consulting with a lawyer and an accountant, and talking to as many franchisees as you can.



""Be Open to Honest Conversations""Inside Anywhere Real Estate's inclusivity program.Anywhere Real Estate's Inclusive Ownership Program launched in 2020 through its Coldwell Banker brand, and then expanded to the company's other brands (Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, Century 21 Real Estate, Corcoran, ERA, and Sotheby's International Realty) the next year. The program offers support to women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and military veterans interested in joining any of Anywhere's brands, including reduced startup fees, mentorship programs, and a tailored professional development program called Accelerate. We asked Sue Yannacone, Anywhere's president and CEO, to tell us more.What was the motivation behind starting this program?


We believe as a company that representation matters. It matters within the workplace and within the consumer population we serve: homebuyers and sellers. So this program really helps us foster that balance, to ensure that we have business owners that represent the communities they serve.What results have you seen so far?As of June, 99 companies have come to us through the Inclusive Ownership Program, and of those, 26 have graduated from the Accelerate program. And we're seeing stellar performance out of them. What's really exciting is it crosses all of our brands and all diversity dimensions, so we're really serving a growing need.What advice would you give other franchisors looking to do more for DEI?Be crystal clear on your ""why."" And be really open to having honest conversations. Get educated from others in the communities you're trying to serve; don't assume what they need.Then, create robust, full-service programs that are well-funded, well-supported, and believed in from the top down. I think you've got to go a lot further than just checking some boxes or offering a financial incentive. You have to commit to the life cycle of the franchisee's business performance, because that's where the real long-term benefit comes.


""Understand That It's a Journey""Inside Batteries Plus' inclusivity program.We spoke with Jackie Luedtke, Batteries Plus' vice president of human resources and head of the company's Horizons Initiative, to learn how the battery-store brand is working to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion — and more.What is Horizons?Horizons is the umbrella for many different programs for employees of our corporate distribution center and corporate stores. We have a mentorship program with senior leaders mentoring employees. We have business resource groups — a women's empowerment group, veterans group, BOLD (Black Originators, Leaders, and Doers) group, wellness group, and Pride group. And we've also added stewardship and philanthropy elements, so we offer paid time off to do volunteer work, we have an associate relief fund, and we make charitable contributions.What results have you seen from these programs?We have certainly seen a higher level of engagement. There used to be the old mantra that you had to leave your personal life at the door. But we know that for you to contribute fully at work, you have to be fully at work, which means your whole self.


What advice would you give other franchisors looking to do more for DEI?Understand that it is a journey. Even two and a half years in, I'd still consider us to be in the early stages. We've come a long way, but we have a long way to go. You're not going to hit a home run right away. So we have to be patient with ourselves, and learn from others. It's been great, because so many other companies and individuals are willing to share their learning experiences. It's not a competition.""Set Clear Goals and Stay Committed""Inside Servpro's inclusivity programs.Servpro launched its Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) Program in 2020 with the creation of two corporate employee resource groups—the Servpro Women's Initiative and One Spectrum. This year the company took another step by launching its DEIB Alliance Council. Maribeth Bearfield, Servpro's senior vice president and chief human resources officer, shares details on these programs with us.What do your two employee resource groups do?The Women's Initiative was created to be a professional community that empowers women to identify, pursue, and achieve their full potential. To date, it has hosted 14 professional or personal development events and participated in eight community outreach events, and since its inception, Servpro has increased female representation by 4%.


One Spectrum was launched to aid in fostering a community for teammates of color at Servpro. The hope is that by starting conversations about DEIB, the group can help improve workplace culture for all employees, and in turn, increase engagement. The group has also dedicated itself to establishing meaningful connections with nonprofit organizations in the area.Why was the DEIB Alliance launched?The DEIB Alliance was started because Servpro recognizes that success is better achieved when people with different backgrounds and a variety of experiences, perspectives, and ideas come together and introduce new ways of thinking and problem-solving. It is comprised of members of the headquarters team, who are diverse in position, background, and more. They're dedicated to fostering a work environment in which individuals feel valued, their perspectives are acknowledged, and they have a sense of belonging.What advice would you give other franchisors looking to do more for DEI?Set clear goals and stay committed to them. Put intentional effort into being inclusive at each opportunity to do so.""Education Is Really the Foundation""Inside Skyhawks & SuperTots Sports Academy's inclusivity programs.Chelsie Hawley is the executive director of Skyhawks Sports' nonprofit arm, Skyhawks Rise, which is dedicated to ensuring all youth have equitable opportunities to participate in sports. She also facilitates the company's equity committee, which covers its sister brand, SuperTots, as well. We talked to her to learn more about both initiatives.How does Skyhawks Rise address ""play equity""?There are four main barriers that we've identified: cost, equipment, location, and transportation. So we provide free or reduced-cost programming to youth in low-income communities, provide all equipment, coordinate facility space in the areas most in need, and work to coordinate transportation. Our franchisees can operate affiliates of Skyhawks Rise in their own communities as well, and this allows them to source grant funding.How did the equity committee come about?We established the equity committee in 2020, in response to the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. A lot of kids were coming to our camps with questions. Often we think children are immune to what's going on in the world, but that's simply not true. So initially we established the committee, which includes myself, other corporate employees, and two franchisees, to help our coaches and corporate team facilitate conversations in a healthy and productive way.What advice would you give other franchisors looking to do more for DEI?Establish a dedicated group that is willing to have conversations and address shortcomings and how you can do better. Education is really the foundation.See the Top 100 Inclusive Franchises here.

35,Companies Are Deprioritizing DEI. Why They Shouldn't and How to Recommit.,"Sep 15, 2023",Nika White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/companies-are-deprioritizing-dei-why-they-shouldnt-and/457413,"
Just because the naysayers have been amplified doesn't mean DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) is dead or should be abandoned. In fact, now is the time to turn up the volume on what's been going well in our DEI efforts.In 2022, 81% of companies polled reported that having DEI initiatives was beneficial to their organizations. The same survey showed 94% of the companies were investing more in mental health resources, 70% were improving equity in parental leave, and 48% had at least one employee resource group (ERG) often centered on racial, ethnic and gender minorities.How did all of the progress we made in 2022 become deprioritized in 2023? Shifting public opinion on DEI and a larger discussion on whether DEI is bringing people closer together or further apart. For DEI professionals, executives and everyone in between, consider recommitting to DEI and transforming the narrative from a story of division to a story of inclusion.



If you or those in your business are losing stamina in your DEI efforts, here's how to recommit to the work and continue making strides.Related: Supreme Court Rules Against Affirmative Action at Harvard and UNC


Understand that DEI is not a trendAfter the murder of George Floyd in 2020, it seemed like the business world had a fire lit underneath it. The drive and energy to promote DEI at all levels of the organization was a priority that couldn't wait. Now, the fire has fizzled and the commitment to equity in the workplace seems to have faded into a trend. If business owners have lost the fire for DEI that was ignited within them in 2020, it's worth exploring why.In this work, there is no ""season"" for equity and inclusion. If we're truly committed, we don't fluctuate between wanting to improve diversity and belonging and taking a year off when it no longer feels relevant. Cultivating DEI is a long-game strategy that helps businesses navigate changes in their company culture and employee makeup — whether it's a good or bad year. It takes consistent action even when no one else is watching.Let's reignite that fire and bring DEI back onto the priority list.Dig deep into your DEI 'why'Why did your company start working on DEI in the first place? Was it sparked by an individual or group needing more support or belonging? Were stakeholders interested in the company's DEI efforts and seeking proof of action? Was the CEO of the company driving the changes in order to cultivate long-lasting diversity and inclusion in the workplace?


It's important to be mindful of your company's original intent and rationale. Take stock of all the progress the company has made so far and where the next steps were heading. Re-engage with those who originally proposed DEI projects and initiatives, and start conversations about how those ideas can be reimagined or reignited.Discuss as a company how DEI can be revived in 2023 and beyond to set your company up for success. Don't let progress sit in a drawer next to last year's tax filings. Reignite the ""why"" and recommit to the journey of DEI — for those in the company who need it now and for those who have yet to arrive.Related: 4 Ways Inclusive Leaders Can Respond to the Weaponizing of DEIGet creative and dream bigger on your DEI initiativesWhile 2020 felt like DEI crisis mode, maybe 2023 and 2024 can inspire DEI initiatives that are forward-thinking and proactive. Innovation and creativity don't happen in a vacuum. They require leaders and changemakers to listen to their staff and dedicate time to creating solutions.


How can the to-do list of the past be reimagined for the future?What new initiatives can support a more diverse workforce and meet anticipated company needs?In economic terms, when there's a financial downturn or a pressing revenue issue in the company, people roll up their sleeves and figure it out. Even if they have no idea what they're doing, the commitment to move past barriers and find solutions drives them toward progress.Unfortunately, I don't see the same commitment when it comes to DEI. Whenever there's a crisis in the company — mass layoffs, financial decline, company culture change — executives and others put their heads down and get to work on solutions. So why not create that same level of urgency with DEI? Now is the time to do so.


Related: Here's How to Have the Most Powerful DEI ConversationsDEI 2.0When companies have thrown in the towel and completely given up on their DEI initiatives after public support has softened, how do we reignite the fire to stay committed to DEI?Simple: We remember this is a marathon, not a sprint, and we get right back on track.We need to cultivate DEI 2.0. Initiatives and strategies that don't simply react to issues as they occur but are proactively preventing DEI disasters in the future. Let's think about how we can evolve the current state of the workplace and set the foundation for inclusion, diversity and belonging in the long run.


For those restarting these conversations, my advice is to not be afraid to go there — to the heart of the DEI fatigue, to the waning of commitment to inclusion, and to the deprioritization of the work.Offer your time and energy to come up with creative solutions that will guide your organization into the future. Be the voice of change that those who have let go of DEI need to hear. With renewed focus and commitment, we can continue to advance DEI in the workplace — even when segments of society declare that it's not a priority.

36,Remote Work Is the Great Equalizer in the Workplace. Here's How It Will Make Your Business a Better Place to Work.,"Sep 12, 2023",Jeanna Barrett,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-remote-work-is-the-great-equalizer-in-the-workplace/458140,"
Becoming a leader in a unicorn tech startup might seem like #careergoals for many. For me, it was anything but. I struggled in my role and had a hard time finding a place in a culture that seemed to be built exclusively for my male coworkers, where I was criticized for my opinions and disliked by junior male teammates or counterparts for seemingly no reason.I wasn't alone. In fact, McKinsey reports that today, women are leaving their jobs faster than ever before, often citing that they're overworked, underpaid and unable to advance. For women of color, lower economic status or disabilities, the situation is even more dire.Though I experienced workplace bias as a woman, I was fortunate to have enough privilege to leave a toxic environment and move on to start my own business. From then on, I dedicated my energy to creating the kind of work culture that would offer a place for women and other marginalized groups to feel safe, thrive professionally and have their voices heard.



As it turned out, the workplace I designed wasn't an actual space at all — it was a virtual space. And what I discovered as I launched my own business was that remote work is the great equalizer and a powerful catalyst for change.Related: Want to Improve Your Company's Diversity? Go Remote.


Back to the office? Back to the Dark AgesOf course, the kind of innovative change that allows marginalized groups to thrive really gets under the skin of the people in power.Business Insider recently compiled a list of major brands currently demanding a return to the office. Every single CEO and/or COO on the list was male — and very few belonged to any non-majority group.Why? Because traditional company models are primarily run by privileged men of a certain age, who appear to feel their positions of power are threatened by women, people of color or the LGBTQIA+ community. Remote companies, on the other hand, are proving to have more diversity and their employees are often better educated, better paid and more representative of differing cultures, backgrounds and voices.Top 3 ways remote work shatters the glass ceiling and smashes the patriarchyWhile some leaders try to placate employees by promising ""hybrid work,"" it still chains workers to a particular location and a dedicated schedule, and it drains the talent pool to — you guessed it — only those who look, act and think like the people in power. In fact, studies are finding that hybrid work leads to as much proximity bias as traditional in-office work. Remote work — truly 100% remote — breaks those chains, turns the talent pool into a vast ocean and offers location and time freedom that empowers employees to soar. How?


Parents aren't punished for parentingDuring the pandemic, parents faced the challenges of working, schooling and parenting with the entire family at home. However, according to the Pew Research Center, mothers overwhelmingly bore the biggest burden, with some saying they passed up on important projects that might have advanced their careers or left their jobs entirely. Women were also nearly twice as likely as men to feel they were viewed as less committed to their role and their company.Even when we aren't amid a global health crisis, parents still have to parent. In today's society of primarily two-income households, parenting responsibilities — in heterosexual relationships — still fall more frequently to women who give up time from their day to ensure their children are thriving.Remote work levels the playing field by giving employees greater autonomy and control over their schedules. Mothers don't have to worry about taking kids to doctor appointments or sporting practice or stress over missing a recital because of work. They don't have to fight for private breastfeeding locations in the office or spend hours pumping breast milk before/after work. They don't have to leave the office or take a sick day to be at home because they already are home and have the flexibility to work around family and motherhood obligations. In this way, they achieve greater balance and have more opportunities to advance.Related: Remote or In-Person? It Doesn't Matter — Why Building the Best Team Matters More Than Location


Different abilities are championedThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in 2022, the employment of people with disabilities had risen higher than ever before. This is because remote work breaks barriers — sometimes literally with offices, work environments and cities that aren't built for disabilities — allowing those with disabilities to work from the place where they are safest, healthiest and most comfortable so they can do their best work.This allows employers to hire those with differing needs or abilities more easily and can also open doors that were previously closed to some employees who are neurodivergent or who have ""invisible disabilities."" These candidates often feel they are ignored or overlooked, but they frequently bring new and diverse assets and skills to a remote team.Location freedom eliminates bordersIn most workplaces, people in the dominant culture typically benefit from their location. They often live in more urbanized areas with above-average incomes, better access to resources and higher education levels.Remote work can break down those borders and widen the pool of candidates beyond physical and figurative borders. This can make it easier for people in rural or lower-income areas who may not have previously had a path to higher-paying, more sustainable careers to find jobs that give them real opportunities to advance.


As long as your company is able and ready to provide workers with the tools they need — high-speed internet, necessary hardware and access to a tech stack — there is no reason an employee from a lower-income or rural location cannot thrive.Related: Remote Work Is Here to Stay. It's Time to Update the Way You Lead.How do we get there?""If you build it, they will come."" Besides being one of the most misquoted movie lines of all time, what does it mean? It means that if you build a strong and inclusive remote work culture, the right talent will show up. Your pool will widen dramatically, allowing you to grow a remote team that is diverse, unique and well-suited to your business needs. Take these steps to get started:Nurture your remote cultureHaving hired many remote roles, I can say from experience that those who are entrenched in traditional office life often have a hard time adjusting to the freedom and flexibility remote work provides. That's why every remote company needs a strong leader in people ops to help them make the transition.


Hiring the right Head of People is critical, not just to ease employees into remote work but to lay the foundation for remote culture. Most often, outsiders think it must be difficult — even impossible — to create relationships with people they don't see in the office every day. In reality, it's usually the opposite. Remote work creates a need to be more thoughtful, intentional and deliberate in establishing and growing a culture, which then becomes even stronger than those built in an office setting.Make DEI more than a buzzwordEveryone talks about DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) these days, but not all of them walk the walk. In a remote workforce, DEI may be ingrained in the company's structure. But that doesn't mean it isn't still a conscious choice that necessitates deliberate and thoughtful planning and action. A larger talent pool doesn't mean much if you're unwilling to get out in the deep end. There's work to be done. When hiring, I have found that there aren't as many diverse backgrounds and cultures among candidates as I would like to see, and I often have to remind myself to dive deeper.Why? Because candidates don't always begin from the same starting line. Creating a true DEI program takes a lot of work, especially if you're really committed to finding candidates from marginalized groups who aren't coming across your job listing on LinkedIn. So, while DEI is, in some ways, a natural part of a remote team, it also takes planning, effort and consideration.Related: Here's How to Foster Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in a Remote-Work World


Making remote work work for allA more diverse and equitable workforce isn't going to manifest overnight. But many founders who have committed to fully remote work, even before the pandemic, are looking for ways to make strides in improving the workforce for everyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, race, religion or cultural background. I know I am.Remote-first founders understand that it makes us better employers, strengthens our bottom line and helps us grow as leaders and as humans. That is truly the power of remote work — one of the greatest equalizers of our time.

37,10 Pros (and Cons) of Hiring International Employees in 2023,"Sep 5, 2023",Anna Johansson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/10-pros-and-cons-of-hiring-international-employees-in-2023/451756,"
Thanks to the abundance of connective technology, hiring and working with people in remote locations, including employees in other countries, is easier than ever. Hiring international employees can be advantageous for your business, helping you save money while simultaneously broadening your talent pool.But is this truly worthwhile in 2023? Let's take a look.Related: The Rise of Self-Employed in the Global Workforce and What Business Owners Need to Know



The benefits of hiring international employeesHiring international employees comes with an array of advantages, including:A wider talent pool. One of the most appealing benefits of hiring people in other countries is getting access to a wider talent pool. There are nearly 400 million people in the United States, but that doesn't mean much if you have several important job openings and no applicants eager to fill them. Broadening your search internationally could be exactly what you need to find more people and fill those vacancies.Relatively easy traveling logistics. Thanks in part to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and ESTA, international travel to the U.S. is easier than ever. Instead of making complicated arrangements and relying on tedious paperwork, your employees may be able to make arrangements to visit the United States for short business trips by filling out electronic applications that only take a few minutes.Remote collaboration potential. Only a few decades ago, working with people in other countries was practically impossible for most businesses. But in 2023, we have access to better collaboration tools than ever. Cloud collaboration platforms, powerful video chat apps and intuitive project management systems make it much easier for employees to engage with each other in real-time, regardless of their geographic location.A road to labor savings. Here in the U.S., we're used to people having a median salary of around $50,000. And if you want a maverick with tons of experience, you'll pay a lot more than that. But labor simply isn't this expensive elsewhere in the world. Hiring talent where the cost of living is lower means employers benefit from lower labor costs.Cultural touchpoints for expansion. If you're interested in expanding your business to new markets overseas, hiring employees in those countries could give you cultural touchpoints.

The downsides of hiring international employeesThere are some important downsides to acknowledge, however.Registration and compliance. From a legal perspective, hiring and maintaining employees internationally can be a bit messy. You may be subject to laws and regulations imposed by foreign nations, which can increase compliance costs and cause legal headaches. At the very least, you should hire a lawyer to help you navigate these complexities, which can ebb away at the labor cost savings you'd otherwise enjoy.Wage increases and employer demand. Hiring people in certain countries used to be absurdly inexpensive, but wages are beginning to increase on an international scale. This is great from an international economic perspective, as the quality of life is increasing for billions of people. However, because more employers are seeking international employees and employment demand is rising, employees are demanding higher wages and more benefits.Communication barriers. English is the most popular language in the world, with 1.3 billion speakers in 2023. You shouldn't have trouble finding employees who can speak English competently, but there may still be some communication barriers if these speakers are inexperienced or if they aren't able to grasp the nuances of native speakers. Translation services and intermediaries may be able to help, but this is still a barrier you'll need to account for.Cultural differences. Finally, keep in mind that cultural differences can make an impact on your business. Employees in other countries may have different philosophies about work. They may prefer working in a totally different time zone. They may have different holidays. They may approach conflict resolution in totally different ways. It's a good idea to immerse yourself in their culture so you can understand where they're coming from if you want a healthy working relationship.Should your business hire international employees in 2023? In some ways, the prospect is more attractive than ever, with fewer communication and travel barriers and more options in terms of both available countries and talented workers. But the decision isn't exactly straightforward. Make sure you fully understand the laws and regulations associated with hiring foreign employees in your destination country and weigh all the pros and cons before moving forward.

38,How Women Can Beat the Odds in the Tech Industry,"Aug 30, 2023",Lena Grundhoefer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-women-can-beat-the-odds-in-the-tech-industry/457573,"
Women are underrepresented in the tech industry, holding less than a third of computer and mathematical occupations. It's only getting worse with the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, as a new McKinsey report found women are 1.5 times more likely to be impacted by generative AI in their work. As a woman working with clients in tech, it can often feel isolating.However, most days, I view it as an advantage because women have a different natural skill set than men. Our empathy helps in listening to clients and understanding the design process. We are less transactional and more inclined toward human connection, which is a great trait to help build a strong team. We also have different perspectives of the world, and various perspectives are essential for long-term success.Related: 4 Strategies to Empower Women in the Workplace



This gender gap in technology is long-standing and caused by a variety of societal issues, ranging from stereotypes, bias and hostile work cultures to lack of early exposure and STEM educational pathways.Companies like Amazon developed AI hiring bots to screen applicants, and, despite being proven to favor male applicants, they are still in use. Not only that, but women were also disproportionately impacted by recent big tech layoffs. Axios and Layoffs.fyi found that 45% of 3,404 workers confirmed laid off from tech employers between October 2022 and June 2023 were women, despite companies like Meta having 63% male workers in their workforce. These layoffs also focused largely on departments like Human Resources, which is nearly 73% female.


Web3 does get better. Some organizations like Boy's Club, SheFi and Surge do an amazing job combatting this by onboarding, retaining and curating female-oriented events to onboard more women into the ecosystem. This sector still inherits the same Web2 bias, though.Boss Babes surveyed Gen Z about Web3 and found young women were 36% more likely to lack any formal education about the sector. Boston Consulting Group partnered with People of Crypto Lab to find only 13% of Web3 startups include a female founder, and only 3% of those were all-female founding teams.All-male founding teams in Web3 raised an average of nearly $30 million each, compared to only $8 million for the all-female teams.Related: Gen Z Is Seriously Misunderstood — Here are 3 Secrets Young CEOs Employ to Disrupt Industries


This gender gap exists in venture capital firms (where only 15% of VCs are women, and only 3% of funds go to all-female teams) and extends to tech sales teams, where women make up only 25% of salespeople and 12% of sales leadership. In school, 80% of AI professors are men, and after graduation, only 10 to 15% of AI research staff at companies like Facebook and Google are women.Even just by existing as a woman, tech can threaten me, regardless of whether I work. Research shows that 96% of deepfakes online in 2019 were women, and generative AI is known to accentuate biases while disproportionately affecting women.There's no reason for any of these problems to exist, either. A McKinsey report on diversity found companies with at least 30% female executives are up to 48% more likely to outperform their least gender-diverse counterparts. In fact, both gender and racial diversity from the entry-level to the C-suite can increase a company's bottom line.Building this foundation as an entrepreneur is especially important as you scale beyond your garage into a multinational company. There are ways to succeed as a female entrepreneur in the tech space.


Getting ahead as a female entrepreneurI can't understate the importance of continuous learning. It's easy as we get older to remain stuck in our ways, but the more knowledge you have, the more confident you'll be in every aspect of your life. That's why it's important to learn something new every day, whether directly related to the business or not.Sometimes, we can learn something in a completely unrelated field that can be applied to our own, so always stay open to new experiences.Related: 4 Research-Backed Reasons Why Women Belong in TechDon't be afraid to be unabashedly who you are. Speak your mind, take the lead, and be willing to win or lose as yourself. We all battle imposter syndrome, and I realize it's difficult to ""be yourself"" when you aren't entirely sure who you are. Still, you should stand confident and follow your dreams, regardless of how difficult the road can sometimes be.


As a woman, also be prepared to go the extra mile. My business partner and I regularly attend business conferences like Consensus and NFT.NYC, and speaker panels are often filled with men. We're lucky to account for 10 to 20% of the speaker slots, which means we must compete harder and bring our A-game.It's also vital to lean into your strengths–while you may have a steeper hill to climb, you can remain competitive by focusing on your core skillsets. Everything else can be outsourced as you build a team of specialists in areas you struggle in. It doesn't mean you can't still struggle through and learn new things, but your bread and butter should focus on what you're best at.More than anything, understand that change is slow. We're living in the 2020s, and my challenges are not much different than those my mother and grandmother faced at my age. You'll still face adversity no matter how hard you work or climb.Gender diversity isn't just a moral imperative; it's a business imperative. Innovation thrives on diverse perspectives, and women are essential to this ecosystem.


Being a woman entrepreneur has unique challenges, but it's not impossible. In fact, overcoming these hurdles helps us refine our skills and come out stronger on the other end. Tech bros may run the world, but that doesn't mean we can't claim our space, disrupt the status quo, and lead with passion and resilience.

39,3 Keys to Success for Black Women Entrepreneurs,"Aug 29, 2023",Lauren Gall,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-keys-to-success-for-black-women-entrepreneurs/457439,"
Let's be blunt. Being a Black entrepreneur is different from our counterparts. Not always in a bad way, just dissimilar. However, we do face challenges or have experiences that are sometimes difficult to understand or articulate unless you're in our shoes or you live through them. What might seem routine, 'normal,' or straightforward to others has proven to be unlike what our communities of color face — especially in the small business world. Nevertheless, remaining optimistic and resilient amongst the noise will aid in your success despite the barriers.Embracing pride for your business while maintaining respect for others and yourself will ultimately mold a sound backbone for what life throws amongst the discrimination and bias that are still prevalent. As a Black woman entrepreneur, being aware of the obstacles and having courage to overcome them is critical. Here are three keys to success that aid in empowerment, growing your small business as an underrepresented class and evolving into a respected small business owner.Related: 6 Ways to Offer Allyship to Black Entrepreneurs



1. Bring your own perspective and authenticity + don't be afraid to cultivate changeNo matter how often you've been silenced, don't allow that to define you. Bring your unique perspective to every situation facing you. Fortunately, redefining and making small changes can yield big results in every area of life. Entrepreneurs generally endure a lot every day because it seems easy enough to just count us out or take us less seriously than those in corporate America. However, speaking up, starting and maintaining needed conversations and leveraging your strengths to propel you forward will open doors for differing perspectives and much-needed change to your organization and the world. It's as simple as this — You can make a difference. So, when you see something you don't agree with or feel it is unethical, say something. Be 1% better every day in all you do.Roadblocks are inevitable but necessary for growth. Looking at them as opportunities to be better is always the way forward. Keep your vision clear on what you want your business to accomplish and your life. Continuously set goals to make your vision a reality. And know that being authentic is the best you can be. People want to see authenticity in how they live their lives, run their businesses, and create community. It builds trust and confidence — which is so instrumental, especially today.


Related: How to Create a Thriving Workplace by Leading With Authenticity2. Stay true to who you are + be an advocate for yourselfIf you're a POC reading this, there has, without a doubt, been a time when you found yourself as the only representation of color in a group. In these moments, look for opportunities to drive diversity by advocating for yourself and others. Because when you walk into rooms and see people that look like you amongst the crowd, doesn't that feel better than good? Whether you look at the company you founded, the organizations you get involved with, or the community you live in, you have the greatest opportunity to support diverse environments. Remembering your value and having a purposeful vision in all situations will go a long way.Related: Black Women Entrepreneurs, Not Banks, Helped Me Keep My Company Going During the Pandemic3. Stay informed + commit to your beliefsThe average revenue of Black-owned businesses in Atlanta is incredibly low. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in 2021, ""Black-owned companies generate $39,826 in average annual revenue."" When you consider that minority-owned businesses are pulling in less than $40,000 a year, which is astonishingly less than those businesses that aren't minority-owned, that's a huge problem. Whether it's through volunteering, speaking, mentoring or 1:1's, being a force of change in those statistics (or similar ones) is crucial to the difference that the small business community needs.


As business grows, be a role model for those following in your footsteps. Others are studying your career path and seeing what your business and life look like. Why not leave a lasting legacy in all areas of your life?Be strong in your commitment to rise above and make a difference; remember it starts with you. Consider these possibilities:Choose equitable hiring practices.Find speaking opportunities that allow you to support your community.Cultivate a diverse set of offerings and client bases.Think through your business and find areas where you can drive diversity, equity and inclusion.Be the change you know you can be, and be proud of where your business can take you.The path to success for Black women entrepreneurs requires perseverance and perspective. Staying true to yourself and being a positive resource to others will build a successful business that serves your purpose and your community well. Even in the face of adversity, a resilient spirit, clear vision and unwavering commitment can make all the difference in achieving success and positively impacting the world.

40,3 Ways Women Founders Can Leverage Their Value on Women's Equality Day — and Beyond,"Aug 25, 2023",Meghan Gaffney,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-lessons-for-female-founders-on-womens-equality-day/453882,"
All too often, people in positions of power don't recognize strengths that don't present like the status quo. That top-down, command-and-control, loud leadership is not always the key to success.As we (hopefully) are entering an era where there are as many different faces of entrepreneurship as there are companies, it's important that we recognize that there is not one singular leadership style or manifestation of ""strength"" that predicts or defines success.As a woman founder, I have the opportunity to present a more customer-centered and equity-focused example of a technology leader in my community. As a woman at the helm of an AI company, I know the importance of diverse leaders guiding the use of nascent technology to ensure that the tools and the economy we are building serve all people well and are deployed in ways that drive toward a healthier and more prosperous future for everyone.



It hasn't always been easy being the only woman in the boardroom, but I remain committed to leveraging my authentic brand of ""strength"" to build not just a thriving company, but a thriving culture. I've learned a lot of lessons along the way that may help other non-traditional entrepreneurs.Related: 70% of Male Leaders Believe This Industry Is Inclusive — But Most Female Leaders Disagree.


1. Use the data — it's on your sideRemind yourself (and anybody else who will listen) that women are proven profit drivers and we have the data to back that up.According to The Harvard Business Review, ""firms with more women in senior positions are more profitable, more socially responsible and provide safer, higher-quality customer experiences.""A Boston Consulting Group study that looked at five years of investment and revenue data showed that investment in startups founded or co-founded by women received less in average investment ($935,000 vs. $2.1 million for male founders), but they outpaced their male counterparts in profit generation over five years by 10%.Why the disparity? Investors often tout their ability to ""pattern match"" and recognize strong leaders. That often translates to choosing underperforming men rather than following the data. Women are the smart economic bet. Founders — don't wait for permission to claim your place as a leader, the data is on your side. Use it to your advantage in meetings, discussions, pitch decks and any place else that message needs to be heard.


As Pitch.com said, ""If investors were looking at the data, they'd be doling out money to female founders left and right.""Related: A Look Back at Women's Entrepreneurship Over the Last 35 Years — and How We Can Change the Future for Women Business Owners2. Flip the script: Reframe your strengthsAll too often, the language used to describe the unique strengths of women and underrepresented founders has negative undertones. I had to flip the script in my own head before I could really claim my place as a leader and I encourage you to do the same.For example, female entrepreneurs are often referred to in soft language that downplays the strength of their leadership style. Women are ""empathetic."" I think the more meaningful truth is that our lack of ego allows us to see the world through our customers' perspectives and speak to the value they want to achieve. In this market, being able to connect with and understand customers is incredibly valuable. Take pride in that ability and showcase it.


Another great example: If someone calls you a careful or compassionate leader, they may not even realize the gendered language that implies. What others have seen as compassionate or careful, I see as deliberate and calculated. I focus on people because our people are the company's greatest asset, not just because I can emotionally connect with them. Again, I flipped the script to frame what may be seen as ""soft"" into an asset for the company and the team.When you're faced with language that doesn't sit right with you, do this simple exercise and flip the script to turn that negative into a strength. Believing in yourself and your strengths will help you sell your ideas.Related: Don't Just Sit At the Table, Flip It. A Reflection for Women Entrepreneurs.3. Seek out diverse viewpoints and invite them to the tableI've made it my mission not only to succeed, but to create an environment where every individual on my team can thrive — to build a diverse culture where people know they are valued and safe and that collaboration is celebrated. It's good for them; it's good for the business; and it's the right thing to do.


What that means is that I need to staff my senior teams with others that lead differently from me. Diverse backgrounds, strengths and styles lead to the ability to think more broadly as a group. I trust that I have seen all sides of the problem because I have surrounded myself with others who see healthcare and business challenges from a perspective that I might miss.Again, diversity in leadership teams is not just ""nice to have"" nor is it solely for checking a diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) box. There is proof that diverse teams — diverse in gender, race, ethnicity, age and education — perform better.A Boston Consulting Group study found that innovation and revenue improve with diversity. The study found a ""strong and statistically significant correlation between the diversity of management teams and overall innovation. Companies that reported above-average diversity on their management teams also reported innovation revenue that was 19 percentage points higher than that of companies with below-average leadership diversity — 45% of total revenue versus just 26%.""As you staff your leadership team and identify your advisors, formal and informal, I encourage you to cultivate diversity in those ranks.


As female entrepreneurs, deep down we know we can create something and bring a vision to reality. We didn't choose the safe or comfortable path. We chose one that requires resilience, strength (in all its forms) and maybe just a little bit of flouting convention. But the biggest risk is not being true to yourself and honoring your own personal brand of vision and strength even when the headwinds are against you, especially in this moment when the economy and our communities need more of us to step up, flip the script and take the wheel.

41,What Is Women's Equality Day? Here's What It Represents and Why It Matters,"Aug 24, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-is-womens-equality-day-heres-why-it-matters/456785,"
Women's Equality Day is celebrated on Aug. 26 each year in the United States to commemorate the adoption of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. This day marks an important milestone in the ongoing struggle for gender equality and women's rights in the country.The little-known history of Women's Equality Day is that the efforts took 42 years to pass and it largely benefited only white women.Related: How to Ensure Opportunity and Equality for Women Entrepreneurs Beyond Women's History Month



What Women's Equality Day signifiesThe 19th Amendment, also known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, was first introduced in Congress in 1878. It sought to enfranchise women by granting them the right to vote. However, the amendment faced significant opposition and took several decades to pass.The women's suffrage movement, which began in the mid-19th century, gained momentum in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Suffragists, led by prominent white women such as Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone and Alice Paul, fought tirelessly for the right to vote. They organized rallies, protests and marches to raise awareness about the issue and gain public support.


After years of activism, the 19th Amendment was finally passed reading: ""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex,"" ensuring that women's suffrage became a part of the U.S. Constitution.On Aug. 26, 1920, Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby signed a proclamation officially certifying the 19th Amendment as part of the Constitution, and thus, women gained the right to vote nationwide. This day became known as Women's Equality Day.Women's Equality Day is not only a celebration of the 19th Amendment's passage, but it also serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for gender equality and women's rights. It is a day to honor the trailblazing suffragists who fought for the right to vote and to recognize the continued efforts of women in various fields and movements to achieve full equality.However, for women of color, the road to voting rights was much longer. It took another 45 years for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to pass, addressing voting discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities, including women of color. The Voting Rights Act applied equally to all racial and ethnic minorities and was instrumental in dismantling many of the discriminatory practices that had prevented women of color from exercising their right to vote.


Through the Voting Rights Act, progress was made in increasing voter registration and participation among African Americans and other minority groups, including women of color. However, it is essential to recognize that despite these legislative advancements, challenges to voting rights persist and efforts to protect and expand voting rights continue to this day.Related: A Look Back at Women's Entrepreneurship Over the Last 35 Years — and How We Can Change the Future for Women Business OwnersWhy Women's Equality Day mattersToday, women are still fighting for reproductive rights, voting rights and the lack of caregiving leave policies that adversely affect women, disproportionately women of color. Reflecting on our history is important to understand how to address today's challenges. Women in the U.S. are centuries away from equality. For women to achieve equality, these issues need to be addressed:Caregiving leaveSexual harassmentGender biasesWomen are 70% of primary caregivers and American women spend an average of 3.5 hours more a week on household labor than men. That is why caregiving leave matters to retaining women in the workplace. Caregiving leave needs to be a part of the overall benefits package. This policy should outline the eligibility criteria, the duration of leave allowed, the process for applying for leave and any required documentation. This benefit is often available for anyone that needs time off to care for family members, whether it be for a new child, a sick family member or other caregiving responsibilities. This is especially important for women of color that are three times more likely to experience death or serious health complications during childbirth.


Flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or flexible hours, along with an inclusive culture that genuinely values caregiving responsibilities. That means managers and HR personnel need to understand the importance of caregiving leave and the company's policies and lead by example, demonstrating the commitment to caregiving leave and modeling leave as a part of the employee experience.Despite the success in gaining awareness with the #MeToo movement, sexual harassment is still commonplace in the workplace. The phrase ""Me Too"" was initially coined by activist Tarana Burke in 2006 as a way to support survivors of sexual violence, particularly women of color. However, it gained widespread recognition and international prominence when actress Alyssa Milano encouraged people to use the hashtag in response to the sexual misconduct allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein.Related: Are These 17 Biases Affecting You as a Leader? The Answer Is Likely Yes — Here's How to Address Them.According to a 2018 study by the United Nations, which surveyed 19,000 women across 21 countries, approximately 81% of women and 45% of men reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment or assault in their lifetime. In the workplace, a 2016 report by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which focused on workplace harassment, around 25% to 85% of women reported experiencing sexual harassment at work which varies by definition of harassment. It is important to note that women of color experience harassment are higher levels due to their intersectional marginalized identities.


Lastly, gender biases continue to hold women back from leadership, promotion opportunities and pay equity. The pay equity gap now sits at 82% and only 10% of Fortune 500 CEO positions are held by women. In order for these trends to improve more quickly, unintentional yet harmful views of women in the workplace must be reconciled. Biases that reflect a maternal wall where women are seen as less committed as mothers, a tightrope of gender expression and the prove-it-again bias as well as the tug-of-war that often happens between women need to be addressed.Recognition of Women's Equality Day and the work needed to close the gaps for women need to continue year-round. To accelerate progress, we must confront and dismantle biases and discriminatory practices that hold women back and work towards creating more inclusive and equitable environments for all.

42,3 Keys to Leading Teams During a Time of Divisive Opinions and Tension,"Aug 20, 2023",Kristen Sieffert,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-keys-to-leading-teams-during-a-time-of-divisive-opinions/449092,"
Gone are the days of avoiding politics and religion at the dinner table. Today, we often wear our opinions and beliefs on our sleeves, and divisive views dominate the news. Employees are increasingly vocalizing their support or dissent for various causes and issues and expecting their places of work to take a stand. With a major election occurring next year, and tensions sure to arise throughout the process, now is the time for you to invest in your company's cultural foundation so that no matter the circumstances, a team's cohesion and productivity aren't collateral damage of the election cycle.This climate can be treacherous for business leaders trying to unite teams toward productive goals. Employers who stay quiet or whose views land on an unpopular side of the debate risk sparking discord — in fact, 40% of workers would consider quitting their job if their leader took a stance they disagreed with, according to a recent CNBC|Momentive Workforce Survey. Oftentimes, though, quiet can be misconstrued as well, or worse, become a void filled by others' opinions that may not be in the best interest of the business.We all want to experience psychological safety in the workplace and have the opportunity for our opinions to be heard. If your employees trust that the organization and team have their back, they'll be more willing to collaborate and pull together. This begins by walking your talk — address your employees' concerns, lead ""fireside"" chats where your door is open to anyone from any level or send thoughtful and well-constructed emails that acknowledge the turmoil affecting your teams.



Related: How The Best Executives Show Leadership in Times of UncertaintyIf you can find ways to balance the differences and unions within your teams, you can discover that a business can be a beautiful example of diversity, an antidote to the echo chambers we find online and a real opportunity to understand others. Here are three ways that you can start being more proactive about the tough conversations in your company and build a strong foundation to weather combative times:


1. Set clear cultural values from the startThe combative atmosphere around business values may encourage you to take a neutral stance on everything, but staying quiet won't stop gaps from forming. Instead, you want to be proactive like Salesforce about creating shared values that build a culture of trust and respect for individual beliefs. Since 2015, Salesforce has been public about its moves to make pay within its workforce more equitable and has spoken out against discriminatory legislation.For strong cultural values to exist within your organization and have alignment between all employees, you have to start from the beginning for a consistent experience. When new hires arrive, welcome them with a transparent conversation about what behaviors are expected that reflect the company values and how commitment to these behaviors plays a critical role in the company's success. Also, invite them to call you out if they don't see those values in action so they know that no one is exempt from these values.While having discussions about culture can be challenging, it will be much easier and healthier to have conversations now instead of when something goes wrong. Set expectations from the beginning of your working relationships (or as soon as you can). When trouble arises, you'll already have a shared language to tackle it.Related: Why You Should Care About Psychological Safety in the Workplace


2. Remind one another of what makes you youCreate a shared culture, but don't ignore differences either. Your differences make you unique as a group of people and as a business. What's more, your differing views can fuel creativity and growth and helps you to connect with a wider audience.When acknowledging differences as a leader, it's important to remember that not every moment is ideal for these conversations. Again, a good rule of thumb is to be proactive about these discussions rather than waiting for a misunderstanding to arise.Set aside time to get to know each other better. Ask your teams what differences they bring to the table and give them a chance to educate you on the best language to use when talking about those differences.3. Rally toward a common causeTwice a month, I send out Friday emails to my team to discuss recent events and double down on our shared purpose. With the media leaning more heavily on divisive language, I choose to talk about shared aims and challenges, so the team can remember that we have more in common than we may initially think. In a recent email, I ended by writing: ""I look forward to sharing stories as we seek out those commonalities in places we may have overlooked in the past. Just like our acts of kindness create a ripple effect, our search for and celebration of commonality can do the same.""


Related: How to Turn Company Values Into Shared Employee BeliefsDespite differences, shared beliefs can be central themes in your team's narrative. If things get hairy in the political world, you can rest on these shared beliefs, using them to lean on as you talk about dissimilarities. What could your shared purpose be?Since I began sharing more of my full self with my team, they have begun to reciprocate, creating a highly empowered and trusting culture. The best path toward building an empathetic culture lies in your hands and is cultivated first and foremost through your modeling and behavior. Ask yourself what is your behavior? How does your team feel after interactions with you?If you are truly and authentically empathetic, your team will learn to do the same. It becomes a cultural norm. And the business will attract the type of people who can help that culture flourish exponentially.

No one blinks when they find out your doctor is a woman. Or your lawyer. Or your accountant. But try telling them that your CTO is a ""she"" or your IT ""guy"" isn't a guy at all — you might get a different reaction. That's a problem, of course. Fortunately, it's solvable. As leaders, we can help pave the path to a tech career, making it less daunting for women.As a woman who's been successful in navigating the rocky road to tech success, I can attest to the fact that it can be done. If you have a dream, you can do it. I just wish that women could realize equality in the technical fields a little faster. According to one CIO Magazine article from 2023, women make up merely 28% of the computing and math-focused worker population. Perhaps worse, about half of the women employees who start in tech eventually leave the tech world behind. Those aren't great numbers, but they shouldn't serve as barriers.The fact is, technology is an amazing sector. It's growing all the time, and opportunities are opening up left and right. Who would have guessed just a decade ago that podcasting technology for brands would be so needed? Now, it's not only a ""thing:"" It's a ""thing"" that's in high demand. That's why I moved into the niche.



Women who are passionate about all things technology-related have so many directions to go in. However, they need to get a foot in the door first. If you're in a leadership role where you can help women move into tech, I urge you to apply some of these tips. You'll be doing a favor not just to talented, tech-minded women but to all the industries that need them.Related: 5 Ways to Make the Modern Tech Workplace More Welcoming to Women


1. Eliminate biased hiring practicesSeveral researchers dove into the statistics of inclusive organizations in 2021. These were businesses devoted to diversity. Nevertheless, they still found tons of biased hiring happening. In one case, female STEM majors needed perfect GPAs to effectively compete with their male counterparts with lower GPAs.My guess would be that those companies' leaders had no clue they were making the candidate journey harder for women. They probably assumed that everyone was being treated fairly. Instead of making the same error, work with your human resources director and hiring managers. Figure out if unconscious bias may be sneaking into the way you evaluate tech applicants.One way to remove gender bias includes taking identifiable names and information off applications. You may also want to wait to conduct face-to-face interviews until the last rounds of decision-making. Using digital, AI-fueled platforms can help, too, especially in the early stages of screening.2. Offer female employees the chance to laterally move to tech rolesLet's say you have a female employee in a non-tech department. She mentions that she'd like to learn more about technology and maybe one day hold a technical position. Is it possible to make that happen? Perhaps, if you set up professional development and mentorship programs within your company.


You can't assume that every worker in your business wants to stay where they're at forever. Many will want to make lateral moves at some point during their tenures. Why couldn't those lateral moves be across silos and not just from one cubby to the next? I got my start in marketing. However, I gradually pivoted myself into a more tech realm. I still have my marketing chops, of course. I just use them differently as the head of a more technical startup.You shouldn't risk losing a good employee just because she's interested in doing something different career-wise. According to Qualtrics, the average churn rate is 10.6% across all organizations. This means that if you can get your turnover to single digits, you can avoid saying goodbye to superstars. At the same time, you may be able to guide a female team member into a technical position. She'll stay with your company, and you'll increase the number of women in tech on your staff. Everyone wins.Related: 3 Tips for Promoting From Within3. Switch to a female-friendly tech vendorThere's a saying that you're judged by the company you keep. It's true in business as well as personal life. When you partner with vendors who prioritize gender equality — including in places where women are historically underrepresented — you make a big statement. Effectively, you tell the world that you're going to be the change you want to see.


For example, let's say that you're trying to pick a new vendor for a technical service you need. Though the vendors you're evaluating are all unique in some ways, they're not too different. Except one has obviously given women more chances to try their hand at technical jobs.Is it worth giving that latter company your business? By doing so, you'll show your support. You may even prove to be an encouragement for the women in your workplace who have considered tech at some point. You may find the experience an opening for what McKinsey & Company calls supplier collaboration, too. That is, you and your new vendor may be able to form other partnerships, like perhaps a joint tech internship for female college students.Women who want to jump into tech shouldn't be held back. By tackling the problem of gender inequalities in the industry now, we can all make having a tech career easier for future generations.Related: How Women Are Innovating and Shaping the Tech Landscape — and How Men Can Support Them

44,What the 'Barbie' Movie Can Teach Businesses About Effective Multicultural Marketing,"Jul 21, 2023",Christine Alexis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-key-insights-from-the-barbie-movies-multicultural/455566,"
Barbie, the iconic doll brand, will debut its highly anticipated movie on July 21. This groundbreaking movie not only promises much-needed nostalgia but will also serve as a catalyst for Barbie to further acquire the multicultural consumer. Over the years, Barbie has recognized the importance of embracing diversity and inclusion by creating dolls representative of all women. To date, the dolls have 35 skin tones, 97 hairstyles and nine different body types. Barbie also recently designed its first doll with Down syndrome in partnership with the National Down Syndrome Society.The brand's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is no different in the movie. The creators of the Barbie movie made it a point to collaborate with multicultural artists and leverage digital platforms, creating an avenue for diverse audiences to feel seen, represented and included.Related: The Time for Diversity in Advertising Is Now



Amplifying impact through collaborationsBarbie took a holistic approach to multicultural representation and forged alliances with influential figures who embody and champion diversity, equity and inclusion. One notable partnership the Barbie movie made was with Issa Rae, an award-winning actress and producer. Additionally, the film has a diverse cast that reflects today's multicultural world. While Barbie prides itself on being ""the most inclusive doll line,"" and its actions show its commitment to the multicultural community, it is expected that Barbie's diverse on-screen representation will also result in a spike in ticket sales.In fact, a study by Movio found a correlation ""between a minority group's representation on-screen and that group's audience turnout, with some groups attending in numbers at more than twice the usual rate. The research also shows that increased representation of minority groups on-screen can influence less engaged moviegoers within that demographic to come out to the theater."" By embracing diversity in casting, the Barbie movie can further tap into the $3.9T minority buying power while bridging cultural divides and engaging a wide range of viewers who can identify with the characters.


Celebrating U.S. multiculturalism through musicThe movie also champions multiculturalism through its diverse soundtrack, featuring collaborations with Latinx and Black artists. The film's soundtrack announcement on Instagram showcased renowned Latinx artist Karol G and award-winning Black artists Lizzo and Nicki Minaj, to name a few. Curating a playlist for all consumer segments further affirms Barbie's commitment to celebrating diverse cultures.By collaborating with artists from these communities, Barbie embraces their unique voices and talents and taps into their fan bases, fostering a deeper connection with multicultural audiences. This strategic approach enhances the authenticity and relatability of the movie. It is also a powerful example of how brands can drive multicultural marketing by spotlighting and collaborating with artists from diverse backgrounds, thus creating a genuinely inclusive experience for the movie-goer.Related: The 1 Rule You Need to Follow to Authentically Build an Inclusive BrandDigital engagement and community buildingThe marketing strategy for the movie extends seamlessly to digital platforms, harnessing the power of social media and online engagement to connect with multicultural audiences. Barbie has a robust digital presence and targeted campaigns on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. According to a study by Google, 64% of respondents reported taking action after seeing an ad they thought was diverse or inclusive. In addition, according to 5WPR 2020 Consumer Culture Report, 83% of millennials want brands to align with them on values.


Collaborations with social media influencers and content creators from various backgrounds were pivotal when promoting the film. These digital partnerships fostered a sense of community as individuals from different cultures shared their excitement and anticipation for the movie, creating a powerful ripple effect of engagement.In addition, Barbie's online platforms, most notably the Barbie Style Instagram account, provide an inclusive space where multicultural audiences can connect and engage with the brand. By featuring diverse Barbie dolls and celebrating various cultural influences on fashion and style, Barbie creates an environment that empowers individuals to embrace their unique identities. There is also the Barbie Selfie Generator, where users can put themselves into the marketing posters on an AI-powered website and include a Barbie-like catchphrase such as, ""This Barbie is a boss."" The generator was a great way to develop excitement and foster community for all Barbie fans through user-generated content campaigns. This expertly crafted digital marketing strategy ensured that the Barbie movie resonated deeply with diverse viewers, cultivating a lasting connection beyond the movie that can translate into greater brand loyalty.The upcoming film is a testament to the brand's commitment to multicultural representation and diverse viewership. Barbie successfully penetrated the multicultural community by collaborating with diverse artists, deploying an inviting strategic digital marketing approach and fostering a platform for inclusive storytelling and engagement. Barbie also provided authentic representation, ensuring that minority groups can see genuine depictions of themselves on the big screen. These tactics go beyond movie promotion, inspiring future generations to embrace their unique identities and affirm Barbie's legacy as a symbol of inclusive representation.Related: Effective DEI Strategies That Result in Lasting Change

45,Where Anheuser-Busch Went Wrong and How We Can Do Better,"Jul 21, 2023",Jack Truong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/where-anheuser-busch-went-wrong-and-how-we-can-do-better/455235,"
Trouble is brewing for Anheuser-Busch (ABI). Following the company's controversial Instagram collaboration with transgender actress/influencer Dylan Mulvaney, Bud Light sales plummeted 26% (compared to 2022), two marketing executives were placed on leave, and distributor sales dropped nearly 30%. In a ""complete lack of oversight,"" Bud Light's national, decades-long status as the No. 1 beer was dismantled in less than a week. Still, the question remains: is Bud Light ""woke"" yet?In today's culture, wokeness is an indicator of one's awareness of issues such as racial prejudice, discrimination, sexism and other social inequalities. Wokeness doesn't just apply to individuals; consumers actively measure companies against this social metric. In an effort to meet this standard, 43% of CEOs now consider diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) to be high on their list of challenges — for both their internal operations and external communications. I am a firm believer in diversifying companies, fostering inclusivity and promoting equal representation — but ""checking the diversity box"" is neither ethical nor effective, and consumers know it.Related: Costco Stamps Bud Light With Its 'Star of Death' After Severe Backlash



Know who your consumers areConsumers increasingly want their purchases to adequately reflect their own values. Companies want to convince us that their products align with our own ideals — an exceedingly treacherous endeavor in an increasingly polarized political environment. When ABI opted to expand market territory by trying to appeal to a younger, hard-seltzer-drinking generation, their internal teams were working in siloes. Thus, the company failed to holistically consider the values of its most loyal consumers, ruffling the feathers of Bud Light's primary consumer base — which is simply a poor business decision.So, where did ABI go wrong? The marketing team wanted to move away from Bud Light's ""fratty"" and ""out of touch"" humor — but at whose expense? Not only did ABI spark outrage among its core and conservative consumers, but it also failed to act as a true ally to the community they were marketing to — alienating both its potential and existing consumers.


Though ABI ""never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people,"" real activism isn't possible without such division. Unfortunately, in today's society, allying with one group (especially marginalized populations) can alienate another. Neutrality can be interpreted as an act of indifference (or complicit) or aggression (anti-ally).Related: Angry Customers Boycotting Bud Light Haven't Meaningfully Impacted Sales, Says Anheuser-Busch CEOIn some cases, being ""woke"" sells — consider Nike's infamous ad featuring pro football player/activist Colin Kaepernick. Nike's ad also prompted boycotts, but Nike doubled down on its decision to stand by Kaepernick. Ultimately, Nike even won an Emmy for the ad, and the company's stock grew by more than 80% over the next five years.The difference between Nike and ABI is twofold: firstly, Nike was already known to be a counter-cultural company, so the Kaepernick ad was consistent with its business strategy (while some felt the ad was out of line, no one perceived it as out of character). Likewise, Nike understood its consumer base: young, left-leaning individuals interested in sports and social activism. By taking both identities into account — their primary consumers, and the company itself — Nike was able to execute a campaign that benefitted not only the company but also Kaepernick's platform for racial justice.


Related: Bud Light Launches 'Biggest Summer Campaign Ever' Amid Backlash and a Decline in SalesKnow who you are as a companyBack in 2017, Pepsi released an ad that seemed to refer to the Black Lives Matter movement and/or police brutality protests. When casting Kendall Jenner as a ""white savior"" figure, Pepsi failed to consider its Black consumers. The company also failed to evaluate its own lack of any real activism related to the movement. Pepsi acknowledged that it had ""missed the mark"" in misappropriating a serious issue. It released a statement eerily reminiscent of ABI's recent apology: ""Pepsi was only trying to protect a global message of unity, peace and understanding"" — by bringing everyone together to enjoy a beverage, of course.Ben & Jerry's is no stranger to controversial, political marketing — and like Nike, these social stunts have yet to have a lasting impact on the company's profitability. The ice cream company is a well-known leader in DEI and social activism and has never forsaken its ""hippie"" Vermont roots. Ben & Jerry's can afford to be bold because their messaging is authentic: they practice what they preach. The company even has an in-house activism budget — backing up the promises printed on its colorful cartons. By contrast, ABI was unwilling to fully commit to being an LBGTQ+ ally, yet hoped (like Pepsi) to profit off the initial optics of the Mulvaney partnership.Related: How to Build a Team That's True to Your Values


Make DEI part of the company strategyAlex Gorsky, CEO of Johnson & Johnson, says, ""The best innovations can only come if our people reflect the world's full diversity of individuals, opinions, and approaches."" This message opens the door for DEI strategies that can make a difference. The important piece that many business leaders miss is that these initiatives must be built into the DNA and strategy of the company rather than tacked on as an afterthought. Had Pepsi or ABI built truly diverse teams operating at all levels, their workforces would have been more representative of the market being served — and they may have recognized the potential pitfalls of their partnerships.Of course, only companies who ""walk the walk"" should consider ""talking the talk"" on a public stage — but even the most well-intentioned companies fall short of making real progress regarding DEI. In 2020 and 2021, companies such as McDonald's, Microsoft, Boeing and Best Buy pledged to improve diversity hiring practices and DEI training, and more than 60 US companies appointed their first-ever Chief Diversity Office (CDO).And yet, 80% of HR professionals view companies as just ""going through the motions,"" and 40% of Black professionals don't believe leaders follow through on authentic DEI initiatives. Much of this comes down to the challenges of actual implementation; many CDOs leave their roles due to a lack of strategic, leadership and financial support. Companies who seek to execute DEI plans must be sure that the company has the infrastructure to support such initiatives — otherwise, their failure undermines their good intentions.Read More: 7 Ways Leaders Can Level Up Their DEI Workplace StrategyMake it a real, long-term commitmentAs John Doerr writes in Measure What Matters: ""Ideas are easy, execution is everything."" I believe that companies who try to capitalize on shallow partnerships only increase the work we still need to do in both the business world and society at large. Until companies actually say what they mean and mean what they say, employees and consumers alike will continue to see through their empty promises and false alliances. Failed campaigns like ABI's do more harm than good — not just for the company, but also for the causes and people they only feign to support.

47,"Artificial Intelligence Can Be Racist, Sexist and Creepy. Here Are 5 Ways You Can Counter This In Your Enterprise.","Jul 13, 2023",Jamey Harvey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/ai-can-be-racist-sexist-and-creepy-here-are-5-ways-you/449109,"
I started my career as a serial entrepreneur in disruptive technologies, raising tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, and navigating two successful exits. Later I became the chief technology architect for the nation's capital, where it was my privilege to help local government agencies navigate transitioning to new disruptive technologies. Today I am the CEO of an antiracist boutique consulting firm where we help social equity enterprises liberate themselves from old, outdated, biased technologies and coach leaders on how to avoid reimplementing bias in their software, data and business processes.The biggest risk on the horizon for leaders today in regard to implementing biased, racist, sexist and heteronormative technology is artificial intelligence (AI).Today's entrepreneurs and innovators are exploring ways to use artificial intelligence to enhance efficiency, productivity and customer service, but is this technology truly an advancement or does it introduce new complications by amplifying existing cultural biases, like sexism and racism? 



Soon, most — if not all — major enterprise platforms will come with built-in AI. Meanwhile, employees will be carrying around AI on their phones by the end of the year. AI is already affecting workplace operations, but marginalized groups, people of color, LGBTQIA+, neurodivergent folx, and disabled people have been ringing alarms about how AI amplifies biased content and spreads disinformation and distrust.To understand these impacts, we will review five ways AI can deepen racial bias and social inequalities in your enterprise. Without a comprehensive and socially informed approach to AI in your organization, this technology will feed institutional biases, exacerbate social inequalities, and do more harm to your company and clients. Therefore, we will explore practical solutions for addressing these issues, such as developing better AI training data, ensuring transparency of the model output and promoting ethical design. 


Related: These Entrepreneurs Are Taking on Bias in Artificial IntelligenceRisk #1: Racist and biased AI hiring softwareEnterprises rely on AI software to screen and hire candidates, but the software is inevitably as biased as the people in human resources (HR) whose data was used to train the algorithms. There are no standards or regulations for developing AI hiring algorithms. Software developers focus on creating AI that imitates people. As a result, AI faithfully learns all the biases of people used to train it across all data sets.Reasonable people would not hire an HR executive who (consciously or unconsciously) screens out people whose names sound diverse, right? Well, by relying on datasets that contain biased information, such as past hiring decisions and/or criminal records, AI inserts all these biases into the decision-making process. This bias is particularly damaging to marginalized populations, who are more likely to be passed over for employment opportunities due to markers of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, etc.How to address it:Keep socially conscious human beings involved with the screening and selection process. Empower them to question, interrogate and challenge AI-based decisions.Train your employees that AI is neither neutral nor intelligent. It is a tool — not a colleague.Ask potential vendors whether their screening software has undergone AI equity auditing. Let your vendor partners know this important requirement will affect your buying decisions.Load test resumes that are identical except for some key altered equity markers. Are identical resumes in Black zip codes rated lower than those in white majority zip codes? Report these biases as bugs and share your findings with the world via Twitter.Insist that vendor partners demonstrate that the AI training data are representative of diverse populations and perspectives.Use the AI itself to push back against the bias. Most solutions will soon have a chat interface. Ask the AI to identify qualified marginalized candidates (e.g., Black, female, and/or queer) and then add them to the interview list.Related: How Racism is Perpetuated within Social Media and Artificial Intelligence


Risk #2: Developing racist, biased and harmful AI softwareChatGPT 4 has made it ridiculously easy for information technology (IT) departments to incorporate AI into existing software. Imagine the lawsuit when your chatbot convinces your customers to harm themselves. (Yes, an AI chatbot has already caused at least one suicide.)How to address it:Your chief information officer (CIO) and risk management team should develop some common-sense policies and procedures around when, where, how, and who decides what AI resources can be deployed now. Get ahead of this.If developing your own AI-driven software, stay away from public internet-trained models. Large data models that incorporate everything published on the internet are riddled with bias and harmful learning.Use AI technologies trained only on bounded, well-understood datasets.Strive for algorithmic transparency. Invest in model documentation to understand the basis for AI-driven decisions.Do not let your people automate or accelerate processes known to be biased against marginalized groups. For example, automated facial recognition technology is less accurate in identifying people of color than white counterparts.Seek external review from Black and Brown experts on diversity and inclusion as part of the AI development process. Pay them well and listen to them.Risk #3: Biased AI abuses customersAI-powered systems can lead to unintended consequences that further marginalize vulnerable groups. For example, AI-driven chatbots providing customer service frequently harm marginalized people in how they respond to inquiries.  AI-powered systems also manipulate and exploit vulnerable populations, such as facial recognition technology targeting people of color with predatory advertising and pricing schemes.How to address it:Do not deploy solutions that harm marginalized people. Stand up for what is right and educate yourself to avoid hurting people.Build models responsive to all users. Use language appropriate for the context in which they are deployed.Do not remove the human element from customer interactions. Humans trained in cultural sensitivity should oversee AI, not the other way around.Hire Black or Brown diversity and technology consultants to help clarify how AI is treating your customers. Listen to them and pay them well.Risk #4: Perpetuating structural racism when AI makes financial decisions AI-powered banking and underwriting systems tend to replicate digital redlining. For example, automated loan underwriting algorithms are less likely to approve loans for applicants from marginalized backgrounds or Black or Brown neighborhoods, even when they earn the same salary as approved applicants.How to address it:Remove bias-inducing demographic variables from decision-making processes and regularly evaluate algorithms for bias.Seek external reviews from experts on diversity and inclusion that focus on identifying potential biases and developing strategies to mitigate them. Use mapping software to draw visualizations of AI recommendations and how they compare with marginalized peoples' demographic data. Remain curious and vigilant about whether AI is replicating structural racism.Use AI to push back by requesting that it find loan applications with lower scores due to bias. Make better loans to Black and Brown folks.Related: What Is AI, Anyway? Know Your Stuff With This Go-To Guide.


Risk #5: Using health system AI on populations it is not trained for A pediatric health center serving poor disabled children in a major city was at risk of being displaced by a large national health system that convinced the regulator that its Big Data AI engine provided cheaper, better care than human care managers. However, the AI was trained on data from Medicare (mainly white, middle-class, rural and suburban, elderly adults). Making this AI — which is trained to advise on care for elderly people — responsible for medication recommendations for disabled children could have produced fatal outcomes.How to address it:Always look at the data used to train AI. Is it appropriate for your population? If not, do not use the AI.Conclusion Many people in the AI industry are shouting that AI products will cause the end of the world. Scare-mongering leads to headlines, which lead to attention and, ultimately, wealth creation. It also distracts people from the harm AI is already causing to your marginalized customers and employees.Do not be fooled by the apocalyptic doomsayers. By taking reasonable, concrete steps, you can ensure that their AI-powered systems are not contributing to existing social inequalities or exploiting vulnerable populations. We must quickly master harm reduction for people already dealing with more than their fair share of oppression.

48,Why Addressing the Racial Wealth Gap is Good for Business,"Jul 6, 2023",Sandra M. Moore,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/why-addressing-the-racial-wealth-gap-is-good-for-business/454639,"
Philanthropy and government programs have been trying to close the racial wealth gap for a long time, but they've been focused on band-aids when we need ladders. While the wealth gap is fueled by several contributing factors, including disparity in home ownership, accumulation of financial assets and strong growing wages, as small business investors, we can draw our attention to a core piece of the problem: the wage gap.Let's take a moment to clarify what we mean when we talk about the wage gap as it relates to the racial wealth gap. We are not just talking about good-paying jobs for people of color. We really need good-paying jobs that provide a clear pathway for Black and Brown employees to build a stronger, sustaining financial future.The typical white U.S. household has nearly eight times the wealth of the typical Black household. To address the systemic issue of racial wealth inequity, the private sector must do what it does best – invest in great companies and entrepreneurs that create quality jobs –and ensure all workers, especially Black and Brown workers, have an equal opportunity to build a lasting, positive economic reality for themselves and their families.



Related: Compounding Inequality to Compounding Success: Bridging the Racial Wealth GapMedia reported widely that recent pandemic aid cut U.S. poverty to a new low, but that was a short-term solution to a global crisis — it wasn't aimed at driving wages higher in perpetuity. As that funding source dries up, those in a lower economic bracket return to the same or even worse circumstances than they were at the start. To truly attack the racial wealth gap, we need the private sector to make the change that the government and non-profits simply cannot do independently.


Private sector employers and investors often can't see how they can drive the change needed to give Black and Brown Americans access to wealth-creation opportunities while growing businesses and pleasing investment partners. But it is not as hard as they may think, and the benefits to their business and community deliver a long-lasting ROI for companies, workers and families.Building a path to financial security starts with strategic wagesFor decades, wages for Black and Brown workers have lagged behind those of white workers with the same experience and education, even in the same geography Even when people of color climb the corporate ladder, they make less — 97 cents on the dollar.These communities need more than just a living wage; they also need opportunities for long-term career development, pay parity and wage progression. A rising wage promotes economic stability, helps workers provide for their families and facilitates wealth accumulation for future generations.Wage progression — whether linked to individual performance, company performance, tenure, skills development, or promotion — is also good for business. It helps attract the best employees, improves retention, and sustains and incentivizes business growth.


Related: How to Support Black Employees During (and After) Juneteenth The role of benefits in building generational wealthMeaningful benefits are a major piece of increasing sustainable employee wealth. Most employee wealth is derived from workplace benefits packages: health insurance, 401ks, stock options, etc. Low-wage workers typically don't have those options, which are key to building generational wealth.Business leaders and investors can change this situation by learning from employees what benefits and opportunities would make the greatest difference in their lives and free up income for saving and investing– be that affordable healthcare, child/eldercare support, or direct wealth creation through incentivized savings opportunities like 401k plans, IRAs, and employer matching savings programs.Offering these types of household-stabilizing benefits could largely pay for themselves in terms of lower absenteeism, greater productivity, increased retention and worker-driven competitive advantage.


Help employees continually grow their skillsToo often, the leadership potential and training of Black and Brown Americans is overlooked. According to McKinsey, Black workers are disproportionately concentrated in entry-level jobs with low pay and underrepresented in leadership and executive positions.Correcting this divide means providing entry-level workers with access to training and development opportunities from the moment they are hired. Programs that teach employees valuable skills for remaining relevant in their careers to prepare them for higher responsibilities while reducing turnover, improving engagement and accelerating business growth.Making it happenInvestors typically provide small businesses with growth capital, but they can also provide operational capital that is invested directly in employees. Business leaders, their investors and advisors can collaborate to devise a feasible and ambitious plan that establishes measurable goals for the company and the impact company leaders aim to achieve by driving an innovative wage strategy.Several local or national advocacy groups for diverse workplaces, such as the Business Consortium Fund, the National Institute of Minority Economic Development and the Minority Business Development Agency, can assist with this kind of wage-targeted approach to eliminating the racial wealth gap.


Furthermore, it is crucial to monitor and evaluate outcomes using meaningful metrics. Failing to measure outcomes from these changes means businesses will not know what they've really achieved, which keeps them from continuous improvement.Related: How to Overcome Workplace Inequality and Reach Gender ParityOpportunity and obligationI believe that every employer and their investors have a moral imperative to make closing the racial wealth gap a focal point of their business model, even if it means taking a little less for themselves and other executives off the bottom line. There is a tremendous opportunity to hire workers from disadvantaged communities and grow and sustain a strong workforce that helps grow all businesses. In return, employees would benefit from quality jobs and greater economic vitality now and in the future, setting up the next generation for even greater progress.It's about doing something incredible and making work ""work"" for businesses and employees alike. This type of investment is the catalyst for the change we need in our business world and our society —but it can't happen without the private sector and its leaders driving the charge.

49,Dealing With Workplace Intimidation? Here's How to Take Back Control of Your Work Relationships,"Jun 20, 2023",Pierre Raymond,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/dealing-with-workplace-intimidation-heres-how-to-fight-it/453804,"
Workplace intimidation is alive and well. Whether working remotely or on-site, employees continue to experience high levels of intimidation, often resulting in an environment made up of toxic behavior or bullying.The Workplace Bullying Institute (WBI) estimated that more than 48.6 million American employees experience some form of bullying at work. Additionally, the WBI survey found that around 30% of working adults have ongoing direct experience with bullying in the workplace, an increase of 57% between 2017 and 2021.While some business leaders might feel that being more assertive — or oftentimes, intimidating — will bring out a more submissive attitude in their employees, it often results in a working environment that is toxic for everyone and can lead to greater employee turnaround or lower productivity.



Related: How to Deal With a Workplace BullyBullying vs. intimidationAlthough the two terms might be closely related, for employees it's important to differentiate between both and know how to act upon them when they are confronted with this sort of behavior.


Bullying is often considered an act of domination. This is usually through using threatening gestures, whether it's verbal, non-verbal, physical or even physiological.On the other hand, intimidation is defined as a deliberate act of frightening a person into doing something. This could be an employer threatening one of their employees with their job or withholding their wages if they are unable to finish a certain task or project, or do not agree with what they are being told to do.The lines are often blurred when it comes to differentiating between being bullied or intimidated. Nonetheless, in the modern workplace, professionals consider intimidation as a form of bullying, which can harm their performance and their relationship with their peers.Creating room for improvementTaking control of bad or negative workplace behavior is never an easy challenge, and confronting a person on their actions can often result in even more uncomfortable situations for employees, managers and employers.


To put things into perspective, nearly 60% of American employers tend to react negatively when they find out that bullying is being reported in the workplace. The result is that perpetrators often don't see the consequences of their actions, which in turn creates a sense of fear among those in the workplace.However, this creates a lot of room for improvement, and for employees that encounter bullying or intimidation regularly, there are ways they can reclaim their workplace relationships and take more action to hold their perpetrators accountable — even if it might be their boss.Related: Bullying Doesn't Just Happen in Schools. Here's How to Turn a Workplace Culture of Bullying to a Culture of InnovationAcknowledge the reality of the situationTake note of when intimidation occurs and realize that it might not be just a person's personality or a clash of opinions. This is important both for employees that experience it or perhaps managers witnessing this behavior among team members.


Make clear distinctions on whether or not a person is deliberately going out of their way to make other colleagues feel scared, threatened or uncomfortable. An action that is repeated multiple times shouldn't be considered a coincidence, but can rather be seen as a choice to act in a certain way.Identify when or where it takes placeIntimidation can be a physical threat or even something that might occur in an email or other forms of communication. If you become aware of when and where this might have taken place, you can start to take more note thereof.Make sure to keep a record of this, either on some notes on your phone or on a separate email account that is not linked to your work. Include as much information as possible, who was involved, what was being said and whether or not the issue has been resolved.Have an open dialogueOften employees tend to feel intimidated by things they don't know, whether it's having to deal with group projects, new programs or even a new colleague. Simply raising specific points with a person in an open dialogue can help resolve a lot of issues.


If you can understand a person's point of view and what they expect from you — in this case, either a manager or employer — you will get a better idea of where you need to make possible improvements or adjust your understanding going forward.Don't directly accuse any person of being intimidating or call them out on their behavior. Rather see whether or not it's possible to resolve the underlying conflict.Take action when neededEmployees and teams need to know when to take action and what their options might be. Employees need to assess their options, whether it's talking to a colleague, their manager or even HR. The same goes for those in upper management roles.Additionally, if an employee is being intimidated or bullied by a fellow peer or their manager, approach them in private and see whether or not you can assist them. Always use the available channels you have available to resolve any confrontation before it transcends into bigger problems.


Evaluate workplace policiesMost organizations will have policies in place that aim to prohibit the act of bullying in the workplace. Make sure that as an employee, you know what the workplace policies are in terms of this, and when it's possible to identify if someone has stepped out of line.If there are no workplace policies, see whether or not you can bring this up with management or employers. There should be clear guidelines on how bullying or intimidation should be handled within the office.Find your voiceThere's no harm in standing up to someone if you feel that they have crossed a certain boundary. Standing up for yourself isn't easy, and it's even harder to do so for other people, especially in the workplace.Not everyone can muster up the confidence to speak out when it's needed. In these cases, keep a record of these particular instances, or perhaps approach a person to see whether or not there might be some unresolved problems that can be sorted out.


To concludeIntimidation in the workplace only creates a toxic work environment for every employee. Having the courage to stand up to someone is not always an option for everyone, so it's important to consider other possibilities that can help them find a viable solution to resolve workplace bullying.

50,What Is the Difference Between Equality and Equity? Here's What You Need to Know.,"Jun 19, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/equality-vs-equity-whats-the-difference-heres-what-to/453146,"
DEI is the most common acronym in the diversity space. D for diversity, E for equity — not equality — and I for inclusion. Why the difference?Equality suggests that treating everyone equally will solve the diversity problem, yet that has resulted in little to no change. Equity by contrast is about meeting the needs of individuals that are systemically marginalized because of factors outside their control — race, ethnicity, class, age or gender most commonly — yet many more.There are three key differences between equity and equality. Equity means:



Providing resources to those that need them the most firstEducating the majority group on their role in inclusionProactively communicating the importance that DEI is not a zero-sum gameRelated: 18 Business Leaders on Creating an Inclusive and Equitable SocietyProvide resources to those that need them the most firstEquity is about putting the needs of those most marginalized first. That means those that have been systemically disadvantaged due to their gender identity, race, ethnicity or other dimensions of diversity are prioritized with resource allocation. Resources such as education, mentorship opportunities and sponsorship need to be allocated to those that reflect the general population. Unfortunately, resources are often overallocated to the majority group that already holds the most privilege and proxy to power, reinforcing the status quo.


Examples of resource allocation are programs inclusive development programs that amplify the skills and voices of people of color, mentorship programs that target underrepresented demographics with access to senior leaders and sponsorship programs that ensure that people's work is equitably recognized. Too often, promotion and representation rates dwindle for women, people of color, those with disabilities and the LGBTQ+ community. Equity seeks to right that wrong.Educate the majority group on their role in inclusionHowever, these programs will fail if the majority group doesn't understand their role in facilitating an inclusive environment where diverse talent can thrive. Often the majority group has not had the lived experiences of being part of a marginalized group and so they lack the context and understanding to be helpful.Panel discussions that bring to life the real experiences of underrepresented groups in a thoughtful pragmatic way can help bridge the gap. In addition, proven resources, documentaries, books and podcasts can help the majority group understand the nuances of inclusion.It is likely leaders will make mistakes in the DEI conversation. Having tools and resources is critical for the majority group to proactively avoid some of these likely missteps.


Tokenism: Tokenism occurs when individuals or organizations make superficial efforts to include diverse individuals or groups without genuinely valuing their contributions. It is important to go beyond representation and create inclusive environments where everyone's voice is heard and respected.One-size-fits-all approach: Another mistake is assuming that DEI initiatives can be applied universally without considering the specific needs and experiences of different groups. It is important to recognize and address the unique challenges faced by various communities and tailor strategies accordingly.Failure to address systemic issues: DEI efforts should not solely focus on individual actions or behaviors. It is crucial to identify and challenge the systemic barriers and biases that perpetuate inequality and exclusion. This may involve examining hiring practices, policies and organizational culture.Lack of genuine leadership commitment: DEI initiatives require genuine commitment and support from leadership. Without strong leadership buy-in, these efforts can lack the necessary resources, accountability and sustainability to effect meaningful change.Overlooking intersectionality: Intersectionality refers to the interconnected nature of social categorizations, such as race, gender, sexuality and class, which can create overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination. Ignoring intersectionality can result in exclusionary practices and a limited understanding of the experiences of marginalized individuals.Relying on quotas: While quotas can be a useful tool to increase representation, relying solely on them can be counterproductive. It is important to create inclusive environments where individuals from diverse backgrounds have equal opportunities to thrive, rather than solely focusing on numerical targets.Lack of ongoing evaluation and feedback: DEI initiatives should be regularly evaluated and adjusted based on feedback from the affected communities. Failure to gather input and measure the impact of these initiatives can hinder progress and perpetuate ineffective practices.Performative allyship: Performative allyship refers to instances where individuals or organizations publicly express support for marginalized groups without taking substantive actions to address underlying issues. It is important to back up intentions with meaningful actions and engagement.Equity is about meeting leaders where they're at and equipping them proactively with tools and information to combat these missteps.Proactively communicating the importance that DEI is not a zero-sum gameAs with any shift in culture or change, the why is pivotal. People need to understand why equity is necessary. Equality is the goal - equity is how we get there. DEI is about doing things differently and challenging the status quo. We can't solve a problem by doing things the same way that created the problem. That's where equity comes in.Oftentimes, the majority group might feel alienated or that they're somehow left out of promotional opportunities because of the focus on diversity. The opposite is often true. When we have diverse representation in decision-making, we have higher rates of innovation, higher revenue rates and profitability. Rather than thinking about it as my seat at the table versus your seat at the table, or my pie slice versus your pie slice, the pie collectively grows bigger and they're more seats at the table for everyone.Many people get overwhelmed with diversity language. Just two letters in the difference between equality and equity mean two very different approaches. As leaders, it's critical that we understand that equity is the path to equality and be willing to do things differently to achieve real diversity.

51,"To Be a Real Ally, You Need to Support Black Employees Beyond Juneteenth. Here's How.","Jun 15, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-support-black-employees-during-and-after-juneteenth/452410,"
For Black and brown folks, Juneteenth has long been of great significance and for many is considered the true day of emancipation of enslaved African Americans. Many have celebrated this holiday and honored the real racial history for some time. For white folks, this was something many likely learned in the summer of 2020 or are just now learning about as it hits the news cycle more and more.Much like Earth Day, Black History Month, Women's History Month, Equal Pay Day and other similar holidays, many companies and entrepreneurs will acknowledge and celebrate Juneteenth but then forget about doing any work toward the same goals afterward. Especially as it's a relatively new holiday celebration, many may not even plan to acknowledge it to begin with. It is critical to implement a long-term commitment to elevating Black voices as an ally beyond just June 19th every year.If you're one of the 9% of organizations that has Juneteenth as a paid holiday, this is the time to reflect and take real action. This is how successful organizations have implemented programs that support Black communities year-round:



Effective mentorship programs or accelerator programs for Black employeesPaid leadership positions for Black Employee Resource Group (ERG) leaders with a budget for the ERG outside of Black History Month and JuneteenthSet measurable goals to boost Black leadership representationRelated: Beyond Marketing — How Brands Can Truly Support the Black Community on JuneteenthEffective mentorship programs or accelerator programs for Black employeesA critical systemic issue facing Black employees is a lack of representation in leadership. When leaders that are majority white men make decisions about who to promote, they often don't have strong relationships with Black employees. This lack of exposure creates a self-fulfilling bias that Black employees don't want to be promoted or that they are not as talented. Skin color does not dictate motivation or talent, access to resources and support does.


DoorDash's Elevate program is a career accelerator designed specifically for high-potential women of color. As a part of Elevate, they complete a six-month cohort experience, including:One-on-one coaching sessions with an external executive coachExecutive sponsor meetings with company directors and C-suite membersCareer workshopsAttendance at leadership team meetingsThe results are impressive with 38% of leaders being promoted within six months of completion. What's interesting about this case study is that it includes coaching, mentorship, training and sponsorship. It's a holistic approach to developing talent — and quickly. This is important because when organizations create space for meaningful interaction between senior leaders and aspiring high-potential talent, biases are negated and relationships flourish, leading to higher promotion rates of often overlooked top talent.Paid leadership positionsMcKinsey & Co. reported that 90% of Fortune 500 companies have ERGs. Most commonly for women and people of color, ERGs exist to create safe places for marginalized groups to connect, learn and grow. The challenge is that most ERG leaders also have day jobs, where they're doing the ERG work in their ""free time."" McKinsey further shows a 24% improvement in the perception of inclusion when they people are a part of an effective ERG. If ERG work is important, people should be paid for it, or at a minimum have job duties removed to make time for the extra work.Consider compensating people for these activities:


Planning and organizing ERG events: ERG leaders often spend time brainstorming, coordinating and executing events, workshops, panel discussions and other initiatives aimed at promoting DEI and fostering an inclusive workplace culture.Building partnerships and networks: ERG leaders may spend time establishing connections and partnerships with external organizations, community groups or industry networks to collaborate on DEI-related initiatives, share best practices and amplify their impact.Training and education: ERG leaders might engage in ongoing education themselves and support the professional development of their ERG members. They may research and share resources, organize training sessions or invite guest speakers to enhance awareness and understanding of DEI issues.LinkedIn announced it would pay Employee Resource Group (ERG) Leaders a $10,000 monetary compensation for each year served starting in 2021. While not all businesses can afford to pay their employees for this extra work, clearing their workload to free up time for the tasks to manage an ERG or giving them additional time off or rewarding them in their performance reviews are also options. This is important because if ERG work is a priority it should be prioritized similarly to any other business imperative.Set measurable goals to boost Black leadership representationWith representation numbers stagnant for Black leaders and organizations, it's critical that organizations target improving this representation. Without an intentional, consistent commitment to diversity, the status quo often prevails. Leaders rely on outdated decision-making styles that tend to favor the majority group in hiring, promotion and pay decisions. Rather than focusing on hiring diverse talent, often that talent already exists in your organization. The key is unlocking that talent.As part of Kellogg Co.'s environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy, the company set goals for 50/50 gender parity at the management level globally, and in the U.S., 25% racially underrepresented talent at the management level — both by the end of 2025. They have since measured their representation numbers and report them publically for accountability.Rather than simply honoring Juneteenth as a holiday, organizations that take a more comprehensive and systemic approach demonstrate real allyship. The real action is year-round with mentorship programs, paid leadership positions for ERG leaders and representation targets for Black leadership being critical to long-term success. By implementing these strategies and maintaining a long-term commitment to elevating Black voices, organizations can drive meaningful and lasting change in their workplace cultures.

""It is our duty to create a benevolent niche for everybody."" These words from sociologist Judy Singer have always been an inspiration to me. It is estimated that about 15 to 20% of the U.S. population is neurodivergent, meaning they have brain differences that give them unique strengths and challenges. Incorporating these individuals into your business can allow you to benefit from their incredible gifts.Employers should consider the impact of the unique skills neurodivergent employees bring to the table and find ways to welcome them into the fold. Here's how:Related: How Leaders Can Support and Embrace The Untapped Potential of Neurodiverse Talent



Identify the minds that could benefit your business, not the rolesI knew I had the opportunity to write this article two weeks ago. And I've definitely written it, as you can see — after I'd rewritten it ... and rewritten it — all while voraciously consuming every business-meets-neurodiversity think piece I could, before diving deeply into academia from 19th-century medical journals to modern peer-reviewed papers. Did I mention that I have ADHD? For me, it's hard to get going and even harder to stop.Fortunately, I've built a career that works with my brain rather than against it. It helps that I invented the job for myself. As CCO and co-founder of Madwell, I have strived to create an environment that offers a safe space for all sorts of minds.


For a business to benefit from the power of neurodiversity, it requires more than declaring a commitment to the idea in general and the availability of noise-canceling headphones. It should not be confused with a commitment to hiring neurodivergent individuals, which is commendable and enriching. Successfully harnessing neurodiversity means mapping out the types of minds you need (not just the roles) and systems to allow such unique thought patterns and skill sets to harmonize even if they don't all vibrate on the same frequencies. We're taught as entrepreneurs to search for efficiency. Well, building a workforce around neurodiversity is highly inefficient unless you're searching for efficiency in neurodiversity.Establish an inclusive hiring processThe term neurodiversity has become increasingly trendy within business consulting circles with applicable, buyable frameworks available for a proper consulting contract. This was not what Australian sociologist Judy Singer had in mind when she coined the phrase in her '98 thesis. The goal was to give a name to the immutable fact that there is no normal, that all human brains are unique, and start a public discourse to benefit neurominorities.People learn and process information in different ways. By establishing an inclusive work environment that begins with the hiring process, prospective employees can feel free and safe to share their strengths and interests from the onset, allowing the employer to better understand the value that they can bring. Neurodiversity applies to all of us and our unique brains. People diagnosed with conditions such as ADHD or autism are often worried about self-identifying due to widespread misconceptions about their abilities to perform. The challenge for employers is to figure out how a combination of diverse minds can fit together. Find ways to make it known that your company welcomes neurodivergent employees on your website and in the job postings themselves, but remember that we ALL work differently.Realize that conformance does not equal performanceAssemble an environment that is filled with vastly different types of thinkers, and let them collaborate. In the strictest sense, since every brain is different, most people will not be right for your company. But you'll benefit disproportionately if you embrace each unique brain to the mutual benefit of employee and employer. I suppose this should be called ""institutionalized nonconformance."" Our company comprises so many backgrounds, it seems like a mistake. It is not.


What has bound us together over the years isn't this set of disparate backgrounds, but the brains running in the background. If you're thriving at our company, you've likely known what it's like to work (or live) in an environment that would like you to be less … different. But it is precisely our differences that make the difference. We recognize that our employees all work in different ways, and we give them the space to do so. The results speak for themselves.Related: 5 Steps to Building a Supportive and Inclusive Workplace for Neurodiverse EmployeesWe shouldn't be able to architect an entire building while writing and designing a national billboard campaign, constructing an 8-ft crocodile sculpture, running a highly targeted performance marketing campaign and creating a 16-ft wide interactive art installation. But we can. Because conformance does not equal performance.Every business can harness this same power by seeking out neurodiverse individuals and creating a welcoming space for them once they're hired. By helping them achieve their full potential, they will help your company achieve its full potential as well.

""The age of AI has begun,"" Bill Gates declared this March, reflecting on an OpenAI demonstration of feats such as acing an AP Bio exam and giving a thoughtful, touching answer to being asked what it would do if it were the father of a sick child.At the same time, tech giants like Microsoft and Google have been locked in a race to develop AI tech, integrate it into their existing ecosystems and dominate the market. In February, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella challenged Sundar Pichai of Google to ""come out and dance"" in the AI battlefield.For businesses, it's a challenge to keep up. On the one hand, AI promises to streamline workflows, automate tedious tasks and increased overall productivity. Conversely, the AI sphere is fast-paced, with new tools constantly appearing. Where should they place their bets to stay ahead of the curve?



And now, many tech experts are backpedaling. Leaders like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Tesla's Elon Musk, alongside 1,300 other industry experts, professors and AI luminaries, all signed an open letter calling to halt AI development for six months.At the same time, the ""godfather of AI,"" Geoffrey Hinton, resigned as one of Google's lead AI researchers and wrote a New York Times op-ed warning of the technology he'd helped create.


Even ChatGPT's Sam Altman joined in the chorus of warning voices during a Congress hearing.But what are these warnings about? Why do tech experts say that AI could actually pose a threat to businesses — and even humanity?Here is a closer look at their warnings.Uncertain liabilityTo begin with, there is a very business-focused concern. Liability.


While AIs have developed amazing capabilities, they are far from faultless. ChatGPT, for instance, famously invented scientific references in a paper it helped write.Consequently, the question of liability arises. If a business uses AI to complete a task and gives a client erroneous information, who is liable for damages? The business? The AI provider?None of that is clear right now. And traditional business insurance fails to cover AI-related liabilities.Regulators and insurers are struggling to catch up. Only recently, the EU drafted a framework to regulate AI liability.Related: Rein in the AI Revolution Through the Power of Legal LiabilityLarge-scale data theftAnother concern is linked to unauthorized data use and cybersecurity threats. AI systems frequently store and handle large amounts of sensitive information, much of it collected in legal gray areas.This could make them attractive targets for cyberattacks.""In the absence of robust privacy regulations (US) or adequate, timely enforcement of existing laws (EU), businesses have a tendency to collect as much data as they possibly can,"" explained Merve Hickok, Chair & Research Director at Center for AI and Digital Policy, in an interview with The Cyber Express.


""AI systems tend to connect previously disparate datasets,"" Hickok continued. ""This means that data breaches can result in exposure of more granular data and can create even more serious harm.""MisinformationNext up, bad actors are turning to AI to generate misinformation. Not only can this have serious ramifications for political figures, especially with an election year looming. It can also cause direct damage to businesses.Whether targeted or accidental, misinformation is already rampant online. AI will likely drive up the volume and make it harder to spot.AI-generated photos of business leaders, audio mimicking a politician's voice and artificial news anchors announcing convincing economic news. Business decisions triggered by such fake information could have disastrous consequences.


Related: Pope Francis Didn't Really Wear A White Puffer Coat. But It Won't Be the Last Time You're Fooled By an AI-Generated Image.Demotivated and less creative team membersEntrepreneurs are also debating how AI will affect the psyche of individual members of the workforce.""Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?"" the open letter asks.According to Matt Cronin, the U.S. Department of Justice's National Security & Cybercrime Coordinator, the answer is a clear ""No."" Such a large-scale replacement would devastate the motivation and creativity of people in the workforce.


""Mastering a domain and deeply understanding a topic takes significant time and effort,"" he writes in The Hill. ""For the first time in history, an entire generation can skip this process and still progress in school and work. However, reliance on generative AI comes with a hidden price. You are not truly learning — at least not in a way that meaningfully benefits you.""Ultimately, widespread AI use may lower team members' competence, including critical thinking skills.Related: AI Can Replace (Some) Jobs — But It Can't Replace Human Connection. Here's Why.Economic and political instabilityWhat economic shifts widespread AI adoption will cause are unknown, but they will likely be large and fast. After all, a recent Goldman Sachs estimate projected that two-thirds of current occupations could be partially or fully automated, with opaque ramifications for individual businesses.


According to experts' more pessimistic outlooks, AI could also incite political instability. This could range from election tampering to truly apocalyptic scenarios.In an op-ed in Time Magazine, decision theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky called for a general halt to AI development. He and others argue that we are unprepared for powerful AIs and that unfettered development could lead to catastrophe.ConclusionAI tools hold immense potential to increase businesses' productivity and level up their success.However, it's crucial to be aware of the danger that AI systems pose, not just according to doomsayers and techno-skeptics, but according to the very same people who developed these technologies.


That awareness will help infuse businesses' AI approach with a caution critical to successful adaptation.

54,Boomers vs. Millennials? How to Broker Peace Between Generations in the Workplace,"Jun 12, 2023",Andrej Jonovic,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/boomers-vs-gen-z-how-to-create-peace-between-generations/453001,"
If we are ever to hope for a workable solution to intergenerational tension in the workplace, it is incumbent on leaders and managers to first get our analysis right. The reality is that younger generations can be better at reading certain markets since they tend to constitute a large part of it, but older generations are more likely to spot a fad over secular change or societal pivot. Synthesize these points of view, and you have a perspective keyed into areas of potential growth buffered by realism and sustainability. What could go wrong?The workplace can be a microcosm of society, and on-the-job tensions are nothing new. However, in an age where we are defining more differences between people than ever before, we risk overstepping those boundaries. Politics has also permeated America to such an extent that people are being led to believe that there are only two kinds of thinking: Blue or red. Healthy arguments have given way to a lot of noise.None of this is fertile ground for peace at work, let alone peace in our time. But there is a way to bridge the generation gap between digital natives and their older colleagues. If we understand each other and the crises that have shaped every cohort, each generation's beliefs and attitudes become more relatable and less adversarial. We would have common ground to build upon.



Related: How to Keep Workplace Relationships Drama-Free: Advice From Family-Run FranchisesIdentifying intergenerational tensionsMismatched expectations create different views on what is appropriate, what is inappropriate, and the value and meaning of work itself. Conflict between generations then tends to crystalize around interpersonal interactions and results in lazy stereotypes. So many expectations that drive intergenerational tensions — such as ambition, work-life balance, and socioeconomic structure — are subjective, so it can be hard to address the root cause.


It helps to understand that employee attitudes are molded early in their careers, so each new generation receives an abundance of information on how to operate in the workplace, but how they receive it is informed by the challenges unique to each era. For context, Boomers arrived in the workforce with a certain degree of stability that is foreign to Millennial workers, who have known nothing but change. Meanwhile, Gen Z entered the workforce in the midst of the pandemic, which presented unprecedented circumstances for all employees.This disparity is apparent when processes are updated in the workplace. Each generation has had different conditioning in response to change, so divergent attitudes can cause disagreement and misunderstanding. But brokering peace requires that we go even deeper into the changes that created a whole new set of expectations for the different age demographics.Related: 4 Ways To Overcome Age-Related Tension In The OfficeGetting to the root causeEvery generation that has entered the workforce has faced at least one major crisis that shaped their values and affected the way they work and live. It's a sobering thought, but the newest generation may not have even met their crisis yet. The pandemic drastically shifted the face of work, and for those new to the workforce, the post-COVID world bears little resemblance to the relative predictability enjoyed by those born between 1946 and 1964.


Boomers themselves were shaped by existential uncertainties, like the Cold War, the Vietnam War, or the civil rights movement. For newer generations, the growth of remote work accelerated by pandemic restrictions has denied them the opportunity to assimilate workplace norms by coming into the office. In one striking case reported by The New York Times, a young worker resorted to ""stalking"" Glassdoor reviews of her own company to learn about its culture.It makes sense that being met with remote interactions in a fast-paced, ever-changing environment in the early stages of one's career would significantly affect a young worker's career mobility and attitude towards their employer. It also makes sense that older generations equate experience with authority. Getting to the bottom of each generation's core beliefs offers the foundation for how to work with these differences.Related: 3 Ways Technology Influences Generational Divides At WorkHow to forge the path to peaceThe problem with workplaces is that they are not always meritocracies. There are politics, shifting priorities, and the natural churn of talent or mobility. All of that can result in intergenerational tensions being put low on the priority list. Depending on the industry, management, and even ownership structure, companies risk losing the necessary diversity of opinions and approaches if they are not addressed.


In an ideal world, we would always have a harmonious, peaceful, and efficient environment, but the existence of tensions themselves is not inherently negative. In creative industries, we are familiar with competing ideas begetting innovation, yet competing viewpoints and even worldviews have the potential to create greater empathy and understanding if harnessed correctly.When an employee is having issues, understanding what their ""crisis"" may have been can provide insight into the kind of coaching and assistance they may need or how to help adjust to the workplace dynamics they may have missed. Management can also provide opportunities for the generations to get to know each other in a collaborative environment. It shouldn't be such a stretch to cultivate mutual respect because no one has been left untouched by the changes to the face of work.Related: 'They Think They're Better Than You': 74% of Managers Surveyed Say Gen Z Is More Difficult to Work With Than Other GenerationsFrom binary to complementary: Working togetherAs managers and leaders, we must bring all people under our care into greater harmony — for everybody's sake and for the business. If we are open-minded, objective, and willing to disarm tensions rooted in generational camps, we stand to gain from age-diverse teams. When members of intergenerational teams are encouraged to share and learn from their differences, decision-making, collaboration, and performance all improve.


With fewer younger workers entering the workforce due to changing demographics and the spate of early retirements during the pandemic, ensuring that the skill sets of each generation are treated as complementary is vital to maintaining operational efficiency. The solution to intergenerational tensions is getting our diagnosis right at the outset so we can work towards facing the next inevitable change or crisis together.

55,How to Foster True Inclusion in Your Business,"May 30, 2023",Miriam Lewis,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-foster-true-inclusion-in-your-business/449750,"
As a chief inclusion officer, I'm often asked why diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) matters for business.The business case for DEI has been proven with countless studies showing its potential to increase morale, customer reach, and profit. According to McKinsey, the most diverse companies are now more likely than ever to outperform less diverse peers on profitability.But benefits to a business's bottom line don't just happen by hiring diverse workers; they're seen when every employee feels a sense of belonging. That includes seeing themselves in your company policies and beliefs, as well as benefits offerings and daily practices.



Diversity, equity, and inclusion cannot live in a vacuum. The success of one depends on the success of all three.Here are steps you can take to build true inclusion in your business today.


1. Cultivate an environment in which employees feel safe, valued, and heard.We know diversity of thought leads to innovative ideas and better outcomes and solutions for customers. If it feels tricky to have much diversity when your business has a small number of employees, expand your perspective of what diversity is. Beyond race and gender, this could also be generation, family status, religious beliefs, differing abilities, veteran status, and sexual orientation.Having some mix of worldviews and backgrounds (whatever that looks like for your business) can make for a stronger workforce. But it won't go as far if employees don't feel supported to share those unique perspectives—and trust that they'll be heard, considered, and potentially implemented.We show people that they matter through our actions and words—as simple as caring about them and their loved ones and acknowledging their presence. Trust and open communication also go a long way. Ask for perspectives and suggestions for improvement. Demonstrate employees' value through verbal recognition, incentives, and stretch projects.Perhaps most importantly: Ensure psychological safety through formal anti-discrimination and harassment policies and training. The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) has resources that can help.


2. Evaluate if your benefits and policies meet the needs of a diverse workforce.This starts with listening to employees to understand their needs.For example, beyond traditional benefits like retirement plans and disability and life insurance, small and midsize business owners are providing additional benefits in response to their unique workforce's needs. This includes childcare benefits, paid family and medical leave, and employee assistance programs (EAPs), according to the Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM.1I encourage you to go a step further to ensure that the details of your workplace benefits are also truly beneficial to all employees. For example, do you have employees in same-sex partnerships whose families could benefit from medical coverage?Offering flexibility—however that looks for your business—is also a powerful tool.


Then consider your workplace policies. Take your dress code for example: Does it allow for religious head coverings? Even if your general policy is ""no hats,"" you can note that religious accommodation requests are available. You can also proactively let employees know they are empowered to follow the dress code in a manner consistent with their gender identity or gender expression, to name a couple of ideas.Everyone deserves to feel like they belong at work. As you continue your efforts toward a more inclusive environment, emphasize the ""and"" in diversity, equity, and inclusion by carving out time and effort to advance all three.Get timely ideas from businesses like yours.The subject matter in this communication is educational only and provided with the understanding that Principal® is not rendering legal, accounting, investment or tax advice.

56,A Woman Co-founder's Guide to Empowering Women in the Workplace and Advocating for Gender Equality,"May 29, 2023",Durana Elmi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-strategies-to-empower-women-in-the-workplace/451992,"
In today's competitive business landscape, diversity and inclusion are more important than ever. Why? A diverse workforce fosters innovation and creativity, contributing to a more equitable and inclusive society while also allowing your business to pivot and remain flexible in a constantly changing environment.As co-founder and chief innovation officer at Cymbiotika, I'm proud to be a leader in this effort and I've made it my mission to empower the women on our team and advocate for gender equality. Using these strategies at my own company has helped create a work environment that empowers our women team members to lead more successful lives, both personally and professionally. Adding them to your own business's strategies can help you do the same.Related: 3 Ways to Empower and Inspire the Next Generation of Women Leaders



1. Nurture growth and development through mentorshipNurturing my team's growth and development — particularly the incredible women among us — is a responsibility I not only wholeheartedly embrace but also take very seriously. Mentorship uplifts and empowers women, helps them better recognize their own innate power and potential, guides them to tap into their unique strengths to reach their career goals and develops them into confident leaders who are ready to inspire others, creating a cycle that brings us closer to a more equitable future.Have you had a mentor who supported you in your growth as a business leader? Maybe you have one today. Mentoring holds a profoundly significant place in my own personal and professional development.


Note your own personal mentoring style and get to know the benefits of that style (and any potential disadvantages). My personal mentoring style is gentle, as my goal is to provide guidance, encouragement, and advice to help my mentees more gracefully navigate the incredible variety of challenges and opportunities they are likely to encounter in the workplace. If you are also dedicated to creating a nurturing environment where women can grow and thrive, providing mentorship opportunities to your team is the best place to start.2. Foster growth through connectionsWe all need a safe haven to share stories and connect on a deeper level. Workshops and other team-building events and gatherings are a great way to bring women together and help cultivate a culture of trust, inclusivity and empathy so that women can uncover their common ground, connect and develop deep and meaningful relationships with people they otherwise might not have had the opportunity to meet.In addition to helping women bond with their teammates and build camaraderie, these uplifting workshops and events also serve as a vibrant platform for personal and professional growth, and participation in these activities presents women with a golden opportunity to develop new skills, broaden their networks and inspire one another by sharing valuable life lessons.3. Cultivate a culture of support and inclusivityThere is immense value in providing women with opportunities to develop their talents and skillsets by making internal hiring and growth a priority. A more inclusive environment helps ensure all employees that they are valued, respected and genuinely supported.


Encourage open communication and collaboration among team members to foster a warm and uplifting environment. By investing in the professional development of your employees and equipping them with the necessary resources and opportunities to enhance their skills and knowledge, such as training programs, workshops and seminars, employees will not only see your company's commitment to their success, but they are also more likely to achieve their full potential.Related: Don't Just Sit At the Table, Flip It. A Reflection for Women Entrepreneurs.4. Become a champion for equality and social changeAs a business owner, you have a powerful platform to promote policies that support women's rights. What are you passionate about? Your passion can help guide you toward meaningful initiatives for both your organization and you personally to support.For example, I'm a passionate advocate for promoting women's leadership, and I demonstrate that passion in tangible ways by supporting policies that enhance women's health and wellness, such as Helping Hands for Afghans, a nonprofit agency I founded that benefits Afghan refugees as they resettle into their new lives. Through advocacy and philanthropic work, my company becomes a more supportive and inclusive environment for women to achieve their goals.


Investing in your team and creating a more supportive and inclusive environment for women gives them room to grow and achieve goals both in and out of the work environment. By championing policies that promote gender equality and using your platform to raise awareness about crucial issues, you can help contribute toward a more equitable and just society.Making mentorship, professional development opportunities and advocacy a part of your business's culture is the key to empowering women — or any other historically disadvantaged or underrepresented group — in the workforce.What change can you make today to make your business a more inclusive and empowering place to be?

57,Companies Aren't Talking About Black Vernacular and Dialect Bias in The Workplace. Here's Why That Needs to Change.,"May 26, 2023",Nika White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/we-need-to-talk-about-black-vernacular-and-dialect-bias-in/449852,"
African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), also known as Black Vernacular English (BVA) or ebonics, is a historic American English dialect that millions of people speak. It's a part of our cultural DNA and is a blend of words and ways of speaking rooted in various African cultures as well as the English spoken in Southern U.S. states, with additional contributions from Creole.This way of speaking has long had negative connotations associated with it. People who speak AAVE are often seen as uneducated and not a cultural fit in workplaces managed by the dominant culture. Many Black people are penalized for a way of speaking that's deeply rooted in this country and yet, despite their education, accomplishments and accolades, speaking AAVE can significantly diminish their professional prospects.This shouldn't be the case. Speaking a different dialect should not negate the professional impact, skills and value that a worker brings. Companies that claim to support diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) while simultaneously discriminating against language or dialect should reconsider their stance on the topic.



I am working to change that. I help organizations break barriers and integrate DEIB into their business frameworks with a human-centered approach. I will share how organizations like yours can be more conscious about language and dialect bias to do better on their DEI and inclusion goals.Hire for a culture ""add,"" not a culture ""fit""Many individuals who speak AAVE are often dismissed in the job interview process because they don't seem like a good cultural ""fit."" I've discussed the dangers of hiring for culture fit before, but it's worth noting that language or dialect should not invalidate a person's ability to contribute, add value or participate in work life.


Instead of assuming the status quo is the ideal culture in the company, consider the very real possibility that having folks who speak AAVE or another dialect or language on the team can truly ""add"" to the company culture. For example, perhaps someone speaking AAVE can bring a new perspective to company projects or dialogues. Or perhaps they can connect with diverse partners and stakeholders in a way that the dominant culture hasn't previously found successful. Think outside the box about how someone's language or dialect can actually enhance your company culture instead of ""fit"" into it.Related: Avoiding the Sea of Sameness: How Hiring for Culture Improves DEINever judge a book by its coverAlthough people who speak AAVE are often described as ""ghetto,"" ""loud,"" or ""aggressive,"" it's often a misconception. A prime example is Angel Reese, a Louisiana State University basketball player who has skyrocketed in popularity in recent weeks. She's had to face dialect and gender bias in the public eye.Angel said, ""I'm too hood. I'm too ghetto. I don't fit the narrative and I'm ok with that. I'm from Baltimore where you hoop and talk trash. If I was a boy, y'all wouldn't be saying nun at all."" Angel was referring to a culture of basketball that has a double standard for women, specifically for women who speak like her. While some are considered ""ladylike"" in the sport, others are called something very different.


Apply this same logic to the workplace. If a worker doesn't speak exactly like another colleague who represents the norm of the workplace culture, will they still be accepted and feel a sense of belonging? Why should language or dialect stand in the way of someone belonging in the workplace or prevent them from getting hired at all?DEI extends beyond skin and gender. Dialect and language should not create a hostile atmosphere where Black workers are undervalued, demeaned or held down at lower rungs in the organization because of the way they speak.Related: Hire Like a Diversity Expert: 5 Key Qualities of Inclusive EmployeesBias against people who speak AAVE hurts organizations, tooDid you know the fastest-growing entrepreneurial demographic in the United States is Black women? Black women aren't waiting for organizations that exhibit bias in their company culture to accept them — they've moved on to building their own empires.


Organizations that consciously or unconsciously bias their employee pool based on the dialect of English the applicant speaks are losing out in the end. As mentioned, dialect does not equate to intelligence, talent or value. Choosing not to hire a qualified candidate because they speak AAVE only pushes them to take their talents elsewhere which can often leave organizations at a deficit in terms of intellect, innovation and growth.In this sense, bias not only hurts the person who experiences it, but it hurts organizations, too. This type of bias holds everyone back. So, why not remove the barrier to access, create more empathy and understanding of the various cultures that live within the United States, and see candidates through the lens of value, character and contribution?Related: 5 Qualities of Black Excellence Overlooked in the WorkplaceFinal thoughtsOrganizations are losing out every time they pass over a candidate that speaks a dialect of English that is not the cultural norm. Race, gender, ability and other identifiers are all seen as important parts of DEI that add to organizational growth and innovation. But why are dialect and language left out?


The people who experience some of the most bias are those who don't look or speak like those in the dominant culture. Sticking to the norm is not always the best or only way. I invite organizations to expand their definition of belonging and value and to create increased awareness around dialect bias.Human Resources and other groups involved in the hiring process and people management functions should put into place bias guardrails that push on hiring managers who may be discriminating against potential employees based on their dialect of English. The financial and cultural costs are too high to ignore. AAVE is English and should be valued and seen as such within institutions.

58,How to Leverage Employee and Business Resource Groups to Create a More Diverse and Inclusive Workplace,"May 26, 2023",Nish Parikh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-utilize-employee-resource-groups-for-a-more-diverse/452057,"
Employee resource groups (ERGs) and business resource groups (BRGs) are gaining in popularity in corporate America as companies seek ways to build, sustain and grow a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce. ERGs and BRGs can be valuable assets in improving diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring outcomes.Based on my experience working with several ERGs and BRGs over the years, I have compiled five ways companies can better engage these groups to achieve their DEI goals. I have added a relevant case study to each recommendation in order to further substantiate my observations and provide a practical approach to understanding and executing feasible solutions.Related: How to Utilize Employee Resource Groups and Cultivate Meaningful Impact in Your Workplace



1. Provide resources and supportOne effective way to engage ERGs and BRGs is to provide them with the necessary resources and support. This could include funding, training and access to company leaders and decision-makers. By investing in these groups, companies can help them achieve their goals while achieving better overall DEI hiring outcomes.Case study: Intel


Intel has about 40 ERGs and seven leadership councils that brought together more than 25,000 employees in 2021. Intel's ERGs are structured around race, national origin, sexual orientation and gender identity, parenthood, disabilities, education, faith and other common affinities. The organization encourages employees to join ERGs beyond their personal affinities to build relationships with a wider community. In addition, Intel has an Employee Inclusion Survey to gain a deeper understanding of how different employee populations experience inclusion at Intel, recognize opportunities for improvement and better understand the root causes of any systemic issues and how to address them. These initiatives demonstrate Intel's commitment to providing resources and support for its employees.2. Foster collaborationAnother way to engage ERGs and BRGs is to encourage collaboration between these groups and other company stakeholders such as HR, recruiters, hiring managers and employee development programs. This can help ensure that DEI goals are integrated into all aspects of the company's operations and policies.Case study: JPMorgan ChaseJPMorgan Chase's Advancing Black Pathways initiative is a collaborative effort to address systemic racism and provide economic empowerment for Black Americans. The program leverages the company's resources and partnerships to provide education, career development and access to capital for Black individuals and business owners. Advancing Black Pathways partners with other organizations to connect Black Americans with internships, jobs, mentorship programs and entrepreneurship opportunities. JPMorgan Chase also provides financial education and counseling to help individuals and families become financially stable. The initiative advances collaboration between JPMorgan Chase and its partner organizations to build a more equitable and inclusive society.


3. Encourage feedbackCompanies should encourage ERGs and BRGs to provide feedback on hiring processes and DEI initiatives. This feedback can help identify areas for improvement and guide future efforts.Case study: SalesforceSalesforce has a well-established ERG program called Trailhead that aims to provide a supportive and inclusive work environment. One example of this program is Salesforce's ""Ohana Groups,"" which are focused on building connections, offering mentoring opportunities and promoting diversity and inclusion among employees and allies. These groups are open to all employees and have a variety of focuses, such as gender, ethnicity, age and sexual orientation.Salesforce's ERGs play a vital role in the company's efforts to encourage feedback and improve employee engagement. These groups provide a forum for employees to share their experiences and ideas, give and receive feedback and participate in initiatives that promote DEI.


Related: 7 Ways Leaders Can Level Up Their DEI Workplace Strategy4. Engage employees and celebrate achievementsCompanies should invest in employee engagement and celebrate the achievements of ERGs and BRGs. This can include highlighting success stories, sharing best practices and providing opportunities for ERG and BRG members to highlight their work.Case study: IBMIBM's BRGs are employee-led groups focused on advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace while also celebrating successes small and big. They are designed to create a sense of community among employees, provide opportunities for growth and drive business results by leveraging diverse perspectives and ideas. The BRGs at IBM are open to all employees, and members have the opportunity to participate in a variety of activities and initiatives, including community outreach, career development programs and networking events. They have been recognized for their impact on employee engagement, success stories and business outcomes, and the company continues to invest in their development.


5. Build communitiesExtraordinary things happen when companies provide support to ERGs in creating communities that are built around the shared values and interests of equity and inclusivity. These communities offer a safe space for employees to share their voices, experiences and perspectives. By providing a platform for employees to come together and collaborate, ERGs and BRGs play a crucial role in fostering a sense of belonging and strengthening the company culture.Case study: MicrosoftMicrosoft's ERGs provide a platform for employees with shared values and interests to collaborate, build communities and drive business impact. They are open to all employees and include a diverse range of affinities and intersectionalities, including women, African Americans/Blacks, Latinx, LGBTQ+, veterans, parents and more.Microsoft's ERGs focus on building and growing communities by providing members with opportunities for personal and professional growth, community outreach and connection with other employees across the company. ERG members can participate in events, mentorship programs and leadership opportunities that help them grow their skills and expand their networks. Through community outreach initiatives, ERG members can give back to their local communities and make a positive impact on society beyond their workplace.


ERGs at Microsoft have made significant contributions to the company's culture and business success. For example, Microsoft's Black and African American ERG, Blacks at Microsoft (BAM), played a critical role in increasing the representation of Black employees at the company and in driving cultural awareness and education. Similarly, the company's Women at Microsoft (WAM) ERG has been instrumental in driving diversity and inclusion efforts across the company.Related: 3 Proven Ways to Hire (and Keep) Diverse TalentIn conclusion, ERGs and BRGs can play a critical role in advancing DEI hiring outcomes and creating a more inclusive and equitable work environment. Companies can better engage these groups by providing resources and support, fostering collaboration, encouraging feedback, engaging employees, celebrating achievements and building communities. The case studies highlighted in this post demonstrate practical approaches to leveraging ERGs and BRGs to achieve DEI hiring goals and create a more diverse and inclusive workforce. By investing in these groups and their members, companies can build a stronger culture of inclusion and drive positive, sustainable and scalable business results.

59,How Women Are Innovating and Shaping the Tech Landscape — and How Men Can Support Them,"May 25, 2023",Barak Jacques,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-men-can-actually-elevate-and-support-women-in-tech/449802,"
Despite the tech industry's historic male domination, a rising wave of successful women is reshaping the sector. Encouraging this trend is vital; it promotes diversity, spurs innovation and inspires future female leaders. Acknowledging these women's achievements, offering support to aspiring females and dismantling systemic barriers are key to a balanced future in tech.As we seek to create a more equitable future, it is essential to recognize and celebrate the achievements of these trailblazing women, provide resources and support for aspiring female tech professionals and address the systemic barriers that have hindered gender diversity in the industry.Related: 5 Pieces of Advice for Women Trying to Navigate Male-Dominated Waters



The current landscape of women in techStatistics consistently reveal the underrepresentation of women in the tech industry. For instance, women hold only 28% of computing and mathematical jobs in the U.S. as of 2022, with even lower numbers at the executive level. These disparities exist for various reasons, including prevailing gender stereotypes, unconscious biases and systemic barriers that impede women's progress in the field.Despite comprising 47% of the U.S. workforce and 74% of young girls expressing interest in STEM fields, women represent only 28% of the tech industry workforce, as per 2022 statistics. This underscores the systemic issues and biases that curtail women's progress in tech, thereby stifling industry innovation. The positive impact of gender diversity on technology and innovation is well-documented. Research suggests that diverse gender representation boosts innovation and financial success in companies, making the inclusion of women in tech crucial for industry prosperity.


Trailblazing women in tech: Profiles and achievementsNumerous women have made significant contributions to the tech industry. Among them, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's COO, is particularly notable for challenging norms and inspiring others. Her best-selling book, Lean In, encourages women to pursue their ambitions and defy societal expectations.Another notable figure is Ginni Rometty, IBM's first female CEO from 2012 to 2020. Under her leadership, IBM shifted its focus to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, driving its innovation and growth.Fei-Fei Li, a renowned artificial intelligence researcher and professor at Stanford University, has also made visionary contributions to AI. As the co-founder of AI4ALL, she actively works to increase diversity and inclusion in artificial intelligence by providing educational opportunities to underrepresented groups.These women represent just a pinch of the many female pioneers who have impacted the industry and continue to inspire others through their achievements. But we must recall that the job is still far from being done.


Related: Why Gender Diversity In Tech MattersInitiatives and programs supporting women in techGroups like Girls Who Code, Women in Technology International and the National Center for Women and Information Technology promote gender diversity in tech through mentorship, scholarships and networking opportunities. Women's inclusion in tech is crucial for innovation, especially during days of advancements like GPT-4. These groups play a crucial role in tackling the underrepresentation of women in tech, providing resources and guidance that empower them to thrive. They also help dismantle stereotypes and biases impeding women's advancement.Female-founded startups: A silver liningIt's not all doom and gloom. In fact, the tech industry has witnessed a heartening shift in women's representation in recent years, with the percentage of female-founded startups rising from 9.5% in 2014 to 21.6% in 2021. This impressive growth marks a new chapter of women shattering barriers and spearheading innovative ventures, a testament to their determination and resilience in overcoming challenges. However, the decline in these numbers from 2021 to 2023 underlines the need to persistently champion gender diversity and foster inclusivity.Nurturing gender equality in tech entrepreneurshipAs a male entrepreneur operating in the tech sector, I recognize the importance of my role in challenging prevailing biases and working toward gender equality. My experiences have taught me that, as leaders, we have the power and responsibility to create a shift toward more inclusive and equitable workplaces.


Here are my insights and suggestions for my fellow entrepreneurs:Firstly, prioritize and value diversity, particularly by actively including more women in your teams. It's well-documented that diverse groups, especially those with a good balance of men and women, bring rich perspectives that fuel innovation. Actively advocating for diversity, specifically gender diversity, can also lead to tangible benefits for your company. Studies have demonstrated that diverse teams are more effective at problem-solving and making better decisions. So, consciously foster diversity in your team, ensuring that every voice is heard and valued.Secondly, prioritize establishing a nurturing work environment — the transition from merely being a boss to taking on the role of a mentor. Try to share your experiences, extend guidance and offer support when needed. Studies have shown that such an environment not only fosters trust but also boosts your team members' satisfaction and empowerment levels, thereby leading to increased productivity and company growth.Thirdly, foster a culture of open dialogue and ensure that your team members can freely express their views and concerns. According to a recent 2020 study, creating an environment conducive to open dialogue significantly increases women's chances of being promoted at work. This transparent communication culture addresses gender-related issues effectively and enhances the potential for women to rise to managerial positions. In essence, a listening environment can amplify the effectiveness of many strategies to enable women to attain leadership roles by facilitating open discussions at all organizational levels.


Lastly, embody your principles through action. Demonstrate your commitment to gender equality through your decisions and daily interactions. Influence fellow entrepreneurs to adopt similar measures, and together, let's echo the message of equality and inclusion across the tech industry.Related: 70% of Male Leaders Believe This Industry Is Inclusive — But Most Female Leaders Disagree.Envisioning a future with equal representationAs male leaders in tech, our influence on gender equality is substantial. We must strive towards a balanced future by fostering diversity, establishing supportive environments and encouraging open dialogue. We all have mothers, sisters, daughters or wives we deeply care for. We should foster a world where their accomplishments are determined by talent, not gender. It's our shared duty to challenge norms, tackle biases and promote equality in tech, enabling them to break barriers and pave the way for a gender-neutral future.

60,Uber Suspends Its Diversity Chief After 'Don't Call Me Karen' Session Elicits Outrage,"May 23, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/uber-suspends-its-diversity-chief-after-karen-session/452704,"
Uber's diversity chief is on leave from the company following employee backlash over an internal event she moderated, dubbed ""Don't Call Me Karen.""Head of diversity Bo Young Lee, who was in charge of a series of discussions about race and the experiences of underrepresented groups called ""Moving Forward,"" was asked to take a step back as the company figures out its next move, The New York Times reported.Related: Uber Drivers: These Are the Worst Thing Passengers Do



Employee criticism stemmed from two events. Last month, a panel titled ""Don't Call Me Karen"" focused on the experiences of a few white women leaders and why the slang moniker ""Karen"" — which generally refers to white women with a sense of entitlement, often to the detriment of people of color — is a hurtful word.Employees felt the conversation ignored the harm such people inflict on people of color; in the second event, a follow-up listening session last week where employees expected to have more of a dialogue, Lee apparently disregarded those concerns, according to The Times.


The controversy was a rare occasion of employee discord under Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who assumed the position in 2017 after a slew of PR nightmares for the company surrounding Uber's co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick. In 2019, Uber reached a $4.4 million settlement with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over sexual discrimination charges, per CNN Business.Related: Report: Uber, Lyft Drivers Face Suspensions, DiscriminationPer the Times, one employee felt Uber's decision to suspend Lee was the right one, writing, ""[They've] heard us, they know we are hurting, and they want to understand what all happened too.""

61,Women Are Being Pushed Off the Edge of the Glass Cliff. Here's What That Means and What to Do About It.,"May 23, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-the-glass-cliff-is-designed-to-hold-women-back-at-work/450769,"
You've probably heard of the glass ceiling when it comes to women in the workplace, but the ""glass cliff"" is just as harmful.Whereas the glass ceiling is a metaphor for the barrier women face in the workplace, the ""glass cliff"" builds on that idea — it's the phenomenon in which female executives are only given leadership roles in seemingly impossible situations like crises, economic collapses or negative public relations incidents. Women are seen as the right choice to clean up a mess, but not to lead when times are good. Even today, there are recent examples of this including Marissa Mayer's tenure at Yahoo, Jill Soltau's time overseeing the collapse of J.C. Penney, Peggy Johnson at Magic Leap and Heyward Donigan at Rite Aid.The glass cliff phenomenon is further backed by academic research:



Researchers at the University of Exeter found that women are more likely to be appointed as CEOs in companies that have performed poorly in the past, compared to men.Columbia Business School found that women are more likely to be appointed to leadership positions in companies that are in crisis, compared to men. The study also found that women are less likely to be appointed to leadership positions in companies that are performing well.McKinsey & Company consistently finds that women are underrepresented in leadership positions across industries, with only 38% of manager-level positions being held by women.These statistics demonstrate the existence of the glass cliff phenomenon, which can set women up for failure in leadership positions due to the difficult circumstances they are often appointed under.How do you spot a potential glass cliff situation and what do you do to prevent it from happening at your organization?Related: 6 Ways to Better Support Women in the WorkplacePay attention to when and how women are promotedMore often, women are promoted in situations that are less attractive to the majority group (often men). These could be situations where despite the best effort, chances of success are low.If women are promoted in roles that feel more challenging than the roles that men are often promoted into, you might have a problem. This is especially important for leaders to pay attention to and address. Keep your radar up for potential glass cliff situations and ask if this were a man, would we approach this the same way?Amplify the experiences of women in your networkOften, women are not given credit for their work equitably to men. Watch out for missed opportunities to give women leaders the credit they deserve for their good work. Make sure that their performance is incrementally rewarded with pay and promotional opportunities similar to men's. You can measure promotion rates of genders and see how it compares to industry standards. Most commonly women are promoted at 86% of the rate that men are promoted based on equal merit. McKinsey & Company calls this the ""broken rung.""


Set goals to increase the representation of women in leadershipOnce you're paying attention and measuring promotion rates, it's important to set goals — not quotas. Quotas can create a zero-sum game mentality where men feel like women are only promoted based on their gender. Goals create a win-win opportunity. As women advance, so do profitability and opportunities for all genders.Related: If You Want More Women in Leadership, You Have to Enact Concerted Change. Here's How.Develop objective leadership selection criteriaBegin by clearly defining the role you are hiring for, including the responsibilities, expectations and qualifications needed to succeed in the position. This will help you identify the specific skills and traits you are looking for in a candidate. Then, identify the key competencies that are essential for success in the role as well as performance indicators.Consider using validated assessments, such as personality tests or cognitive ability tests, to measure a candidate's abilities objectively. These assessments can provide insight into a candidate's strengths and weaknesses and help you make more informed hiring decisions. Be sure to review the criteria you have developed to ensure that they are fair, relevant and unbiased. Consider involving a diverse group of stakeholders in the review process to ensure that different perspectives are taken into account.


Ensure balanced interview and interviewee slatesFor any open leadership position, it is critical to have a sourcing strategy that ensures you are reaching a diverse pool of candidates. This may involve using job boards, social media, networking events, employee referrals and other channels to attract a wide range of applicants. Screen candidates objectively by using the objective selection criteria you have developed. This will help ensure that all candidates are evaluated based on the same set of standards rather than by outdated gender biases.Some organizations screen resumes to remove any identifying information, such as names, addresses and schools, to reduce the potential for bias in the hiring and promotion processes. Be sure to Interview a diverse slate of candidates and mirror diverse representation with interviewers to attract a range of perspectives and experiences.Remove systemic gender biasesThe maternal wall is the largest area of gender bias against women where people assume women are caregivers and men are providers. This results and decreased opportunities for women and often the prime years of their careers.Start by recognizing and addressing biases related to caregiving responsibilities, such as assuming that women are more likely to take time off for caregiving or that men are not interested in or capable of taking on caregiving responsibilities. While this gender stereotype may be true often, workplace dynamics and family roles are shifting.

62,The Developer Shortage Crisis Could Devastate The Tech Workforce. Here's Why (and How) Leaders Should Act Now.,"May 16, 2023",Leonardo Mattiazzi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/the-developer-shortage-crisis-could-devastate-the-tech/449732,"
If you work in technology, you've likely seen the headlines bemoaning the ongoing developer shortage. Demand for skilled developers has increased steadily over the last few years, but the supply has failed to keep up. The International Data Corporation (IDC) has predicted a global shortfall of four million developers by 2025. If we don't act now, the global talent shortage could result in approximately $8.5 trillion in unrealized annual revenues by 2030.So what can we do about it?Recently, I attended the SXSW festival in Austin and led a panel with industry leaders from Salesforce, Morgan Stanley and Estée Lauder to address this question. Throughout the conversation, it became clear that our solutions must go beyond establishing a more robust job fair at the top universities. To tackle the developer shortage, the entire industry must undergo a paradigm shift, prioritizing diversity, education and policy to realize change and secure the future of all tech-enabled businesses. ChatGPT will only take us so far.Tap into new pools of talentTech has primarily pulled candidates from the same finite talent pool for decades. The problem is that this pool does not reflect the diversity of the world around us. 62% of all tech workers are white, and 75% are male. Relying on this extremely limited and homogenous source of talent has put the industry in a bind. Companies are unable to fill open positions, yet, there are large groups of people who have been shut out of the industry. What would the developer shortage look like if we enlarged our talent pools to better include women, people of color, global workers, people with disabilities and formerly incarcerated people?



We cannot continue returning to the same empty pot and expect gold to suddenly appear. We cannot expect to find 4 million new developers by 2025 from the same pool.As leaders, we need to consider groups we may have dismissed due to old biases and ask ourselves, ""How can we tap into new pools of talent?""Related: 4 Reasons Low-Code Tools Will Never Replace Software DevelopersUtilize non-traditional methodsFostering a new generation of developers means organizations must implement non-traditional methods to identify and attract talent.First, look at your job descriptions — are they accessible to those with unconventional backgrounds? Do away with degree requirements and develop job descriptions that focus less on credentials and more on the skills necessary to succeed in the role. Furthermore, train hiring managers and recruiters to untangle their biases and identify transferable skills in a candidate's application.Skills can be taught, but passion and creativity are much harder to come by. One can typically upskill an employee in weeks or months, but changing someone's behavior will take years at best. Don't allow erroneous requirements like a four-year degree to get in the way of hiring someone who could bring a vital perspective to your team.


We should also consider how we can adapt our workflows to drive inclusion and belonging. For example, the prevalence of remote work has opened up many opportunities for those living with a physical disability. Pre-pandemic, many workplaces wouldn't consider an applicant if they couldn't come to the office. Moving forward, we must educate ourselves on other areas of our work that might be unwittingly exclusionary and adapt accordingly so all have the chance to contribute. It takes leadership and teams a lot of learning to properly include everyone.Related: How Software Developer Freelancers are Filling the Skill GapNurture the talent poolIf we only look for talent when we need them, we will likely default to old biases and hire the first developer that checks all our boxes. The onus is on organizations to actively build and nurture an expanded talent pool through education, training and support.Organizations must invest in STEM education outside the traditional and expensive four-year degree. What can we be doing as companies to expand access to tech education and accreditation? At Salesforce, they partner with schools to provide access to computers and coding classes to bring tech to students early in their learning journey. There are also programs like Microsoft's Accelerate, which provides free courses and resources to underserved communities to equip them with the necessary skills to participate in the tech sector.


Still, education alone is not enough. My company recently partnered with a non-profit and a higher education institution in Brazil to help underserved communities access tech jobs. Although these students had completed their computer science degree — while holding a full-time job in another area —many still didn't feel confident applying for a job in tech or even creating a Linkedin profile. We quickly realized it was essential to build a bridge from the hard skills learned in class to the soft skills they need to get a job, including networking, interviewing and seeking out opportunities. Gaining the credential is one thing, but if a person doesn't know how to use it in the job market, they won't get far.During the question portion of the panel, a student and young entrepreneur asked how companies can incentivize and publicize developer boot camps for young people. He suggested focusing on community-centered approaches — going into underserved communities and providing educational resources. We shouldn't expect people to come to us, we have to make the effort to reach out to them.It's on us to create holistic solutions along every step of the pipeline, providing the necessary structure, support, and emotional safety for marginalized groups to confidently apply for tech jobs.Related: Why Low-Code Platforms Are the Developer Shortage Solution People Aren't Talking About


Act as an ecosystemThere's a visibility gap, not a talent gap in the developer industry. Finding non-traditional and creative approaches to identify and evaluate talent is how we can help our companies see the talent they may think is lacking.We must find solutions that help foster and develop talent from its earliest stages and connect more into initiatives with nonprofit organizations working with underserved communities to create solutions that work for them and with them.Most importantly, we will all fail if we compete to develop talent. The challenge at hand requires us to scale and to scale properly. We must work together to build an ecosystem with partners across industries — even those we may consider competitors.

63,Why You Need a Diversity and Inclusion Expert to be Involved in the Layoff Decision-Making Process,"May 15, 2023",Jyl Feliciano,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-deib-teams-should-be-involved-in-layoff-decisions/450758,"
As layoffs sweep the tech industry, companies risk the reversal of years of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) progress almost overnight. Leaders have a responsibility — to their employees, their businesses, the industry, and society at large — to conduct layoffs equitably. I know this firsthand because last month, my company made the difficult decision to eliminate 10% of our roles, and as the company's DEIB lead, equity was my top concern. With a seat at the table, I was able to help coach decision-makers through the process and offer an equity-focused mindset as the conversations unfolded.With more than 77,000 tech employees laid off in 2023 already, this moment is a vital one for the companies that have invested in DEIB. Simply put, layoffs should not counteract DEIB progress — two steps forward and one step back is still moving backward on a critically important journey. But if DEIB isn't a part of these conversations, companies risk just that. It's more than losing DEIB practitioners and teams; the entire tech industry has a newly diversified workforce and fresh opportunities, such as better diverse leadership, at stake.Even so, the harsh reality is that most times, DEIB leaders don't have a seat at the table during these tough conversations. That's a major blunder, and it's one we're already seeing the consequences of as Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are dissolved and entire DEIB teams are let go — by some estimations, DEI roles had a nearly 40% attrition rate at companies that laid off employees, compared with a 24% churn rate for other types of roles.



The insights and tools that DEIB leaders provide are shock absorbers for the broader impact of a layoff. Many companies experience increased attrition in the wake of layoffs, for example, and DEIB leaders can help with preserving morale and retaining diverse talent long-term. Companies are remiss to underutilize this expertise. DEIB leaders are trusted collaborators at all stages of the process of carrying out equitable layoffs. From eliminating unconscious discrimination in the reorganization itself to facilitating new DEIB commitments, DEIB leaders can help.Related: The 7 Worst Mistakes Companies Make When Laying Off Employees


Eliminating bias and discrimination in reorganizationDEIB leaders' bread and butter is shining a light on the truths that are often overlooked in business decisions: We have a unique purview that enables us to offer meaningful perspective to leaders developing a role elimination process sans bias and to develop a framework that works for the business at that time. The earlier the DEIB leader is brought into the decision-making process, the better.For example, at my company, we mapped the current roles against business priorities to determine which to eliminate. Stripping these decisions of unconscious bias by removing names, tenure or other details about individual employees was central to this approach. Like many of my peers, I warn leaders about the risks of inadvertently eliminating roles in a way that creates a homogenous organization; if people aren't asking the right questions, looking at the right data or conducting adverse impact analyses, layoffs in the industry may eliminate large swaths of underrepresented workers: women, people reentering the workforce, veterans and BIPOC employees, to name a few groups.Improving transparency and supportDEIB leaders can help leaders communicate the news to employees empathetically, appropriately and transparently. Poorly written or delivered communications from executive leadership leave remaining employees sour and make departing employees feel unappreciated among the many other emotions that come with layoffs. Layoffs are unfortunate and heartbreaking; there's no other way to slice it. But internal communication is key, and handling the news delicately — for example, prioritizing one-on-one, face-to-face conversations and preserving team communication channels — can keep backlash and blows to culture to a minimum.Related: 8 Effective Tips for Conducting Layoffs


Facilitating support for departing employeesDEIB leaders are also experts in what types of benefits and support are important to the employees being let go (based on their roles, the market and the resources available) and can serve as a resource in operationalizing these initiatives. From determining appropriate severance timelines to offering outplacement services to allowing former employees to keep their company laptops, there are many considerations that other leaders may overlook.Preserving culture and progress — and re-committing to DEIBCompanies are in a tough spot when emotions following layoffs are still raw. How they manage this time can make or break company growth in the long run. Employees will look to leaders for transparency and accountability related to corporate diversity and so will job-seekers. The experiences that remaining and laid-off employees have after a workforce reduction speak volumes about the DEIB commitment level of the organization and help solidify its place in the talent market. DEIB leaders can help executive leadership make their commitments to diversity clear and facilitate re-commitments in the wake of layoffs.There's no ""one-size-fits-all"" way to do layoffs, but when companies have to, those that are facilitated transparently, equitably and as thoughtfully as possible are more likely to be set up for near- and long-term success. Companies need to preserve the efforts they've invested in, and DEIB practitioners are an asset for operationalizing and sustaining that in these difficult times.Related: 3 Things to Do When Layoffs Are Looming

64,The Great-Great-Granddaughter of the Long-Uncredited Man Who Taught Jack Daniel How to Make Whiskey Is Now the Award-Winning Master Blender at His Namesake Distillery,"May 10, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/her-great-great-grandfather-taught-jack-daniel-how-to/451032,"
Last month, from April 17-18, the Nearest & Jack Advancement Initiative hosted its inaugural Spirits on the Rise Summit — a two-day event connecting BIPOC businesspeople in spirits with industry leaders from historically underrepresented communities to accelerate their businesses.The first day of the event took place at the Jack Daniel's Distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee, and the second day at the Nearest Green Distillery in Shelbyville, Tennessee. Established on the former site of the historic Sand Creek Farms, the Nearest Green Distillery now sits on 432 acres and is home to the Humble Baron bar and restaurant, which boasts the longest bar in the world.Nearest Green Distillery is named for the formerly enslaved, long-uncredited man who taught Jack Daniel how to make whiskey when he was a boy. The distillery stands not only as a testament to the past but also to the future, with its commitment to the diverse spirits industry envisioned by Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey's CEO and founder Fawn Weaver, her husband Keith and the brand's many team members and supporters, which include Green's descendants.

Today, the Founder of Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey Carries on His Legacy.""This day is for those who need or desire a leg up,"" Victoria Eady Butler, Green's great-great-granddaughter and Uncle Nearest's master blender, says of the Spirits on the Rise Summit. ""People in the industry who look like me.""


With Eady Butler at the blending helm, Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey became the most-awarded American whiskey or bourbon of 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. What's more, Eady Butler became the first woman to win the Master Blender of the Year title at Whisky Magazine's American Icons of Whisky Awards in 2021 — and the first person to receive the honor for two consecutive years in 2022.Entrepreneur sat down with Eady Butler at the distillery's Barrel House II, where former horse stalls have been converted into booths for the second location of Chuck Baker's beloved BBQ restaurant, to learn about her unexpected road to master blender, what goes into crafting the perfect blend and how it feels to carry on her family's legacy.""I just couldn't say no to the opportunity to help continue my great-great-grandfather's legacy.""Despite being the great-great-granddaughter of the first-known Black distiller in the U.S., Eady Butler never set out to join the whiskey business.Some of Eady Butler's siblings continue to work at Jack Daniel's to this day; the ""beautiful relationship"" between Daniel and Green continued with their families over generations, Eady Butler says. But she was always set on a career in law enforcement.


As a young girl, she dreamed of becoming the police commissioner or working in hostage negotiations. Those aspirations inspired her to study criminal justice at Middle Tennessee State University and launched her 31-year career with the Department of Justice, where, for more than 20 years, she led and supervised a team of criminal and forensic analysts.Eady Butler was considering retirement when Weaver approached her about joining Uncle Nearest. ""She and I connected and talked about what I could contribute to the team,"" she recalls, ""and honestly, I just couldn't say no to the opportunity to help continue my great-great-grandfather's legacy. So the 'yes' was easy.""So, in March 2019, Eady Butler retired from the Department of Justice on a Thursday and went to work with Uncle Nearest on the following Monday. She started as the VP of administration, but it wasn't long before Weaver approached her about the possibility of blending.Although nervous, I just knew I wasn't going to fail.Eady Butler didn't have any blending experience — but she was willing to give it a shot.""The first time that I went in to blend, I went in carrying a ball of nerves,"" Eady Butler says. ""My background was not in the spirits industry; I had never even considered blending whiskey. I had always enjoyed it with my family and friends, planning cocktails and things like that, but had never blended whiskey — and of course I was nervous.""But Eady Butler was surrounded by support. The Weavers and three team members with years of blending experience among them were standing by when Eady Butler attempted to blend her very first batch of 1884 Small Batch Whiskey.

""Although nervous, I just knew I wasn't going to fail. And thankfully out of all the products that were laid on the table for me to taste, sample and blend, I made the right choices.""Weaver told Eady Butler that halfway through the first blending session, she knew she ""had something special"" — so she asked her to blend another batch of the 1884 and hasn't been back to observe her blending since, Eady Butler says.""Fawn Weaver was my ultimate cheerleader,"" Eady Butler says. ""She entrusted a lot in me that day, but she was there cheering me on while I was doing it. That has carried me a long ways, and I'm grateful for that.""Related: With Whiskey Tariffs Finally Suspended, American Distillers Raise a Toast


""I'm always looking to ensure that the finish is good, along with the taste, of course.""Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey's long list of achievements — 700 awards and accolades since the brand's 2017 launch, including 78 ""Best in Class"" honors — is proof positive that Eady Butler was destined to be its master blender.And it's a responsibility she doesn't take lightly. ""We are a premium product, so I want to always ensure that what goes in the bottle meets the standard of our brand,"" Eady Butler says. ""And then the finish is always important to me. It was from that very first day, and it still is.""Eady Butler samples and blends at cask strength then proofs down to ensure there's not a lot of water in the product. ""It is important to me that the finish be strong and kind of inviting, but not pungent,"" she explains. ""So I'm always looking to ensure that the finish is good, along with the taste, of course.""Eady Butler is committed to keeping her palate sharp: She doesn't eat or drink anything else while blending, and she won't spit out any product either. She's also ""extremely loyal"" to Uncle Nearest whiskey.


""I don't know if it's scientific, or if it's just what I believe is necessary, but I don't drink any other whiskey,"" Eady Butler says. ""I don't want to do anything that may disrupt my palate.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Uncle Nearest Premium WhiskeyRelated: American Whiskey: A Proven Recession-Proof Investment Opportunity""What keeps me going is making sure that we are always focused on Nearest Green.""Becoming an award-winning master blender at her great-great-grandfather's namesake distillery might not have been part of her original plan, but Eady Butler says the journey's been one full of ""beautiful surprises.""


One of them has been the experience of working with Uncle Nearest's all-women executive team — something Eady Butler hadn't experienced in law enforcement, where she says she was often the only woman in a room full of men.""It's hard to put into words,"" Eady Butler says. ""There is a beautiful acceptance around the table of who we are, just like we are. And then the creativity, the dedication, the juggling act that takes place oftentimes, multitasking. I feel very fortunate to work alongside them and have them as my family.""What we are doing is way more than whiskey. Today, we are change agents.And, of course, as the first-known Black woman with the master blender title in the U.S., Eady Butler gets to carry forward her ancestor's legacy in an especially powerful and apt way, which she calls a ""beautiful blessing.""


""I'm honored to be the first African American female master blender,"" Eady Butler says. ""But more than anything, what keeps me going is making sure that we are always focused on Nearest Green. When Fawn launched this brand, it was with the thought of ensuring that Nearest Green's legacy would be cemented in history. And that is what keeps me going every day.""Working at Uncle Nearest means there's something new and exciting happening all the time, Eady Butler says. But at the end of the day, everything leads back to Nearest Green, the godfather of Tennessee whiskey who started it all — and whose legacy continues to lift other BIPOC founders and professionals in the spirits industry now.""This morning, I woke up with excitement and anticipation that this day would be a springboard to change somebody's life,"" Eady Butler says, referring to the summit. ""What we are doing is way more than whiskey. Today, we are change agents. And I'm glad to be a part of that.""

66,The Importance of Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace for Startups,"Apr 24, 2023",Chris Kille,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/why-diversity-and-inclusion-is-so-important-for-startups/449674,"
Diversity and inclusion are essential components of a successful workplace in any organization. When it comes to startups, the importance of diversity and inclusion cannot be overstated. Startups need to be innovative, adaptable and flexible to succeed, and having a diverse workforce can help to achieve these goals.Diversity generally refers to the range of differences that exist among people. These differences can include race, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, religion, education and culture, among others. Inclusion refers to an environment where all individuals feel valued, supported and included, regardless of their differences.For startups, diversity and inclusion involve creating a work environment in which everyone feels very comfortable sharing their thoughts, ideas and perspectives without fear of discrimination or exclusion.



Related: Why You Need Diversity on Your Team, and 8 Ways To Build ItBenefits of diversity and inclusion in startups1. Better decision-making:


A diverse workforce brings multiple perspectives, experiences and ideas to the table. This diversity of thought can lead to more creative solutions and better decision-making. When a team is composed of individuals with different backgrounds and experiences, they are better equipped to identify challenges and opportunities and develop innovative solutions catering to a broader range of customers.2. Increased innovation:Startups need to be innovative to succeed. A diverse workforce can generate new ideas and aids to create products and services that cater to a diverse customer base. When individuals from different backgrounds and experiences come together, they can combine their unique perspectives and expertise to develop innovative solutions.3. Better customer understanding:


Businesses need to understand their customers to develop products and services that meet their needs. A diverse workforce can help startups to better understand their customers and cater to a broader range of people. A team of individuals with different backgrounds can bring unique perspectives on customer preferences, cultural nuances and societal dynamics. This can lead to products and services that are better tailored to customers' needs.4. Better problem-solving:A diverse team is better equipped to identify challenges and develop solutions that cater to a wider range of people. Startups must be agile and adaptable; a diverse team is better suited to this task. By leveraging a team's diverse experiences and perspectives, startups can develop solutions that cater to the unique needs and preferences of diverse customers.5. Improved employee engagement:


A diverse workforce that feels valued and included is more likely to be engaged and committed to their jobs. When employees feel like they belong and that their contributions are valued, they are very likely to be productive and motivated to help the company succeed. This can lead to better morale and higher employee retention rates.6. Enhanced creativity:Diversity and inclusion help to create an environment that respects and embraces different perspectives, cultures and ideas. This can spur creativity and innovation, resulting in a wider range of ideas and solutions that may not have been generated through a homogeneous work environment. A diverse and inclusive workforce can open up a world of possibilities for startups, helping them to solve problems and face challenges in new and imaginative ways.7. Competitive advantage:


Companies that embrace diversity and inclusion are very well positioned to attract and retain top talent. A diverse workforce that values different perspectives and experiences can help businesses to tap into new markets and cater to emerging customer needs. This can ultimately translate into a competitive advantage in the marketplace.8. Improved reputation:When startups prioritize diversity and inclusion, it can positively impact their reputation within the industry and in the eyes of potential customers. Companies seen as socially responsible and inclusive may be more attractive to consumers and can help build a positive brand image.9. Mitigating risk:


Diversity and inclusion can help mitigate workplace risk by reducing bias and promoting fairness. When teams are composed of individuals from different backgrounds and experiences, there is less risk of groupthink, which can lead to poor decision-making. Additionally, promoting diversity and inclusion can reduce the risk of costly legal battles resulting from discriminatory workplace practices.Related: Diverse Teams Drive Innovation in Ways Homogeneous Teams Just Can'tStrategies for promoting diversity and inclusion in startups1. Embrace diversity in hiring:Startups must embrace diversity in recruiting and hiring to build a diverse workforce. This means looking beyond traditional recruiting methods and expanding the search for talent to include diverse communities. By recruiting from a wider range of backgrounds, startups can build a stronger team with diverse perspectives and experiences.


2. Train employees on diversity and inclusion:Training is essential in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Startups should regularly train employees on diversity and inclusion best practices, including unconscious bias training. Employees should understand the importance of embracing diversity and creating an inclusive work environment.3. Create a culture of inclusion:Creating a culture of inclusion involves valuing and respecting all employees and fostering an environment where everyone feels very comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas. Startups can achieve this by promoting transparency and open communication, providing opportunities for feedback and recognizing and celebrating diversity.


4. Establish diversity goals:Startups should establish diversity and inclusion goals and measure progress against them regularly. By setting goals and tracking progress, startups can ensure that they are making progress toward creating a diverse and inclusive work environment.Overall, diversity and inclusion are essential components of a successful workplace in startups. A diverse workforce brings new perspectives, experiences and ideas to the table, leading to increased innovation, better problem-solving and a better understanding of customers. By promoting diversity and inclusion in recruiting, training and culture, startups can build teams that are better equipped to counter the challenges of an ever-changing business landscape.Related: Diverse Hiring and Inclusive Leadership Is How Startups Thrive

67,Noticed a Growing Disconnect Between Employees and Employers? Here's Why.,"Apr 24, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-employers-and-employees-arent-agreeing-on-expectations/449113,"
In just seven years, we will face a global worker shortage of 85 million people, according to the 2023 Workforce Trends ManPower Group report. That means there will be major shifts in the power balance between employees and employers. Traditional employers with a command and control leadership style will have less power as power shifts more to employees.With increased power over employees, expectations are shifting. Consider these statistics:31% of current workers would take another role in the next month if it offered a better blend of work and lifestyle.68% of Gen Z workers are not satisfied with their organization's progress in creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and 56% would not accept a role without diverse leadership.More workers think that the ability to collaborate (83%), solve problems (82%) and be trustworthy (82%) are more important to do their job well than simply being a high producer (76%).57% of employees are already pursuing training outside of work, because company training programs don't teach them relevant skills.75% of investors say companies should address ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues, even if doing so reduces short-term profitability (diversity, equity and inclusion fit in the ""S"").To address these growing macro trends, organizations need to:



Model and reinforce workplace flexibility — especially senior leadership).Objectively measure employee performance (a.k.a. behaviors + results).Proactively address ESG social issues before it is mandated.Related: How to Balance Employee Happiness and Business Expectations1. Model and reinforce workplace flexibility — especially senior leadershipConsidering nearly one-third of workers would leave their roles immediately for better work-life integration, this signals a growing expectation for authentic flexibility. No longer a nice to have, it is a must-have for workers. More traditional cultures have been slow to change, expecting employees to return post-pandemic to the status quo. Rather than retreat to past notions of workplace expectations, this is an opportunity to shift to meet shifting employee expectations. People are looking to leaders to not just say flexibility is important but to model it through their own actions. As leaders work remotely and take time off, employees feel safer doing so as well.


Here are some unconventional ways leadership can promote flexibility (Note: For front-line workers, virtual work may not be a possibility and flexibility can be more constrained):Host a workplace offsite at a remote location where employees can bring their families, mixing work and life in a relaxed environment.Set expectations for in-person days in the office environment. Consider maybe one or two designated days per week that your employees are expected to be physically present, and working from home the remainder of the days.Be clear about holiday observances cross-culturally. Be cognizant of holiday celebrations and out-of-office obligations.Talk to team members about their travel interests or family visits, encouraging them to work from other locations if they can and want to during less busy times.2. Objectively measure employee performance (behaviors + results)Subjective criteria invite bias into the performance management process. More often, inclusive behavior is just as important as the ability to get results. If your employees are getting results with exclusionary behavior, they need to be held accountable for these behaviors as well — trust, collaboration and problem-solving skills. Increasingly, toxic workplace behavior is a key reason for employees self-selecting out organizations. If you tolerate toxic behavior because the person is getting results, it's the same as saying toxic workplace behavior is acceptable.Consider adding competencies to the performance management process to ensure people are not only getting the results but they're being held accountable for their behavior. Competencies like communication, leadership, empathy and vulnerability are highly correlated with healthy workplace cultures. What gets measured and gets done. When people are held accountable for their behavior, the culture shifts.Related: Employees Only Meet Expectations When They Know What's Expected


3. Proactively address ESG social issues — before it's mandatedEurope's expected mandate of ESG reporting will affect any organization that does business in Europe. Rather than having to react once enacted, it's important to proactively prepare. Because diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are a part of the social component of ESG, organizations will be expected to report on DEI activities and representation numbers. Investors, customers and employees alike are asking how organizations are contributing to positive social change. As the power continues to shift to employees, expect this question to be asked more often, realizing future consumers and employees are voting with their dollars and employment decisions. People want to work with organizations that are creating social good.Case studyA Fortune 25 client of ours in the financial services industry realized this shift in employee power. Instead of maintaining the status quo, they decided to develop a program that responded to changing employee needs. They built a nine-month Men as Allies program with a curriculum to support learning on flexibility, inclusive leadership skills and how to effectively mentor and sponsor people different from themselves. The result was a boost in year-over-year membership growth of 30% for women and 40% for men as allies. Promotion rates and retention for women in the program increased as well.With a growing disconnect in workplace expectations, it's important that organizations realize that the workplace needs to change, not the employees. By modeling flexibility, measuring employee performance and anticipating ESG expectations, we can meet employees where they are and create more inclusive workplaces where all people feel seen, heard and feel like they belong.

68,4 Ways Inclusive Leaders Can Respond to the Weaponizing of DEI,"Apr 13, 2023",Chuck H. Shelton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-inclusive-leaders-can-respond-to-the-weaponizing-of/448939,"
During these highly-polarized times in America, we see some people weaponizing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) as a means to grow political power. Their premise: meaningful engagement in diversity, equity, and inclusion conversations and programs is about pursuing political correctness and a liberal social agenda.The weaponization of concepts and ideas meant to improve outcomes and opportunities for all is wreaking havoc on our ability to have productive discourse, especially in the workplace. Inclusive leaders must be prepared to respond to the dissenting arguments around the value of more inclusive cultures to ensure that we do not undermine our core values and commitments to employees and all stakeholders.Inclusive leaders need to think clearly and care deeply, so we can cut through the confusion around DEI. Here are four ways to do that.Related: Diversity Is Not the Same to Everyone. Here's Why That Matters1. Diagnose why some use DEI as a weaponMotivations animating the accusations that DEI is code for progressive politics include:



The fear of change: New realities bring hard adjustments. For people with much experience of advantage, it may be easier to caricature and blame DEI and harder to accept demographic shifts, immigrants, and differences in religion, gender identity and sexual orientation. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said: ""There is probably no emotion that plagues and crumbles the human personality more than that of fear."" Such fear manifests every day among opportunistic politicians and commentators.A waning commitment to critical thinking: Leaders cannot succeed when ignoring facts, history rightly told, and evidence-based decision-making. In contrast, much of the mounting criticism of DEI suffers from a lack of rigorous reflection. Take, for example, one outcome of the recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank. Andy Kessler of the Wall Street Journal offered a mostly useful analysis of why SVB failed. Unfortunately, he added a rogue thought about the diversity of the Bank's board and wondered aloud if ""the company may have been distracted by diversity demands."" He provided no evidence in his purely biased conjecture. It set off a feeding frenzy among politicians and 'news' people who choose to see DEI as a threat.Grasping benefits embedded in discrimination and systemic racism: Bias can be consciously acted out and articulated. Some of the most insidious resistance to the goodness and power in DEI comes from those who see reality only as win/lose: if those experiencing disadvantage move forward, then these fearful, lazy-thinking, uncaring folks assume that they will lose position, resources, and opportunities. Here's the deal with systemic racism: pretending it doesn't exist doesn't make it so. And as inclusive leaders, we are either actively dismantling how bias operates — in our talent system, for instance — or we are complicit in the menacing impact of unchecked inequity.2. Rediscover the ""Why"" in DEIWhat's an inclusive leader to do? We need to reconsider and recommit to business reasons for engaging with DEI. This means defining and measuring how DEI drives growth through the following:


Talent: Selecting, growing, and retaining a mix of talent by disrupting bias and generating opportunities for people and systems.Products and Services: Leverage DEI to design, produce, and deliver our offerings.Revenue: Grow our market presence and customer connections.Process: Fuel innovation, improvement, and efficiencies through DEI.Environment, Social, Governance Commitment: Center DEI as a critical driver for ESG and investment funding.Brand: Build your reputation and your company's brand as an inclusive leader.DEI is the right thing to do because it's the right thing to do for you, your team, and your organization. Contrary to the assumption that the case for DEI is so well substantiated it should be ignored, perhaps the new pressures should motivate us to revisit the business reasons for DEI.Related: 7 Ways Leaders Can Level Up Their DEI Workplace Strategy3. Invest in learning to lead more inclusivelyIn the face of political arguments and the risks that roil around diversity, I suggest that you re-inform your self-interest in leading inclusively. Here are several vital investments:Overcome your fear of discomfort because unease around DEI can provoke curiosity and profound learning. It's not time to prohibit talking about sexual identities and orientation, it's not time to hide the truth about slavery from our children, and it's not time to run from the reality of white supremacy. It is time, as an inclusive leader, to find your courage, evoke bravery in your team and company, and accept discomfort as a source for transformation.Inclusive leadership is based on a set of skills that are really competencies to be developed. Learn more about them and then work on developing them yourself.Lead in ways that disrupt bias and create opportunity in your systems and culture. Inclusive managers attend to bias reduction in their relationships and decisions. And we join others in producing measurable growth in opportunities, especially among underrepresented colleagues.Related: Do You Have an 'Inclusion Delusion?' Here's How a Lack of Inclusivity Can Create a Toxic Culture


4. Communicate the success that DEI bringsThe most effective antidote to the devaluing of DEI is to tell the success stories that always come from leading inclusively: winning and serving new customers across the globe, the ability to attract and retain a mix of talent, progress in ensuring that the majority of people are also finding the benefits that DEI delivers.Measure what matters in terms of identities in your workforce and customer base across markets, and then talk about the hard-won progress in your metrics. Mention a colleague's skill with inclusive leadership as part of announcing their promotion. Lean into the hard conversations, get real, choose vulnerability, and tell your truth in ways that build relationships.We live and lead in an era of cross-currents: as we see people trying to weaponize DEI as a conspiracy and a threat, we know as inclusive leaders that diversity, equity, and inclusion are sources for growing our team, our companies, and our careers. Rightly viewed, this weaponization is an invitation to clarify the business-building power of DEI. As a result, we stay away from low-performing political arguments, and we lead with clarity, courage, and a competitive edge.

69,Does DEI Training Work? It Depends How Proactive It Is.,"Apr 11, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/does-dei-training-work-it-depends-how-proactive-it-is/446481,"
The key question leaders are asking is: Does diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) training work?The answer is not a simple ""yes"" or ""no."" It depends on how the work is being positioned inside the organization.Is it intentional?Is it consistent?Is it fully supported by senior leadership?DEI is ineffective when it is forced, the progress isn't measured and it is not supported by senior leadership. However, when the commitment is intentional and consistent by leadership and measured over time, organizations experience results. They see higher rates of innovation, improved decision making and higher profitability than their industry peers.



When DEI work fluctuates with the news cycle or DEI training is done as a check-the-box one-time approach, it can do more harm than good. DEI is not a short-term endeavor. Organizations that are proactive with DEI, weaving it into their strategy, addressing systemic issues and measuring outcomes see better results over time.Let's compare the different approaches of two organizations that launched DEI initiatives.Related: Is Diversity Work Actually Helping or Hurting Businesses? The Answer Is Complex.Organization A: ReactiveReacting to events in the news cycle, they immediately sprang into action. Although timely, they overshadowed their efforts by making bold statements and donations to charitable causes aligned with newsworthy topics. The quick response and unclear messaging confused employees about why, suddenly, they were being forced to participate in DEI training and for what purpose.Organization A's initiative backfired because the employees sensed that the organization was performing an empty, ""check-the-box"" initiative to tout that they were promoting DEI; without the intention to actually create an equitable workplace culture. They didn't have the organizational baseline data necessary to build a strategic plan and measure the impact over time. Naturally, events in the news cycle faded — and so did the organization's efforts. This led to a decrease in employee engagement and, unfortunately, resistance from employees to participate in future DEI endeavors.Organization B: ProactiveIn this case, members of the leadership team were intentional with their efforts. They surveyed the entire organization to uncover current perceptions of DEI (established a baseline), utilized a dashboard to measure impact over time, conducted listening sessions to garner support, and used all collected data to inform their initiatives. Organization B then built a strategic DEI communication program that featured consistent, ""bite-sized"" communications and monthly touchpoints for managers. Their outcome was successful and led to an increase, year over year, in DEI metrics, higher retention and promotion rates of employees in marginalized groups.


From both case studies, reactive and proactive, we can surmise that reactive responses to news cycles or haphazardly assembled, performative initiatives designed to create an outward appearance of an organization being DEI compliant, fail to land and create further division, confusion and frustration with employees. Proactive planning and organizational leadership that presents a consistent and united front with their messaging are necessary for a successful DEI initiative.Related: How to Promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Your WorkplaceHow to be proactive1. Be intentionalDEI training needs to be tied to the overall strategy and embedded in the organizational culture. A strong DEI strategy answers what it means at our organization and why it matters here, now and ongoing. Get a baseline assessment of where you are at on the DEI journey and utilize the feedback to draft a mission statement that will drive the common purpose within the entire organization.


2. Be consistentOnce a clear mission statement has been crafted it should be prominent in every communication about DEI. By including it in all DEI-related communications over time, employees that may be skeptical or may not see the value in DEI will start to see how it shapes the employee experience. Often, the smaller bite-sized communications can meet people where they are at and build momentum for addressing systemic issues like pay equity and bias in hiring and performance processes.3. Gain full leadership supportWhen leading DEI work, encourage everyone to fully participate on a consistent basis, especially senior leadership. Make participation highly encouraged or expected so that people feel psychologically safe joining and not forced. Involve folks in the process to gain buy-in early and often.


Leadership should be clear, consistent, and united in their communications regarding DEI. Employees should have a crystal-clear understanding of the importance of the DEI initiative to the organization, what is expected of them, and why their participation is essential. The clarity in this message will also be a deterrent to anyone adamantly opposed to participating in DEI, as there is no room for dissension when the purpose is clear.Related: Is This Diversity and Inclusion Concept the Missing Link for Real Change?DEI training does work when it is intentional, consistent and fully supported by senior leadership. Yet, when it is reactive, and only done opportunistically as a part of the news cycle, it can be detrimental. Leadership that is proactive with DEI work wins over time.

70,Rosario Dawson teams up with Square to Help Black and Latino Entrepreneurs Move Forward,"Mar 29, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/rosario-dawson-teams-up-with-square-to-help-black-and/448610,"
Square recently announced the launch of Forward, a business accelerator program designed to help Black and Latino retail entrepreneurs obtain the capital, coaching, and products they need to succeed.Who are these coaches?Program mentors include actress, activist, designer, and businesswoman Rosario Dawson; bestselling author and CEO of Sweet July Ayesha Curry, financial advisors and podcasters Rashad Bilal and Troy Millings of Earn Your Leisure, and NBA Champion, entrepreneur and Social Change Fund United (SCFU) co-founder Dwyane Wade.



So, it's safe to say that program members will have access to the resources and network needed to succeed.As per Square, ""Forward will support 25 early-stage businesses who will be awarded $20,000 in funding along with exclusive access to trainings developed in partnership with 1863 Ventures, a recognized leader in providing culturally competent business curricula. The training topics will range from leadership and customer development to scaling operations and managing financial growth.""


But, the deadline to apply is April 1st, so you'll need to fill out the application quickly.Need more information? I recently had a chance to chat with Rosario Dawson about the accelerator program and her partnership with Square.Why Rosario Dawson chose to partner with Square""This is personal to me and is part of my life's work. When I heard what this team has been building for the past two years in response to what we saw in 2020, during which 41% of black businesses went under, I had to get involved. There's just not a lot of people who actually wanted to put that much in initiative and time and energy behind actually doing something about it.""She continues, ""A lot of people said so, but they didn't necessarily create entire programming. And this team has been working diligently for two years to now launch this project to identify and find 25 different black and brown businesses and give them $20,000 and mentorship, financial literacy and all the resources that are needed to solve this critical issue.""


Dawson has a history of supporting entrepreneurs and individuals that are often overlooked.In addition to her partnership with Square, she's also the co-founder of Studio One Eighty Nine, a social enterprise that provides a platform to help promote and curate African Fashion.The 5 lessons about Entrepreneurship she wishes she learned soonerGiven her extensive experience and desire to help others avoid failure, I asked Rosario to share one lesson about entreperneurship that she wish she learned sooner. True her form, she overdelivered and shared five lessons.Start small ""To get to that point where you were able to scale and grow is really beautiful. But sometimes you gotta start small. So just don't be afraid to start.""Build a team""You want to make sure whatever weaknesses you have you hire for or you get mentors for. Don't be afraid to ask questions.""Ask questions and stay curious ""Don't be afraid to ask questions. You won't know the answer unless you ask. And even if you think you know the answer, you can always learn from another perspective in another way.""


Anticipate setbacks""Expect that dip. Because I think the psychological aspect is really a big part of it. And knowing that you're gonna have humps and there's gonna be dips and you need to be able to figure out each level as it comes.""Fail forward""Failure is gonna be a part of that journey. You're not gonna get it all perfectly. Don't let it stop you from moving forward because you're never going to be perfect out the gate.""


Rosario's advice for entrepreneurs who are hesitant to apply for ForwardMy father always said ""If you ask, the answer will be yes or no. If you don't ask, the answer will definitely be no"".Rosario shared a similar message when I asked her what she would say to entrepreneurs who were hesitant to apply for fear of not being accepted.""You've already put in the hard work to build your businesses, and the answer is going to be no if you don't apply. And one of the great things that can happen here is you can expose yourself to this company, which genuinely cares about you. And you can potentially just get better at applying for grants and writing about yourself. You never even know, just through the process, what you can get and what you can learn.""And, even if you don't get accepted, all hope isn't necessarily lost.


""There's gonna be a lot of people who are looking at this and maybe that 26th applicant that didn't make it into the 25. But we'll keep them in mind and who knows what ends up happening in the future?""Next stepsReady to apply? You can do so on the Forward website but you'll need to hurry. Applications close Apr 1, 2023.And whether you get accepted or not, I highly recommend checking out the additional resources Square provides to founders. Good luck!

71,Is Diversity Work Actually Helping or Hurting Businesses? The Answer Is Complex.,"Mar 23, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/is-dei-uniting-or-dividing-your-business/446480,"
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work and the great divide in opinions regarding it has become a point of focus in recent headlines. One common — and very polarizing — debate is: Should we or shouldn't we implement DEI in our organization, and if we do, should we make it mandatory for all employees?To cut through the confusing rhetoric, the answer is yes, it's absolutely necessary. New research reveals that 89% agree that DEI in the workplace is important. Generation Z (the most diverse American generation yet) is entering the workforce and they are looking for employers that embody and acknowledge their diversity. In addition, customers and employees alike expect organizations to speak up about social issues and they are voting with their dollars and loyalty.DEI initiatives that backfire generally do so because they create division within the workplace, for some employees it can seem like ""too much"" or ""not worthwhile,"" and for others, it can feel like ""not enough."" Given this polarization, organizations are increasingly expected to bridge the DEI divide.



Consider these three proven strategies to unite rather than divide your organization:Establish a baselineMonitor, listen and adjustKeep it energized, consistent and continuingRelated: 10 Ideas to Drive Your DEI Initiatives in 2023


Establish a baselineStart by establishing a baseline. Survey all members of the organization to understand their perceptions of DEI. You can't determine where you need to go and what needs to be done if you don't know where you are starting. The information gathered can help inform and identify how to shape and improve initiatives. Map out the entire employee experience — recruiting, hiring and performance management — and use it to analyze any disconnect with marginalized groups. Consider race, gender, LGBTQ+, disability and age to assess who the organization is attracting, retaining, promoting and losing. It is not uncommon to uncover that marginalized groups are not being retained or promoted as frequently as the majority group.The information from your survey and employee experience assessment will establish the baseline and identify where you need to go. Gather senior leadership and those passionate about DEI inside the organization and ask the following questions: What are we trying to achieve? Why are we doing DEI work?Monitor, listen and adjustOnce an organization has gathered baseline data, crafted its mission statement and engaged everyone, the next step is to monitor how the initiative is received and the progress it is making within the organization. DEI is both quantitative and qualitative, be sure to continue to gather data, with surveys, focus groups or listening sessions to gather feedback. These efforts will enable you to make any necessary modifications to your initiative as conditions evolve over time. Consider asking employees: What obstacles do we have to an inclusive workplace? What are we doing well for DEI? What is one thing we could do to better support DEI?The feedback you gather should identify issues that consistently arise, they typically center around the lack of middle management engagement, inauthentic commitment, not enough time and lack of prioritization. By listening to the feedback from your employees, you are doing two very positive things: You're demonstrating a higher level of commitment to DEI to employees by allowing them to feel heard and that their input matters, and you're identifying issues as they arise and adjusting your DEI initiative to meet those needs. No organization is where they want to be with DEI, but the key to a successful DEI initiative is to be honest about the gaps rather than pretending they do not exist.


Related: Is This Diversity and Inclusion Concept the Missing Link for Real Change?Keep it energized, consistent and continuingThe one-and-done, check-the-box DEI training and activities often polarize organizations further. DEI is more than just training; it is an intentional set of activities that drive diverse representation, inclusivity and systemic equity. Rather than a big event or public relations statement, consider these proven activities: DEI communications, enrichment opportunities and, most importantly, work to de-bias and create equitable systems. Offering a range of ways for individuals to participate in a meaningful and comfortable way will encourage continued engagement.A steady pulse of consistent and clear DEI communication from all levels of the organization, on a regular basis, demonstrates to people a long-term, genuine commitment. Rather than divide an organization with forced training that shames and blames people; meet people where they're at by listening to them and clearly defining the opportunities. Communicating progress, even if the organization's current situation is not ideal, is important to energize all involved in the efforts because progress always outweighs perfection.DEI will continue to be polarizing unless we engage more allies in the conversation. Remember, most people are in the middle. Research shows that DEI can be ineffective when it is not supported at senior levels and the impact is not measured. However, when the commitment is intentional and consistent by leadership and measured over time, organizations see positive results. DEI is a competitive advantage. Two case studies illustrate how DEI can unite or divide organizations by tapping into three proven strategies — establish a baseline, plan and communicate; monitor, listen and adjust; then keep it energized, consistent and continuing.

72,The Odds Are Still Stacked Against Women in Business. Here's How Young Women Can Defy Them.,"Mar 22, 2023",Lissele Pratt,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-young-women-can-smash-the-glass-ceiling-in-business/446312,"
As a millennial woman founder, I know firsthand the obstacles that women encounter in the corporate world. Although there has been some progress over the past eight years, the representation of women, particularly women of color, is still lacking. According to McKinsey & Co, only 1 in 4 C-suite leaders are women, which is a staggering statistic. However, the situation is even more alarming for women of color, as only 1 in 20 hold a senior leadership position.I started my first business at age 16, and now, at age 26, I am running a seven-figure fintech consultancy. But my success hasn't come without its fair share of challenges. Like many young women in the corporate world, I have faced bias, skepticism and a lack of representation. That's why it's more important than ever for young women to have strategies to overcome these obstacles and succeed in the corporate world.Here are some key strategies to break through the barriers and achieve our goals.Related: Women Are Leaving Corporate America for Entrepreneurship. Here's How to Support Them.1. Build your networkBuilding a strong network is absolutely essential for success in the corporate world. As a young woman in this industry, connecting with other women and allies who can provide support and guidance is especially important. Here are some ways to build your network:



Attend industry events and conferences: This is a great way to meet new people and learn about the latest trends in your field. You might even be surprised by how many like-minded individuals you come across at these events.Join professional organizations or networking groups: My advice would be to look for groups that are specifically focused on supporting women in your industry. These groups can be an incredible resource for making connections and building relationships with other successful women who have gone through the same challenges you're facing.Seek out mentors: As a young woman in the corporate world, having a more experienced woman in your corner can be invaluable. Look for senior-level women in your company or industry who you admire and reach out to them. Don't be afraid to ask if they would be willing to meet with you for coffee or lunch.Connect with your colleagues: Building relationships with your coworkers can help you build a strong support system and open up new opportunities. Take the time to get to know your colleagues, ask for their advice and insights, and find ways to collaborate on projects.Related: Women Entrepreneurs Face Unique Challenges. Here's How to Thrive in the Face of Adversity.2. Develop your skillsIn the corporate world, it's important to constantly develop and refine your skills. This is particularly true for young women who may be starting out in their careers and seeking to prove themselves. By investing in your own growth and development, you'll be better positioned to take on new challenges and succeed in your career. Here are some ways to develop your skills:Seek out learning opportunities: This can include online courses, webinars and training programs that can help you build new skills and knowledge. You can also seek mentorship or coaching from more experienced professionals in your field. Don't be afraid to ask for help — everyone starts somewhere!Volunteer for new projects or initiatives at work: This can give you the chance to learn new skills and take on new responsibilities, all while demonstrating your value to your team and organization. Don't shy away from opportunities pushing you outside your comfort zone.Hone your existing skills: Take the time to reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, and look for ways to improve in areas where you may be struggling. Seek out feedback from your colleagues and supervisors and use it to inform your growth and development. Remember: No one is perfect and there's always room for improvement.Stay up-to-date on the latest trends and developments in your field: Read industry publications, follow thought leaders on social media and attend conferences and events to stay informed and ahead of the curve. Don't let yourself fall behind — staying current is crucial in today's fast-paced corporate world.It's easy to feel like you have to work twice as hard to prove yourself in the corporate world. But investing in your own growth and development is one way to give yourself an edge and position yourself for success. Remember, you're capable of achieving great things — it's just a matter of putting in the time and effort to develop your skills and knowledge.Related: Reframing the Concept of Networking for Women Entrepreneurs: Relationships, Not Networks


3. Speak up and advocate for yourselfIn the corporate world, it's important to be your own advocate. This can be particularly challenging for young women who may be hesitant to speak up or self-promote. However, speaking up for yourself and advocating for your ideas and contributions is essential for getting ahead in your career.Early in my career, this was one of the biggest challenges I faced. I remember sitting in meetings where I had great ideas, but I was too afraid to share them for fear of being dismissed or ignored. It took me some time to realize that if I wanted to make an impact and be successful, I needed to have confidence in my ideas and the value I brought to the table.One way to start advocating for yourself is to be proactive in sharing your accomplishments and contributions. Don't be afraid to speak up in meetings or presentations and share your ideas and insights. Look for opportunities to take on new responsibilities and demonstrate your value to your team and organization.Another important aspect of advocating for yourself is setting boundaries and speaking up when you feel uncomfortable or unsupported. I remember a time when I was working on a project with a colleague who was constantly interrupting me and talking over me in meetings. It was frustrating and demoralizing, but I didn't know how to address the situation. It wasn't until I spoke up, set boundaries and was able to establish a more respectful working relationship.


Remember, advocating for yourself doesn't mean being aggressive or confrontational. It's about having confidence in your ideas and contributions, setting boundaries and speaking up when you need to.Related: 11 Women Leaders on How to Make Your Voice HeardFinal thoughtsAs young women in the corporate world, we face a unique set of challenges. But with the right mindset, strategies and support, we can overcome these obstacles and achieve success in our careers.Remember, you have the power to shape your own career path. By developing your skills, speaking up for yourself and seeking out mentorship and support, you can navigate the corporate world with confidence and purpose.


In the end, what matters most is staying true to yourself and your values. Be authentic, be resilient and never stop pursuing your goals and dreams. With hard work, dedication, and a supportive network, there's nothing you can't achieve. So go out there, break down those barriers and show the world what you're capable of!

73,"Many Companies Are Backtracking On Their Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Programs. Here's Why That's A Mistake","Mar 20, 2023",Miriam Warren,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/many-companies-are-backtracking-on-their-diversity/447784,"
In the wake of George Floyd's murder in May 2020, hundreds of employers, including a large number of tech companies, voiced renewed vigor toward their diversity, inclusion, and belonging (DIB) policies and programs. Now, less than three years later, many of these same companies are reneging on their vows via extreme budget cuts and layoffs that have gutted entire departments, and left programs — including diversity hiring, diversity training, and employee resource groups (ERGs) — dangling, disproportionately adversely affecting minorities.At this moment in our nation's history, when DIB has become politicized, it's more vital than ever for companies to keep their public promises to rededicate themselves to their DIB commitments. Troublingly, the current ""post-pandemic"" trend is quite the opposite.While the current economic downturn and threat of a recession have undoubtedly contributed to tech companies' decisions to downsize, there are myriad reasons why this approach to belt-tightening is short-sighted. And, there are even more reasons to rethink the dissolution of DIB departments and programs. First, there is the impact to morale, as corporations signal that prioritizing diversity was only performative. In an ongoing tight labor market, what does that say to potential talent from under-resourced communities? How can these workers ever regain trust for an organization with a reputation for turning its back on them when times get tough?



Regardless of the potential for public blowback by divesting from DIB efforts, inclusive companies have consistently proven to reap the benefits of better business outcomes. Improving the bottom line is, in part, a function of having a wider pool of qualified candidates (especially for fully-remote organizations); 76% of job seekers believe ""a diverse workforce is an important factor when evaluating companies and job offers."" When a company's workforce reflects the communities it serves, and an inclusive environment is cultivated in which different voices can thrive, it follows that input on product offerings, advertising, and customer engagement will appeal to a much broader audience as well.During times of turbulence like these, organizations can continue to cultivate inclusive workplaces without breaking the bank. The most powerful ways to weave DIB into the fabric of a company cost little to nothing beyond time and commitment:


1. Take stock of where your employee diversity program currently stands. Are there racial, LGBTQ+, and/or gender gaps, especially within your leadership team? Like Yelp, the answer is most likely yes.2. Educate and empower leaders to listen to and act on employees' needs. Managers that educate themselves and their teams to value diversity, and those that lead by example by demonstrating inclusive behaviors, bring DIB strategies to life.3. Establish an internal pipeline for DIB-related training. Unlike costly external consultants, building internal capabilities and leaning on train-the-trainer models creates internal champions who consistently promote ongoing DIB-related learning. This works best because external training is often generic and lacks organizational context. Building resources internally mitigates the risk of organ rejection when employees consume training content.4. Deploy an executive-led sponsorship program. Through this, executives commit to not only mentoring URMs, but they also become their internal advocates — lending underrepresented employees their social caché and helping them rise through the ranks and achieve their goals.


5. Create transparency for current and potential employees. You can do this by reporting on your DIB program's successes, as well as opportunities for continuing to do better moving forward. A holistic DIB report is the key to growing and sustaining your diverse workforce, and — in turn — continuing to build a strong program.I acknowledge that public sentiment about diversity in the workplace isn't at the same fever pitch it was three years ago, but don't conflate tiredness with completion. If you have the luxury of contemplating your exhaustion pursuing diversity outcomes over the past few years, imagine the experience of the folks who've experienced oppression their whole lives. Our journey toward a truly just and inclusive workplace—one where everyone belongs—is not over; it's only just begun.

75,8 Ways To Empower the Next Generation of Women Leaders,"Mar 8, 2023",Elisette Carlson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/8-ways-to-empower-the-next-generation-of-women-leaders/446554,"
I know what it feels like to be left out. I was born in Mexico and moved to San Diego at the age of 4, where I learned to speak English in Kindergarten. I struggled to make friends because I couldn't understand my classmates, and many kids didn't speak to me because I ""spoke differently."" Luckily, I picked up English quickly but then faced another insecurity. When I was eight years old, I talked my way into playing on a boys baseball team with my twin brother because ""girls"" nor ""co-ed"" baseball was offered where we lived. From the very first practice, I was mocked for literally throwing like a girl. Fortunately, times have evolved for young girls, and we have more female and diverse leadership in place than ever before. Yet, it's not enough. Too many outdated ways of thinking and policies are in place that need to be knocked aside.For 2023, the International Women's Day theme, #EmbraceEquity, aims to get more people globally talking about why ""equal opportunities are no longer enough - and can in fact be exclusionary, rather than inclusive."" 



The campaign strives to educate on the differences between Equity and Equality. It states that ""Equality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities. Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances, and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome."" Inequity affects several people, but historically it has impacted women, people of color, members of the LBGQT+ community and people with disabilities. It has also affected lower-income individuals and the underrepresented.As we look to continue to instill courage and inspire a more inclusive vision for female leadership, below are eight strategies for how organizations can empower the next generation of women leaders and entrepreneurs.


1. Make women aware of their superpowerWe all have one. My superpower is the ability to get people on the phone, to get the meeting scheduled and to get them to return the email. I'm not intimidated by the outreach and genuinely enjoy meeting people to build relationships and friendships. Encourage women to use their superpower, be it a keen knowledge of tech or a track record of success with scaling business plans, support them to go after their dreams and goals, tackle challenges and break barriers. Usually, it's within these accomplishments that we can drive company success, systemic change and personal growth.2. Create a culture of belongingFor a company to be productive and inspirational to its employees, a sense of belonging needs to be felt by everyone. If a woman or anyone feels excluded, insecure or unsafe, her self-esteem and talent will be diminished. To create this culture, organizations can meet a baseline of fair pay, offer meaningful work and support women with a work-life balance between office, hybrid and remote work. Women feel a sense of belonging when their opinions are valued and when their managers lead with empathy. For the 4th year in a row, Hilton topped the list for Fortune's Best Workplaces for Women. The company outlines how they create a culture of belonging in its Diversity and Inclusion Statement and Report here.Related: 14 Strategies For How To Retain Top Talent and Build Championship Teams3. Build more diverse boardsI work on CEO and board searches with my team at Boyden and focus on taking action toward addressing the lack of diversity on corporate boards. According to the Himforher.org 2021 benchmark study of Gender Diversity On Private Company Boards, produced with Crunchbase, nearly 40% of high-growth private companies have no women on their boards, and 78% have no women of color.


Overall, only 14% of all board seats in private companies are held by women, and just 3% by women of color. In fact, that same study revealed there were as many board members named ""Dave"" as women of color within the firms researched. And yet, studies reveal that diverse boards outperform their peers.Jocelyn Mangan, CEO and Founder of Himforher.org, explains that there is no pipeline issue. Mangan explains that ""there are plenty of women with the skills needed to serve as a director to fill every empty seat."" She encourages CEOs to build more diverse boards by identifying sources outside the personal networks of those in the boardroom today and building a broad pipeline of candidates. Leaders should also focus on finding the right expertise: looking across who is already on the board and identifying the missing skill sets — functional, industry, scaling and growth, ESG, customer segment or business model — will yield a broader and more strategic pool of qualified candidates.Related: The Secret to Making Boards More Successful Is to Make Them More Approachable4. Introduce inclusion in the onboarding processDuring the onboarding at my firm, I was required to take multiple training seminars on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, complete with quizzes at the end. It was an important refresher for me, and I also learned new specifics about the continually evolving inclusive language. Education on language, pronouns and respectful word choice will drive a stronger company culture. Leaders can begin with The Inclusive Language Handbook or recruit a certified DEI leader to educate employees.


5. Fit the job to the candidate instead of the candidate to the jobEspecially for women, tailor the job to meet her needs rather than asking her to mold into a role that may have antiquated policies that lack flexibility, skill sets, and interpersonal and soft skills. I recently read CNBC's Senior Media and Tech Correspondent Julia Boorstin's new book, When Women Lead, where she addresses obstacles that women face and shares valuable takeaways for building more successful female leaders. Using data and research, Boorstin explains how women's traditionally undervalued characteristics, such as vulnerability and gratitude, can be ""vital superpowers.""6. Generate public relations and exposure for womenChampion women for speaking engagements, podcasts, speaking on panels and media pieces. When I launched my marketing and PR agency 14 years ago focused on sports, health and wellness, my first few hires were female athletes, including an Olympian. When I identified opportunities for my team to be featured on a podcast or speak on a panel, I pitched them and encouraged my colleagues to share their stories to inspire and educate others. After the first media piece I helped her secure, my Olympian colleague went on to speak on multiple podcasts and panels about her challenges with mental health in athletics and continues to share her story to inspire and support fellow female athletes.7. Offer mentorship and leadership development programs within and outside the organizationIdentify the strengths, room for growth and passions within women and offer learning to help them achieve their stretch and aspirational goals. Allow women to put their day-to-day work on hold to accommodate their development and encourage cross-functional mentorship, allowing them to build more relationships and feel safer and included in their work environment.Related: 5 Secrets to Finding and Working With a Mentor


8. Understand the business imperative for how diversity can drive productivity and successPagerDuty, a digital operations solution company, is an excellent example of a company that sought to fill their gaps in tech and equal pay. After reviewing PagerDuty's 2022 Inclusion, Diversity and Equity Report, I spoke to their Chief Diversity Officer, Roshand Kindred, who shared that representation in tech for women, especially Black and Latina women, was limited.Among a handful of inclusion programs rolled out at PagerDuty in 2022, Kindred focused on hiring more women for tech positions and put a gender equity plan in place. Productivity went up in only nine months. Even more impressive, today their pay equity and gender equity is spot on — dollar for dollar for men and women.Empowering our next generation of women leaders goes beyond policies and hiring practices. The most important thing companies can do to promote more women leaders is to think, act and lead with the conscious commitment to including everyone and promoting a culture where women, and people of all genders and backgrounds, can show up as their authentic selves. Leaders must make it a business priority to offer more women leadership and board positions. The only way we will inspire and accomplish this is not to make less noise and take action.

76,Studies Suggest It's Good Business to Hire Women Over Men. Here's Why.,"Mar 7, 2023",Gleb Tsipursky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-hiring-women-over-men-is-better-for-your-business/446926,"
Research from cognitive neuroscience and behavioral economics has consistently shown that women are held back from career advancement compared to men.A study of managers in 20 Fortune 500 companies discovered that men had a faster career progression and received higher pay than women, despite the fact that women had similar qualifications, worked in the same industries and had consistent work experience.Another study of 138 executives, half male and half female, found that women had to work harder to overcome barriers such as exclusion from informal networks and receiving less mentoring than men.



Additionally, a study of over 1000 MBA graduates revealed that women faced discrimination more often than men, and even when controlling for work experience, women earned less than men.It is clear that the ""glass ceiling"" exists, and women face discrimination that hinders their advancement compared to men, despite having similar qualifications, skills and experience.


Related: If You Want More Women in Leadership, You Have to Enact Concerted Change. Here's How.However, employing women over men may be the key to success for your business, according to a wealth of scientific research. Studies have shown that teams led by women tend to outperform those led by men and that companies with a higher proportion of women in leadership positions are more profitable.One study published in the Harvard Business Review reports that companies with a higher proportion of women in top leadership positions ""are more profitable, more socially responsible and provide safer, higher-quality customer experiences."" Focusing deeply on innovation, the study looked at 163 multinational companies over 13 years to determine how these firms' long-term strategies shifted after women joined their top management teams. They discovered that firms became more open to change and less open to risk and shifted focus from M&A to R&D.Other scholarship shows similar results. Research from the 1996 to 1997 National Organizations Survey revealed that firms with more gender diversity tend to have more clients, higher sales revenues and greater profits. Another study found that companies with at least 30% of women on their Board of Directors tend to be more profitable. Furthermore, a third study found that teams with gender balance tend to have better sales and profits compared to teams that are mostly male.


But why do teams led by women tend to perform better? Research suggests that women may be more effective leaders because they are more likely to foster a positive and inclusive work environment. Studies have found that women are more likely than men to encourage collaboration, share credit, and provide constructive feedback.Additionally, women are often more adept at multitasking, which can be a valuable asset in today's fast-paced business world. Women are also more likely to adopt a long-term perspective, which can be beneficial for a company's long-term success.However, it's not just about the numbers. It's also important to ensure that women are given equal opportunities to succeed and are not held back by unconscious bias.Related: Women Are Being Pushed Out Of The Workforce, and It's Time Employers Do Something About It. Here's How.


Companies that prioritize diversity and inclusion tend to have a more engaged workforce and a more positive company culture. This can lead to increased productivity and employee satisfaction, as well as a more innovative and adaptable workforce.This discrimination is often the result of implicit bias, which refers to unconscious and unwarranted associations and assumptions that we make due to our gut reactions, intuitions and instincts around people we perceive to belong or not belong to our group. These biases can take the form of the halo effect, where we make a too-positive evaluation of other aspects of an individual based on one characteristic we like, or the horns effect, where we downgrade all of another person's characteristics based on one aspect we dislike.To address these biases, it is important to evaluate their consequences and take steps to counteract them. This can include implementing diversity and inclusion programs, training employees on implicit bias and its effects, and actively seeking out and promoting qualified women for leadership positions. Additionally, it is important for both men and women to be aware of their own biases and work to counteract them in their interactions with colleagues and in their decision-making processes.Overall, the research is clear that discrimination against women in the workplace is a real problem, and that addressing implicit bias is crucial to promoting gender equality and creating a more inclusive and equitable workplace. By taking proactive steps to counteract these biases, organizations can not only promote gender equality but also reap the benefits of improved performance and increased profitability.

77,What Do You Do When Your Colleague Is Biased? Try These 5 Phrases to Professionally Call It Out.,"Feb 20, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/use-these-5-phrases-to-professionally-call-out-biases-at/443932,"
If you have heard of unconscious bias, you've probably heard that all people have bias. While this is true, most people exposed to unconscious bias display polarizing views about diversity. They tend to think everyone has bias so it's not a big deal, or we all have bias and we're all bad humans. Neither extreme is reality.A commonplace example of bias is in the form of microaggressions or non-inclusive behaviors. These biased statements although often unintentional, are still harmful to marginalized groups (women, people of color, those with disabilities or in the LGBTQ+ community). They often reinforce the harmful stereotypes of a group onto an individual. They are analogous to ""death by a thousand cuts"" or similar to the cumulative effect of many mosquito bites rather than the itch of only one mosquito bite. The idea is that repetitive behavior over time harms people, rarely the singular event.Specific examples of microaggressions or non-inclusive behaviors might include:



""Where are you from?"" (or really from is even worse)""Your culture is so…"" (insert stereotype)""Can I touch your hair?"" (with hand invading personal space)""You're so articulate"" (with surprise)""Why do your people do this…"" (with judgment)Related: Are You a Performative Ally? Here Are the Signs.These are a few commonplace microaggressions. A microaggression is any statement that could potentially feel othering or make someone feel less than others because of their association with a marginalized group. For marginalized groups, these types of statements and behaviors occur at higher frequencies.


Bias is a problem when it's uninterrupted. This is when someone witnesses a biased statement and chooses to ignore it or does not take action to call attention to it. Much like when we drive past a car wreck or witness someone in need of help, the more people that are around, the less likely we are to speak up or help. This is being a bystander.Bystander behavior is problematic because it is the same as saying the behavior is acceptable, increasing the likelihood of it happening again. By contrast, an upstander calls attention to the biased statement and uses it as a teachable moment for others around them to prevent the behavior from happening again.Most of us like to consider ourselves to be upstanders, yet at the moment, emotional flooding can prevent us from speaking up. Our brain's amygdala fires our fight or flight responses and it can be difficult to think clearly. That's why having some back pocket phrases can help. To practice being an upstander, the next time you witness a biased statement, consider trying one or more of these five phrases.Phrase 1: ""What did you mean by that?""On the heels of a microaggression, sometimes we need to buy ourselves some time to think more clearly and calm down our emotions. Asking for clarity while assuming positive intent can help someone become more self-aware about their problematic behavior. Rather than elicit blame and shame, triggering defensiveness, this simple question helps someone explain their rationale and invites them to self-assess how it could be perceived differently than what they may have intended.


Phrase 2: One-word audible such as ""woah,"" ""ouch"" or ""eek""Following non-inclusive behavior, it is critical to acknowledge what happened is not acceptable. if you don't have the right words to say at the moment, bringing attention to it through a one-word audible can slow down the situation, signals to others you saw it and invites others to join the conversation to help the person learn. Ideally, we would have a conversation at the moment, yet if emotions are high, it's best to call a timeout and circle back later, usually within 24 hours.Related: Diversity Is Broader Than Just Race and Gender. This Is the Often-Overlooked Piece of the Puzzle.Phrase 3: ""Help me understand where you are coming from…""Rather than call someone out for their behavior in a way that creates division or makes the person feel like a bad person, give them space and grace to learn. Meeting the person where they're at and inviting them to share their perspective before sharing yours, creates an environment for reciprocal understanding. Rarely are our perspectives the only possible perspective. Hearing others' perspectives makes it more likely that they'll listen to your perspective, especially if it's different.Phrase 4: ""I'm curious…""One way to avoid judgment in a potentially negative situation is to maintain a healthy level of curiosity. It is impossible to be judgmental and curious at the same time. Simply starting your statement with ""I wonder"" or ""I'm curious"" shows that you're willing to learn from the other person which will make them more likely to want to learn from you. Rarely are arguments or different views resolved by telling the other person what to think. Instead, by asking questions, we stay curious and invite others to stay curious as well.


Phrase 5: ""That is not okay.""If a situation is a severe form of microaggression or the person is a repeat offender, accountability is in order. It's important as hopeful upstanders, that we call attention to what was unacceptable and draw the line for it to not be accepted again. As a leader, it's even more important to model this behavior and to be firm on boundaries. For severe forms of microaggressions or habitual behavior, a one-on-one conversation is likely best.Unfortunately, biased statements are commonplace. Next time you witness a non-inclusive behavior consider asking ""what did you mean by that?"" or saying ""woah"" or gaining clarity by stating ""help me understand where you are coming from…"" These phrases can open the conversation, rather than offend or shame others that make well-intentioned mistakes.Related: 10 Ideas to Drive Your DEI Initiatives in 2023

78,Is This Diversity and Inclusion Concept the Missing Link for Real Change?,"Feb 15, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-do-i-enact-real-dei-change-in-my-business-heres-how/443372,"
As a certified cultural intelligence trainer, I see the unfortunate outcomes when cultural intelligence is not a part of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work. When DEI work focuses solely on race and gender and not broader dimensions of diversity, the majority group (white, straight, cisgender men) often feels left out. This perpetuates the problem with those that hold the majority of positional power and influence in organizations not engaging in DEI work.When we broaden diversity to include cultural intelligence, we invite allies with power to influence change in DEI work.Related: Diversity Matters: Defining (And Developing) Your Cultural Quotient



What does cultural intelligence mean?Cultural intelligence is ""an outsider's seemingly natural ability to interpret someone's unfamiliar and ambiguous gestures the way that person's compatriots would."" Alternatively, the Cultural Intelligence Center describes it as ""the ability to work effectively across various cultural contexts (e.g. national, ethnic, organizational, generational, etc.).""Cultural intelligence simply put: working effectively with people that are different from you.


There are many dimensions of difference in people — race, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, disability, LGBTQ+, neurodivergence, mental health, age and culture — with many more.Imagine for a moment what might be possible if more people could work more effectively with different types of people.What would it feel like to work with a culturally intelligent workforce?What would be different at your organization?What positive changes would be possible for DEI?The benefits of cultural intelligenceWhen we value the full array of differences that an individual brings to an organization, performance increases.Studies show that toxic workplace cultures with a lack of respect and inclusion of cultural differences are primary predictors of employee turnover.Psychological safety, the ability to speak up and share hard things without the fear of retribution, is highly correlated with higher team performance. This kind of safety is more familiar to culturally intelligent teams.Culturally diverse teams are more likely to be more innovative, solve problems more deeply and perform better under uncertainty.The business case for DEI has been around for a long time, yet representation and the perception of inclusion have not shifted. Without the broader lens of cultural intelligence, organizations lose sight of these benefits.


Related: How to Promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Your WorkplaceHow to bring cultural intelligence to your organizationVery few DEI programs are experiencing the outcomes they had hoped to achieve: 80% of organizations are estimated to be going through the motions of DEI without enacting real change. DEI work means doing things differently and disrupting the status quo. Systems in organizations need to shift to be more diverse, equitable and inclusive and cultural intelligence is often the missing link that can accelerate change.To bring cultural intelligence to your organization, consider these ideas:Train the entire organization on cultural intelligence. Rarely are front-line workers trained on DEI beyond awareness training. Only 25% of organizations have DEI training included in leadership development training. Because DEI training is optional, employees lack the understanding of cultural intelligence for it to be valued and well-practiced. Cultural intelligence can be learned over time through education on empathy, vulnerability, candor and other key human skillsets.Communicate the importance of cultural intelligence. It is necessary to consistently and intentionally share information on cultural intelligence over time for it to stick. As with any culture change, appreciating differences and working with people with different backgrounds takes time. Look for stories from team members, clients or the community to showcase the skills on a personal level.Measure cultural intelligence. Cultural intelligence is rarely assessed in performance reviews. Organizations more commonly measure the results of goals without measuring the behaviors that help accomplish the goals, leading to dissatisfaction among employees with 90% of HR leads believing reviews yield inaccurate information. This should also be measured at an organizational level with perception data from engagement surveys or specific DEI assessments.Related: Not Where You Want to Be with Diversity and Inclusion? Consider a Bite-Sized Approach.


An organization I consulted with on cultural intelligence could apply these practices, citing a reduction in turnover of diverse groups, an increase in promotions of people with diverse backgrounds and a 20% improvement in perceived knowledge of cultural intelligence of those trained. Cultural intelligence skills were central to their measurement, communication and training practices.Cultural intelligence is a vehicle to bring more allies into the conversation. When we expand the conversation on DEI beyond race and gender, we create a psychologically safe space for people with other dimensions of difference to join that might have otherwise thought they did not have a place in DEI.

79,Here's the Biggest Way You Can Show Up for the Black Community Beyond Black History Month,"Feb 10, 2023",Mita Mallick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/this-is-the-biggest-way-to-show-up-during-and-beyond-black/444138,"
As we officially enter Black History Month, we've started being inundated with companies recognizing the occasion on social media. We've been invited to workshops and programming. We might show up, engage for the moment and move on to the next meeting. And all along we forget that Black History Month is not the only month to show up for our Black colleagues and the Black community. It's an important reminder that our allyship should be a year-long commitment and not limited to February.So here's one of the biggest ways you can show up for the Black community beyond Black History Month: Write checks. Use your influence and the power of your corporate and personal wallet to show your support. On my journey to be an ally to the Black community, here are the three things I am focused on.Paying Black colleagues fairly and equitably""There's no time like the present to start closing the racial pay gap,"" activist and speaker Lisa Hurley told me. ""We need leaders to stop giving us non-promotable tasks in our workplaces and stretch assignments that don't lead to promotions or an increase in pay.""



According to a PayScale study, Black men earn 87 cents for every dollar white men earn on average. ""Even as Black or African American men climb the corporate ladder, they still make less than equally qualified white men,"" says Jackson Gruver, a data analyst at PayScale. ""They are the only racial/ethnic group that does not achieve pay parity with white men at some level."" And according to data from Lean In, Black women in the U.S. are paid 36% less than white men and 12% less than white women on average.As a leader, don't wait for human resources to review your team's pay. Ensure your Black team members are paid fairly and equitably, particularly as new external hires join your team or internal moves and promotions happen. Check your bias when it comes to assigning those ""non-promotable"" tasks Hurley mentioned — ones that bring no monetary recognition.


As a peer, be open to sharing your compensation with your Black colleagues to ensure they are being paid fairly and equitably. Offer to help them come up with their case for a pay raise, or if you have influence and leverage in your organization, advocate on their behalf.Related: 6 Ways to Offer Allyship to Black EntrepreneursSupporting Black-owned businessesUse the power of your corporate and personal wallet to support Black-owned businesses in your office and your home. Be thoughtful and intentional about purchasing products and services from Black-owned businesses. Let colleagues and friends know who you are buying from and why.Fill your work kitchen with cookies from Partake Foods, founded by Denise Woodard, and coffee from BLK & BOLD, co-founded by best friends Pernell Cezar and Rod Johnson. If you are doing a wine tasting with clients, buy from McBride Sisters Wine Company, which was founded by Robin McBride and Andréa McBride John, and get inspired by Elle Simon Scott and her new book Boards: Stylish Spreads for Casual Gatherings.


If you're looking for gifts for colleagues, buy luxury candles from The 125 Collection, founded by Valerie Wray, or the Growing in Gratitude Journal from Alexandra Elle. Gift the book I'm Not Yelling: A Black Woman's Guide to Navigating the Workplace by Elizabeth Leiba, an important resource for Black women, women of color and allies seeking to understand an experience that's not their own. Search for and purchase incredible stock photography on pocstock, which was founded by Steve Jones. And finally, if you are looking for help in your company's equity journey, consider hiring Abenaa Hayes' Elysee Consulting.Related: How Brands Can Go From Performative Allyship to Actual AlliesPaying Black speakers fairly and equitably""Ask us to speak, and not just for Black History Month,"" author and speaker Elizabeth Leiba told me. ""We don't disappear for the rest of the year. Neither do our bills or our wealth of experience we have outside of our Blackness.""Ensure that you are focusing on diverse representation and including Black speakers with intention in internal conferences, team offsites, customer-facing events and more. Ensure that you pay Black speakers on time and in full. They should be honored for their expertise by paying them fairly and equitably, not in exchange for audience exposure, Starbucks gift cards or a company's social media post. Compare their rates to what you're paying other speakers, and ensure it's fair and equitable.


Black History Month is an important moment to start or continue your journey as an ally, but it's just the beginning. As Hurley told me, ""Remember, 'ally' is a verb.""Related: 5 Ways Entrepreneurs of Color Can Determine an Ally's Authenticity

80,Are You a Performative Ally? Here Are the Signs.,"Feb 6, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-can-you-spot-a-performative-ally-here-are-the-signs/443043,"
It's Black History Month in the United States. For those that do not identify as Black and want to appropriately celebrate and honor Black history, it might feel difficult to know what to say or do. White people have been conditioned for most of their lives to not talk about racism, to be color blind and were often taught that racial injustice had already been resolved through the Civil Rights and Black Lives Matter movements.Here are some of the challenges many well-intentioned, yet performative allies have when they show up in the conversation about racial issues:Lack of knowledge of the real history of racismSelf-proclamation of allyshipInconsistent action in the face of adversityRelated: Don't Phone It In for Black History Month: 5 Ways to Show You'll Be Dialed In All Year



Sign #1: Lack of knowledge of the real history of racismI remember hearing these messages as a child: ""Things are better than they used to be"" or ""We all have equal opportunities now."" I grew up in the 1980s in the Midwest and mainly absorbed the positives rather than the reality of the lived experience of people of color in my history classes. The story was simplified — we had slavery, it was abolished and Civil Rights solved the problem.The reality is that we have had slavery longer than we have not had it. For the 100 years between the abolishment of slavery and Civil Rights legislation, Jim Crow laws, lynching and systemic barriers to voting, housing and education through redlining were commonplace. These systems — voting, housing and education — have racial barriers that persist today. The wealth gap today is 6 to 1. For every dollar, the average white American has, the average Black American has only about 17 cents.


Black history is American history. It should be celebrated all year long. That means that our history books need to tell deeper, richer stories about the experiences of people of color. Glorifying and often white-washing leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and Harriet Tubman create false notions of what success looks like. These stories are modeled as successful activism without addressing the fact that these leaders had bolder visions that were a part of much bigger movements. History books are more likely to be written by the majority group (not people of color) and the lack of lived experience is present in history lessons today about racism.Take action: Research what you do not understandOur history books may still be flawed, yet there are many resources to unlearn and relearn our real racial history. The documentaries 13th, Deconstructing Karen and the movie Selma explain more about the deeper systemic issues of racism. There are many more. Once you have done more research, it is fair to ask questions to learn more and share what you have learned with others in your personal and professional lives. Do your research first. Do not expect marginalized people to educate you.Related: 3 Ways Leaders Can Step Into Accountability for Diversity and InclusionSign #2: Self-proclamation of allyshipAllyship cannot be self-proclaimed. It is in the eye of the beholder. when people show up opportunistically, it feels very performative to those who have been marginalized their entire lives. Allyship is about progress over perfection and mistakes are likely especially as you learn more about racism. Rather than being right, it is about being open to new information and shifting perspectives.


When performative allies label themselves as allies, they are making it about them. They are centering their experience rather than the lived experiences of people of color. For allyship to be successful, power must be shared. It is a power with, not power over relationship.Take action: Drop the egoRather than center your lived experiences, allies shift the attention to those that need support the most. They don't center themselves or try to rescue those around them. They ask for feedback on how their actions are landing and modify them to be better. That might mean sponsoring, advocating or mentoring those in other racial groups. Rather than advice-giving, allyship is more about listening to learn and staying curious versus judgmental.Compare notes to somebody that's different from you. Privilege is not a bad thing as long as we share it and help others with our privilege. Empathize with the lived experiences of others different from you. By putting your own feelings aside and practicing empathy and perspective-taking of others you learn and grow as a hopeful ally. It's not about you as an ally.Related: Here's the No. 1 Question White Leaders Ask Me About Black History Month


Sign #3: Inconsistent action in the face of adversityPerformative allies show up when it's convenient for them, not when others need you the most. When white people only show up during Black History Month, it can often cause more harm than good, especially if it's forgotten on March 1. For those that have experienced harm because of their racial identity, celebrating their history one month of the year doesn't feel genuine and perpetuates distrust between races.Real ally activity does not fluctuate with the new cycle or diversity calendar. It is a consistent and intentional activity over time. Often when we unlearn and relearn painful truths about our history and the lived experiences that are vastly different from others, guilt can emerge. We wonder why we are just now learning these facts and how we might have contributed to the problem. It is okay to feel that way, not to act in a way that harms others. Process pain in private spaces with people you trust without pushing the pain onto others to help do the work for you or feel sympathy for you.Take action: Challenge the status quoThose that experienced the harm of racism want allies to speak about the issues that affect those different from themselves. When white people elevate issues of racism, they are heard differently due to the perception of not having the proverbial ""skin in the game."" Amplify the voices of others. Surface systemic issues that are not adequately addressed in our history lessons.Consider how you have been complicit with the systems that uphold racism. Perhaps that's through the segregated community you live in or the system or the intergenerational wealth your family has accumulated that you have benefited from. Most white people have experienced the benefits associated with the historical mistreatment of other races. That doesn't mean you didn't work hard or don't deserve what you have achieved — it simply means the hardships you faced were not because of your skin color. Be open to accepting these learning opportunities as an aspiring ally. Apologize and own your mistakes when you make them.


Remember, allyship is about learning and often unlearning history, dropping our egos and consistently showing up in the ongoing conversations about race. Systems of inequality will not be solved overnight, and it takes all races to push for the systemic change needed for positive change.

81,5 Qualities of Black Excellence Overlooked in the Workplace,"Feb 2, 2023",Nika White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-qualities-of-black-excellence-overlooked-in-the-workplace/442638,"
We live in a world where Black excellence is everywhere. Entrepreneurs like Oprah, Rihanna, Michael Jordan, Jay-Z and Beyonce dominate the airways, TV stations and retail outlets. Each of these stars entered the arena in different ways and all managed to embody Black excellence to grow their businesses to unimaginable heights.But why is it that excellent qualities revered in celebrities are so often overlooked — and sometimes even stifled — within everyday white and eurocentric workspaces? It doesn't take a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) expert like myself to tell you that Black employees get a bad rap at work. Racism, stereotypes, inequity and cultural clashes make it so that employers and coworkers alike may exclude, diminish and at times target Black workers while downplaying their excellent qualities.Despite the systemic reasons why some Black workers may retreat and lose their shine in the workplace, there are others who hone in on their excellent qualities, break through barriers and shoot for the moon. Today, we'll discuss five qualities of Black excellence, how they are cultivated in Black communities and the myriad of ways they manifest in the workplace.



Related: It's Black History Month. Here's How to Show Black Employees You Care.1. Black culture encourages building meaningful connectionsIn many Black households, family and community are one and the same. One person's grandmother is everyone's grandmother and often holds the role of making sure no one is left behind, alone or without guidance. Black entrepreneurs coming from traditional Black households understand that building meaningful connections and looking out for one another is essential to survival.


This shows up in the workplace as Black employees seeking to connect with individuals at varying levels of the organization, networking across departments, social statuses, races, genders and nationalities to build connections that feel reciprocal, meaningful and welcoming. Lifting others up, checking on them and making sure they're included is a quality of Black excellence that eurocentric workplaces would be wise to recognize and value in their Black employees.2. Black culture cultivates creativityWhen all Black folks had was each other and the hope they would surpass the confines of slavery, Jim Crow and now the prison industrial complex, many folks cultivated a sense of creativity. Whether inventively using food scraps left by white plantation owners during the slavery era or making music and art during segregation, Black folks had to be creative to find upward mobility, bypass restrictions from the wider society and most importantly, survive.Black culture encourages us to see obstacles and find ways around them. We're encouraged to find new opportunities, think outside of the box, and innovate on new solutions–even if the existing culture tries to stop us. Creativity could be the secret sauce to why so many Black entrepreneurs experience success.Related: Managing a Black Woman? Here's How to Become Her Success Partner and Ally.


3. Black culture invites joy and humor as resistanceDespite all that's happened to the Black diaspora, many people still find a reason to smile and find joy. Instead of weeping and retreating into sadness, many of us had to find a way through the most difficult parts of our lives and cultivate an inner strength that showed up as joy, humor, and wit.This isn't simply a sign of someone who enjoys humor, but someone who is resilient in the face of difficulty and who can turn a hard situation into something joyful. Some who experience trauma in the workplace may exemplify anger, hatred or sadness. But facing triggers and difficulties with satire, improvisation or wordplay to create a humor-filled moment and create something positive is a soft skill that should be recognized in more Black employees.4. Black culture calls for fairnessThe vast majority of folks calling out workplace racism or inequality are people of color, in particular Black folks. Many Black individuals have had to collectively fight for their rights which produced a sense of righteousness and justice-mindedness that's pervasive throughout the Black culture.In the workplace, a passion for fairness can look like speaking up when a biased comment is spoken. It can also look like holding leadership accountable for implementing programming and initiatives equally amongst all employees.


Black workers are often passionate and vocal about fairness because it was a necessity in our families and communities. This quality helps us advance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) across communities, companies and workplaces.5. Black culture encourages people to project confidence""Keep your chin up"" is a common phrase heard in Black households. The idea is to never let the dominant culture see you sweat. The goal was to work hard and project confidence even if you were feeling low. Freedom, safety, jobs and other opportunities may not always be available, but Black culture tells us to project confidence, stand tall and keep moving forward.At all levels of the organization, Black folks attempt to show pride in their work. They can strive for excellence in their corner of influence even if it's not the most powerful position in the company. It can show up as being strong at work even if things in one's personal life are not in great shape. Demonstrating resiliency and projecting confidence are qualities of Black excellence passed down through the generations and are deserving of recognition.Final thoughtsWhether it's Beyonce, Jay-Z, Michael Jordan or Oprah, all of the Black entrepreneurs we know and love have qualities rooted in Black culture. While all Black entrepreneurs are inherently gifted with qualities of Black excellence to one degree or another, some have yet to reach their full potential, while others have truly embraced and embodied them to break through barriers and skyrocket to success. Now is the time for conventional, white, and eurocentric workplaces to finally recognize the unique qualities that come from Black culture and lift up employees who exemplify these qualities.

82,6 Ways to Celebrate Black History Month and Be a Better Ally in the Workforce Beyond February,"Feb 1, 2023",Chuck H. Shelton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/6-ways-to-celebrate-black-history-month-beyond-february/443399,"
Celebrating Black History Month is a great way to honor the significant contributions African Americans have made throughout history. However, to create a truly equitable workplace and ensure that our employees feel seen, heard and valued daily, it's essential to recognize Black history as an integral part of American history throughout the year.Research shows that workplace diversity positively impacts employee engagement and productivity. In other words, creating an environment of inclusivity for all employees isn't just the right thing to do, but it also makes good business sense. An authentic celebration of Black heritage throughout the year can help companies foster understanding and empathy among coworkers from different backgrounds. Such a celebration also allows employees to learn more about their colleagues' experiences, promoting a deeper sense of community and understanding.Related: It's Black History Month. Here's How to Show Black Employees You Care.



By recognizing Black history all year long, companies can show their employees they care while demonstrating a commitment to creating an environment where everyone feels seen, heard, valued and respected. Celebrating Black culture is one way to ensure all employees feel included in the workplace, no matter what month it is.Here are six ways to be a better ally and celebrate Black History Month beyond February:


1. Celebrate authentic Black history and cultureMake sure that all employees have access to accurate and current information about the African-American experience and contributions throughout history. Encourage employees to learn more about the accomplishments of African Americans in a variety of fields — from science and engineering to art, music and literature.How to implement it: Provide employees with a list of books, movies and articles by African Americans that tell the stories of African Americans throughout history. As opposed to non-African Americans telling the stories about African Americans (which has been the norm for too long).Related: Be Intentional About Diversity2. Plan authentic eventsCelebrate Black History Month by planning events that make meaningful connections to the African-American experience. Invite guest speakers to share their unique perspectives on Black success stories and create opportunities for employees to engage in dialogue about important topics such as race, identity and inclusion.


How to implement it: Engage in an open dialogue with employees about the types of events they would like to participate in, such as movie screenings, group discussions and panel talks. Use their input to plan engaging activities focusing on Black culture and history.Related: Here's the No. 1 Question White Leaders Ask Me About Black History Month3. Show authentic supportShow employees that their contributions are seen and valued by celebrating their success throughout the year. From recognition awards to career advancement opportunities, ensure you're actively engaging with all of your employees so they know their work is appreciated.How to implement it: Highlight employee achievements in company newsletters and recognize them at team meetings. These small gestures can go a long way in making your workplace more inclusive for everyone!


4. Host educational eventsConsider hosting educational events such as lectures, workshops and brown bag lunches that focus on learning more about the roots of Black history in America. Provide professional development resources and opportunities for employees to engage in meaningful conversations around race, culture, and inclusion.How to implement it: Invite experts in the fields of African American studies or Civil Rights to speak to employees about the history and legacy of Black people in America.5. Incorporate inclusive resources into trainingInclude inclusive language, images, historical facts, etc., into all existing workplace diversity curriculums and training materials. Such a universal approach will help employees become more aware of the impact that race, gender and ethnicity have on daily workplace interactions.How to implement it: Incorporate examples from Black history into existing diversity training materials such as videos, readings, and case studies. Ask employees for feedback about which resources would be most useful for learning more about Black history and culture.


6. Develop authentic mentorship programsInvest in mentorship programs focusing on developing collaborations between African American employees and their colleagues of other ethnic backgrounds. Establish safe spaces where everyone can share their experiences openly and without judgment.How to implement it: Create an inclusive environment through team-building exercises, cross-cultural conversations and networking events. Facilitate dialogue among employees of different backgrounds and encourage them to share their insights and ideas.Celebrating Black History Month is an important way to remind everyone of the contributions African Americans have made to our society over the last several hundred years. Yet it's also important that we recognize these achievements throughout the year in the workplace. By incorporating authentic resources into the workplace, employers can create a more inclusive atmosphere for all employees — no matter what month it is.

83,Black and Asian Founders Face Opposition at All Levels — Here's Why That Has to Change.,"Feb 1, 2023",Andrew Glaze,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-all-of-us-need-to-join-the-fight-for-workplace-diversity/441285,"
The Ernst & Young 2020 Global Private Equity Report found that 74% of private equity firms under $2.5 billion did not have set targets for ethnic diversity and had no plans to set any.While this might come as a surprise to those with no history working in private equity or hedge funds, this statistic and the recent media attention Soo Kim has received regarding the TEGNA takeover, unfortunately, come as no surprise to me.As a former employee of Standard General, one of only a handful of Black Americans working in the hedge fund sector and an immigrant founder, I'm appalled at the lack of diversity in this space. However, I can firmly say that it would be a lot worse without Soo Kim's contribution — but we need more than just him to join the cause.



Related: 18 Business Leaders on Creating an Inclusive and Equitable SocietyWhat's happening with Soo Kim's TEGNA takeover?In February 2022, Soo Kim's Standard General, with funding from Apollo Global Management announced a deal to acquire TV station owner TEGNA for roughly $8.6 billion. TEGNA is the second-largest local TV broadcaster by revenue, operating 64 TV stations and two radio stations across various markets in the U.S. Contrary to large TV consolidation mergers, this particular deal has drawn a number of vocal objectors.


Ostensibly, the critique has come from a union — The NewsGuild — that purports to be concerned about jobs, despite the public commitments that Standard General made to preserve local station employment. While concerns about jobs are admirable, the publicly filed comments from these groups include statements that, in so many words, say that Soo Kim's ownership of this station group would do nothing to advance diversity as understood by the civil rights community and public interest.Is there a ""wrong"" type of minority?These commenters continue to say that Soo Kim was not barred by his race from becoming a successful entrepreneur.As a fellow New Yorker and both graduates of Stuyvesant High School, I can speak to our experiences. Using his Asian ancestry against him is exactly the kind of short-sighted hateful rhetoric causing so many issues for Asian communities across America. I have seen this in all aspects of American life, from Wall Street firms to my days at West Point and in Baghdad.When there's a flag draped over your coffin, there is no ""wrong type of minority."" Yet we seem to treat immigrant founders and founders of color like there is such a thing as a ""wrong"" type of minority.


The indivisible nature of the United States is our greatest strength, but that strength is weakened by the belief that Soo Kim being Asian makes him unqualified to pursue the commercial principles that our country was founded on.However, what worries me more than anything is that Kim hasn't been treated fairly by anyone throughout this deal. Are these political letters and criticism influencing the regulators whose judgment the closing of this deal depends on? I know firsthand how hard it is for founders of color to access the capital to pull off deals of this magnitude. An adverse outcome here would have a chilling impact on minority ownership of broadcasting assets at the very least. Perhaps this is what the objectors want.While the thought of that is troubling at the very least, I believe what's been so impactful and appalling to me throughout this entire debacle has been the fact that I know Soo Kim. I've worked with him, I have represented him on public company boards and I've seen what he stands for. It's unimaginable to me that he could be on the receiving end of such racism when he so clearly stands for justice and equality.Related: 6 Ways to Offer Allyship to Black Entrepreneurs


Commitment to diversityAs the founder of Standard General, Kim has been tireless in his commitment to diversity: from hiring to using his power to change companies to better reflect what America really looks like. More importantly, he didn't limit his search to just Asian professionals. Black, Asian, Jewish and white employees all were represented in the 12-person team at Standard General while I was there. He has also consistently appointed women and people of color to the boards of his companies throughout the years.I have seen the good he does in his companies and how hard he works to provide equal access to opportunities regardless of race or gender.And, because I am the diversity and inclusion officer for the MediaCo board of directors, which owns the radio stations Hot 97 and WBLS (which has a management team that is over 50% diverse and a staff that is over 70% diverse overall), I would say that it is precisely Kim's unique background that could help improve TEGNA own documented diversity issues.If other leaders follow Kim's lead, we can slowly but surely change the diversity problem. But we all have to actually commit.


How the TEGNA deal compares to other acquisitionsJust to drive my point home, I believe it's important to take a look at how this TEGNA deal compares to other similar acquisitions.Recently, the TV industry has seen a surge in big deals. For example, Gray Television acquired Meredith's and Quincy's local stations with virtually no opposition from across the aisle. Scripps bought ION Media Group and Nexstar Media Group also added to its empire by snatching up Tribune Broadcasting — moves that heavily concentrated power in this industry space.All of those prior deals did not face any of the scrutiny and criticism from this deal, which is curious because the TEGNA deal shrinks the company with the concurrent sale of a number of stations to Cox Media Group, and does not require any statutory divestitures or regulatory rule waivers as each of the above did. And yet, with Standard General's deal, the informal 180-day ""shot clock"" for a regulatory decision has long passed.The point? The lack of opposition to other similar deals shows young entrepreneurs and immigrant founders that even when you try to play fair as a person of color in this industry, you just can't seem to win.


Related: 5 Ways Entrepreneurs of Color Can Determine an Ally's AuthenticityThe system has to changeIn one interview, Kim said that after the takeover, TEGNA would get a ""company with a minority owner, run by a woman, that's committed to serving diverse communities. We think that's good business.""It is good business, and I am delighted to see that Kim and Standard Media CEO Deb McDermott have received letters of support from legislators, civil rights groups and minority media groups. I applaud these groups for speaking up in defense of Soo Kim and other minorities in this space. I, too, am doing my part to speak up against these racist attacks. However, that isn't enough anymore.The system has to change — and it changes by not allowing these types of attacks, comments and ideals to persist in any way, shape or form. We must stop entertaining the idea that these types of comments are valid or even acceptable. We have as a nation all experienced the heartache of watching videos of racially motivated violence against people of color from all walks of life. Racial oppression takes place in the business world just as it does in the streets, just without the same visible evidence but the same indelible impact on those persons of color involved.


As a business leader, here's how you can enact systemic change:When making hiring decisions, stop going with your gut. Newsflash, your gut always leads you to the most comfortable choice. Instead, create a list of metrics you will hire for and focus on hiring someone that meets those metrics. Blind auditions eliminated discrimination in the world's greatest orchestras. Imagine what it could do for your business.Be aware that there are challenges diverse individuals face in business that you don't see or experience. Do your best to factor those in when evaluating candidates. They may not have Goldman Sachs on their resume, but can you see evidence of ability in past academic performance or in other areas like military or community service?As the great Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""An injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.""

84,Diversity Is Not the Same to Everyone. Here's Why That Matters,"Jan 31, 2023",Martin Rowinski,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/diversity-is-not-the-same-for-everyone-heres-why-that/443106,"
I know I'm not the typical picture of diversity. However, growing up in communist Poland offered me a unique approach to problems and solutions that most businesspeople I meet today never consider. Diversity of thought — combining our differences to cover as many diverse perspectives as possible in our decision-making — is where companies find the most benefits.While diversity and inclusion of traditionally marginalized groups are important, being truly diverse takes more thought than people realize. To truly experience greater diversity, we need to eliminate bias, go beyond what diversity looks like and choose the people that bring something new to the table.Related: 10 Ideas to Drive Your DEI Initiatives in 2023



The often-invisible diversity of immigrantsLike many immigrants, my childhood experiences — living under a harsh communist regime, fleeing my homeland and transitioning to a foreign country — shaped who I became and how I perceived the world. After ten years of never knowing if we would have enough to eat, the abundance in the U.S. looked different to me than someone who grew up never knowing scarcity. I saw and took advantage of more opportunities in the US because I was so used to seeing none.And I'm not alone. Immigrants commonly view the U.S. as a land of opportunity, which is why so many find success here. By leaving their home countries and starting a new life, immigrants demonstrate a higher tolerance for risk, which may explain why immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs. Evidently, 80% more likely than U.S.-born citizens. Nataly Kelly for the Harvard Business Review compared the ""immigrant mindset"" to a growth mindset, an adaptability in the face of change that drives business success.


I recognize how my history created differences from others at a young age. In Poland, we all felt trapped by communism, so when an exchange student came to our school, we were curious about their differences. We asked questions and welcomed him openly. In the U.S., outsiders were always coming in, and the kids I met at school there felt more comfortable bullying the new kid. Their different experience shaped the decisions they made, too.Over time, I learned to lean into my differences to build my own path to professional success. As my classmates and I got older, people were less likely to pick on me for my accent and became more interested in it. I started using it as a tool for networking, asking questions and learning from others. With over 25 years of C-suite experience and as CEO and founder of a company dedicated to curating high-performing boards, I have seen how combining many diverse minds can create successful leadership teams.Related: The 3 C's That Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Can Teach Us Today To Advance Workplace Diversity, Equity & InclusionAlign the picture of diversity with the business caseBoth gender and race represent an important element of the business case for diversity — but within them, there are swaths of diverse perspectives to consider. External pressures, from government and industry standards to public perception, can often drive businesses to focus only on the diversity that observers can see.


Imagine a board of all white men. It appears homogeneous on the surface but might be more diverse than meets the eye. Maybe all of them are immigrants from around the world, sharing vastly different experiences. Of course, boards should be diverse — including a range of women and people of different races and ethnicities — to gain more of the business benefits. We may still find diversity among a board entirely made up of all women or entirely Latino or black men, but the business case for diversity is less about appearances.The benefits of diversity come from being able to bounce ideas off of people who think differently than us, including as much of a range of diversity as possible — age, socioeconomic background, neurodivergence, as well as gender, race, and ethnicity. The idea is to create a team where each member thinks as differently as possible about approaching problems and creating solutions. Even when that diversity looks like a white man, if he happens to be an immigrant, we can count on diversity's benefits.Related: Solving Organizational Diversity Is Still an Issue: The Cost Is Steep, But the Rewards Are HighPut this to practical use in hiringTo bring the benefits of diversity to a team, we need to consider how certain perspectives fill in the gaps in a company's leadership. We can implement this into the hiring processes by:


Eliminating bias. Imagine both candidates taking an interview behind a curtain. Talk to them and get a sense of their mission, vision and values while determining how well they align with the company.Looking for diversity that brings something new to the table. Without thinking about what diversity ""should"" look like, choose the candidate based on what their unique perspective brings to benefit the company.Going beyond the usual concepts. Look for adding diversity in unexplored areas — age, socioeconomic background, neurodiversity, or culture.Offering mentorship and sponsorship opportunities. Sometimes the candidate with the right diversity to benefit a team has less experience. Set them up with veteran team members to provide support and resources so they can better develop their skills and navigate their careers while creating a sense of belonging on the team.Being open to seeing potential in everyone. There's a classic story of two brothers with an alcoholic father. One grew up successful, and the other followed in their father's footsteps. When asked how they ended up where they were in life, both answered: ""Because of my father."" One brother chose to grab adversity by the horns and become better than his past. That may not look like diversity on the outside, but his perspective would bring diverse thinking and problem-solving to a team.Related: What Business Leaders Are Getting Wrong About Bias TrainingOf course, we must continue to include more women and others from traditionally marginalized groups in all levels of business and leadership, but to reap the business benefits, a diversity of diversity is the best approach. Sometimes the most unique perspective may not come from the diversity we're used to seeing. Leaders need to read between the lines. Create a bigger picture of diversity than checked boxes and good appearances by gathering the right diversity based on what matters to the company.

85,Diversity Is Broader Than Just Race and Gender. This Is the Often-Overlooked Piece of the Puzzle.,"Jan 30, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-age-is-the-most-overlooked-piece-of-the-diversity-puzzle/440926,"
Generational diversity is diversity. Diversity is broader than just race and gender. We often oversimplify diversity to attributes we think we can see — like race and gender, yet the richness of diversity goes beyond our skin color and gender identities. Most attributes of diversity are fluid — gender, race, ethnicity and age — they can change over time or people may associate along a spectrum or identity with multiple categories within a dimension.Age is a fluid dimension of diversity as it's constantly changing.Our workforce currently has four generations participating in it. Although there is no formal authority to define generations, generations are commonly defined by birth year:



Baby Boomer Generation: People ages 56 to 75 (born between 1946 and 1965)Generation X: People ages 41 to 55 (born between 1966 and 1980)Generation Y (millennials): People ages 25 to 40 (born between 1981 and 1996)Generation Z: People ages 9 to 24 (born between 1997 and 2012)Related: Diversity Starts at the Top: Embrace Different Perspectives for Maximum SuccessGen Z is the most diverse generation of all timeBecause Gen Z grew up in a time of peak immigration in the U.S., they had more exposure to other racial groups and ethnicities. They also grew up in a more welcoming and accepting environment for the LGBTQ+ community.


Neurodiversity is also a key dimension of difference for Gen Z. Rates of diagnosis for autism, ADHD and other neurodivergence have increased significantly in recent years. With exposure comes a broader acceptance of differences. People have not changed; it is the awareness that has. For organizations that want to attract top talent, addressing the unique aspects of generational diversity is key.Gen Z expects inclusionIn a recent study by Monster, 83% of Gen Z individuals stated an employer's commitment to diversity and inclusion is significant when choosing where to work. Another poll found 75% of people in Gen Z said they'd reconsider applying to a company if they weren't satisfied with their diversity and inclusion efforts. It is common for younger generations to ask about diversity efforts at organizations during the interview process. They want to know if it's simply window dressing or if it's authentic and is quick to decipher authenticity.Related: 6 Ways Multi-Generational Workforces Lead to Business GrowthAge bias is the biggest area of biasAccording to Project Implicit, the most common bias people have is age. Most people have more positive associations with younger people than older people and 93% of older Americans have experienced age bias, one study said. As with many dimensions of difference, there are common stereotypes about age:


Older people are poorly skilled with technology (and younger are better)Younger people are entitled (and older people work harder)Older people are more conservative (and younger people are more liberal)These are just a few commonly held beliefs about people based on age. While biases and stereotypes can be rooted in some truth, it is important that we don't apply a stereotype about a group of people to an individual. Here are some problematic ageist statements/actions with potential corrections:Giving the social media project to a young person vs. Delegating the social media project to a person with the most expertise/passion, regardless of age.""I don't want to hire them because I am afraid they won't work as hard"" vs. ""Let's have objective criteria to determine fit rather than using outdated stereotypes.""Thinking ""I know who they voted for"" based on their age vs. Getting to know the person and their beliefs.Related: Why You Need to Become an Inclusive Leader (and How to Do It)One of the biggest challenges with ageism is that we have a primal fear of getting old. We discriminate against our older selves. In Ashton Applewhite's Ted Talk, they discuss why we fear getting old and how the stigma of being ""old"" manifests itself in our culture. This fear can lead to unhelpful behaviors that discriminate against older employees.In fact, ageism does not make sense. Most research shows that we are the happiest at the beginning and end of life given the data on the U Curve of Happiness. Happiness bottoms out in the mid-40s and often increases with age. Coupled with research on Blue Zones, studies find having a strong community as you age has the biggest influence on longevity.


Ageism is real. It's often the biggest source of bias. Let's be careful not to be biased against our younger, current or older versions of ourselves. As conversations on diversity and inclusion continue, expect them to intensify with Gen Z demanding more diverse representation and inclusive behavior in organizations. If generational diversity is not addressed, organizations stand to lose out as younger generations vote with their dollars and feet.Generational differences are a part of the diversity conversation, yet often overlooked or not included. By including generational diversity in the overall diversity, equity and inclusion conversation you bring more human experiences and potential allies into the work.

86,Why Your Business Needs to Consider the 4-Day Workweek — Especially If You're Serious About Diversity.,"Jan 23, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-you-need-to-consider-implementing-the-4-day-workweek/440362,"
The four-day workweek concept isn't new. New Zealand and many European countries have proven it successful over recent years. Yet, with the shift to hybrid work and the need for increased flexibility, more companies are rethinking the work week. One study showed that 40% of companies have implemented or are beginning to implement a four-day workweek.Having managed my diversity speaking business for eight years, my organization is trying the four-day workweek in 2023. We studied the benefits, discussed our preferences and decided as a team to commit to the shift. As with any change, we anticipate there will be challenges short-term and are hopeful about the long-term results.Research shows the four-day workweek boosts productivity, improves retention and increases access to diverse talent. This work schedule is more attractive to those that are caregivers, younger employees, those from different socioeconomic classes and those with disabilities.



According to Four-Day Week, organizations with successful implementation take into account the differing preferences of their employees with the flexibility to co-create their work schedule. LinkedIn's Workforce Confidence survey, which surveyed 19,000 workers in 2022, found that for 54% of people, the four-day workweek is among their top three priorities when it comes to workplace benefits. Support is especially strong for the younger generation of workers, with 62% of both millennials and Gen Z supporting the shift. The four-day week was also more popular among women (57%) than among men (51%).One wrinkle to this — most senior leadership teams have significantly lower interest in four-day work weeks at just 43%.What does it take to boost diversity and inclusion with the four-day workweek?Related: The Case for a 4-Day Work WeekDitch the ""traditional worker"" mindsetMost senior-level leaders grew up under the ""traditional worker"" mindset where men were more likely to occupy leadership roles with stay-at-home partners to help with tasks outside of work. The preference for workers to always be ""on,"" respond to emails right away, be visible in the office for more hours, have back-to-back meeting schedules and emphasize being busy over actual results is outdated. The ""traditional worker"" model needs to shift from the four-day workweek to work.For women that are caregivers, folks with disabilities and those from different cultures and backgrounds, it is more difficult to fit into a culture that reveres the ""traditional worker."" Burnout and turnover are much higher for leaders in diversity work. More flexible work environments are known to create more psychological safety for workers with different backgrounds and reduce the number of microaggressions they face.


Barnes' organization, which is working with university researchers to test the four-day week across different industries, promotes the 100/80/100 model: 100% productivity, 80% of the time, with 100% pay.Oftentimes people don't reduce their workloads, they're simply more intentional and efficient with the time they have when they lose one working day. People are forced to evaluate trade-offs and set clear priorities instead of saying yes to everything.Related: This is What It's Actually Like to Work a 4-Day WorkweekBe clear on what good performance looks likeInstead of glorifying the ""traditional worker,"" have objective criteria to measure performance. Reduce meetings by asking ""could this meeting be an email,"" set clear boundaries on business hours and do not reward work done outside of those business hours.


Teams that flourish in the four-day workweek have a concise set of documented goals and expectations. They know what is in scope for their role and out of scope for their role. They have the confidence to push back on work outside of their job descriptions.Also, encourage employees to set healthy boundaries based on their primary job responsibilities. Normalize pushing back when people ask more from you with clever phrases like, ""If I helped you, I'd be letting others down"" or ""I would be unable to do a good job on your project and my other work would suffer.""As a leader, paint a picture of what good looks like. Measure performance objectively based on specific, measurable data to set your team up for success. For example, my team does quarterly key performance indicators (KPIs). Each team member selects three broad goals with specific tactics that are easy to measure completion on. We evaluate them at the end of each quarter to inform quarterly bonuses and pay increases.Related: Want to Work A 4-Day Workweek? Here's What It Takes


Do a trial runIf your team is skeptical about the four-day workweek, try it first. Set an expectation for a time period for the trial, define what success looks like and gather perspectives at the end of the trial. My team has committed to our trial period at the start of the year. We are shifting to longer hours Monday through Thursday, proactively managing expectations with our clients and blocking time on our calendars for critical tasks aligned with our KPIs.We also looked ahead to the year and blocked time off when we know we are traditionally slow. We plan to take time off on holiday weeks, summertime and spring and fall break times. That way we can be available when our clients are traditionally busier by proactively planning our work schedules around past known seasonality.One of the few downfalls to the four-day workweek is time for creative work for folks with diverse backgrounds. With less time to wonder and banter with colleagues informally, the status quo can endure. Innovation time should also be prioritized and fit into the new work week. Our team schedules regular creative project time throughout the month to remind us to continue to rethink work.Flexible work environments like the four-day workweek are known to help diversify workplaces. With this new model, our team hopes to retain our diverse team and also attract more talent from diverse backgrounds.

87,Not Where You Want to Be with Diversity and Inclusion? Consider a Bite-Sized Approach.,"Jan 17, 2023",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/struggling-with-your-dei-efforts-try-a-bite-sized-approach/440301,"
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is a relationship. Relationships take time and trust — but trust is hard to earn and easy to lose. As with any relationship, DEI is a journey, not a destination. It's not a check-the-box, one-and-done type of thing; it is a long-term commitment.Unfortunately, many organizations make the mistake of looking at DEI short-term vs. long-term. They reduce budgets during economic downturns, flex activities with the news cycle or structure programming around holidays and cultural celebrations (instead of weaving them throughout the year).To combat this inauthentic approach, I prefer the snackable approach to DEI. In a recent Diversity Pivot podcast, VP at Delta Faucet Company and hopeful ally Jon Dartt shared that his organization makes DEI a part of every gathering. At each team meeting, they have a short exercise sometimes using a pre-work (article, video, podcast), and discuss the content openly as a group. They share ideas and move into their other agenda items fluidly after. These types of activities weave DEI into the culture and embed practices rather than feeling separate or ad-hoc.



The organization now has a monthly DEI topic that their corporate training department provides content on for all managers to surface and discuss these issues with their teams. Content could focus on a variety of things from microaggressions to inclusive language to cultural celebrations. The key is it keep consistent and intentional with the content, garner feedback from teams on what they want to learn about, and have the flexibility to co-create or source content from experts inside or outside of your organization. My team has a plethora of vetted resources we have collected over the years.Once you have an intentional consistent rhythm to DEI, these issues will likely serve.


Do we make DEI programming mandatory?What do we do when senior leaders do not show up at DEI programs?How much time should we expect to spend on DEI work?These are important questions to answer in advance of rolling out a bite-sized program. Be proactive and be clear with expectations because people will ask. Have a clear why communicated from the senior-most leaders so that people understand what this means and why it matters to the organization versus getting defensive and finding excuses they cannot participate.Related: Dear Leaders: Stop Making These Excuses About the Lack of DiversityDo we make DEI programming mandatory?I am not a big believer in making any type of training mandatory. It conjures up associations with sexual harassment training and other forms of training that feel like the organization is trying to protect itself from lawsuits. Yet, when you don't set a clear expectation for people to attend, you tend to get more of the people that are already passionate about it in attendance, and not the people that really need the training. The people that really need the content usually prioritize other work instead because usually that work is more valued by the organization (especially at performance review times).I like the word expected. We expect you to attend these training programs, especially for people leaders. This is a part of your overall development just like any other leadership or change management training the organization has throughout the year. Plus, inclusive leaders get better business results. It helps them and the organization succeeds.


Related: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Initiatives Are Incomplete Without This Essential DimensionWhat do we do when senior leaders do not show up at DEI programs?I was facilitating a recent client session, and during the ask me anything segment, 20% of the audience asked the above question. It was obvious that people that were already advanced in their DEI education were present at the program, yet it was painfully obvious that the senior leadership team was not. This happens all too often.People take their cues on what's expected from senior leaders. When senior leaders emphasize certain skills or programs, people take note. Leaders model what's expected of the rest of the organization. Therefore, it is critical that they are present for DEI programs. Even better, have them share a short intro or outro emphasizing the importance, the continual focus on DEI and key developments and commitments show everyone that it truly is important.Senior leaders have a lot of tasks vying for their time. I would recommend having them rotate leadership roles on key programs and be responsible for at least one or two a year. It sends a huge signal to the rest of the organization when they speak up and attend alongside their teams.


Related: You Have to Weave DEI Into Your Financial Goals If You Want Your Business to Survive. Here's Why.How much time should we expect to spend on DEI work?With the DEI bite-sized approach, the benefit is that it doesn't take days off the calendar for folks. They can sprinkle it in around their existing workload. That said, there are varying ideas of how much time people should be spending on DEI work. First, if someone is involved in an Employee Resource Group (ERG), DEI committee or council and is already spending several hours a month doing work for those initiatives, that's probably enough (and that is their decision). For folks that aren't as involved in DEI work, the organization needs to decide how much time is reasonable to produce the shift in behavior they are hoping to achieve.In a recent LinkedIn poll, 60% of people in my network thought leaders should spend five or more hours per month on DEI work. Many commented that it should be a part of their job description and regular workload so it doesn't feel like an extra thing to do. In an ideal world, I completely agree. The key to setting a time expectation is to make sure that people truly have the capacity to do the work well, that it can be measured and people can be held accountable to the chosen standard.With a modern LMS system, this is easy to measure and hold people accountable to. Our clients have the most success with virtual self-paced programs with short video lessons and additional resources and workbook activities to take action.


The key to bite-sized DEI programs is to let people choose their own adventures. They'll be more bought in and likely to take action with what they learned.

88,4 Criteria Diverse Talents Use to Evaluate Their Prospective Employers,"Jan 5, 2023",Clair Kim,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-criteria-diverse-talents-use-to-evaluate-their/374295,"
The number of companies seeking to diversify, and in turn strengthen, their talents continues to grow as the world continues its efforts to embrace inclusivity in the workplace. Although this is generally good news, one can say that there is substantial room for growth when it comes to how this diversity is handled in actuality.This room for growth, in turn, leaves substantial room for keen evaluation — and one not done by the employers, but by the talents of under-represented backgrounds themselves. So, the question is: what do these talents seek in a company? How can employers wow these prospective applicants? Let's take a look.1. Stance and progression

89,5 Tips For Building a Strong Leadership Team,"Dec 27, 2022",Vincent Tricarico,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-ways-you-can-build-a-strong-leadership-team/440624,"
Laying the foundation for a powerful leadership team starts with a business assessment and a self-assessment. What does the business need to achieve, and how can our leadership teams get us there?I tend to look at things globally, but while I can see things in a micro way to determine the next steps, I like to lean on my teams to dig down into the details as they come up with a knock-out marketing and sales strategy, stellar creative, rock-solid and accurate financials and innovative thinking that are all informed by five guiding tips.Related: 22 Qualities That Make a Great Leader



1. Determine what goals and priorities the business needs to focus onWhen determining the base needs of the business, you have to look at who's already on your team. Here's a good example. I have a person in a manager's seat right now, but I'm mentoring him to be a director because what I've identified in him are many of the key personality qualities that a leader and a leadership team need.Intelligence is key. I refer not only to business intelligence but also to emotional intelligence. This includes understanding how to interact with people and the business requirements. They are two different things, but both are required of a leader. You need to be organized, and you need to have really good communication skills.


You also need to be able to say no. I want my leadership team to be strong enough to know the difference between what we should say yes to and what we should say no to because I'm relying on them to run their parts of the business and then report to me. Therefore, I need to have trust that they understand what it means to say no — and they can only know that if they understand the business as a complete operation.For example, if there's a need for someone to jump in the warehouse and pack boxes, then so be it. The fact that my warehouse leader was packing orders on a Monday shows the rest of his team and me that he's not going to ask anyone to do something that he's not willing to do himself.Related: Setting Measurable Goals Is Critical to Your Strategic Plan (and Your Success). Here's Why.2. Never forget the importance of ""right people, right seats.""Do they get it? Do they want it? Do they have the capacity to do it? And then there are measurables that give us an idea if they are meeting those criteria. We're a little obsessed about this, but it's important.


One thing that guides a strong leadership team foundation is the establishment of core values. What does the business stand for, and what are those values?In our business, one of the things that we really believe in is customer relationships built on trust. Another one is minding the small details. Little things matter. This can be the little nuances of contract manufacturing or providing more service to our customers.You want to go out and find a leadership team that lives the core values every minute of every day that they are in the building, hybrid or remote — because it is through their leadership, their belief in those values, and how they exemplify them that provides the blueprint of how an employee should act.Remember that every employee, not just leaders, builds a company's reputation and goodwill.Related: As a Leader: Never Compromise Your Core Values3. Leaders should be able to pivot, make adjustments and change courseIf you're going to be in business and think things are going to stay the same, you're not in the right field and should do something else. There's an excellent quote that I read recently from Jeff Bezos, where he said that ""every day needs to be day one.""He said that day one is when you're entirely customer-obsessed and constantly looking to grow the business. On day one of a business, you're asking what we can do to wow our customers. How can we provide value? You never want to leave day one because, once it becomes day two, it's now on a path to stagnation.I agree with that. Part of day one thinking is understanding that things change. It's being resilient enough to change course, evaluating things on the fly, knowing what's working and rapidly driving resources to what's working.


How do you bring the best out in your teams? In baseball, it's catchers that have a unique perspective. They're managing the pitcher and see the game from a perspective only they can see.They're watching the game unfold in front of them. Nine innings, 162 games a year for 20 years, or however long they're behind the plate. They're great leaders in the sport because they understand the game at a level that other players can't.I think that that's a big part of when you're looking to develop a quality leadership team. Those are the kind of skills that you want to see.Be like a catcher.


4. Knowing that honest mistakes, smart risk and bold action are often neededWhat I believe in is that you want to give people smart authority. You want to let them understand the guardrails within their sphere and encourage people to own things. You give people a chance to accept responsibility, take full responsibility for something and give them goals for what you want them to accomplish. Then set them free to go out and do it.When they make mistakes, they learn something. It's through honest mistakes that real learning happens. We grow up in a culture where everything has to be mistake-free and perfect. In reality, however, the best and most successful entrepreneurs are founded out of risk. If you remove the risk from your business as you're operating it, how can you ever grow? How can you ever move to the next level?You want to allow your team and leaders to grow and make what I call ""smart mistakes"" — honest mistakes that are not due to carelessness or recklessness. It's okay to make a mistake when you've gone through the process of making a good decision.I also believe in ""smart risk,"" — where you think more outside the box. Smart risk is, for example, taking a reasonable chance on a well-thought-out opportunity.


In marketing, there's the whole theory of test and rest. Try something, give it a time frame, and look at the results. Did it work? Yes, then throw more at it. If not, what did we learn, why didn't it work and what could we tweak?Related: 7 Mistakes Leaders Make When Managing a Remote Team5. Blending diverse talents can create a force multiplier effectThe best example that I can give is a hockey team. There are usually four lines on a hockey team, and traditionally, you have the top six that score. You have two lines of forwards that go out there, and their job is to generate offense and control the puck in the other team's zone. But if you have four lines like that, then who's playing defense?So, you complement those lines with somebody who's maybe a bit more physical, somebody who likes to agitate. While you certainly need to score goals, you also need the passers, the players who keep the team spirits up, and the enforcers where necessary.


Same thing in business. You have to have a leadership team that's not an echo chamber. In echo chambers, there are no divergent views or solutions. When you look at things like marketing and sales, you want different opinions so you have the best chance to make a decision that helps the business move forward.Related: Ensuring Diversity Is Not a Distraction to LeadersWhile values can be shared, talents should be unique. People should be able to work together and respect each other's aptitudes and viewpoints because I believe that creates a high tide in which all boats can float.My feedback about our vice president of sales from her employees is that ""She is the best manager I ever worked for because she empowers me to own things and do the best job I can.""


That's what I call great leadership.

91,Intent vs. Impact: What Leaders Need to Know to Create a Safe Space,"Dec 22, 2022",Elayna Fernandez,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-leaders-can-create-a-safe-space-and-improve/440465,"
I was sitting next to my brother in the backseat when a motorcycle driver recklessly swerved in front of us. The car driver, a recent acquaintance who had offered to give us a ride home from school, tried maneuvering the car to avoid hitting him. He didn't hurt him, but the car flipped in a matter of seconds, and we crashed.I ended up with 19 broken bones, an eight-day coma, costly medical bills, loss of income and college education, and a long and painful recovery process.There are two ways to react to this story.



1. Focusing on intent""I'm sure the motorcycle driver was just in a hurry.""""I'm sure the driver was just trying to do what was right.""""An accident is unintentional by definition.""2. Focusing on impact""I'm sad to hear you were hurt.""""Were any others hurt?""""Is everyone alive and well now?""While most or maybe all of the intent-focused statements might be true, and the thoughts may come up automatically and involuntarily, they are not helpful when expressed to someone in pain or distress.One of the ways we invalidate people is by highlighting our innocent intentions or those of others.


What is intent, and what is impact?Intent is the idea or desire behind our language, behavior or lack of words or actions. It's what we mean by our words or action.Impact is the effect our words, action, silence or inaction have on another person or community. It's how our words, actions, silence or inaction are felt, experienced, and understood by another.Intent vs. impact - What is the difference?Intent is the desired aim or goal of your words, actions, silence or inaction, so it is the impact you set out to create, while impact is how someone receives or perceives what you do or share. It's what the listener hears, understands and feels, which is not guaranteed to match what the speaker expected. The listener is not a mind reader, so they will only be able to interpret the reality of your actions based on experience.Each party will filter the situation through their own history, cultural context, beliefs, feelings and worldview.Related: How Does Inclusive Culture Boost Company Performance?Prioritizing impactAn inclusive leader understands that even the best intentions could result in a negative impact. However, an inclusive leader prioritizes impact to be respectful and validate the experience of the team member who feels hurt or distressed.Does intent even matter?The motorcycle driver kept on going, and we never found out who he was or if he even noticed what happened, and no one took his license plate or called the police. But if he had been prosecuted, his intent would have mattered in a court of law.Both drivers would have probably been found innocent or charged in any way that could never reflect this car accident's impact on my life.


Besides the apparent health, financial consequences and opportunity costs, this event has been highly debilitating to my mental health. It's been more than 25 years, and I still experience anxiety and even panic attacks related to driving. And there is so much more!But even in a courtroom, the intent also matters. If there had been evidence of the intent of harm, the accident would have instantly become a crime.Acknowledging the impact of our conversations is imperative to create a safe place where people can be vulnerable.However, it is essential to allow people to express their intent after being held accountable for the unintended consequences of their actions. When we explore both the impact and the intent, we can create connection, foster curiosity and communicate care.


Related: Why Our Best Intentions Might Not Be Interpreted as the BestAvoiding invalidationWhen someone voices a concern, we must avoid and discourage these invalidating statements:""I didn't mean any harm.""""I'm sorry you feel that way. That was not my intention.""""It was just a joke!""A great leader does not deny, dismiss or downplay the impact words and behavior cause and educates others. This is especially crucial when seeking to create an inclusive environment.For instance, as an immigrant to the United States and a woman of color, I have often been the target of discrimination, microaggressions and subtle (and overt) acts of exclusion. I have had thousands of conversations with people who have had similar experiences and are equally passionate advocates but don't feel safe speaking out because:


They've learned that claiming a lack of bad intent or a lack of knowledge gets people off the hook.They end up being shamed for their feelings, experiences and perceptions.They don't see a change in the environment.Promoting a culture where everyone feels safe, seen and supported requires an impact-focused, intent-inclusive approach.Related: 9 Best Practices to Improve Your Communication Skills and Become a More Effective LeaderMy 3-step communication model When there's an intent vs. impact gap, we can bridge it with what I call ""Communication CPR."" The three elements of Communication CPR are:Care: Focusing on validating the impacted person.Perspective: Allowing the affected person to provide their perspective and then exploring the other person's intent.Repair: Taking immediate action to make the necessary shifts to assure resolution, reconciliation and restitution.Start Communication CPR today!There were two drivers and three passengers in that car accident, and I'm grateful we all survived. When you practice the Communication CPR model in the workplace, your team's harmony and morale will also survive and thrive.When we focus on impact and explore intent, we can avoid otherness and create workplaces and communities that are safe, welcoming and inclusive, both in our personal and professional life.


Are you willing to try impact-focused intent-inclusive communication?

92,Dear Leaders: Stop Making These Excuses About the Lack of Diversity,"Dec 22, 2022",Julie Kratz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/dear-leaders-stop-making-these-excuses-about-the-lack-of/439417,"
The workplace is changing quickly. As with any change, leaders fear what they don't understand. Diversity, equity and inclusion can be polarizing topics for today's leaders, especially those in the majority. With that fear, there is resistance to change or denial that a problem truly exists.Just because the workplace works for the majority group doesn't mean it works for everyone.Very few workplaces are as diverse and inclusive as they would like to be. In fact, the majority of folks do not feel a sense of belonging at work. According to Great Place to Work, a sense of belonging is one of the top three most important reasons employees give for leaving their job. Belonging has real tangible benefits, with belonging people are:



Three times more likely to feel people look forward to coming to workThree times more likely to say their workplace is funNine times more likely to believe people are treated fairly regardless of their raceFive times more likely to want to stay at their company a long timeInstead of resisting diversity and inclusion, leaders need to embrace it as a competitive advantage — yet all too often, they are apathetic statements and actions in direct resistance to this necessary change.Related: 5 Reasons Leaders Fail to Transform DEI Rhetoric into Action


Common excusesIn the eight years of leading diversity equity and inclusion training and consulting inside Fortune 500 companies, I often hear, ""we can't find diverse candidates,"" ""folks with diverse backgrounds don't stay"" or ""our industry is not diverse."" While these statements might feel true, they often are not based on real data or experiences.Excuse #1: We can't find diverse candidatesIf you were fishing and not catching fish, would you blame the fish? Similarly, if you were gardening and your plants weren't doing well, would you blame the plants? Why are we blaming diverse talents for our inability to find them? The world is incredibly diverse and with access to a hybrid work environment, there is an increased ability to attract diverse talent. This could be caregivers, folks with disabilities and people in different parts of the world. Diverse talent has never been so accessible.Diversity means doing things differently. If you're struggling to find diverse candidates, you likely need to look at how you're recruiting for diversity. Are you going to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)? Or posting on global job websites and approaching folks in marginalized communities? Veterans and persons with disabilities are very underemployed and are ripe for recruitment.


Excuse #2: Folks with diverse backgrounds don't stayDiversity doesn't work without inclusion. As you are building a diverse pipeline of candidates, it is important to ensure that the workplace environment is inclusive so that they will stay. There's no point in hiring a talent if you risk losing them in the short term. Turnover is costly, estimated at 1.5 to 2 times the person's salary and can reinforce a self-fulfilling narrative that diversity is too much work.Make sure that your onboarding process is inclusive. Consider buddying up people from marginalized groups with other folks and marginalized groups and get them involved in employee resource groups so they have a safe haven to share their experiences. Check in regularly with diverse groups to ensure that they're having an inclusive experience. Stay interview data is far more actionable and proactive than exit interview data where people have little incentive to be honest.Excuse #3: Our industry is not diverse


No industry is diverse. Even nonprofits are largely run by white men. There is no industry that's dominated by women or people of color, especially as you go up in leadership rank in the organization. Front lines are often filled with diversity, yet that precipitously diminishes at the top of organizations.Why not try to be an industry leader in diversity? One of my clients in tech did just that with their female founder. My client intentionally built a diverse and inclusive company in an extremely white male-dominated industry. She models flexibility and embraces a culture of trust where people can bring their weirdness. She also does regular diversity and inclusion training to make sure people understand it's embedded in the culture. They have over 50% women in their organization and mirror representation of communities of color as a result.Related: Stop Focusing on the 'Pipeline Problem.' Tech's Diversity Issues Run Deeper.Strategies to overcome excusesTired of hearing these excuses? Try using Kristen Pressner's Flip It to Test It framework. The strategy flips the dimension of difference, i.e., race or gender, to help playfully yet directly question the person that made the excuse. Ask, does that still make sense if we are referring to the majority group? Or, if we were talking about the majority group, would you still say that? This helps stop excuses at the moment they happen and normalizes a culture where we call people in to be more inclusive.


Leaders struggle to find the words at the moment to combat these excuses. Consider adding these talk tracks to your back pocket when confronting a diversity excuse.That's not true. In fact…What makes you say that?I used to think that as well, but have come to realize that…Did you know that…My perspective is different…Let's dig into that assumption more…Help me understand why you said that…Let's dig into the data before making that assumption…If you want to build a culture of inclusion where people feel like they belong, it starts with questioning assumptions. Letting excuses go unchecked leads to self-limiting beliefs that prevent inclusion from working. Practice debunking the myths of diversity and model it for others around you. Your culture just might become more inclusive.Related: The Great Resignation is a Chance to Get Serious About Diversity

93,The Future of Work: 4 Ways Companies Can Evolve to Usher in the Future of the Workplace,"Dec 20, 2022",Dean Guida,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-ways-companies-can-adapt-to-the-future-of-work/440004,"
It's no secret that the workplace has dramatically transformed over the past couple of years. We've traded in the days of rigid office schedules (not to mention desk lunches), blurred lines between work and personal lives and siloed teams for flexible workplaces that prioritize collaboration, transparency and work-life balance. This hasn't been an overnight transformation–but one that's required overhauling internal processes, implementing new technology and reevaluating traditional ideas.And the transformation process is still ongoing. This new era of the workplace is continuing to evolve–and companies will need to evolve with it to keep employees engaged and drive productivity across the entire organization.Here are four ways companies can evolve to make way for the future of the workplace:Related: 4 Things for Employers to Consider About the Future of Work1. Place data at the center of collaborationWe live in a data-rich environment, with most companies sitting on excess data. But as much data as businesses have, there's usually a lack of access to it because everything is siloed and owned by various stakeholders and departments across the organization.



We'll start to see these data silos break down as companies move towards digital workplace tools. In the digital workplace, teams can easily access and bring multiple data sources together to get a full-picture overview of their business and make more informed decisions.While decisions have long been ruled by the highest-ranking official or loudest person in the room, we'll see data opening dialogue between team members and lending itself to fresh ideas. With data as the center of team communications, businesses will see collaboration increase, and teams will drive more intelligent, more informed decisions.Related: How to Lead With Empathy Powered by Data2. Make way for the next generation of workersThe next generation of workers is entering the workplace, and companies must evolve their internal processes and reevaluate their workplace tools as this group's presence continues to grow.


As digital natives, this new generation of workers won't settle for workplace tools with poor user experience or usability — their priority is simple and fast. Their need for speed also extends into communication, looking for instant communication with team members. This means they prefer chat to email and brief messages over paragraphs.The teams that prioritize this way of working in the new year will be those that are welcoming — and retaining — this next generation in their workplace.3. Prioritize the rebuilding of workplace cultureOver the past two years, companies have focused on driving productivity while teams work remotely. They've integrated new tools and processes to drive efficiencies and productivity. During this transition, companies have supported employees at home with at-home care packages, online events and 1:1 Zoom check-ins — but today's employees need more.Companies will need to work to rebuild their company's culture and extend what teams used to have in the office – to fully remote and hybrid teams. Companies will look to further streamline workflow and communication so teams can better collaborate and always feel like part of something bigger. This will help to combat quiet quitting and connect team members to their part in driving success in the overall business.


As companies double down on company culture, their big focuses should be on driving increased communication and transparency across the organization, building a desirable work environment where employees want to show up–both remotely and in person, and bringing a sense of team and community back to the workplace.Related: Why it's Important to Build a Good Work Culture4. Upskill employees to drive success in the digital workplaceCompanies have accelerated the digitization of their business, with a large majority of companies taking on tech-focused initiatives, like automation, AI and moving to the cloud. While these initiatives are critical to business growth, they can only be successful if workers are digitally skilled.To increase the adoption of these initiatives, companies must foster an environment that will upskill employees–specifically developing digital skills–to drive the adoption of new technologies and digitized processes.


Companies must start to put their focus on advancing digital skills within the organization – if they haven't already. The companies that don't risk falling behind in driving necessary business growth.As companies usher in this new era of the workplace, they'll have to evolve to meet their employees with the technology, tools and work environment to drive increased collaboration, productivity and more informed decision-making. This will keep employees engaged and, ultimately, create business growth for the organization.

94,"""No One Wants To Work Anymore"" Is a Phrase Old as Dirt. Here's How to Really Attract and Retain Employees in the New Age of Work","Dec 19, 2022",Larry Jones,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-attract-and-retain-employees-in-the-new-age-of-work/439686,"
You've undoubtedly heard about the so-called ""anti-work"" movement if you're a business owner or entrepreneur. According to a slew of media outlets, nobody wants to work anymore. Even worse, those businesses that can find people to hire have trouble retaining talent amid outrageous demands, quiet quitting, and worse.Indeed, there is a growing rift between employers and employees. But if you look closely, it's nothing new nor indicative of some ""anti-work"" movement. The idea of business owners lamenting ""no one wants to work anymore"" is so old you could likely find it carved on the pyramids.The truth is this: workers have more options than ever before. If you, as an employer, are not making your business a desirable workplace, you'll need help attracting and retaining employees. You might recognize this as less of a ""crisis of work ethic"" and more of a failure of employers to keep up with changing needs.



Related: Happy Employees Create Happy CustomersAttraction starts with finding out what employees wantIf you own a business, you should have at least some knowledge of basic capitalism. If so, you might recognize that the entire system relies on choice. Your clients choose your products and not your competitors' because you incentivize them in some way. Well, the same is true of employees. As with your customers, you need to find out what employees want — and what they want changes over time.


Unfortunately, many ""old school"" employers are too inflexible to consider this. To them, the mere offering of a job should be enough to inspire not only action but loyalty. But that doesn't work in a world where employees can merely join the app-based gig economy (Fiverr, DoorDash, Lyft) if they don't like their current job. Sure, the pay is variable, and the benefits are nonexistent, but such jobs offer flexibility, which is in high demand among modern workers.So if you want to figure out what employees want, that's your first stop. According to this Pew Research Study, most workers who quit their jobs cite low pay, few opportunities for advancement and a general feeling of being ""disrespected"" as reasons for leaving. Other reasons included ""not enough flexibility"" and ""too many"" or ""too few"" hours.You might recognize these as perfectly valid reasons to leave a job. While the media may make it seem like all employees are demanding to work from home, get free childcare or have an on-site brewery, today's employees want what employees have always wanted. They want to be paid fairly, treated well and have a chance to climb the ladder.Related: Improve Employee Retention By Taking a People-First Approach


Retention is about finding the ""them"" in the teamEvery year, magazines put out their list of ""Best Companies to Work For."" But rather than cite the companies with trampolines in their meeting rooms and corporate retreats to Bali, the top-ranked positions are typically occupied by companies that treat their employees respectfully and pay attention to their needs.The standout criteria for why employees loved working for top companies were as follows:98% — I can take time off from work when I think it's necessary.98% — When you join the company, you are made to feel welcome.97% — Management is honest and ethical in its business practices.97% — I'm proud to tell others I work here.97% — People care about each other here.Every single item on that list is personal. It's something that the company provides its employees, either literally or emotionally. There's nothing about ""sky-high salaries"" or ""office perks,"" just references to how working at the company makes them feel.Of course, most employers already know this but either choose to forget it or prefer to imagine the problem as a lack of work ethic. The truth is that attracting and retaining employees comes down to treating them like part of the team from day one. It's about making them feel important and valued. The companies that top that ""Best Places to Work"" list see their employees as assets, not indentured servants who should feel lucky to have a job.


Returning to the discussion about what employees want, it's crucial to consider the ""upward mobility"" factor. Many employers lose perfectly good, perfectly happy employees because they don't have a chance for advancement. With nowhere to grow in their current job, the employees have no choice but to look elsewhere.That's why it's so important to provide a ""light at the end of the tunnel."" Educate your team members so that they can move up the ladder. Moreover, reward them financially when they do. And if your business isn't big enough to provide them a place to go, invest in them anyway so they can continue their career elsewhere.Related: Google's CEO Is Asking Employees 3 Simple Questions to Boost ProductivityEmployers need to be more than just ""job givers""In the end, attracting and retaining employees is about making them feel like they're a part of something greater than just a 9-5 job. Of course, there are dozens — perhaps hundreds — of ways to do this.


Some of the best strategies include making custom plans for each employee's future and following through when they fulfill their side of the agreement. You might view their job as an opportunity for you to help them rather than for them to help you. You might learn to welcome feedback, avoid micromanagement and recognize and reward outstanding performances.Despite what some news outlets say, there is no ""anti-work"" movement. If anything, hiring and retaining talent issues result from employers failing to recognize what potential employees want or provide what they promise. As with the last 100+ years, all it takes to get good employees is to stop treating them like a number and treat them like valuable team members.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

And so the anecdote continues…..A woman, a man and an elephant walk into the boardroom……(insert quippy reflection here). The truth is that 92% of the time, a man will secure his place in the boardroom, and only 8% of these elite corporate heads are female. The elephant in the room is the apparent lack of females with a seat at the table.



With the disparate ratio of male CEOs to female CEOs peppering the landscape of corporate America, the illusion of gender equality needs to be rethought. Gender equality in the workplace is spoon-fed into our ecosystems from an early age. Yet, the results are difficult to quantify as the percentage of CEOs worldwide is predominantly male.If we look back at the emergence of women claiming their spot in the workforce, we must look to Rosie the Riveter and her presence as an integral part of the predominantly male workforce during World War II. Many brought tools home from work and used them on their home repairs. They took on domestic roles they never had before. World War II mobilization affected women by introducing them to new lines of work not typically suited for women at the time.

Richly diverse women joined this call to arms and became involved in this feminist movement. This era of women's rights exploded in the United States and worldwide, forever changing society by expanding rights, opportunities and identities. With all the strides made in the past decades, the United States lags globally, ranking 27th on overall progress.As a young girl in the 80s and 90s, I was taught that there were no limits to my professional aspirations, yet I continued to hit the proverbial glass ceiling. I went to law school, completed a master's certification, and was never taken seriously like my male counterparts. I earned the accolades, wrote the articles, hob-knobbed with the powerful constructs of corporate greatness…and then, nothing.My role as an entrepreneur hinges on those who have gone before me and made a path for females to claim their birthright as CEO of their own corporate dream. Conversations with a mentor or coach are essential in pushing your leadership skills to the next level.


Related: How These 3 Female CEOs Are Driving Workplace Change and Equality for Working MothersIn particular, I remember a conversation with a CEO and Mom-Boss, Tracy Hazzard. Hazzard is the CEO and founder of Podetize who is normalizing the role of a wildly intelligent and unapologetic momma who is balancing the teeter-totter women who believe they can have it all. She taught me the art of embracing carpools, breastfeeding and gobbling up the totality of my female-CEO dreams. She is a curator of female employees who delight in the autonomy of a professionally focused life rooted in family growth.Creating a business model that embraces the idea of female autonomy, coupled with the tools to navigate success, is the blueprint for up-and-coming entrepreneurs who celebrate diversity and champion unlimited potential.Being a mother of four boys, I knew it was essential to their development that they witness their mother be firm in her rise to the top of corporate mayhem in conjunction with the day-to-day toggling of bandaging boo-boos and heralding playdates. These two roles we play as mothers and bosses are a rickety rite of passage that can be accomplished.


Related: 3 Things to Do Today to Achieve Better Work-Life Balance as a Mom EntrepreneurDigging deeper into exploring the qualities of top-tier female CEOs, I recognized a pattern that was the foundation for sustainable success.Build a team — both professionally and personally. The number one mistake entrepreneurs make is doing work others can do. Micromanaging is an exercise in control and binds leaders to unproductive execution. Building a competent team who executes on behalf of your company freed you of time, energy and focus. Hire an executive assistant, hire a marketing guru and lock arms with childcare providers.Find a mentor who has gone before you. Nothing is more important than seeking out and engaging with a leader who understands your path. Mentorship is essential to the executive experience, and many CEOs and Boss Mommas are eager to impart their knowledge to rising stars. Do your research and reach out. Asking questions is more powerful than executing answers.Think differently than your male counterparts. As women, we have the intuitive ability to think differently than our male equals. This is our superpower. Our vantage point is a strength. When women aspire to be a part of the ""boys club,"" we do a disservice to a demographic that yearns to be heard.Understand your strengths and then magnify them by 10xing your strengths. Ask yourself, what are your strengths? I dimmed my light for so long because I wanted to make everyone around me feel comfortable. This left a void in my life that silently diminished my joy. Not until I recognized my strengths in writing and elevating the voices around me did I reach my truest potential.Be confident in your priorities, and do not make excuses. We, as women, tend to make excuses. When asked to perform professional tasks, we minimize our roles as mothers. This results in an imbalance in our lives and creates chaos. We can maintain a healthy equilibrium when we are confident in our priorities and vocalize this to our teams.

96,You Can't Return to The Office Without Defeating These Four Major Battles,"Dec 15, 2022",Gleb Tsipursky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/you-cant-return-to-the-office-without-defeating-these-four/441087,"
As increasing numbers of companies are requiring employees to return to the office for 3 to 5 days per week this fall, they're running into the buzzsaw of what one of my clients called the ""Four Horsemen of the Required Return to Office"" challenges: resistance, attrition, quiet quitting and diversity.The Four Horsemen stem from the fact that workers who are capable of working remotely prefer to do so most or all of the time. For example, an August 2022 Gallup survey of remote-capable workers shows that 34% of respondents want to work full-time remotely, 60% want to work a flexible hybrid schedule and only 6% want to work in a traditional office-centric setting. A June 2022 McKinsey survey of all workers, remote-capable and not, provides further context on preferences for hybrid work. It found that 32% of respondents want to work full-time remotely, 10% want to work remotely four days a week, 16% three days a week, 18% two days a week, 13% one day a week, and 13% prefer full-time in-office work. Thus over half of all respondents want to work less than half the time in the office. And a September 2022 survey from the School of Politics and Economics at King's College reported that 25% of respondents would quit if forced to return to the office full-time.Related: Want Your Employees Back in the Office? Here's How to Make It a Place They Want to Be.



No wonder workers facing return-to-office mandates show resistance, the first of the Four Horsemen. For example, the leadership of Apple required its employees to come to the office three days a week. While Apple employees are not known for stirring trouble, in this case, 1,000 employees signed a petition requesting more flexibility. GM announced in a message on Friday, September 23 that all salaried employees would have to return to the office three days a week. The message sparked intense employee backlash, leading to GM walking back its requirements and delaying any required return to the office to next year.In a September 2022 survey, Gartner found that only 3% of companies would fire non-compliant employees, and only 30% would have HR talk to those who don't show up. No wonder large U.S. banks trying to force employees back to the office are meeting with high rates of noncompliance of up to 50%. And many other employees are showing up for a part of the workday, from 10 to 2 pm. The Labor Day return-to-office mandates resulted in a rise in office occupancy in early September, reaching 47.5% during the week ending September 14 in 10 major cities tracked by Kastle Systems, a security access card provider. Yet the office occupancy declined to 47.3% by the end of the week ending September 21 and to 47.2% the following week.


Given this resistance, some workers simply quit, joining the Great Resignation, making attrition the second of the Four Horsemen. That includes top-level executives: Ian Goodfellow, who led machine learning at Apple, quit in protest over Apple's mandated return to office of three days a week. It also includes many rank-and-file staff, with publications featuring the stories of employees who quit rather than return to the office for 3 to 5 days per week. Or consider a National Bureau of Economic Research paper about a study at Trip.com, one of the largest travel agencies in the world. It randomly assigned some engineers, marketing workers, and finance workers to work some of their time remotely and others in the same roles to full-time in-office work. Those who worked on a hybrid schedule had 35% better retention.Even finance, the industry leading the charge for returning to the office, suffered significant churn. European banks, which offer more flexible hybrid work policies, are using these to hire talented staff from the less flexible U.S. banks. Smaller and more flexible financial planning firms are headhunting financial planners in larger and less flexible companies. Even bankers at the top banks, like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, are leaving due to the return to office requirements.Perhaps even more dangerous than resistance and attrition is the third of the Four Horsemen, quiet quitting. That term refers to employees psychologically disengaging from their work and doing just enough to get by without getting in trouble. Quiet quitting can be worse than the much more obvious resistance or attrition since quiet quitting rots a company's culture from within.Related: Quiet Quitting Is Dividing the Workforce. Here's How to Bring Everyone Back Together.


A September 2022 survey by Gallup found that such quiet quitters make up about half of the U.S. workforce. Forcing employees to come to the office under the threat of discipline leads to disengagement, fear, and distrust, according to Ben Wigert, director of research and strategy for workplace management at Gallup. Indeed, Gallup found that if people are required to come to the office for more time than they prefer, ""employees experience significantly lower engagement, significantly lower well-being, significantly higher intent to leave [and] significantly higher levels of burnout."" By contrast, employees feel gratitude to companies that give them more flexibility and show trust: as one such employee said, ""if my company is going to come in and give me this flexibility, then I'm going to be the first to give them 100%.""Indeed, research by Stanford University even before the pandemic found that workers who spent 4 days a week working remotely were 9% more engaged than in-office staff. Gallup finds that ""the optimal engagement boost occurs when employees spend 60% to 80% of their time — or three to four days in a five-day workweek — working off-site."" A June 2022 Citrix survey finds that 56% of fully-remote workers feel engaged, but only 51% of in-office employees do so. The evidence is backed up by a CNBC survey from June 2022, which found that 52% of fully remote workers say they are very satisfied with their jobs, compared with 47% of workers working full-time in the office. No wonder, then, that mandates forcing employees to come to the office results in quiet quitting.Related: Is Remote Work Responsible for Quiet Quitting? This Behavioral Economist Reveals What He Tells His Clients — and How to Fix It.The final of the Four Horsemen relates to the serious loss of diversity associated with the mandated office return. A Future Forum survey found that 21% of all white knowledge workers wanted a return to full-time in-office work, but only 3% of all Black knowledge workers wanted the same. That's a huge difference. Another Future Forum survey found that 38% of Black men wanted a fully flexible schedule, but only 26% of white men felt the same. The Society for Human Resource Management found that half of all Black office workers wanted to work from home permanently, while only 39% of white workers did so.


Why do we see this difference? It's because Black professionals still suffer from discrimination and microaggressions in the office, and are less vulnerable to harassment in remote work. Similar findings apply to other underrepresented groups.Evidence shows that underrepresented groups are leaving employers who mandate a return to the office and are fleeing to more flexible companies. For example, Meta Platforms offers permanent fully-remote work options. By doing so, Meta found, according to Sandra Altiné, Meta's VP of Workforce Diversity and Inclusion, that ""embracing remote work and being distributed-first has allowed Meta to become a more diverse company."" For example, in 2019, Meta committed to a five-year goal of doubling the number of Black and Hispanic workers in the US and the number of women in its global workforce. Thanks to remote work, Meta's 2022 Diversity Report shows that it attained and even outperformed its 2019 five-year goals for diversity two years ahead of its original plans.While Meta's diversity goals are benefitting from remote work, other companies that offer less flexibility have DEI staff ringing alarm bells about how the desire for remote work among underrepresented groups threatens diversity goals. After all, the workers who are going to Meta are coming from somewhere, right? Underrepresented groups are joining the Great Resignation in greater numbers in the context of the mandated office returns.In working with my clients who wish to bring their employees back to the office to slay the Four Horsemen, I find a combination of strategies to be crucial. Before launching an office return, we consider compensation policies. A June 2022 survey by the Society for Human Resources reports that 48% of survey respondents will ""definitely"" look for a full-time work-from-home job in their next search. To get them to stay at a full-time job with a 30-minute commute, they would need a 20% pay raise. For a hybrid job with the same commute, they would need a pay raise of 10%. A September 2022 survey by Goodhire found that 73% of workers believe companies should pay in-office workers more than remote workers. Indeed, research by Owl Labs suggests that it costs an average of $863 per month for the average office worker to commute to work versus staying at home, which is about $432 per month for utilities, office supplies and so on.


That data helped my clients develop a fair compensation plan that paid staff a higher salary if they spent more time in the office. Doing so helped address the first two Horsemen, resistance and attrition. Some of my clients even used that policy as a simple yet effective incentive to nudge most of their staff to return to the office in a way that minimized resistance and attrition, while saving significantly on the payroll for the small minority who chose to work remotely.Addressing quiet quitting required a range of techniques. One involved working on improving culture and belonging, such as retreats with fun team-building exercises. Another is centered on helping staff address burnout, such as by providing mental health benefits. Finally, it helps if employees feel you care about their professional development: upskilling pays off.To help prevent diversity losses, as well as facilitate underrepresented groups getting promoted, it's valuable to create a formal mentoring program with a special focus on underprivileged staff. That means providing minority staff with two mentors, one from the same minority group and one representing the majority population. Doing so offers the minority mentee a diverse network of connections and experiences to draw on among both minority and majority staff. It provides mentees with the implicit knowledge and relationships they will need to advance, while the fact that each mentee has two mentors lightens the load on each mentor and makes the workload manageable.So if you are committed to returning to a mostly or fully in-person workforce, remember that you need to watch out for — and defeat — the Four Horsemen. Make a plan in advance, and determine how you will overcome these problems before they threaten the success of your return-to-office plan.

97,6 Ways to Support LGBTQIA+ Employees' Mental Health as a Business Leader,"Dec 14, 2022",Chuck H. Shelton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/6-ways-to-support-lgbtqia-employees-as-a-business-leader/439702,"
As a business leader, it's important to be aware of the unique challenges that LGBTQIA+ employees face in the workplace. Mental health is an important issue for all employees, but it can be especially challenging for members of the LGBTQIA+ community to get their mental health needs met, especially as they are often targeted by violence and discrimination. Here are six ways to support LGBTQIA+ employees' mental health in your business.Related: 5 Simple Ways to Do More for Your Employees' Mental Health This Week1. Create a safe and welcoming spaceMake sure that LGBTQIA+ employees feel safe in the workplace by actively creating an environment of inclusion. This includes having policies to prevent discrimination and creating safe spaces where members of the LGBTQIA+ community can come together to socialize and support one another.



Why it works: Studies have shown that environments of inclusion can improve mental health outcomes in the workplace. A safe and welcoming space will help LGBTQIA+ employees feel accepted and supported.2. Provide mental health resourcesMental health resources should be available to all employees, but they are essential for members of the LGBTQIA+ community who may feel isolated or unsupported. Offer resources such as counseling services and employee assistance programs to ensure everyone can access the care they need.


Why it works: Mental health resources are essential for ensuring that employees can care for their mental well-being. These resources allow them to seek help as needed and show that you value your employees' mental health.3. Ensure equal treatmentAll employees should be treated equally and respectfully, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Ensure that policies are in place to guarantee fairness and equality for all employees — equal access to benefits that are important for all members of your workforce. For example, ensure that your medical insurance covers the costs associated with gender affirmation and gender transition healthcare.Why it works: Equal treatment helps create an environment in which LGBTQIA+ employees feel respected and valued, which can go a long way in improving mental health outcomes for community members.4. Be more than an allySupporting LGBTQIA+ employees should go beyond simply creating policies to promote equality. Work to create an environment where employees can openly discuss their identity without fear of judgment or discrimination. Listen, understand and learn from each other.


Why it works: Creating an open and supportive environment encourages dialogue and understanding between employers and employees, which will help reduce stigma and make it easier for members of the LGBTQIA+ community to seek out mental health resources when needed.Related: 7 Ways Entrepreneurs Can Ensure Better Equality at Their Workplace5. Educate yourselfEducate yourself on issues pertaining to the LGBTQIA+ community, such as sexual orientation and gender identity. Doing so, you will be better equipped to create a safe space for all your employees, regardless of their sexuality or gender identity.Why it works: Educating yourself on the relevant issues will help you understand the unique challenges that members of the LGBTQIA+ community face. It also gives you the knowledge and understanding needed to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable and supported.


6. Keep track of trendsExternal factors can affect mental health, such as legislation changes and new policies related to sexuality or gender identity. Stay informed on current events and any laws that may affect your employees so that you can provide support when necessary.Why it works: Keeping track of trends helps employers anticipate potential situations and respond accordingly with resources, education and other forms of assistance, thereby ensuring that all employees have access to the support they need when faced with challenges related to their mental health.By understanding the unique challenges members of the LGBTQIA+ community face and creating policies that promote inclusion, employers can foster an atmosphere of acceptance and respect in the workplace. A supportive workplace includes zero-tolerance policies for violence against LGBTQIA+ members and provides information and resources on mental health. Mental health is an important part of employee well-being, and employers should work to ensure that all employees have access to the care they need.

98,This Silent Productivity Killer is Draining 4 Hours From Your Week. Here's How To Fix It,"Dec 5, 2022",Melanie Fellay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/this-productivity-killer-is-draining-workplace-efficiency/438940,"
The phrase, ""there's an app for that,"" has become so commonplace it's meme-worthy. In our personal lives, apps can scream for us, call for us and tell us when to sit, drink, or even use the restroom.In our professional lives, app-mania is equally prevalent, with Productiv's 2021 report finding the average SaaS company uses 254 apps.Even skimming through my own arsenal, I found logins to five different video conferencing apps, six task management tools and at least five cloud storage solutions.



How did we land in this state of app abundance? Among other reasons, tools offer unique capabilities and levels of familiarity, or often, they're carried with us from other companies. Regardless, the goal has always been to leverage technology to make us more productive and effective in our roles.Unfortunately, what we're experiencing is quite the opposite.Related: The 10 Biggest Productivity Killers and How to Overcome ThemA tale of 1200 togglesThe more tools we rely on to get work done, the more we bounce between those tools throughout the day. Every time we toggle from one app to another, we're ""context-switching.""Have you ever been interrupted while counting and had to start over again? That's context-switching. Your brain's flow state is disrupted and must reset before returning to the original task. In the workplace, the scenario might be that you're creating a contract in your CRM, you forget how to complete the process, and are forced to dig through Google Docs or an LMS to find the answer.According to a report by Qatalog and Cornell University's Idea Lab: On average, people take nine and a half minutes to get back into a productive workflow after switching between digital apps.


How many times do you think this happens to you during the day?A recent study of 20 teams across three Fortune 500 companies found ""that workers toggled roughly 1,200 times each day."" That adds up to four hours each week or four weeks in a year spent simply reorienting yourself.Context-switching is the silent killer secretly draining your team's productivity, focus and mental health.Forget Zoom fatigue. The problem is tool fatigue. For instance, to answer a colleague's question, I'm forced to bounce from Slack to ClickUp to Salesforce to Gmail and then back to Slack again. With every toggle, I'm faced with different layouts, styles, font types and more that force my brain to reacclimate momentarily.


While we're off trying to fix productivity challenges with the newest collaboration or messaging tool, context-switching lurks in the background, compounding as we build more complex systems and networks.Related: How to Focus, Be Productive and Maintain Balance During a CrisisZone-tendingIn sports, we're familiar with getting in the zone (or the flow state). That's why basketball players get thrown off their game with a bad foul call, or golfers can miss a swing if somebody yells. The ""zone"" is a mental state where you're completely immersed and focused on the activity.Within this flow state, you're more creative and productive. The term was coined by positive psychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Jeanne Nakamura. According to them, entering the flow state can lead to clarity, a lack of obstacles, a heavy sense of concentration, and intrinsic positivity.


This state of mind isn't reserved for professional athletes. Imagine the benefits for your employee's mental health and productivity if we embraced environments that enabled a flow state throughout the day.When we're entirely focused on the task, 100% of our mental energy is devoted to solving that task. But, with every toggle, a piece of that energy is drained, and our cognitive load increases, slowing down our ability to process information.Imagine your brain is a computer with dozens of tabs and files open. Eventually, you'll reach storage capacity and see that terrifying spinning wheel alerting you the computer is bogged down and unresponsive.Your brain functions the same way. Your working memory can only hold so many pieces of information simultaneously. Switching from app to app increases your cognitive load until you can't process any more information.


How can we get in the zone if our brain has maxed out capacity from context-switching? Here are some ways to protect your mental energy and reduce the toggling tax.Related: 10 Tips to Boost Employee Productivity and Skyrocket Performance1. Enable employees within their existing workflowsHow can you eliminate or reduce the need for employees to context-switch? Let's say your sales team works predominately in Salesforce, but they often toggle to their PowerPoint for answers to questions. Just-in-time learning solutions will automatically surface the training, resources or guidance employees need to succeed directly within Salesforce or other tools they're already working in. Employees can stay focused on the task without needing to hop around apps for help.2. Eliminate tool redundancyAs we navigate this impending recession, many companies like ourselves are shifting from a grow-at-all-costs mentality to a long-term, sustainable growth mindset. Context-switching aside, we can no longer justify having two separate calendar scheduling solutions when there's a sufficient version in our marketing automation platform. While these times are challenging, they've also helped us reduce context-switching by ensuring only necessary tools remain in our tech stack.


3. Designate work blocks (and stick with them)On Mondays, our sales team turns off all notifications, blocks all meetings, and focuses entirely on prospecting. On Wednesdays and Fridays, our marketing team blocks off afternoons for uninterrupted work blocks where they can focus completely on their projects. Whatever this looks like for your organization, ensure every team dedicates time throughout the week to complete work without distractions.4. Remove distractions as much as possibleYou've had years of practice multitasking. It's not unusual to have 30 tabs open, news headlines in the background, and notifications buzzing during work. But multitasking is the enemy of productivity. Instead, focus on single-tasking throughout the day. Chunk your work into blocks based on a single task and try to focus only on that task for the allotted time. Create an environment that eliminates unnecessary distractions and see how that impacts your productivity.Above all else, listen, watch and speak to your employees. See how many applications they need to open to find a resource, watch as they navigate complex processes, listen to their challenges and understand where they're getting stuck. With this in mind, you can begin to relieve their toggle fatigue and move from ""there's an app for that"" to ""it's in the app you're in.""

100,"If You Want More Women in Leadership, You Have to Enact Concerted Change. Here's How.","Nov 11, 2022",Crystal Crump,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/if-you-want-more-women-leaders-you-have-to-clear-the-path/436776,"
Since the dawn of time, women have been flexing their leadership skills. They've served as executives, politicians, matriarchs and teachers. They've created beautiful art, pioneered groundbreaking innovations, penned prominent literature, managed households and advocated for human rights. Without a doubt, society is better off for women's work — yet women continue to be underrepresented as leaders in modern workplaces.Just look at STEM. Popular media might have you believe that we've defeated the gender gaps in these fields — or, at least, made representation gains. But this couldn't be further from the truth. The ratio of women to men in tech roles has actually slid back over the past 35 years, according to Accenture. Up to half of the women in tech leave by the time they turn 35, resulting in under 20% of CIOs and CTOs being women.We've seen a similar workplace exodus over the past two years as millions of working women decided to stay home to care for children and aging parents. For the working women who stayed, it hasn't been easy, either. On top of the added pressure and fatigue of the pandemic, McKinsey found that women are doing more to support their teams, including advancing DEI efforts, mentoring and championing underrepresented women on their teams. Despite that, women held under 30% of senior management roles in 2020.



These are the very leaders you cannot afford to lose right now, so how can you ensure that you're setting women up to successfully reach executive positions when experienced employees and women are most likely to leave the workforce? Start with these three strategies.Related: Thousands Of Women Haven't Rejoined The Workforce. Here's How To Get Them Back.


1. Provide at-work networking opportunitiesIn business, it's often about who you know. But for millennia, the spaces designed for professional networking inherently kept women and other marginalized individuals away.Additionally, it's often hard for women to attend after-hours networking events as they juggle personal commitments. This goes double for working mothers, who still shoulder most household duties compared with their male partners. To remedy this imbalance, you need to provide networking and training opportunities during the 9 to 5 — whether that means allocating the budget to allow more equitable opportunities to attend industry conferences, hosting on-site events yourself or finding virtual opportunities for women to learn and network with their peers.That said, entrance to networking opportunities will do women little good if they ultimately don't feel welcome or have a sense of belonging. So consider creating safe spaces for women to network with other women. From a cultural perspective, people want to see representation in the workplace.The benefits will be twofold. More women will have the opportunity to connect with colleagues and other industry professionals. Additionally, incorporating networking opportunities into the workday itself (rather than in addition to the 40-hour workweek) can help counter rampant pandemic-related burnout, which is particularly prevalent among women. Per McKinsey, one-third of women thought about leaving the workforce or downshifting their careers in 2021.

Men aren't leaders more often because men are better suited to the job but because of deeply ingrained biases and societal attitudes against women's leadership potential.Case in point: One 2021 analysis of a large retail chain found that while women made up 56% of entry-level workers, they made up only 14% of district managers. Despite the women employees earning better performance ratings, they often received lower ""potential scores"" (i.e. how much their managers believed they'd grow and develop) and therefore were not as likely to advance up the rungs.In response, you need to create strong professional development plans and, where possible, promotion pathways for women employees. If women don't see an achievable pathway to success, they may choose to exit. Indeed, 77% of women say the largest barrier to gender equity is the lack of information on how to advance.


Related: How to Make Company Flex Schedules Work for Everyone3. Create flexible work schedulesTwo years after the percentage of women in the workforce plunged, it still hasn't recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Indeed, many women will never return to the workforce, not because they didn't find fulfillment in their jobs but because in-office work is no longer feasible for their lifestyles.Remote or hybrid work models don't work for every industry, but if possible, give your employees the option to work from home at least part of the time. At the very least, you need to create a culture that accommodates working mothers. For example, institute guidelines around when internal meetings can be scheduled so they don't compete with school pickup and drop-off times.And if you do go the fully remote route, take steps to ensure that ""working from home"" doesn't turn into ""living at work."" As mentioned, women are more susceptible to burnout due to their outsized responsibilities at home. Define working boundaries for your employees so they're not constantly feeling the pressure to work outside of the ""typical"" workday.

101,Employers Need Workers. Now They're Realizing The Untapped Talent of These People.,"Nov 4, 2022",Gleb Tsipursky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/need-workers-employers-are-realizing-the-untapped-talent/438483,"
If you give any leader the opportunity to increase their talent pool of potential employees by 15% — with all these new hires belonging to an underrepresented minority — they'd jump at the chance, especially given tight labor markets and CEO desires to increase headcount. Yet too few leaders realize that, according to the U.S. government, people with disabilities are the largest minority group in this country, with 50 million — 15% of the population — living with disabilities.Sure, many executives feel concerned by the extra investments involved in providing accommodations for people with disabilities. Yet these accommodations might not involve anything besides full-time remote work, according to a new study by the Economic Innovation Group think tank. The study found that the employment rate for people with disabilities did not simply reach the pre-pandemic level by mid-2022, but rose far past it, to the highest rate in over a decade. Remote work, combined with a tight labor market, explains this high rate, according to the researcher's analysis.Related: 5 Ways Employees With Disabilities Help Maximize a Company's Growth



A bit of history: Employment rates among people with disabilities dropped, along with the rest of the labor market, early in the pandemic. However, they recovered quickly. People with disabilities aged 25 to 54, the prime working age, are 3.5 percentage points more likely to be employed in Q2 2022 than they were pre-pandemic. What about individuals without disabilities? They are still 1.1 percentage points less likely to be employed!That means the labor market recovery for those with disabilities was substantially faster than for those without disabilities. We know that both those with disabilities and those without faced a similar conditions of a tight labor market. Given that, remote work appears to offer the major differentiator that enabled those with disabilities an opportunity to join the workforce.


These statistics align with expert statements. For example, according to Thomas Foley, executive director of the National Disability Institute (NDI), workers with disabilities had been asking to work remotely for decades before the pandemic and had consistently heard companies say ""no."" During the pandemic, he said that when ""we all realized that ... many of us could work remotely ... that was disproportionately positive for people with disabilities.""Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Find Great Talent Despite a Labor ShortageThe benefits of remote work for people with disabilities are particularly relevant due to the impact of long Covid. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that about 19% of those who had Covid-19 developed long Covid. Recent Census Bureau data indicates that 16 million working-age Americans suffer from it, with economic costs reaching $3.7 trillion according to a recent estimate.Certainly, many of these so-called long-haulers experience relatively mild symptoms — such as loss of a sense of smell — which, while troublesome, are not disabling. But others experience symptoms serious enough that they now have a disability.


According to a recent study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, about a quarter of those with long Covid changed their employment status or working hours. That means long Covid was serious enough to interfere with work for 4 million people. For many, this interference was serious enough to qualify as a disability.Indeed, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found in a just-released study that the number of people with disabilities in the U.S. grew by 1.7 million. That growth stemmed mainly from long Covid conditions such as fatigue and brain fog, meaning difficulties with concentration or memory, with 1.3 million people reporting an increase in brain fog since mid-2020.Many had to drop out of the labor force due to the intensity of their long Covid. Yet about 900,000 people who now have a disability have been able to continue working. Without remote work, they might not have.In fact, the author of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York study notes that long Covid can be considered a disability under the Americans with Disability Act, depending on the specifics of the condition. That means the law can require private employers with fifteen or more staff, as well as government agencies, to make reasonable accommodations for those with long Covid. The author notes that ""telework and flexible scheduling are two accommodations that can be particularly beneficial for workers dealing with fatigue and brain fog.""


Related: The Labor Shortage Is Only Getting Worse. What's Causing It and How Can I Avoid Losing Staff?But companies shouldn't need to worry about legal regulations. It simply makes dollars and sense to expand their talent pool by 15% of an underrepresented minority. After all, extensive research shows that improving diversity boosts both decision-making and financial performance.Companies that are offering more flexible work options have already gained significant benefits in terms of diverse hires. In its efforts to adapt to the post-pandemic environment, Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, decided to offer permanent fully remote work options to its current employees and new job applicants. And according to Meta chief diversity and inclusion officer Maxine Williams, the candidates who accepted job offers for remote positions were ""substantially more likely"" to come from diverse communities: people with disabilities, Black, Hispanic, Alaskan Native, Native American, veterans, and women. The numbers bear out these claims: people with disabilities increased from 4.7% to 6.2% of Meta's employees.Having consulted for 21 companies to help them transition to hybrid work arrangements, I can confirm that Meta's numbers aren't a fluke. The more my clients proved willing to offer remote work, the more staff with disabilities they recruited — and retained. That includes more obvious employees, such as those with long Covid symptoms and mobility challenges. But it also includes employees with invisible disabilities, such as immunocompromised people who feel reluctant to put themselves at risk of getting Covid-19 by coming into the office.


Unfortunately, many leaders fail to see the benefits of remote work for underrepresented groups, such as those with disabilities. Some even claim the opposite: thus, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon claimed that returning to the office will aid diversity. What explains this poor executive decision-making?One part of the answer comes from a mental blindspot called the in-group bias. Our minds tend to favor and pay attention to the concerns of those we perceive to be part of our in-group. Dimon and other executives who do not have disabilities don't perceive people with disabilities to be part of their in-group. They thus are blind to the concerns of those with disabilities, which leads to the kind of jaw-dropping statements made by Dimon that returning to the office will aid diversity.In-group bias is one of many dangerous judgment errors known as cognitive biases. These mental blindspots impact decision-making in all life areas, ranging from the future of work to mental fitness.Another relevant cognitive bias is the empathy gap. This term refers to our difficulty empathizing with those who aren't part of our in-group. The lack of empathy combines with the blindness from the in-group bias, causing executives to ignore the feelings of employees with disabilities and prospective hires.


Omission bias also plays a role. This dangerous judgment error causes us to perceive failure to act as less problematic than acting. Consequently, executives perceive a failure to support the needs and interests of those with disabilities as a minor matter.The failure to empower people with disabilities will prove costly to the bottom lines of companies that don't offer remote work options to those who would benefit from such accommodations. They are limiting their talent pool by 15%. Moreover, they're harming their ability to recruit and retain diverse candidates. And as their lawyers and HR departments will tell them, they are putting themselves in legal jeopardy for violating the ADA.By contrast, companies like Meta that offer remote work opportunities are seizing a competitive advantage by recruiting these underrepresented candidates and expanding their talent pool by 15%. They're lowering costs of labor while increasing diversity. The future belongs to the savvy companies that offer the flexibility that people with disabilities need.

102,Solidarity Without Sameness: The Key To Working Together,"Nov 2, 2022",Cheri Beranek,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/solidarity-without-sameness-the-key-to-working-together/437536,"
Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) policies are more than just feeling good about ourselves. Diversity drives innovation, and companies that innovate in today's fast-paced environment are the ones that come out on top. Socially-responsible companies are attracting more demanding consumers. But the more diversity we bring to a team, the more potential for crossed interests and differing opinions about what social responsibility implies, which can quickly escalate into conflict.This is where building solidarity comes in.Solidarity is not thinking and behaving exactly the same. It's rallying support as a team, welcoming and respecting open communication even when opinions are different, and agreeing to the course of action that best considers the company and its people. Fostering solidarity, not sameness, is the key to unlocking the benefits of a diverse team.



Related: Solving Organizational Diversity Is Still an Issue: The Cost Is Steep, But the Rewards Are HighWelcome the benefits of embracing diversity as a teamEveryone has differences, and the more diverse backgrounds, upbringings and histories we bring onto a team, the more opportunities for differences to exist. But from boards and management teams to organizing a charity fundraiser event, embracing group diversity brings more perspectives, ideas and alternatives that spur innovation and improve productivity. Diverse teams focus more on facts and process them more carefully, resulting in smarter decisions.


A 2015 McKinsey report found that embracing diversity also improves the bottom line. Companies in the top quartile of ethnic and racial diversity in management were 35% more likely to have higher financial returns over the industry average; companies in the top quartile for gender diversity were 15% more likely. Diverse teams that work well together outpace the competition.Companies seek to advance diversity at all levels. Still, for those diverse minds to work well together as a team, they need solidarity — ""unity, association, reciprocation, a good community or social interest, gratuity, justice and respect for human dignity."" With a culture of solidarity, companies can more successfully implement DEI and ESG initiatives that reduce social and economic inequality within the organization, improving efficiency, productivity and the company's reputation.Related: How Diversity Helped Bring My Company TogetherAlign everyone around individual responsibilitiesBuilding and encouraging team solidarity requires an established set of values around personal responsibility to contribute to the effort. Sincere acknowledgment and mutual support build a culture of community, which can foster solidarity, but solidarity cannot be forced. It is a co-responsibility for the moral well-being of all others as equal partners on a common mission. Each person with their individual and collective interests needs to embrace solidarity around acknowledging and respecting our differences while arriving at decisions that best serve the collective ""we.""


People pick up on culture fast through the example of their leadership, so leaders should demonstrate acknowledgment and support of diversity to build that sense of solidarity in their teams. There are many worlds of thought with which I disagree, but I work hard to respect them and be understanding of the background from which they originate. So much of our foundational backgrounds embed themselves into who we are today. While I can't even begin to fully understand every person's background or how they got to where they are, I can at least respect the fact that it played a part in creating them, even when we disagree.We can also build a community culture by recognizing the dynamic interdependence between all team members, emphasizing the need for dialogue, compassion, and understanding across a team. Start by making sure everyone feels they belong.We just had our annual meeting, where everyone — those stationed outside Minneapolis and some even outside the country — comes home to the ""mothership"" to celebrate everything in Clearfield. We start by discussing the upcoming year, host lots of learning during the day and hold parties every evening. Especially in this new hybrid world, bringing everyone together is critical to maintaining their sense of solidarity.Related: How to Promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Your Workplace


See everyone's potential equallyWhen I became a grandma, I developed a new perspective to understand inclusion in the face of diversity better: Look at people as babies. My six-month-old grandson is slightly over 19 pounds, while my 15-month-old is approaching 20 pounds. The older one is small for his age, while the younger one is big. To look at them, they seem totally different. And yet, I look at them as very much the same. They are both my grandsons, with the same potential for growth despite their differences. When we look at babies, whether grandchildren, children, or someone else's children, we so quickly look at them and see their potential. Each one is equally capable of becoming the next future star performer. If we can see the potential in babies, why can't we still see it when they grow up to become adults?As leaders, seeing equal potential in everyone allows us to respect what their differences can bring to the team — as team members, seeing our peers full of potential will enable them to achieve their best for the benefit of the rest of the company. Look at someone and think about whose baby they were. Imagine someone caring for them, praying for them and trying to open doors for them; someone who saw them brimming with potential. Encourage others to imagine the same and help instill diverse teams with a greater sense of oneness and unity.As former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon put it, ""A world of peace and solidarity can only be accomplished by acknowledging and celebrating [sic] our diversity."" Diversity and inclusion are more than just inviting people in: We need everyone aligned around creating an environment where people feel comfortable being their authentic selves and bringing those diverse perspectives to the table. Leaders need to build it into their team culture, but it also comes down to individual employees to take on their responsibility. Once someone takes charge, solidarity can quickly start to spread.

103,"Is the Workplace of the Future Remote, Hybrid or Distributed? Actually, It's All of The Above.","Oct 31, 2022",Jesse Meschuk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/is-remote-work-the-future-its-time-for-the-agile/437141,"
As the pandemic subsides, many executives and employees are transitioning to the new normal. Companies that transitioned to a remote environment are now opening their offices again and trying to determine how they will operate. Some businesses, like Airbnb, Salesforce, Meta and Google, have stated they will allow people to remain remote if they choose to, as employers believe it improves their chances at retention and employees have proven they can get the work done.Others, like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Netflix, are pushing to have all employees back in the office five days a week in the belief that there is no substitute for in-office collaboration and interactions. Other companies are trying to land in the middle. Adobe, Apple, and Citi use a hybrid approach in which employees are generally expected in the office 2-3 days a week.Several factors suggest the winning strategy won't be forcing one approach but adapting to the needs and desires of the workforce. A more agile strategy toward workplace design, culture and operating models will be required to succeed. To understand why, consider the business realities and opportunities behind a more agile approach.



Related: Remote Work Is Here to Stay. It's Time to Update the Way You Lead.Why an agile strategy will winGallup published a study of more than 8,000 remote-capable workers to learn what they prefer, what they see as the future and what they plan to do if their company changes directions.


Fifty-six percent said their job can be done entirely remotely today, and only 20% said they believe fully on-site will remain a valid strategy, down from 60% in 2019. Only 6% said they want to work entirely on-site. That means 94% of employees surveyed want a more flexible strategy. With more than 70 million workers in the U.S. estimated to be in remote-capable roles, that's a significant number looking for a more flexible strategy.After two years of the ""great work experiment,"" in which vast portions of the workforce were forced to work from home, we have a lot of information and data. Here's what we've learned:Workers are more productive at home: a Stanford University study found that working from home full-time was equivalent to adding a full day of productivity per week.Workers are more likely to stay at their employer: the same study indicated turnover decreased by 50% as employees felt more loyal and refreshed because they could be more comfortable at home and spend more time with friends and family.It limits wage inflation: a July 2022 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research showed those organizations that expanded work-from-home and remote work opportunities moderated wage inflation by 1% of wages over 12 months on average. The annual Survey of Business Uncertainty found that 55.4% of companies have been able to ""restrain wage growth"" by employing a flexible work strategy.It allows companies to tap into a more global, more diverse workplace: remote teams give employers access to worldwide talent and potentially be ""open"" to the public around the clock ― the ""follow the sun"" model, in which work continues in various regions night and day. Groups that have traditionally ""fallen"" out of the workforce, like women who have kids, can work from home part-time or full-time more easily.Employers save money on rent and other facilities costs. A study by Global Workplace Analytics estimates facilities savings could equal $10,000 per year per employee.So what does an agile work strategy mean and look like?An agile workplace strategy means an organization is not wedded to traditional 20th-century operating models or organizational structures and is willing and able to adapt flexibly to meet the needs and preferences of its talent. The new models include:Fully Distributed Organizations: rather than trying to employ all technology workers in traditional markets (Silicon Valley, Seattle, Los Angeles, etc.), companies will establish hubs all over the world. Top talent can be obtained and retained in lower-cost markets like Eastern Europe, India or Southeast Asia, or even small non-traditional cities in the U.S. like Boise, Idaho.Full Remote Organizations: these organizations have removed the requirement to be in an office entirely for nearly every role and now employ a global ""work where you are"" strategy. Companies like GitLab, with 1,500 employees in more than 65 countries, have gone even further — they have no company-owned offices at all. Dropbox is ""virtual first"" now and retains 16 studios worldwide, but employees aren't required to come in or be near a location.How do you make this work strategy work? Four quick tips:Change your organization's operating model and structure to allow this environment. For example, Google provides ""distributed work playbooks"" for leaders, managers, employees and buddies (to help new hires) to help drive how to make the environment work for everyone.Set clear expectations: practical goal setting, feedback processes, and regular and effective check-ins and 1:1s between managers and employees to ensure things don't fall through the cracks with a remote, global or hybrid workplace.Gather the right tools: effective project management software like Asana, shared document approaches like Google Docs/Sheets/Slides, shared drives like One Drive, and effective real-time collaboration tools like Slack and Zoom for working seamlessly in a (usually) single-sign-on environment.Make it an organizational imperative to forge connections, bonds and friendships at work: in an Agile work environment, people will need to find ways to connect as informal in-person mechanisms will be more limited.Related: 4 Things for Employers to Consider About the Future of Work


ConclusionHow to deploy an agile work strategy is complex, nuanced and challenging, but it will be required to win in the future. The organizations that begin the journey now will be more ready to survive the challenges ahead and capitalize on the opportunities the future will provide.

As the old adage goes, ""what gets measured gets done."" Historically, the challenge with diversity, equity and inclusion work (DEI) is that it's perceived as a ""nice-to-have"" versus a ""must-have"" with few concrete goals to measure progress. In fact, McKinsey research found that organizations often overburden those marginalized groups to lead the DEI work without additional compensation.That trend is changing with more companies tying compensation to DEI work. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, between September 2017-18, 51 companies in the S&P 500 included a diversity metric in their compensation program. Between February 2020-21, that number had nearly doubled to 99 companies.By rewarding DEI work, these organizations are seeing results. When people know that it's tied to their compensation and performance goals, people see it as a part of their job rather than a hobby outside of work hours. With goals, employees are more likely to prioritize the time spent on education and activities to drive awareness and systemic change.



Related: 5 Reasons Leaders Fail to Transform DEI Rhetoric into ActionWhy set DEI goalsGoals are essential for human motivation. The Psychological Bulletin found that 90% of the studies showed that more challenging goals lead to higher performance. Research has shown that people are two to three times more likely to stick to their goals if they make a specific plan for when, where and how they will perform the behavior. The human brain is wired for goals.


Without accountability, goals do not work. It is essential to frame DEI goalsetting as important as any other goal-setting process in business, but there might be initial pushback, as there often is with organizational change. Watch out for these opportunities to advocate for DEI goal setting:DEI is not a zero-sum game. By focusing on diversity goals, we grow opportunities for innovation and decision-making in business results.The majority group is a part of the solution, not the problem. Decision makers must prioritize DEI for their decisions to support diversity.DEI is not political. These are human issues that impact people in the workplace.The initial pushback can create drama. The more the leadership team emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion and how it ties to the organization's overall strategy, the more people buy in. People often need a starting point for goal setting.Related: 4 Trackable Metrics to Move the Needle on Diversity and Inclusion GoalsHow to set DEI goalsYou might be thinking that this sounds hard. Decades of workplace inequity will not be solved overnight. Yet with specific goals, people understand expectations and modify their behaviors to be more inclusive. Setting goals requires specificity, numeric measurement, aspiration, relevance and a deadline.


Specific: It should be easy to know when the goal has been completed.Measurable: There is a number or percentage tied to the goal.Aspirational: By definition, goals are not being met today it should be challenging based on the present state.Relevant: The individual can influence the outcome of the goal.Time-bound: Without a deadline, things don't get done.By making DEI goals SMART, employees understand expectations and are held accountable. Without goals or with vague goals, employees are left to wonder why it is important or how to show progress. DEI goal setting often comes with pushback (as with any change).Here are some starter goals to consider:Number of hours on diversity education and trainingParticipation in Employee Resource Group (ERG) activitiesActivities to support removing bias from recruiting, hiring, promotion, pay and performance decisionsInclusive behavior 360 data from team membersLeadership roles in DEI and ERG teamsParticipation in community events for DEITeaching time with others about DEIRecognition from others of allyshipRelated: Want Your Employees To Stay? Be Accountable To Your DEI GoalsAs with any goal, thinking about how it fits into what people are already doing makes it easier to accomplish. James Clear, author of Atomic Habits summarizes it best: ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.""


Bottom line — weave DEI into daily tasks and embed it into how people live already personally and professionally. Break the daunting goal into baby steps with incremental activities throughout the year to support it.Here are some themes to keep in mind to get your organization ready for DEI goals:It's a journey, not a destination: Set reasonable targets and goals to close gaps in talent, pay and education.Make it a part of the performance: Establish KPIs for employees to work on DEI, otherwise, it is simply a ""nice-to-have"" vs. a ""must-have.""Engage senior leadership in a consistent, intentional set of actions over the year: This should be a part of every employee meeting and key activity.Measure progress: Look beyond representation numbers and dig in holistically about attitudes/perceptions.Take education to the next level: Go beyond awareness to tangible activities employees can take action on like addressing bias in systems and accountability.DEI goals should be a part of a bigger DEI picture. Providing tools and systems to help people hold themselves accountable is pivotal. By focusing on DEI goals, organizations increase their chances of long-term success with DEI — and by investing and prioritizing it now, they will remain relevant for future customers and employees.

105,The Dos and Don'ts of Wearing a Halloween Costume at Work,"Oct 30, 2022",Mita Mallick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-rules-for-wearing-a-halloween-costume-to-work/437924,"
With Halloween just around the corner, many organizations will be hosting office gatherings, costume contests and opportunities to bring your children in for trick or treating. This might be the first time your company is celebrating the holiday in person since the onset of the pandemic, and you might feel pressure to get creative with your costume. But remember: Some costumes unfortunately might be seen by your coworkers as insensitive or offensive, or even racist, misogynistic or highly inappropriate.Related: Your Halloween Candy Will Be Smaller This Year (And Not Just Because of Inflation)Here are three things to keep in mind to ensure everyone can feel included and enjoy Halloween:



Don't glorify those who have caused harmHalloween costumes are not an opportunity to glorify those who have caused others harm. The popular Netflix series Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story centers around the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. He targeted and killed mostly Black, Asian Latino men. The series sparked renewed interest in Dahmer, manifesting in the sale of Dahmer Halloween costumes. Some online retailers, including eBay, have now shut down the sale of these costumes.Even if they are currently trending on Twitter or are infamous figures, dressing up as any of these individuals can be incredibly hurtful to colleagues: Osama bin Laden, Vladimir Putin, Adolf Hitler, Jeffrey Epstein or others who inflicted pain. Finally, do not use inspiration from mass shootings, Covid-19, natural disasters or movements like #MeToo to come up with ""creative"" or ""funny"" costumes. This again has the potential to cause hurt and harm to your colleagues.


Related: A Milwaukee Bar Once Frequented By Jeffrey Dahmer Slams 'Senseless' New Patrons Looking for 'Dahmer Drinks'Don't embrace cultural appropriationHalloween costumes are also not an opportunity to appropriate someone else's culture. Dressing up as a member of a culture that isn't your own in a costume that's ""funny"" or an exaggeration is offensive and hurtful. This can include dressing up as a geisha or Native American or in an Arab sheik costume, a grass skirt with a coconut top or a poncho with a sombrero. Don't appropriate particular symbols or pieces of clothing that hold significant meaning for those from historically marginalized groups. It's not a costume for them; it's part of their community, culture and everyday way of life.Finally, blackface is highly inappropriate, hurtful and racist. Blackface is a racist practice dating back to minstrel shows in the 1820s. White performers would pretend to be Black, darkening their skin, pretending to have oversized lips, and wearing wigs and exaggerated costumes. They would ridicule and mock Black people, often depicting them as being ignorant or lazy. Once you understand this history, you now know it's never appropriate to wear blackface for a Halloween costume.Related: 'Best October Decor in Town': Yard of 'Scary Things' for Halloween Goes ViralDo discuss intent versus impactIf someone does show up to work with an inappropriate Halloween costume, don't wait for human resources to intervene. Be the person who intervenes on behalf of your team. Pull the person aside and talk to them about intent versus impact. Here's an example of what you could say:""I wanted to share that some of our colleagues are hurt by what you are wearing. I am sure this wasn't your intent, and I wanted to share why this costume is so upsetting for them.""


Or, you can say:""I am sure when you chose this costume you intended to be creative. Unfortunately for some of our colleagues, this costume isn't funny. It's very painful for them, and here's why.""Encourage your colleague to apologize to those they harmed. Ask your colleague to share what they learned and why they now understand the costume was harmful. An apology is a key to helping rebuild trust among colleagues.Remember that Halloween can be another wonderful opportunity to bond with colleagues. And when in doubt about your costume selection, don't be afraid to ask someone else's opinion. To be on the safe side, stick to dressing up as a piece of fruit, or as a Halloween classic like a pumpkin or a witch. More important than the costume is the opportunity to connect and make sure everyone feels included and able to fully enjoy the festivities.

106,6 Reasons Black Diversity Officers Struggle and What CEOs Can Do to Fix It,"Oct 25, 2022",Chuck H. Shelton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/6-reasons-black-diversity-officers-struggle-and-what-ceos/437371,"
It is no secret that black diversity officers face an uphill battle in their roles. Despite numerous studies proving the value of a diverse workplace, these officers are often left to fight the relational, cultural and institutional barriers that prevent them from achieving real progress. Here are six reasons Black and Brown diversity officers struggle and what CEOs can do to fix it.Note: Diversity leaders from other identities may also face many of these struggles.1. Diversity leaders are set up for failureOrganizations often set Black Chief Diversity Officers (CDOs) and other diversity leaders up for failure by expecting them to solve all the diversity challenges within a company. This is an impossible task and places too heavy a burden on these individuals. In many cases, they are also given inadequate resources to create meaningful and sustainable change.



How to fix it:Organizations must set realistic expectations with their DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) leaders. They should provide them with the resources they need to succeed. Additionally, organizations should create diverse leadership teams that work together to solve problems so that identifying and acting on DEI opportunities is a distributed and firm-wide expectation.


2. CEOs and other top leaders are not genuinely committed to DEIMany CEOs and top leaders may pay lip service to the DEI, but they don't take substantive and concrete steps to improve diversity within their organizations. A lack of commitment can make it impossible for diversity leaders to succeed. Either DEI is an actual business priority, or it is just performative.How to fix it:CEOs and other executives must hold themselves and be held accountable for their commitment to diversity. They must make and keep promises to their employees, customers and communities to deliver on the business-building power of DEI. Additionally, they should be transparent about the organization's efforts and progress.Related: Fake Job Interviews: The Dark Side of Wells Fargo's 'Diversity' Efforts


3. Diversity leaders often face resistance from executive peersWhen diversity leaders try to make enterprise-reaching changes within their organizations, they may encounter overt and covert pushback or sullen cynicism from other members of senior leadership. This resistance can make it difficult for CDOs to implement necessary changes.How to fix it:Organizations must create an environment where diversity leaders can succeed. This means equipping executives with the tools needed to deepen their DEI point of view, leading to more inclusiveness in their business units and markets. This also includes clear and activated agreements about how to help DEI leaders effectively respond to peer pushback.Related: How to Use Executive Search Recruitment Practices to Foster Diversity and Inclusion in Your Workforce


4. Diversity leaders often feel alone in their journeyIsolation is a common experience for executives, and that is particularly true for CDOs. Their peers may not know how to support them, and some do not care to. Add an unclear business rationale, a dysfunctional reporting structure and a lack of resources… and we can see how isolation and loneliness are built into the CDO role. It is a bad mismatch for leaders who are often social and emotionally intelligent.How to fix it:Make sure the executive managing the CDO — typically the CHRO, sometimes the CEO or COO — is profoundly engaged in the success of DEI in the organization. This includes providing them with mentorship and networking opportunities inside and outside the company. Additionally, organizations should ensure that executive peers work hard to build relationships with CDOs and publicly value their contributions.Related: Stop Expecting Marginalized Groups to Lead Diversity Efforts.

The level of the team and whiteness are usually correlated — the more senior the team, the whiter it is likely to beNote: Please remember that I'm a white guy who is merely stating an observable fact about places dominated by white people.This challenge around representation can make it difficult for people of other racial identities to succeed in organizations — ""I need to see it to believe it."" The pipeline to executive roles is self-fulfilling, so it is no small challenge to build a new mix at senior levels. And when the CDO is the only person of color at the top of the house… please refer to the previous point on isolation.How to fix it:Invest in preparing high performers for senior roles by sourcing talent more inclusively and centering DEI capability as a job qualification. Also, establish more robust connections in communities and through social media so that a new mix of external talent is also available when hiring.


6. Diversity leaders often burn out quicklyDiversity leaders burn out quickly because of their heavy burden: their average tenure in a CDO job is under two years. Their burnout is due to the cumulative impact of points 1 to 5. In addition, less than 20% of incoming CDOs bring prior experience in such a role, so the hiring, onboarding and early development are especially vital for people in DEI roles.How to fix it:Set realistic expectations with your CDO, prepare and support them, provide them with the right resources, help them navigate conflict, and hold their peers accountable for building high-trust relationships.The fact that Black and Brown diversity officers face immense struggles is no surprise. For years, studies have shown the value of a diverse workplace, but many organizations are just now starting to explore diversity, equity and inclusion's powerful potential. If CEOs want to promote racial equity in their workplaces, they need to do much more than just hire a few Black and Brown people for token positions. They must listen to what diversity officers are saying and provide them with the resources and support to do their jobs effectively.

107,I Created a College Atmosphere At My Company. Here Are 3 Ways It Increased Employee Retention,"Oct 25, 2022",Gergo Vari,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-ways-to-recreate-a-college-atmosphere-in-your-workplace/436544,"
When was the happiest period in your life? Was it your early childhood? Your adolescence? The honeymoon phase of your marriage? For me, my university years rank high on the list. As a teenager, I was never entirely comfortable in my own skin. In my early 20s, I was more self-assured and better connected with my peers, with whom I shared many common interests, goals and life circumstances. Fast forward to my post-graduation days, when I entered the workforce, and that fulfillment — stemming from a combination of exploration and joy — fades fast. Why?Related: Why Your Culture Should Be Like College Life -- No Matter the Age of Your EmployeesCollege = community + cultureMy early career experiences lacked a sense of community. The openness to different life paths that had bonded me with my fellow college students was replaced by a 9-to-5 work rhythm and a separation between my professional and private life. When office hours ended, my colleagues and I went home to our respective families and friends. Occasionally we went out for drinks before parting ways, but this was the exception — not the rule, as it had been in university.Am I alone in experiencing this erosion of kinship among the people I spent most of my time with? I doubt it. Data has shown that overall life satisfaction peaks twice in life — first in one's early 20s and again at age 69. My dissatisfaction with work culture during my early career helped propel my entrepreneurship, and I have never looked back.



Instead, I've looked ahead by forging cultures inside my companies that recreate and rekindle the community spirit of college. Not only does this create a happier working environment, but it also increases employee loyalty and retention. Here are some key ways you can build a more robust company culture in which people learn, grow and stay together.1. Model your hiring process on college admissionsThe good news: you can create a college environment in your workplace, and it has all the positive results I've mentioned. There are many ways to do this, but one of the most powerful and important is your hiring and recruiting process. If you went to college, do you remember the application process? Once you've entered the pool of applicants, the school starts to seem more and more desirable. Why? To understand fully, you'd have to look at the psychology of in-groups, but suffice it to say that college admissions departments are well-trained to make you feel like you have a chance at being part of something special.


Your human resources team doesn't need to employ sinister branding tactics to borrow from college admissions departments. They just need to remind applicants that your company is about much more than the product or service it provides. Like admission to Harvard University, getting a job with your company should be associated with meaningful results — e.g., pave the way for future success — but it's also about the experience and the connections formed along the way.Related: Benefits of a Positive Work Environment2. Onboard into a college-like cultureNext up, you need to tailor your onboarding to feel more collegiate. You want to evoke the glory of the college experience. One hint for this is to study how campus orientation programs work. Have you ever noticed how campus orientation passes new admissions from one advisor to another, each of whom is an expert on a specific aspect of college life?Do the same with your new hires. I accomplish this at my company by stretching the onboarding process over three months. That's longer than many new hires last on the job at some companies! It works because it provides dozens of touch points for new employees to acclimate to their roles and ease into developing a deep sense of belonging. And throughout this journey, they get to ""buddy up"" with different team members and leaders.


By month 4, they're part of the next new hire's onboarding — except now, they're the expert on the company. Everyone needs to feel like they're vital to the culture we're creating, and this approach to onboarding makes that happen.3. Treat your office like a campusThis is where you can truly put your stamp on your company culture by making it an environment where people can grow and develop. One reason our college years are formative experiences for many of us is that we are already adults when we attend, yet are still developing and growing, together with our peers.To instill this self-discovery in your organizational culture, you must think holistically. If you have a physical office, ask: is it designed in a way that enables people to be at work without working? We all know that our most profound ideas and insights come during times of relaxation, and your physical office if it exists, needs to facilitate such moments.I encourage everyone on my team to use the office not just for work. I want them to do everything there that they would in any environment where they feel comfortable. Also, employees need areas not only where they can collaborate but where they can retreat and have downtime. What else? They need to eat, play, learn, make art or music, or pursue another non-work-related creative activity. The more opportunities you can provide in your company to do all these things, the longer your employees will stay on board—and the more satisfied they'll be while they're with you.Additionally, it's important to remember that there's no ""one"" authentic college experience. Paths vary depending on the person, the goal and the course of study. Craft a work environment that enables a diversity of approaches and experiences, and you will not only have a more exciting workplace but also lay the groundwork for innovation.Can remote-only or remote-first companies also create campus-like work cultures? Of course. It takes imagination, but tools and techniques abound, and they can also be used to augment in-office experiences in a hybrid environment.

Absolutely. And if you want to build an organization that can flourish in our turbulent times, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more robust model than universities.

108,How to Best Recruit Board Members Outside of Your Industry,"Oct 24, 2022",Martin Rowinski,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-recruit-board-members-from-outside-of-your-industry/436577,"
Few individuals are experts in everything. Even the cumulative expertise in most businesses could use input from more experts in diverse areas. This is why we have boards — a panel of experts in areas that fill in the gaps in our existing company knowledge base.But even once we find the right group of experts from our industry to take a seat on our board, we would still stand to benefit from the wisdom of more diverse perspectives and experiences. Their range of successes and failures becomes additional resources to put together more tried and tested strategies in the face of new challenges.Outside board members can bring a lot to a company, but to find the right ones for the job, we need to know what to look for:Related: How Board Members Can Help You Through a RecessionOutside experts bring more perspectivesMost companies (and boards, for that matter) still lack insight from people outside their industry. In 2014, less than 5 percent of middle-market companies had an established board or advisory board, and most of those who did put family, friends and internal management into those roles. But the perfect marketing expert for a company could be someone from outside that company. Their experience could even be from outside of that company's industry, but their new point of view might be exactly what the company needs to get its brand to the right audience. Their unbiased eyes can catch more company inefficiencies, see greater opportunities and ideate more innovative strategies.



This is also why diversity in race, gender, age and socioeconomic backgrounds drives innovation. Looking to outside board members to fill talent gaps opens up a larger pool for inclusivity. A 2020 Deloitte study found women held under 23 percent of board seats among Fortune 500 companies, and minority men, only 12 percent. But adding these points of view to a company's leadership paints a complete picture of that company's role in commerce and broader society. With this diversity of perspectives on our board, we position our company to be more innovative than most of our competition, still strategizing without them.Related: 3 Ways to Find Your Perfect Board of AdvisorsLook for strategic, outside-the-box thinkersBesides looking outside your industry and broadening diversity, two main attributes indicate a high-quality outside board member: a strategic mind and outside-the-box thinking. Elon Musk is an excellent example of someone who demonstrates both qualities. His endeavors range from electric cars to solar energy to a space exploration company that competes with NASA — his outside-the-box mind saw the connections between these diverse fields, and his strategic mind allowed him to apply his successful experiences from one to another.Of course, someone with both would be ideal, but someone with either quality will drive any company in the right direction. Strategic thinkers analyze several variables when creating plans for achieving goals and generating new ideas. They stay on top of new opportunities while considering vulnerabilities. To do this, they ask many questions, welcome feedback and self-reflect. They gather all the information before making decisions to make them decisively. With a strategic mind, even someone outside a company's industry could still see how their skill set could be translated into a new field.


Most of us unknowingly follow some form of old ideas born out of antiquated lines of thinking, but outside-the-box thinkers easily step outside of those boundaries. They imagine radical new possibilities, question the status quo and stretch the boundaries of what's achievable. Rather than fearing change, they embrace it as a new opportunity. An outside-the-box thinker will be able to see how their perspective and experience in other industries is advantageous to strategizing and innovating in a new one.Related: Thinking of Joining a Board? Here Are 3 Things You Must Consider FirstWhen it's worth the risk, despite no industry experienceIf you find a strategic or outside-the-box thinker, the next step is determining if they are suitable for your board, especially when they have no experience in your industry. If your company plans to do mergers and acquisitions, bring a person outside your industry with expertise in mergers and acquisitions. If you want to take your company public, find an outside expert in going public. If you can find someone who has already done what your company needs to do in several industries, this is an excellent indicator of their flexibility to step in and excel in yours.Then, try to draw out those valuable skills that translate across all industries: strategy and innovative thinking. Get to know their strategic mind. Ask about their area of expertise and if they have a strategic plan for growth and improvement. Reveal outside-the-box thinkers by getting them to elaborate on how their skill sets apply to your industry. When you find the right people with the skill sets your company needs and the ability to pull ideas from different industries, this outside board member can be a key player in driving your company's success.

109,How Leaders Can Support and Embrace The Untapped Potential of Neurodiverse Talent,"Oct 17, 2022",Nika White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-leaders-can-support-neurodiverse-talent-in-the-workplace/435661,"
When we think of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), we often think of race, gender, sexual orientation and physical disability. But what about mental and cognitive diversity? These days, more and more people are coming out as neurodiverse. An estimated 15-20% of people worldwide are neurodivergent and that could include folks in your workplace.While neurodiversity qualifies as part of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA), what a neurodivergent person may need in order to feel welcomed, safe and productive at work may differ from what's available. What can we do as entrepreneurs and business owners to support neurodiverse folks in the workplace and include them in our DEI plans? As a diversity and inclusion practitioner for more than 20 years, I'll share the answers to these questions — and more — in this article.What is neurodiversity?According to the Cleveland Clinic, ""the term 'neurodivergent' describes people whose brain differences affect how their brain works. That means they have different strengths and challenges from people whose brains don't have those differences. The possible differences include medical disorders, learning disabilities and other conditions.""



In a nutshell, neurodiversity is a different functioning of the brain that can affect someone's social skills, ability to focus and a host of other issues. Folks who are neurodivergent may also have:ADHDLearning disabilitiesAutismTourette's syndromeOther conditionsWe've all worked with folks with ADHD, autism and other conditions for a while now, but we may not have known how to create environments that allowed them to produce their best work or showcase their best selves. That's where including them in our DEI plans can be useful. But first, we should talk about how neurodiversity can show up in the workplace and ways we can create a more inclusive environment for neurodiverse individuals.


Related: 5 Steps to Building a Supportive and Inclusive Workplace for Neurodiverse EmployeesHow neurodiversity shows up in the workplaceOne reason neurodiversity may be overlooked in DEI is that people don't know what it actually looks like in real life. If we can't identify neurodiversity in the office, how can we expect to adapt our policies, practices and culture?Here are three scenarios describing how neurodiversity may look in the workplace.Employee #1 may be mildly autistic but doesn't show typical symptoms at work. But at home, they may be antisocial which may impact their work relationships.Employee #2 may be neurodivergent and struggle with job interviews. However, once on the job, their skillset shines and they perform outstanding work.Employee #3 may struggle with focusing in noisy environments, but having quiet rooms to work in can support them in producing their best work.Each employee in these scenarios adapted differently to their environment and found their own way to thrive in the workplace. However, neurodivergent folks shouldn't have to do all of the work to adapt. Here are a few ways your organization can take the weight off of their shoulders and help them thrive in the workplace.


4 ways to support neurodivergent individuals at workKeep in mind that each individual is different, as illustrated in the examples above. There's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to supporting employees, whether they're neurodivergent or not. However, there are a few ways you can keep a listening ear open and become more attentive to the needs of neurodivergent workers.1. Find a manager or employee to be their success partner and allyIf there's a manager or someone who works side-by-side with a neurodivergent individual, make it a point to train that person on how to practice active listening and compassionate communication. I usually suggest hosting team talks for situations where listening and receiving feedback are helpful in solving inclusivity issues. However, for individuals, it can feel isolating and ""outing"" to have group conversations about inclusion and be the ""only one"" with a particular identity at the table.For individuals, it's better to have one-on-one conversations with someone they trust who can offer a listening ear. A manager is an ideal candidate to be a successful partner or ally because managers are charged with listening to their employees' needs and have the simultaneous authority to access leadership and request inclusive policy and practice changes. This is an example of when compassionate listening meets action.Related: Here's How to Have the Most Powerful DEI Conversations


2. Design different physical spaces that accommodate various employee preferencesOne way your business can be mindful of neurodiversity is to create dynamic spaces in the office that meet various work needs. Workspaces can be quite important to neurodivergent individuals. Some may prefer to be alone in a closed-door office while others may prefer a certain style of furniture, wall colors or a pleasant aroma.Creating physical workspaces that meet the needs of group meetings, individual working and pleasant places to rest can stimulate and calm certain individuals in the workplace. The best part is, that having different spaces will help not only neurodivergent individuals but neurotypical employees, too. Building dynamic spaces can help all employees find their best working environment and feel comfortable completing their tasks.The goal is to create spaces that support, not inhibit, workers with different working styles to do their best work. Creating dynamic physical spaces can be an investment in your employees' wellbeing as well as their inclusion and comfort.3. Avoid labeling neurodivergent people as ""different"" or othering themOne mistake we make as employees and business owners is wanting to categorize individuals and put them into boxes. I shared earlier that neurodiversity can sometimes overlap with ADHD, autism and Tourette's syndrome. While that's true, it's important not to ""out"" or label neurodivergent people as different or as having ""different needs.""


As leaders, we have to walk a fine line between supplying workers with what they need to do their jobs while making sure they don't feel exposed or embarrassed by making personal requests for their work and wellbeing.Be sure to train managers and fellow employees who work with neurodivergent people on how to be sensitive to their needs and embrace their requests without othering them. As mentioned earlier, while one change to the physical or cultural environment may benefit a particular neurodivergent person, it may also be appreciated by other employees.Related: How to Talk About Disability Diversity in the Workplace﻿4. Encourage other employees to value the different working styles of othersThe challenges organizations face when adapting to neurodiversity in the workplace may actually begin with fellow employees. Not everyone may be as intentional as leadership when creating an inclusive workplace. Some employees may not understand why a certain individual chooses to be alone in their office while company functions are occurring or why an individual is so sensitive to the noise of the coffee maker in the background.


Instead of leadership overlooking employees judging or looking down upon individuals who are neurodivergent, host a training or workshop that can help them spot the behaviors of neurodivergent individuals and find ways to be compassionate and respectful in those scenarios.A warm, inclusive and compassionate work culture can make or break a neurodivergent individual's ability to work and thrive. Sometimes having allies and success partners amongst fellow employees can be an invaluable support system to a neurodivergent person — even when leadership hasn't quite caught on yet.Final thoughtsAs you think through your DEI plans and strategies, you may be thinking of how your organization can support racial, ethnic, gender and sexual orientation minorities. However, don't forget about those with mental and cognitive disabilities that may not be as apparent. These individuals are in need of the same respect and inclusion.Create an environment where employees and team members with physical and mental disabilities can feel supported. This can include physical spaces that smell, feel or sound a certain way. Or it can be training managers and employees on what allyship looks like for neurodivergent individuals. No matter how you do it, keep folks with mental disabilities in your DEI plans this year and beyond.
