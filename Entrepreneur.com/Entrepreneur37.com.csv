Everyone knows the exasperation of unnecessary friction.We've all navigated systems that create maddening ordeals rather than give us simple answers, services, or refunds. We've sat through endless meetings with blabbermouths and ill-defined agendas. We've pulled our hair out over rules, procedures, traditions, and technologies that once made sense, but are now antiquated, pointless, and inefficient. These are all soul-crushing forms of organizational friction that make it difficult to do simple things. And as professors at Stanford's School of Engineering and Graduate School of Business, we spent the last seven years researching the causes and cures for these problems.But one of our biggest discoveries surprised us. It turns out that friction isn't always a problem. In fact, sometimes it can be a solution.

1,3 Customer Service Trends to Follow this Year,"Apr 4, 2024",Michelle Van Slyke,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-customer-service-trends-your-business-needs-to-follow/471717,"
Customer service has never been more important. Today's customers not only desire fast and seamless service but also expect a personalized and delightful customer experience (CX). To add even more to the mix, the stakes are high for businesses that don't measure up. According to a recent PwC report, one-third of customers would leave a brand they love after one bad experience.The good news is that succeeding in customer service can reap incredible benefits for businesses. In fact, 86% of customers are willing to pay more for a great CX, per the Tempkin Group. Due to these factors, customer service has become one of the top priorities for businesses in 2024. Here are three CX trends every business leader should buy into to help them excel in 2024.The evolving role of self-service technologyToday's customers expect fast, seamless and convenient service. One recent study found that half of all customers will not wait more than 3 minutes in a store. It's unrealistic to expect businesses to provide instant, in-person service all the time – that's where technology has to play a role. Gone are the days when these technologies were viewed as taboo. On the contrary, many of today's customers prefer customer service, which technology supports in some way. Per a recent study by Aspect, 73% of customers want the ability to solve product or service issues independently. Even many small businesses and franchises should invest in technologies like self-service kiosks or technology tools that support customer service efforts.



If your business hasn't invested in self-service technology for customers, 2024 might just be the year to do so. A great place to start is with self-service kiosks onsite. This is a tool that The UPS Store recently introduced, with over 1,800 self-service kiosks now installed at franchise locations across the country. These kiosks streamline online returns and item drop-offs for The UPS Store customers and offer an option to get in and out of the store faster than ever. Whether self-service works into your business plan or not, technology will be a key player in customer service in 2024.Related: 10 Reasons Why Good Customer Service Is Your Most Important Metric


Connecting with Gen-ZYou may not realize this, but Gen Z is growing up fast. The oldest members of this generation will be much closer to 30 this year than 20. With Gen Zers becoming a bigger sect of most companies' customer base, one of the biggest CX trends in 2024 will be the importance of appealing to this group. So, where should you start? One place is on social media. As the first actual digital-native generation, Gen Zers are often most comfortable interacting with companies on social media. A survey by Hubspot found that 90% of Gen Z expect brands to be active on social media, and 13% claim social media as the preferred form of customer service. If you're not on social media, 2024 is a great year to use it.This shouldn't just be reserved for large national brands; even small businesses should find ways to be active and interact with younger customers on social media. LinkedIn or Instagram are great places to start for most companies, but consider where you feel most comfortable or which platform your customers are most active on. Authenticity must be prioritized in social media customer service, especially when interacting with Gen Z. In addition to responding to customer needs, being active on social media will allow your company to build more trust with Gen Z and interact with customers more often.Related: What You Must Know About the Next Generations of ConsumersHarnessing customer insightsOne CX trend that has persisted in its importance is using customer service interactions for their insights. While customer service should prioritize the customer experience, all companies should also look for ways to learn from these interactions. This can be achieved through high-tech and low-tech means. For example, businesses can use data intelligence software to get real-time insights or social media analytics to collect information. Plenty of data intelligence vendors can offer real-time insights based on customer touchpoints. On the other hand, businesses can also tap their customer service employees for their insights following a customer interaction.


Employees often have some of the best feedback to offer since they interact daily with customers. All businesses should view their customer touchpoints as an opportunity to not only make their customers happy but also as a chance to learn and adapt for the future. In 2024, you should consider finding ways to better obtain customer insights, whether that be through investing in data analytics or looking for insights from your employees.Providing great customer service should always be a priority for business leaders, but it continues to be more important each year. As we move through 2024, be sure to keep tabs on customer service trends, especially when it comes to the importance of self-service, appealing to Gen Z and harnessing customer insights.

3,The Philly Cheesesteak Was Invented At This Spot in 1930. Here's Why Fans Can't Stay Away 90 Years Later.,"Apr 2, 2024",Shawn P. Walchef,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/heres-where-the-philly-cheesesteak-was-invented/471584,"
At the heart of Philadelphia's culinary legacy stands Pat's King of Steaks, a landmark synonymous with the iconic Philly cheesesteak.Frank Olivieri, the executive chef and owner, traces the origins of this beloved sandwich to a serendipitous moment when his Uncle Pat grew weary of the daily hot dog fare and improvised with ribeye trimmings.""One day my uncle Pat got so tired of eating hot dogs he said to my grandfather, go down to the butcher and see what trimmings he has from the ribeye and bring it back, and we'll make that sandwich that we always like to make,"" Olivieri told host Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media. That sandwich, cooked on the same open flat top as the hot dogs, became what we know now as the Philly cheesesteak.



Related: Chef Says This Is the No. 1 Thing That Makes a Restaurant Successful or NotFor Frank Olivieri, building connections and fostering hospitality is a family tradition deeply ingrained in Pat's King of Steaks. Inspired by his uncle's outgoing nature, Frank emulates Pat's approach of rubbing elbows with Philadelphia's elite and Hollywood stars — all while promoting the business. Olivieri explains, ""What I did was I found a way to let the business work for me rather than me work for the business.""


Philadelphia's legendary hospitality is evident in the enduring legacy of Pat's King of Steaks. Despite the city's infamous weather, loyal patrons brave the elements to savor the iconic cheesesteaks. ""Hospitality is somewhere between going to the French Laundry and that hot dog joint in Chicago where the women yell at you all the time,"" Olivieri laughs.Related: How The Nourish Spot Is Building a Legacy of Healthy Eating and Community ConnectionAbout Restaurant InfluencersRestaurant Influencers is brought to you by Toast, the powerful restaurant point-of-sale and management system that helps restaurants improve operations, increase sales and create a better guest experience.Toast — Powering Successful Restaurants.

4,How An Unmarked Dive Bar in Vegas Became One of America's Must-See Destinations — Within 3 Years of Opening,"Apr 2, 2024",Kristen Bayrakdarian,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-an-unmarked-dive-bar-in-vegas-became-one-of-americas/471448,"
You might not guess that in Las Vegas — a place known for luxury resorts, opulent casinos, and just about any amenity imaginable — one of the city's most beloved establishments is in a single-story building a six-minute drive from the Strip.There's a sole neon sign in the window that says, simply, ""Open."" But inside is a bit of magic: a bar, called The Silver Stamp, that makes just about everyone feel like they're back home, no matter where they're from. And in a city like Las Vegas, that's a high-wire act. ""It's a transient city,"" says Andrew Smith, one of The Silver Stamp's co-owners. ""We have so many different people coming here."" And not just locals. Tourists seek the bar out in almost equal measure.The Silver Stamp has become so beloved that when Entrepreneur held a vote to select America's favorite mom-and-pop shop™ (out of 150 of the most popular small businesses in the country, selected in partnership with Yelp), the divef bar won first place.



Related: These Are America's Favorite 150 Mom & Pop Shops™, According to Yelp and EntrepreneurThis is all the more impressive given that Smith and his co-owner and life partner, Rose Signor, only opened the business three years ago, in February 2021. In that short time, they've paid off their two small investors, the business has averaged 23% revenue growth year over year, and by popular demand, extended their hours from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m.So what is the Silver Stamp getting right?""A lot of people say, 'I don't know what it is, but I just feel so comfortable in your space,'"" Signor says.Comfort — it's no small thing. It's possibly the most important feeling a mom-and-pop shop can evoke. But it's also mysterious. You can't simply buy comfort. You can't follow a checklist to create it. You have to understand, deeply, what it means to you.


Image Credit: Mike BellemeSignor and Smith met in 2017, when she hired him to work at Atomic Liquors, the oldest freestanding bar in Las Vegas. ""It was an instant connection,"" Smith says. They'd both been in the service industry for years — Smith had managed a nearby bar before coming to Atomic Liquors — and they both shared an interest in the craft beer industry. Smith had planned to move to the Northwest at some point, but when he met Signor, he had a good reason to stay. And Signor had actually moved from Las Vegas to Seattle back in 2011 — only to move back a year later. She missed Las Vegas and the desert, and was inspired to infuse Sin City with some of the wholesome beer culture she loved.But Signor and Smith's connection went deeper than a love of pilsners and IPAs. They'd grown up in small towns on opposite sides of the country — Peru, New York, and Yuma, Arizona, respectively — that instilled in them a strong sense of community and, perhaps more importantly, empathy. ""I remember seeing situations [growing up] where I felt truly bad for people getting treated poorly and embarrassed because they didn't have enough money,"" says Signor.Related: A Small Business Owner's Guide to Managing Funds and InvestmentsWhen Signor and Smith discovered that they had both, individually, been saving to open their own bars, joining forces was a no-brainer. ""We knew we wanted to do something together,"" Smith says. They started dreaming about the bar they'd open, and even collecting decorations. A vintage clock here, a disco ball there. A wooden toucan to hang from the ceiling, sock monkeys to dress in funny, seasonal outfits. Their nostalgic, oddball, something-for- everyone aesthetic was representative of their mission for the business. ""We'd been to so many establishments that have not made us feel welcome, or have made us and others feel like outcasts,"" Signor says. ""We wanted everyone to feel included.""In May 2018, they took the leap. They quit their jobs together and backpacked for nine months through Europe and the U.S. to learn more about the history of beer. When their former boss at Atomic Liquors, Lance Johns, reached out and told them he had bought a few buildings in the downtown area, and he would lease one to them, the couple jumped at the chance. They had a vision, and they were ready.  Image Credit: Mike BellemeConstruction on the Silver Stamp began at the end of 2019. A few months later, we all know what happened: The pandemic hit.Smith and Signor had planned to hold other jobs as they built out the space, but the shock to the service industry left them unemployed. They had already sunk $60K of their savings into gutting the space, buying materials and paying contractors, so they pressed ahead. But there were mistakes and setbacks during construction, and the funds dried up way before the bar was finished.

""I remember stepping outside and thinking, We don't really have any money left.""At some point, the couple assessed their situation. Nothing was going to plan, sure, and the money was gone. But they had their own two hands, and a community of friends who were willing to help.They began spending long nights repurposing old, torn-out wood, running electrical lines, and laying plumbing themselves, to cut costs. They sought out any help they could get. ""One of the biggest things I learned during this process,"" Signor says, ""and this is even after we've opened — is to not be afraid to ask as many questions and to reach out to as many people as you can. Sometimes you think you're bothering people, but in that dire moment, I remember panicking and hitting everybody up, asking for suggestions, and looking to people that have a little bit more experience with the situation. There were some really surprising people that came forward to help us just by mentioning what our situation was."" People coached them through different processes, gave them a discount on their services, or lent them materials and machinery. They turned to others for counsel or attempted to replicate, through trial and error, what seemed to have worked for other successful establishments.One person they leaned on a lot was Lance Johns, who knew how hard they worked from when he was their boss. ""Lance is somebody that will give back to people who give to him,"" says Signor. ""Having a mentor saved us a lot of time not having to second-guess ourselves.""One thing they never doubted was how they wanted their bar to feel: inclusive and, of course, comforting.Related: Experts Say This Is the Key to Marketing a Mom and Pop BusinessThey poured those values into every detail and decision. Christmas lights strung across the ceiling help keep the ambience neither too dark nor too bright. Bar stools are repurposed gaming chairs, designed for people to sit in one place for an extended period of time. The collection of cozy nooks and small seating areas encourages intimate conversations, and the music is kept at a low enough decibel that you can hear your neighbor talk. There are only two screens, an anomaly in otherwise tech-saturated Las Vegas. And this low-tech ethos extends to printing physical menus, even though the bar has served over 1,700 different beers in three years — averaging out to nearly two new beers a day. Finally, there's the diversity of decorations and memorabilia — a bubbling lava lamp, vintage beer posters, kooky seasonal decorations, scavenged beer-can art installations — that Signor and Smith had collected over two years before the bar's opening. They're now strewn across the wood-panel walls and, really, everywhere, so that customers have something fun and different to look at in each corner. Customers have even begun adding their own contributions to the decor.


""We have been to enough bars in our life to know what makes us feel comfortable,"" Signor says, ""So how we created the bar was based on our own preferences."" By trusting their own well-defined feelings, they built something universally relatable.Image Credit: Mike BellemeBut creating an environment that is comfortable and relatable is about more than just creative decisions. It's also about financial decisions, and from the start, Signor and Smith were determined to keep costs down. ""We have low overhead because our decisions weren't fueled by [trying to make] money,"" Signor says. ""We intentionally made choices like a cheaper building off the beaten path and being our own managers and cutting out that salary.""Being intimately involved in the day-to-day operations of the space has also helped them foster the spirit of the bar and its employees. ""Our definition of a bartender isn't someone just serving drinks,"" says Signor. ""It's about building a relationship with these guests. When we're hiring, we look for people who genuinely appreciate other people, treat them with respect and kindness, and create a really safe space that people want to come back to."" Their ideal hire is someone who has positive energy, is able to leave their personal life at the door, can laugh and joke with people, and is humble (which they define as ""not intimidating and able to put people at ease"").Related: 50 Amazing Grants, Accelerators, and Free Resources Being Offered to Entrepreneurs by Champions of Small BusinessIt's painful to let people go when they don't live up to those standards, Signor says. But it's also essential. ""When prioritizing what to do next, I always think of the guest sitting in that barstool,"" she explains. ""We tell the staff to pretend we're the guests on the other side. What are they seeing? Really envision it from their perspective.""But, while Signor and Smith want their employees to put themselves in their customers' shoes (or, rather, stools), they also believe that employees have to be happy for customers to enjoy themselves. They offer health benefits — something they say is mostly unheard of in their industry, but something they wanted when they were employed by others. They are also transparent with their employees about finances and business decisions, sharing numbers and providing reasoning for changes. They take their workers' thoughts into consideration, whether it be opinions on events or on shifts in workflow. And they don't ask employees to do anything they wouldn't want to do. (The pair continue to work bar shifts alongside their staff — including cleanup duty.)""Don't be afraid to get feedback,"" says Signor. ""Our staff is so important to us and really we wouldn't be the bar that we are without them. So we lean on them, and they lean on us.""


The same way she encourages her employees to look at things through the customer's eyes, she makes a habit of looking at a situation from the viewpoint of her employees. ""I've learned to always try to put myself in the mindset of the other person,"" she says. ""I roleplay with myself in my head: If I say this to them, what do I think their response will yield? And could I say it differently? I just really try to understand where they're coming from before we approach the situation."" She adds, ""And then if we're frustrated, we sleep on it. That was something that my mentor told me: 'Always take a couple of days to reflect.'""These days, when Smith and Signor reflect on their business journey, it's notable that, in a city known for its fabulous attractions, The Silver Stamp has become its own must-see destination. ""We've become a bar people bring their families to when they're in town because they have to show their parents, their uncle,"" Smith says.Signor adds, ""We've had grown people cry when they first come in here. The space touches them immediately.""People are always looking for comfort, and the Silver Stamp shows that if you devote yourself and your business to that quality above all, people will feel it — and deeply appreciate it. You just need a vision, and a willingness to get your hands dirty. ""Every single aspect of this bar we've had our hands in,"" says Smith. He and Signor think it's funny that one of the bar's quirks that locals and tourists love — the fact that they don't have signage outside their building, giving the bar that local, in-the-know vibe — came about because they couldn't afford the sign they had designed.That's the kind of thing you never could have planned for. So, while Smith and Signor have received offers to franchise the bar, they don't think what they've created can be replicated. They do have other plans in the works. But The Silver Stamp will remain dependably unique — news that is its own kind of comfort.Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big Brands

5,90% of Execs Say Providing Employee Health Benefits Will Be Unsustainable By 2030 — Here's One Solution Businesses Need to Consider,"Apr 1, 2024",Michael Waterbury,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/90-of-execs-say-providing-employee-health-benefits-will-be/469603,"
Healthcare appears to be headed for a breaking point as the cost for employers threatens to become unsustainable. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 9 out of 10 executives say it will be impossible to continue providing employee health benefits by 2030.Rising healthcare costs are a challenge, but not an impossible one. Employers today have options. More and more, companies of all sizes are self-funding their employee healthcare to control costs, while fully funded and self-funded employers alike are adopting high deductible health plans (HDHP) that require lower premiums.There are risks with these approaches, though. Self-funded employers who do not take care to contain healthcare costs can see their own expenses spiral. High deductibles, meanwhile, can saddle employees with greater medical debt.



However, these cost-saving measures do not need to result in an outsized risk for the employer or medical debt for the employee. Low-cost enhancements to health benefits can provide substantial support to employees in any workplace, regardless of whether their health plans are fully insured or self-funded.For self-funded employers in particular, these improvements are especially advantageous, as their expenses are directly linked to the healthcare costs incurred by their employees.


The most effective enhancement available to employers is the healthcare navigator. With a single phone call, employees who work for businesses that offer a navigator with their healthcare plans can save in numerous ways, lowering overall medical costs for the self-funded employer and helping covered workers avoid medical debt.Related: There's A New Trend In Healthcare That's Saving Money For Small BusinessesPrice comparisonPeople aren't usually aware of what their health plan covers until they need to use their insurance. That can be a stressful time to find out how much a necessary procedure costs. And it's unlikely that someone in need of medical care is going to shop around and compare prices.This is where healthcare navigators come in: They can do the comparisons for the plan participant and often find a care path that costs significantly less than the one recommended by an insurance plan or primary care provider. In this way, navigators help employees avoid certain costs that could otherwise have a devastating effect on their personal bottom lines, as well as the financial health of self-funded employers.


Bill reviewBy now, many people are aware that billing errors are shockingly common in the healthcare industry. When a patient pays a bill they aren't actually responsible for, the patient is due a refund of the overpaid amount.However, the average employee might not be aware that they've overpaid or might not have time to investigate whether they were billed in error. Likewise, a self-funded employer may not have the internal resources to do this kind of investigative work. A healthcare navigator knows how to quickly spot this type of error and can help the employee (and the self-funded employer) get the refund they are owed.Financial assistanceOften, people don't know that they qualify for hospital financial assistance. Employees might assume they're not eligible for such programs based on their income, so they don't apply, when in fact financial assistance could save them (and the self-funded employer) thousands of dollars.Healthcare navigation can guide people through the process of applying through a hospital's financial assistance portal, potentially leading to significant direct savings.


Related: How to Protect Your Money from Getting Eaten by Health-Care CostsTime savedFor the average person who isn't well-versed in the complex language and structure of the health insurance universe, trying to figure out and deal with health care costs is extremely time-consuming.Frustrating health insurance issues that would have taken a plan participant four hours to solve take only one hour with a navigator. Those lost hours of problem-solving don't just cost the employee; they can cost the employer as well by cutting into work hours and tying up HR resources.Not just for low-cost plansWhile employees on HDHPs and businesses that self-insure stand to benefit the most from healthcare navigators, there are advantages to this kind of policy enhancement for any company offering their employees health insurance.


No matter how the care is funded or what type of plan an employee is signed up for, healthcare can be intimidating. Any employer who provides workers with an ally in the fight to get the best care with the lowest personal cost is likely to build goodwill among staff and burnish its reputation as a people-first enterprise.Combining all these types of cost savings, from pre-treatment to bill review, it's possible to establish a comprehensive figure that accounts for the total savings realized by using a healthcare navigation service. Depending on the size of the company, this can add up to millions of dollars.Making sense of the complex and expensive world of healthcare requires dedicated expertise. Healthcare navigation is something that employers and employees can't afford to go without.Related: 6 Ways Entrepreneurs Can Solve the Problem of Medical Debt

6,I Specialize in Exit Planning — You Need to Make These 5 Moves Before Selling Your Business,"Apr 1, 2024",Mark Kravietz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/you-need-to-make-these-5-moves-before-selling-your-business/470750,"
It's never too early to prepare your company for a sale. The business landscape is evolving rapidly, and entrepreneurs considering selling their businesses must adapt to the changing market dynamics. Strategic planning and timely decision-making can significantly impact the success of selling a business. In this article, we will explore five crucial moves business owners should make in preparation for selling their business in 2025.1. Embrace technology and digital transformationIn the digital age, technology plays a pivotal role in business operations and value proposition. As of 2022, businesses that fully embrace digital transformation are more likely to attract higher valuations when it comes time to sell. According to a study by McKinsey, companies that invest in digital capabilities experience revenue growth rates 2.5 times higher than their counterparts.To position your business for a successful sale in 2025, focus on enhancing your digital infrastructure, adopting advanced technologies and staying ahead of industry trends. Leverage data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to streamline processes, improve efficiency and demonstrate the scalability of your business to potential buyers. Most importantly, help ensure your employees are using this technology responsibly; implement an AI policy to protect your customers and employees.



Related: How Much Time Do I Need to Sell My Business? First, Consider These 7 Factors.2. Strengthen financial performanceA robust financial performance is a key driver in determining the value of a business. Prospective buyers closely scrutinize financial statements, profitability, and cash flow before making acquisition decisions. They also look for growth of earnings. I'm working with a client whose business was off significantly in 2020 and 2021 and just started to come back in 2022. There will be excellent growth from '23 to '25 and he is looking to sell by the end of '25. It was his patience, cost-cutting and streamlining of his products that turned things around. I believe he will have a successful exit.


To help maximize the value of your business, focus on improving profitability, minimizing debt and maintaining a healthy cash flow. Implement cost-cutting measures, optimize operational efficiency and diversify revenue streams. By presenting a solid financial foundation, you will increase the attractiveness of your business to potential acquirers.3. Build a strong and adaptable teamBuyers are not just acquiring a business; they are inheriting a team. Having a skilled and adaptable workforce is crucial for the long-term success of any business. According to Deloitte, organizations with strong leaders are 2.3 times more likely to financially outperform their peers.Invest in training and development programs to upskill your employees and help ensure they are equipped to navigate the evolving business landscape. Provide each employee with an annual budget for continuing education and make sure they use it! Every employee that attends a conference should present their key learnings to the company so everyone can benefit.A skilled and adaptable team adds significant value to your business, making it more appealing to potential buyers who are looking for a seamless transition.


4. Enhance customer relationships and brand equityCustomer relationships and brand equity are intangible assets that greatly influence the perceived value of a business. Additionally, a strong brand can command premium prices and create a competitive advantage.Invest in customer satisfaction initiatives, gather feedback and address any issues promptly. This is not a one-time thing, but something that must be done on a regular basis. Cultivate a positive brand image through effective marketing and public relations strategies. These initiatives take time and funds to implement, so start early and make sure to budget accordingly to keep the momentum going. By enhancing customer relationships and brand equity, you not only improve your business's market position but also make it more attractive to potential buyers who seek a reputable and customer-centric acquisition.Related: You Sold Your Business. Now What? Embracing a New Chapter with Care and Purpose5. Engage professional advisors earlyNavigating the complex process of selling a business requires knowledge and experience. Engaging professional advisors early in the process can significantly impact the outcome of the sale. In an Exit Planning Institute NY Chapter's State of Owner Readiness Survey, 78% of business owners indicated that they had a formal transition team. This shows the importance of creating a team of professionals.


Seek the assistance of financial advisors, legal professionals, merger and acquisition specialists and investment bankers. Make sure your financial advisor has experience with exit planning; the Certified Exit Planning Advisor (CEPA®) has proficiency in helping business owners sell their businesses. Their insights, negotiation skills, and market knowledge can be invaluable in maximizing the value of your business and ensuring a smooth transaction.Selling a business in 2025 requires strategic foresight and proactive measures. By embracing technology, strengthening financial performance, building a strong team, enhancing customer relationships and engaging professional advisors early, business owners can position themselves for a successful and lucrative sale. The statistics and industry insights mentioned in this article underscore the importance of these moves in the context of the evolving business landscape. As you prepare to sell your business, remember that early preparation and strategic decision-making can make all the difference in achieving a favorable outcome in the competitive market of 2025.

7,How to Choose the Right AI Partner for Your Business,"Mar 29, 2024",Adam Chandler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/a-checklist-for-selecting-an-ai-partner/471570,"
Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and automation is more than a trend — it's a strategic imperative. It has been shown that ""60% of business owners believe AI will increase productivity,"" and ""42% believe it will streamline job processes.""Selecting the right partner is crucial for marketing professionals aiming to increase location owner adoption, boost visibility at a corporate level and streamline operations and advertising. Let's discuss the key considerations to help guide marketing experts in this journey.The essential considerationsThe first thing to consider is expertise and experience. When evaluating potential partners, assess their track record in driving location owner adoption. Look for partners with proven experience in implementing successful marketing strategies and automation techniques tailored for streamlined operations and increased adoption at the local level.



When referring to proven experience, this includes asking the right questions. What are those? For starters, what is their average increase in location adoption rates per brand? How do they safeguard their technology and client data to ensure trust and transparency? Do they have clients you can speak with and receive testimonials from that can speak to the specific challenges your brand and team are facing?Related: 4 Ways AI Is Revolutionizing Targeted Advertising — And How to Balance Its Ethical Implications


Next, look at the customization and scalability factors. Effective marketing strategies require tailored approaches. Ensure your partner implements client feedback and grows to customize their AI solutions to enhance location-specific initiatives. Regarding scalability, check to see that corporate-level visibility and expansion are seamlessly integrated.The third key factor to assess when looking for a compatible marketing partner is whether their existing technologies are compatible with your marketing goals. A capable partner should provide easy integration for an efficient and cohesive advertising ecosystem, ensuring that all parts work harmoniously together. One way to check on this is to conduct a pilot project that tests integration capabilities. Other things you should consider for a vendor partner checklist include:Scalability — Confirm that the vendor's solution can scale to meet the brand's growing needs and user base.Data Security — Ensure that the vendor complies with data security and privacy standards relevant to the industry.Performance Metrics — Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and ensure the vendor can provide relevant metrics.Customization Options — Access the level of customization the vendor allows to tailor the solution to your brand's specific requirements, voice and standards.User Experience — Evaluate the impact of the integration on the overall user experience for both internal teams and location owners.Ongoing Support and Maintenance—Confirm the vendor's availability to support your brand's team members and assess how they troubleshoot and provide maintenance.Compliance — Verify that the vendor's solution can seamlessly interact with other third-party tools and services.Testing and QA Processes — Discuss the vendor's testing and quality assurance processes to ensure a smooth integration and minimize potential issues.Updates and Upgrades — Ask about the frequency of updates and upgrades to the vendor's solution and their process for ensuring backward compatibility.Related: AI is the Antithesis of Authenticity — But There's Hope. Here's How We Can Align Our Human Values with AI.Going beyond the basicsIt's time to take your search a step further. All the components highlighted above are indicators of a successful integration and trial period with a partner brand, but let's get team-specific.


In any partnership, you want to ensure transparency and communication are at the forefront. Effective collaboration demands clear communication channels. Choose a partner emphasizing transparency in processes, timelines and potential challenges. This ensures a smooth workflow and minimizes potential disruptions. Also, check to see that this possible partner is not only your time and communication but also that of your location owners. Assess how they will interact with your brand owners and what that may look like on an ongoing basis. Is this the communication they need? Can they provide aid, guidance and support to your leadership team and individual location owners? If the answer is yes, this may be your perfect partner.Marketing strategies are dynamic, requiring partners who can adapt to change. Assess a potential partner's flexibility in accommodating new marketing strategies, changes and feedback to ensure dynamic and effective advertising campaigns. Also, the importance of a cost-effective partnership cannot be overstated. Evaluate the overall value proposition, ensuring that your investment translates into increased ROI And efficient budget utilization.Related: 5 Trends Shaping the Next Generation of Digital MarketingUse your case studies to your advantage.Real-world examples offer valuable insights.

8,Why DEI Still Matters for Small Businesses and Startups,"Mar 28, 2024",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-dei-still-matters-for-small-businesses/471543,"
All businesses want to succeed, but there is something many of them may not realize can support their growth. They say diversity is our strength as a society and encourages new ideas and perspectives. Well, I am here to tell you that the same things — diversity, equity and inclusion — can give businesses an edge. Some small company owners may think focusing on making sure their business and culture are unbiased, fair and welcoming to all types of people is just about being politically correct. Let's see how centering on these values — what I will call DEI for short — can truly help startups and smaller companies be stronger and more profitable over the long run.Related: Prioritize DEI and Crush Your ROI Goals — How Inclusive and Authentic Marketing Drive Business GrowthAttracting top talent is getting more competitiveOne big reason why DEI is important for small businesses is because attracting top talent is constantly becoming more competitive. Nowadays, when people, especially the younger generation, are looking for jobs, they do not just look at pay and benefits. They also want to work for companies whose values match their own. Top candidates may leave a small business or startup to work for organizations that value DEI; hence, the latter risk losing out on excellent applicants. As smaller businesses look to expand, having an inclusive culture and a diverse team can help them attract the most incredible talent available.



A better reflection of your customer baseHaving a more diverse workforce can help you better understand and service a broad consumer base, which further motivates startups to focus on DEI. It will be more difficult for employees to relate to and address customers' demands from different backgrounds if they all have similar experiences. On the other hand, a diverse team of employees from various backgrounds may offer insightful advice on connecting with and pleasing clients from all backgrounds. More satisfied customers and growth prospects will follow from this.Related: The Burden of Breaking Barriers is Pushing Black Leaders to Breaking Point. This DEI Expert Reveals Where We Are Going Wrong.


Improved creativity and innovationResearch repeatedly shows that having a varied group of people with different viewpoints, experiences and backgrounds fosters greater creativity and more creative problem-solving. A workplace where all views are heard can help spark innovative solutions that may not originate from a homogeneous group. This is beneficial for smaller companies and startups that are attempting to remain dynamic and come up with fresh ideas. Diverse perspectives produce more creative products, services and methods, essential for any expanding business.Setting the right example for othersEven if your small business is just starting now, you can set the right example when it comes to DEI from the beginning. While some established companies may find it hard to change their culture, new startups can build inclusion into their foundations. Leading with strong DEI practices from day one allows you to attract like-minded customers, partners and investors who want to support companies demonstrating fairness and equality. It also prepares you to be a responsible community member and role model for positive change as your company succeeds.Related: 4 Ways Inclusive Leaders Can Respond to the Weaponizing of DEILegal and regulatory complianceFocusing on DEI for small businesses is also essential simply for legal and regulatory compliance reasons. As anti-discrimination laws and regulations continue to strengthen over time, companies of all sizes must ensure equitable policies and an inclusive culture. This reduces the risks of unfair treatment claims that can damage brands or result in lawsuits. Having defined DEI best practices and annual training shows that even a young company is operating ethically and by the law from the start.Some practical ways small companies can improve DEI:Commit from the top. The CEO and other top leaders must fully support and champion DEI from day one. They will need to communicate to all employees that promoting diversity and inclusiveness is a core value of the company. Leaders must provide the motivation and resources for DEI efforts to take root within the organization truly. When managers demonstrate their investment in these issues through their words and actions, it will encourage everyone else to get on board.Support employee resource groups. Employee resource groups (ERGs) allow workers with shared backgrounds or life experiences to connect, raise awareness on issues impacting their communities, and advise company leaders. Small teams can sponsor one or two ERGs made up of volunteers. This allows employees to lead in promoting inclusion from peer to peer while getting necessary support and visibility from high levels.Audit hiring and promotion practices. To address potential biases or inequities, small businesses must examine how they hire, develop and promote workers. Companies can review applicants and leadership demographics over the past few years. Do these numbers properly represent the diverse pools of talented individuals in their industry and community? Are there patterns indicating unfair barriers that held some groups back from equal opportunities? By reflecting on hiring metrics, businesses gain insight into whether implicit prejudices need addressing to establish a more just system open to all.My advice would be to analyze how balanced and welcoming your business is, look for low-cost ways to enhance fairness and continue working on DEI as your operation expands. If you prioritize DEI and focus even a little each month on improvements, your business will be on the right track to attracting and keeping talent and customers for the long run.

9,Working With a Third-Party Logistics Provider? Here Are 3 Key Steps to Ensure a Seamless and Successful Partnership.,"Mar 27, 2024",Mark Ang,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-ensure-a-successful-partnership-with-a-third-party/470617,"
Brands spend major dollars making positive connections with customers. They seek out touch points to build awareness, create personalized experiences and establish emotional links that drive greater engagement, sales and loyalty. And they are well aware that every interaction counts.Yet, amid this flurry of activity, there's one vital relationship brands may be overlooking that can make or break their entire customer connection: It's the partnership with their third-party logistics (3PL) provider.Much like any successful relationship, this connection thrives on clear communication, mutual trust, compatibility and a deep understanding of each other's needs and objectives. It's not just up to a 3PL to make the relationship work — it's a collaborative path that leads to its success.



Going well beyond contractual agreements, here are the three essential strategies brands can employ to nurture a thriving 3PL partnership and enhance their customer experience:Related: The 4 Key Tenets of Every Successful Partnership


1. Communicate openly and oftenWhen a brand engages with a 3PL, establishing transparent and consistent communication is key to its long-term success. It starts during the evaluation phase when brands lay out their requirements and leads into the proposal phase when 3PLs share their core competencies. Before a partnership decision is even made, 3PLs should have their implementation plan mapped out, accounting for a brand's system integrations, inventory management, packing details and carrier preferences, among other leading factors.Open communication shouldn't end with a service agreement. For a truly successful partnership, brands can't take a set-it-and-forget-it approach with their 3PL. They can make warehouse site visits, establish channels for communication and share vital information regularly. The same goes for 3PLs. They cannot simply take over warehousing, inventory management, picking and packing, shipping and delivery without understanding all the nuances of a brand's business, from a brand's identity and SOPs to its specific compliance requirements for order fulfillment. Each partner must be willing to go all in on communicating transparently, frequently sharing forecasting and sales data, providing visibility into inventory levels and discussing any issues, performance metrics and customer feedback that arise.By fostering a strong collaborative relationship with their 3PL, brands can achieve efficient operations, transparent pricing aligned with expectations, and effective communication tailored to its unique needs. This alignment cultivates a positive customer experience, characterized by predictability and reliability.2. Treat your 3PL as an extension of your brandA successful 3PL-brand partnership goes beyond mere transactions. In the most successful partnerships, brands view their 3PL as a true extension of their team. This is an intentional process that takes more than simple collaboration. It requires a willingness from both brands and their 3PLs to integrate themselves into each other's business.


3PLs aren't typically experts in retail, but they are experts in getting products to shoppers. By relegating a 3PL to just operational tasks without integrating them into the broader strategic framework, brands can encounter inefficiencies and missed opportunities.Take sales and promotions as an example. Say a brand has invested significant time and resources into launching a new product with a splashy ad campaign but didn't inform their 3PL partner of the expected upswing in inventory and sales. This will result in staffing shortages, fulfillment delays and disappointed shoppers. By leaving their 3PL in the dark, and not giving them the opportunity to prepare, the brand didn't support a successful partnership.Communicating variances, whether it's new SKUs or expected volume fluctuations, is a simple way to bring the 3PL along for the journey. Brands and 3PLs can take it further by establishing a point of contact who regularly shares updates, discusses KPIs like dock-to-stock metrics or inventory and picking accuracy, and aligns their customer support programs to quickly resolve shopper issues.Operating as an integral part of a brand's team gives 3PLs the flexibility needed to adapt their operation to address partner needs instead of imposing rigid, one-size-fits-all solutions.


Related: These are the Do's and Don'ts of Working With a Third Party Service Provider3. Embrace 3PL technology and the visibility it providesAs retailers look for methods to improve their customer experience, 3PLs embracing technology are rising to the occasion to meet their needs.It's not enough just to partner with tech-forward 3PLs, though. Brands need to go all in on the technology offered to stay competitive and meet the ever-evolving demands of their customers.Various technology platforms, such as Order Management Systems (OMS), Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) and Transportation Management Systems (TMS), offer brands real-time insights into their 3PL, fulfillment and delivery operations, drive efficiency and offer visibility throughout their entire operation. What's more, a 3PL's automation, robotics and AI tools can boost productivity, reduce costs and enhance workforce experiences — leading to happier warehouse and delivery associates who perform better for brand partners.


Embracing technology and the 3PLs that adopt it, enhances operational efficiency and provides brands with the visibility they need to make informed decisions and proactively address customer needs, ultimately leading to a more seamless and satisfying shopping experience.Related: How To Get the Most Out of External PartnersMaintaining open lines of communication, viewing 3PLs as a strategic partner rather than a service provider and embracing their technology are all key to forming successful partnerships.With a strong 3PL relationship, brands can elevate their customer experience to drive brand loyalty and stay ahead of the curve in the increasingly competitive retail environment.

10,What Are Your Customers Watching While They Wait? Learn How To Improve Your Business's Atmosphere.,"Mar 26, 2024",Shawn P. Walchef,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-keep-customers-entertained-while-they-wait/471525,"
Do you sometimes sit in a waiting room or at the bar and wonder what to look at?Atmosphere TV was created to get your attention (and entertain you too) in those moments with a curated stream of engaging, audio-free video content.Blake Sabatinelli is the CEO of Atmosphere, the world's largest streaming television platform for businesses. ""It's a pretty simple premise,"" Sabatinelli told Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media. ""We make TV for businesses.""



Related: How the Owner of an Award-Winning Restaurant Brand Beat the Odds and Found SuccessAtmosphere is about crafting an engaging out-of-home experience tailored for businesses across various industries.


By curating a diverse range of audio-less channels, covering everything from live sports to animal antics to America's Funniest Home Videos, Atmosphere ensures that every business can curate the perfect ""atmosphere"" for its patrons, far beyond traditional programming. Their content is shown in places all over the world.""We've done just about everything you can think of,"" said Sabatinelli. ""Frankly, we have a channel for every environment, and we do that because everyone has their own tastes, everyone has their own atmosphere within their businesses, and that is a pun that's intended.""Related: Chef Says This Is the No. 1 Thing That Makes a Restaurant Successful or NotThe fuel behind Atmosphere comes down to one of the most powerful things around these days: engaging content.


Atmosphere teamed up with Red Bull to present the X Games Aspen Live on their platform so venues could air it for their patrons as it was happening, instead of later as clips. ""Red Bull is an amazing partner to us in so many ways. They were one of the first groups to really place a bet on this little company based out of Austin, Texas.""Sabatinelli saw the power of partnerships first-hand when the CEO heard comedian Bert Kreischer tell a story on his popular podcast about watching the X Games live at a California bar that has Atmosphere TV.Bert thought the Red Bull-sponsored extreme sports event looked like so much fun he went out and bought a ticket to the X Games the next day. All because he saw it on Atmosphere.Growing Atmosphere into a global company has required hard work and big decisions. In the face of adversity brought on by the pandemic, Atmosphere pivoted and expanded its reach to find new opportunities in sectors like doctor's offices and auto shops. The places where people have to wait and could use some entertainment.


""We moved our business to not just focus on bars and restaurants,"" he said, ""but bars and restaurants and other locations that have intentionality of viewership and significant dwell time.""This strategic shift underscores Sabatinelli's commitment to adapting to evolving market conditions and meeting the needs of diverse businesses. ""Finding a way to get the people to take a breath and enjoy the experience around them, it's just such a no-brainer and such a huge opportunity for a business like ours.""Building An Advertising PlatformThe Atmosphere platform is also an advertising network in addition to a content publisher.""The ability to light up a campaign — in a way like you do on Google or on Meta now — to drive results for your business is something we spent a lot of time making sure we could do,"" he says. ""But beyond that, we spent a lot of time making sure we got it right.""


Related: How The Nourish Spot Is Building a Legacy of Healthy Eating and Community ConnectionSabatinelli believes there's a big opportunity to help empower small businesses to drive value and awareness with price-competitive advertising depending on their goals and budget.""One of the areas we're most excited about is not just growing out the national advertising platform as a whole, but also building something of scale and opportunity for restaurant operators like yourself to go and make sure you can drive foot traffic and make money,"" the Atmosphere CEO says.

11,The Counter Service at Yo' Mama's Is Just As Unique As Its Name. Here's Why People Come Back for the Experience as Much as the Food.,"Mar 15, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-customer-experience-at-yo-mamas-is-just-as-unique-as/471207,"
The environment at Yo' Mama's, a comfort food restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama, is just what it sounds like: a warm space that makes customers feel at home. Owned and operated by Crystal Peterson and her family, the establishment wins over customers through its quick and engaging counter service.Crystal and her mom got their start selling food at jazz festivals in Florida back in 2011. When they moved into a brick-and-mortar in 2014, Crystal developed her unique business model through market research.""I actually [ate] at every single restaurant I could think of that could be comparable to [mine] and [looked] at what was missing,"" she revealed. ""Was it the customer service aspect? Was it the portion size? Was it the flavor?""



What she found was that counter service is a win for both the owner and the customer. When guests aren't waiting thirty minutes to order their food, Crystal doesn't have to stress about turning tables and can provide the quality customer service that is so crucial to success.It's also important to understand your customer base. Crystal's restaurant tends to draw in travelers and workers looking for a bite to eat during their mid-day break. Because of this, she aims to create a ""getaway"" space where customers can relax in the middle of a busy day and enjoy a delicious meal without worrying about long wait times.


Yo' Mama's regulars, like Yelp Elite Delia S., love the way Crystal and her staff approach customer service, greeting customers at the counter and walking them through the menu.""I remember the interpersonal contact that this restaurant does on a consistent basis,"" Delia said. ""The vibe I got was, 'We're excited you're here. We appreciate your business, and we also want to make this an establishment where you will continue to visit and tell other people about it.'""Key to Yo' Mama's top-tier service is Crystal's involvement in the business's day-to-day operations. She knows that morale starts from the top and makes an effort to be at the restaurant as often as she can, engaging with her staff and customers.""What I've known is that workers work better when the owner's in the building,"" she said. ""You get a better product, so the customer is more satisfied.""


Crystal has also made her business a hit by focusing on a niche. Her gluten-free menu attracts people who can't satisfy their dietary needs at just any restaurant, and it also creates an element of surprise and delight for customers who don't come in looking for gluten-free food and still enjoy their meal.This focus on accommodating dietary restrictions has helped Yo' Mama's create a strong community where every diner feels included.""I've literally had customers that have come in and cried because their kid has never been able to eat in a restaurant because they are gluten intolerant. And they [can] actually sit there and enjoy a meal with them instead of having to bring a snack in for them to eat or get[ting] food from another restaurant [to] bring to them.""Building this kind of welcoming and accessible space for the local community aids Crystal's ultimate goal as a business owner to support the local economy. She emphasized that if you and your neighbors don't spend your money where you live, nobody else will, especially if everyone commutes to larger cities or towns.


""You have to be a citizen, and [being] a citizen equates to using your money right by your house instead of going to the other side of town,"" she said.Spending money at Black-owned businesses, who are often hindered by stereotypes, is especially important. Delia makes an effort not only to visit local Black-owned businesses but shout them out on Yelp whenever she can, letting people know that these spots are for everyone to visit and enjoy.""Oftentimes in restaurants, I don't think the playing field is fair. As a Yelp Elite, I am more drawn to trying as many of the smaller, often Black-owned restaurants that our city has to offer because there's such a large Black community—but that doesn't mean that only Black people are eating Black food. Restaurants are spaces that have the ability to traverse across class, race, region. You go into Yo' Mama's, and you see a diversity of people there gathering around this comfort food.""Delia also makes sure all her reviews are thoughtful, filling gaps on Yelp Pages by uploading missing photos of dishes and menus and choosing not to post about negative experiences unless she has valuable tips for owners or other guests.


Crystal brings this same level of intentionality to her review responses as an owner. She has found that some consumers only review a business when they want to express frustration or have expectations that Crystal can't satisfy, like an issue with her pricing. She chooses not to let these customers bring down her energy or service-focused mindset. By managing her emotions in the face of backlash, Crystal is able to engage with customers in a more productive way.""Some [customers] are coming in looking to lose. Some of the problems that people have don't even include me. So if I can control my emotions to change your emotions, then maybe we can win this and you can actually enjoy the experience.""In addition to an inviting restaurant atmosphere, Yo' Mama's believes in:Understanding your customers and your role in the business community. Gain an edge by researching your competitors and thinking about how you can fill gaps in their offerings.Restaurants as a space for diverse, inclusive community. Accommodating the needs of all your customers, including those with dietary restrictions, can help everyone who enters your space feel seen and welcome.Being flexible in the face of chaos. Navigate unexpected business obstacles by keeping the well-being of your customers and staff at the forefront.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Crystal and Delia, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.

12,Boomers: The Wealthy Client Group You Can't Ignore — Here's the Best Way to Market to Them.,"Mar 14, 2024",Scott Keffer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/boomers-own-most-of-the-wealth-heres-the-best-way-to/469989,"
In the unending search for the holy grail of marketing, financial advisors are lately tempted by promises of quick and easy client acquisition through digital marketing miracles. From buying digital leads to endless social media posts, content marketing and webinars, the financial industry has embraced the allure of online strategies with hopes of waves of new affluent clients.However, starting with a method is marketing backward. Marketing should always begin with your ideal client. Knowing their mindset is the recipe for success – embracing their desires, mastering their language, and resonating with their values.The ideal clientThe first and foremost consideration is defining the ideal client. Seeking to be everything to everybody positions you as nothing to no one.



My definition is an E.L.K. — Easy. Listen to you. Keep paying you the most — who is successful, serious and salt. Successful financially ($2 million to $25 million), serious about their money and future and salt-of-the-earth (loyal and trustworthy). Most importantly, they are in a position to become a client today and move their money to you now (ages 64-74).That's a Baby Boomer. Boomers own 51 percent of all wealth in the United States, have the most wealth per household, have the most money in retirement funds and have the most money in stock and mutual funds.


Related: The 7-Step Guide To Finding the Right Clients and Avoiding the Ones Who Waste Your TimeThe normal and natural testProspects do what is normal and natural.Think about this: Would an affluent Boomer normally and naturally go online to find a CPA, attorney, heart surgeon or financial advisor? The answer is no. Sure, there are always exceptions. However, in marketing, relying on exceptions is foolhardy and costly. Marketing must be sustainable and scalable to be successful.Many mistakenly assume that the majority of retail purchases are made online. Not true. In 2023, only 15.6% of all U.S. retail sales occurred online, according to Statista. Furthermore, 84% of Boomers prefer visiting a physical store for their shopping needs.


Understanding the mindset of Boomers, who grew up in a world devoid of technology, unveils a picture of their unique set of values and preferences. Growing up with catalog shopping, green stamps, waiting for the mailman, service stations, rotary phones, telephone operators, sending postcards while traveling, adjusting the antenna on the single black-and-white TV, vinyl records, having milk delivered to a box on the front porch and getting news from Walter Cronkite has stamped an indelible set of values and preferences on them.Not surprisingly, Boomers align with traditional values, are most comfortable with conventional communication, and value information from trusted sources.Typically, three kinds of people go online for financial information: 1. Hot tip investors seeking the latest stock ""intel,"" 2. DIYers seeking ""how to"" information, and 3. Price-shopping penny pinchers seeking a deal. None of these are the kind of people who make the best long-term, loyal clients.Related: How You Can Build Long-Lasting Customer Relationships


The ideal marketing mediumDirect mail aligns perfectly with the preferences of Boomers. They trust the tangible.According to the United States Postal Service (USPS), 92% of Boomers check their mail daily, with 91% stating that sorting through mail doesn't stress them. Furthermore, 82% express a greater likelihood of buying from a business that sends them direct mail, considering it more personal than digital communications. These statistics reinforce that Boomers trust direct mail more than any other marketing channel.Even Google and other popular brands rely on direct mail to get businesses to advertise with them. In a 2018 Vox article, they report, ""Yet over the last few years, brands — including hot, digitally savvy, direct-to-consumer ones like Casper, Harry's, Wayfair, Rover, Quip, Away, Handy, and Modcloth — have taken to targeting customers in the mail.""Better yet, mailboxes are less cluttered these days, which means less competition. As advertising spending overall grew 50% (2015-2021), the dollars that went into Direct Mail dropped 17%, per Statista.


Related: 5 Ways to Effectively Market to Baby BoomersHere are five keys to make for direct mail success1. Personalize the mail: Make it unique — Craft your message as if it's a letter written to a friend. Address the dreams, desires, and concerns of a Boomer. Make them feel seen and understood, establishing an immediate connection. Use their name, acknowledge their individuality, and tailor your communication to resonate on a personal level with authenticity and sincerity.2. Invest in presentation: Make it hard to ignore — Design your mailing package to be visually arresting. Invest in quality paper, eye-catching graphics, and a layout that demands attention. A well-presented letter not only reflects professionalism but also intrigues prospects, urging them to want more.3. Appeal to both the heart and the head: Mix emotion with reason – Strike a balance between emotional resonance and logical persuasion. Connect with them emotionally and support your claims with rational arguments, data, and evidence. This harmonious blend creates a persuasive narrative that speaks to both the heart and the head, leaving a lasting impact and setting you apart from the crowd.


4. Include high-value content – Provide information that adds genuine value. Offer statistics, trends, and insights that position you as a source of exclusive knowledge, elevating the perceived value of your message. By sharing relevant and intriguing content, you position yourself as an indispensable resource, fostering trust and credibility.5. Use familiar analogies and metaphors – Communicate complex ideas using relatable analogies and metaphors. Create a bridge between unfamiliar concepts and your prospects' existing knowledge. Analogies serve as mental shortcuts, making it easier for your reader to grasp the essence of your message. By using familiar comparisons, you enhance accessibility.In a world barraged with online noise, the key to success with affluent Boomers lies in delivering messages that are normal, natural, and, above all, trusted by them. Financial advisors can unlock a deep gold mine of affluent Boomers with little competition by embracing direct mail and crafting personalized, engaging marketing.

15,3 Ways to Achieve Cohesion Across Your Organization's Cybersecurity,"Mar 11, 2024",Jason Oeltjen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-to-create-cohesion-within-your-organizations/470290,"
Data protection and digital privacy have generated significant attention from C-suite leaders, with the Securities and Exchange Commission recently proposing public companies' Board of Directors share the responsibility of IT security supervision, compliance and risk mitigation.As business leaders begin to educate themselves on the fundamentals of cybersecurity, one of the things they cannot overlook is cohesion. With disparate security tools abound, leaders must ensure the IT security stack is working together — rather than creating additional silos.Here's how to achieve optimal cohesion across the security stack.



1. Achieve visibility across all systemsOne of the biggest benefits of a cohesive IT security stack is greater visibility. During a time when cyber threats are more sophisticated than ever before, organizations cannot afford to have blind spots – nor should security teams be chasing false positives. But a common question business leaders face is how to increase visibility without necessarily reinventing the wheel or replacing several security tools in the arsenal.One of the ways to maximize visibility and integration across systems is through a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. SIEMs consolidate data from various systems to provide a centralized view granting users real-time visibility across the entire IT environment. It's one of the first recommendations I typically make to business leaders who want to better understand their organization's security posture without boiling the ocean.


Related: The 'Mother of All Breaches' Just Happened — Here's the Security Implications for Businesses2. Strengthen API securityOnce visibility is established, you must also evaluate the security of the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) through which your systems, tools and applications interact. In simplest terms, APIs work as a backend framework for mobile and web applications — and cybercriminals often take advantage of any API security gaps as a means to gain access to an organization.If APIs aren't properly secured, they can become the next big supply chain attack, with malicious actors introducing malicious code during the attack and wreaking havoc on an organization. In fact, recent research found that cyber attacks targeting APIs increased a whopping 400% from June to December 2022, and since then, they have shown no signs of slowing down.Business leaders must ask themselves: how confident is the organization in its API security? How exactly are these APIs protected? APIs need to have high levels of security; otherwise, they are no safer than a standard password login.


Related: Cyber Threats Are More Prevalent Than Ever — So Don't Leave Your Business Exposed. Here's How to Protect It.3. Ensure flexible integrationsIn addition to gaining visibility and bolstering API security, it's important to strive for flexible integrations across your security systems.To achieve this, first determine:Are you integrating your systems through custom coding? While coding has its benefits, a major drawback is the long-term impact that will arise when engineers leave the company. The U.S. Labor Department estimates that the global shortage of software engineers may reach 85.2 million by 2030, and the position will likely be a revolving door between now and then. How easy will it be for the new engineer to continue working on this custom code? This creates a major barrier to modernizing infrastructure.What happens when you have to swap out one vendor for another, especially to meet compliance requirements or reduce budget? This is where identity orchestration plays a massive role. Traditionally, identity has become a bottleneck in the integration process, but through identity orchestration, enterprises now have the ability to add or remove vendors – spanning applications and services – with speed and ease. It's like an 'easy button' for the tech stack, ensuring simplicity, flexibility and seamlessness across the entire user experience.Are you factoring in all costs of integration, even those that are hidden or come after the fact? I've come across a new vendor being selected due to cost savings, but then organizations forget to consider the runway to integrate the new system into the ecosystem – and the hidden costs that can come with that. Often, these costs can be up to four times the cost of the new system, along with needing 6-12 months to integrate effectively into the organization. Luckily, identity orchestration can help with integration timing as well as long-term ROI.Regardless of the organization's size or sector, businesses are always looking for a more cohesive experience across the tech stack, where speed and security are optimal. This year, when all eyes are on security — including the Board's — is the ideal time to start paving the path towards simpler, seamless security integrations.

16,The Little Coffee Shop That Asks Customers Not to Be Quiet,"Mar 8, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-little-coffee-shop-that-asks-customers-not-to-be-quiet/470902,"
Nirvana Soul in San Jose, California is not a place you go to bury yourself in a book or work quietly on your computer. Colorful artwork lines the walls, and upbeat music fills the air. You're bound to meet someone new during your visit as the conversational baristas and owners float around tables to chat with customers.Sisters Jeronica Macey and Be'Anka Ashaolu started the coffee shop in 2018 to create a space for belonging. They wanted people to have a space where they could experience community or come to make a friend. From day one, they've poured their efforts into curating an energizing and welcoming environment at the shop.Related: How This California Hot Spot Grew From Delivery-Only to Pop-Up Shop to Storefront



Nirvana Soul's tight-knit community feel is a huge appeal for customers, including Yelp Elite and Community Intern Camy T. A local college student, Camy frequents Nirvana Soul to study, work on art, and hang out with friends. ""Downtown coffee shops were missing that community aspect,"" she said. ""But when Nirvana Soul came into town, things shifted in my perspective. It became a hub for many college students for studying, creating art, showcasing their talent at open mic night, and meeting new people, especially creatives.""Be'Anka and Jeronica's team laid the foundation for the shop's accessible and inviting feel. Their friendly staff is eager to answer questions and make an effort to ""table tap,"" walking up to every customer to ask how they're doing and offer them water. ""We just try to put in little joyful moments, so [people] have great coffee and a great experience at the same time,"" Be'Anka said.


The owners acknowledge that their departure from the coffee shop's traditional head-down work environment can lead to misunderstanding and sometimes critical feedback. They've had to learn how to respond when critiques come from someone who might not be in their target audience.""Change is hard, right?"" Be'Anka asked. ""So sometimes, it's almost like a culture shock. We've had reviews where people say, 'This is not what a coffee shop is supposed to be.' And we're like, 'Okay, I hear you, but maybe it's just different than what you're used to and we can be a little more open-minded.'""Related: The Owners of This Texas Farmers Market Took a Big Gamble. Here's How It Paid Off Bigger Than They Dreamed.Reviews like these can actually be a useful way to set expectations for future customers about the shop experience. By clearly communicating how your business operates, future patrons will have a better sense of what to expect and can decide if it's a right fit for their needs. In her time running Nirvana Soul, Be'Anka has learned the value of all feedback, both positive and critical, in helping her optimize the customer experience.


Be'Anka also stressed the importance of sharing your feedback in the moment. While Camy loves the environment and food at Nirvana Soul, she mentioned in her 4-star review that the sweet flavors in her drink were overpowering. Critiques like these are easy fixes that Nirvana Soul's baristas are happy to accommodate in the moment.""We'd so much rather [hear in person] than read about it later because now you're out there in the world with a drink that you hate. We could have gotten you something better, and you're already gone,"" Be'Anka said.As a consumer, Camy feels a responsibility to provide thoughtful feedback, always striving to help businesses improve.""I think people get a bit into the realm of people-pleasing,"" she said. ""You want to make people feel good, but you're also sacrificing your own needs as a consumer by not letting a business know if something could be changed. We're in an era of improvement, of growth, and I think it's important to critique every now and again.""


As a business, in addition to being responsive to feedback, creating touchpoints with your customers on social media is an important way to make them feel like a valued part of your community. As Be'Anka builds up Nirvana Soul's social media presence, she makes an effort to reshare posts from customers whenever she can. These expressions of appreciation go a long way with regulars like Camy.Related: This Mom and Pop Ice Cream Shop's Success Comes Down to This Simple Phrase""I think it's really beautiful to exchange that back-and-forth with a business,"" Camy said. ""I come here frequently. You recognize that, you appreciate me as your customer, and I'm dedicated to your business.""Be'Anka also emphasizes the importance of being consistent and active on social media. If you find social media intimidating, start small. It's better to post one simple photo every day than to let the need for a ""perfect"" feed hold you back from posting.


""I just snap pictures of anything. It doesn't matter what it is. It could be a drink, it could be artwork, it could be a scene in the shop. You don't have to say much. You can describe what's in the photo. You can say 'good morning.' It doesn't even matter because tomorrow's another day and you should probably just post the next picture.""Above all, Nirvana Soul is a space for community, a key part of which is representation. During their six years in business, Be'Anka and Jeronica have featured the work of over 65 artists, including female artists and artists of color, with the intention of creating a space where diverse voices are seen and uplifted.While the shop celebrates its role as one of a handful of Black- and woman-owned businesses in San Jose, Be'Anka recognizes that the quality of the Nirvana Soul experience is what shines through to customers at the end of the day.""We know there's going to be people who find us because we're Black-owned,"" Be'Anka said. ""We also know that it's not going to be a one-and-done with them because they're going to come in, love the experience so much, and know that this is a Black-created experience. And then they'll come back and bring more people—because after a certain point, it's just awesome coffee and a great experience.""


In addition to staying true to your mission and vision, Nirvana Soul believes in:Engaging customers during their visit to your business. Create a space where they feel comfortable chatting, asking questions, and raising any concerns they may have.Maintaining an active social media presence. Consistent posts and reposts welcome customers into your online community and show your appreciation for their support.Using online reviews to understand, optimize, and set expectations for the customer experience.

17,I've Worked Remotely For Over 20 Years — 5 Common Mistakes Companies Make When It Comes to Remote Operations,"Mar 7, 2024",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-common-mistakes-companies-make-with-remote-sops/467326,"
SOPs, or standard operating procedures, are a must for any company — remote or otherwise. However, when working with an entirely remote team, some special considerations need to be put in place. Directing and working remotely for over 20 years, I have a unique perspective on this that I would like to share.1. Out of sight, out of mindIt is common practice to share standard operating procedures during onboarding with new hires, but past that, most companies never mention operating procedures again — unless, of course, there is a change that needs to be made. It is a good idea to have employees review procedures regularly, even if no edits have been made. I recommend reviewing them quarterly in a meeting, or perhaps you could send a survey out a couple of times each year that requires employees to review standard operating procedures and provide feedback on areas they believe can be improved.I once worked with a team that sent out a survey once a year to employees, and to encourage participation every employee received a $50 gift card for completing the survey. Not only did all the employees fill out the survey, but that team had the best standard operating procedures because they were consistently updated and reviewed. Get your team involved, and don't just put operating procedures out of sight and out of mind after onboarding.



Related: I've Managed Remote Teams For 15 Years — Here Are My 3 Most Important Leadership Lessons.2. Ignoring the need for flexibilityRemote work allows employees to have more control over their schedules and work environments, but many companies still adhere to rigid structures that don't accommodate this flexibility. This lack of flexibility can hinder productivity and creativity, as employees may feel restricted and unable to adapt to their unique circumstances. Common working hours are a good start to establish, but keep in mind this is not meant to be the typical 9 to 5 where an employee is at their desk all day.


In my opinion, it is crucial to include in your operating procedures when you expect someone to work. You can mention a time limit such as a minimum of five hours daily, or you can offer specific hours such as 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. The best way to do this is to outline a set of hours that everyone needs to be working at the same time, regardless of time zone — and be sure to let everyone know what time zone they should be referring to! A default zone should be used for everyone, like central standard time.3. Inadequate communication proceduresWithout clear and efficient communication channels, remote teams can struggle to stay connected and aligned. This can lead to misunderstandings, delays and decreased productivity. It's important for companies to establish effective communication protocols, such as regular check-ins, team meetings and utilizing communication tools like video conferencing or messaging platforms. Additionally, providing guidelines on expected response times and communication etiquette can help remote workers feel supported and connected.Another company I worked with offered incentives for those who responded faster than the required time on a regular basis. This ranged from a special bonus to extra time off, and it applied to both internal and external communications. This was outlined in their operating procedures so everyone knew how long they had to respond to messages for coworkers and customers alike. It created a very collaborative environment where everyone was connected and stayed on top of things. It was highlighted in the procedures that everyone would use a single platform to communicate (which, for this particular company, was Slack).4. Failure to address technical challengesFrom unstable internet connections to outdated software, these issues can severely impact productivity and hinder remote workers from performing their tasks effectively. Failing to address these technical challenges not only frustrates employees but also prevents them from reaching their full potential. A good procedure to have in place is what to do when technology does not work — should employees call someone? Send a text? What steps should be taken to let the rest of the team know when something is not working?


The best way to tackle this issue is to include contact information in your operating procedures. That way if someone's computer crashes before a meeting, they can call/text/email the right person to let them know what is happening and ask for what the next steps should be. Include a grace period too; for example, let your employees know that if they are not able to get their computers up and running 10 minutes before a meeting they should reach out to their manager.Related: Remote Work Is the Great Equalizer in the Workplace. Here's How It Will Make Your Business a Better Place to Work.5. Insufficient training and onboarding proceduresMany remote companies tend to throw their new employees into the metaphorical deep end and hope they learn how to swim on their own. While some personalities can handle this, it is extremely difficult and stressful for any person to try to figure out how to operate within a company like that. It is incredibly important to have standard operating procedures for how to onboard a new member to the team from getting them logins to training them on how to use the software given to them to do their job.Your procedures do not have to be overly detailed here, just a general outline for everyone to follow. For example, step one for remote workers should be getting your new team members all the logins they need. Step two should be training on how to use the systems they will work in daily such as instant messaging software and time tracking software. From there your company can customize the steps as needed.


Standard operating procedures unite employees and give them direction within a company, and when working remotely, it is extra important to keep them up to date and in front of everyone so that your employees know what is expected of them and how to handle problems.

      Key Takeaways    



        Every business has a strategy because strategy involves making choices. However, the effectiveness of a strategy lies in whether these choices actively contribute to the business's goals and the delivery of value.
      


        This article outlines seven common but ineffective strategies that businesses may have unintentionally adopted and advice on how to make better choices.
      












    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

""One of the biggest problems with strategy is that the business doesn't have one."" It's common to read this phrase in articles that aim to identify why a business strategy isn't working.And yet, every business has a strategy because strategy is about choices — and the team makes choices every day. The issue is that the choices they make do not advance the business.Effective teams make deliberate choices so every action the business takes drives toward delivering the value the business exists to deliver.Related: 7 Strategies Businesses Can Use to Be Profitable and SustainableSeven common but ineffective business strategiesWhether you're consciously aware of it or not, you make choices based on something. That something and your choices serve as your strategy. Here are seven common but ineffective strategies you may have inadvertently adopted:



1. You're reactiveWhether it's a new idea, a raging fire or the ping in your inbox, you choose to act based on what hits you at that moment. I've made the mistake of saying this type of team isn't strategic when I meant to say they aren't deliberate. You're likely pedaling at full steam but not going anywhere.2. You do what you want to doYou build what you want to build. The quintessential example is a robotics company that wanted to build X even though all the input they received from their customers told them they needed Y. The company continued to build X because that's what they wanted to build. Now, they don't exist anymore. If you're the only one reaping value, you have a hobby, not a business.3. You do what you've always doneYou know the approach works. You're comfortable doing it. And you definitely don't want the stress of changing it. So you keep on keepin' on. Alas, too many businesses no longer exist because they failed to evolve. You must adapt what you do and how you do it because the world changes all the time.4. You chase the new cool thingEvery day brings new priorities that start with emails like, ""Check out how cool this is. We should do it."" Sometimes, you start a new thing because you enjoy creating. Sometimes, you do it because the new thing is simply more exciting than doing the hard work you actually need to do. Much like a reactive strategy, your team finds it hard to gain any traction or soothe their spinning heads.


5. You spend as little money as possibleYou scrutinize every investment looking for the cheapest option, including what could be done for free. Slowly, sometimes glacially, no one wants to work on your team, and your business loses all the resources required to do, well, anything.6. You go after the moneyYou see a way to get a lot of cash in the near term, so you immediately apply effort in that direction. Never mind what you were doing before. Never mind that you (somehow) want team members to keep doing that stuff, too. If you can put a check in the bank today, you'll worry about tomorrow later. Unfortunately, you may not have a business tomorrow.7. You pursue moreWhen someone asks for your strategy, you answer, ""To be the biggest company in the world!"" You pursue more markets, more users and more followers. When asked why, you say, ""Because we need to be the biggest!"" Your team has a tough time making choices and a high likelihood of running an unprofitable business.Related: 5 Common Growth Strategy Mistakes and How You Can Fix Them


How to make better choicesIt's not that the companies making choices in any of these seven ways don't have a strategy; they don't have a particularly good strategy. They may even operate using a few of these strategies at once, which only compounds the negative effects.New businesses launch every day. We can create products and services faster than ever before. And soon, production will come at pennies on the dollar. The only way to thrive is to focus on delivering meaningful value.Define the value you deliver by engaging the people you serve. Then make choices so everything you do as a business drives toward delivering that value. To succeed, you'll need to assess how your choices work — i.e., how effectively they deliver value — and adjust accordingly.Routinely gather input from the people you serve, your team and the external environment, so you're positioned to evolve your business as value shifts, your team grows and the world changes.


You and your team make choices every day. You choose to hold this meeting, adopt this software or launch this product. You need to make deliberate choices that advance your ability to effectively deliver value. The choices you make — and what you base them on — define your strategy. And like so many things, some strategies work better than others.Related: How to Recover From a Failed Strategy

19,This Data Security Consultant Explains Why Businesses Should Embrace Web3 — But Do It Cautiously,"Mar 6, 2024",Ralph Tkatchuk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/businesses-should-embrace-web3-but-do-it-cautiously/469900,"
After much initial skepticism and doubt, Web3 has emerged as a real source of value, paving the way for a new generation of decentralized applications (dApps) built on blockchain. These dApps provide fantastic opportunities for forward-thinking companies to transform their business operations and enhance their efficiency.A 2023 survey of 600 enterprise decision-makers in the U.S., U.K. and China found that nearly 90% of them deploy blockchain technology in some capacity, with 87% saying they planned to invest in blockchain in the next year. This reflects businesses' fear of being left behind as blockchain developments accelerate globally. According to Deloitte, 73% of financial executives believe their organization will lose an opportunity for competitive advantage if they don't adopt blockchain and digital assets.Advocates of Web3 laud the decentralized web's greater resilience and security compared to its predecessor, as blockchain ensures that every transaction is public and verifiable, improving record-keeping and data integrity.



However, despite the promise of blockchain's greater security, the increasing adoption of Web3 technologies has not eradicated security risks, merely changed them: The 2023 Web3 Security Landscape report by Salus shows that cyberattacks on the Web3 industry resulted in losses in excess of $1.7 billion last year, highlighting the extensive range of threats within the decentralized world.Related: Confused About Web3? Steve Aoki Dissects His Business to Show How You Can Make Money.


New security challengesWeb3 avoids some of the security headaches of Web 2.0 but introduces several new ones, almost all unique to the industry.Some of the biggest attacks of the year included the $200 million attack on the cloud-based blockchain services provider Mixin Network; the $197 million attack on Euler Finance; the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group attack on both the Poloniex cryptocurrency exchange and Atomic Waller, stealing more than $126 million from the former and more than $100 million from the latter.The majority of Web2 attacks target users. Most threats faced by the Web3 industry, however, take advantage of code vulnerabilities of decentralized applications and protocols. Access control issues accounted for 39% of all Web3 attacks, whereas flash loan protocols, where flash loans are used to maximize the impact of another form of attack like the exploitation of smart contract bugs or the manipulation of cryptocurrency asset prices on an exchange, contributed to more than 16% of attacks.User-targeted attacks, as mentioned, are ""less popular"" in Web3. Phishing attacks, which use social engineering tricks to manipulate unsuspecting users into exposing data, spreading malware infections or giving access to restricted systems accounted for a mere 4% of all attacks.


Besides software vulnerabilities, retail investors continue to fall for exit scams and ""rugpulls:"" fraudulent crypto projects that convince the community to back them before fleeing with the funds they've raised.Mitigation is possibleReassuringly, there are concrete steps that businesses can take to reduce the likelihood of falling victim to each of these threats. With appropriate caution and due diligence, there is no reason to pass up the many potential benefits of Web3.Related: 5 Essential Tips for Starting a Successful Web 3.0 VentureEnhance authenticationIntroducing more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, like decentralized identifiers (DIDs), access tokens or biometric and multi-factor authentication, will mitigate many security threats such as access control-based vulnerabilities and phishing attacks. Companies should make sure they always adhere to the principle of least privilege, a crucial step for remaining secure online across both Web2 and Web3.


Increase complexityAs in real life, cyber attackers like to get in and out quickly to avoid detection, so increasing the complexity of participation in Web3 projects will make attacks less likely. DeFi protocols offering flash loans can safeguard themselves against threats by introducing minimum borrowing amounts and time limits, as well as additional fees to raise the costs for attackers. In a similar vein, attacks on oracles can be reduced in a number of ways, such as by avoiding the use of markets with shallow liquidity for price predictions, and by increasing manipulation costs for attackers through the use of TWAP (time-weighted average price) mechanisms.Hardware wallets — the use of physical technology to store private cryptographic keys online until they are needed — can also help to avoid hacks. Short of physically stealing the hardware wallet itself, which resembles a USB drive, they are virtually impossible for cybercriminals to access.Implement checksAs with Web2, businesses should regularly update their access permissions to avoid chinks in their security armor. In addition, they should conduct thorough audits of all smart contract code, as this often falls prey to re-entry vulnerabilities. They should also adhere to the check-effect-interaction model.Perform due diligenceOrganizations can employ penetration testing to find and exploit their own vulnerabilities before attackers do. Extensive employee education is also crucial to enable individuals to identify and avoid phishing attacks and other threats.


Finally, make sure to research new projects and their teams carefully to ensure that they have a reliable track record, thus avoiding falling victim to rugpull scams. Prioritize projects that have undergone transparent security assessments by reputable auditors.Related: How to Own Your Online Narrative — Even When the Internet Owns YouEmbrace Web3, but do it cautiouslyThe high exposure to scams in Web3 is one of the major obstacles preventing mass adoption of decentralized technologies. However, though the amount of total losses in 2023 was very high, it was lower than the number for 2022. This suggests that the landscape's overall safety is improving, as more companies adopt the necessary precautionary measures.As Salus points out, $1.7 billion in losses is still an alarming number, and one that emphasizes the importance of improving security and educating users about the risks of Web3. The inherent vulnerabilities of the technology are distributed across multiple areas, demanding a multi-pronged approach to security, which can be enhanced by prioritizing those platforms and protocols that implement the strongest security measures.


My main takeaway from the report is that businesses need not shy away from embracing Web3 and all of the potential it offers. However, their adoption of the technology should be accompanied by extensive checks and research, and adherence to the same strict standards of security as they employ in their legacy technology systems.

20,Big Businesses Take Forever to Pay Their Small Suppliers. These Founders Did Something About It: 'Nobody Had Seen Anything Like This',"Mar 6, 2024",Frances Dodds,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/these-founders-help-small-suppliers-get-paid-quicker-from/470341,"
It should have been a celebratory lunch — the kind where you order french fries and cheesecake, then go home to nap and don't even feel bad about it.Instead, Stacey Abrams and Lara Hodgson were sitting in an Atlanta restaurant, dazed with disappointment, talking in circles, returning again and again to the same confounding question: How did we not know this?It was 2010, and three years earlier, the women had cofounded a company called Nourish, which made grab-and-go baby bottles filled with premeasured, purified water for easy formula mixing. The company had been finding its legs, one wobbly step at a time. Then, Whole Foods placed a huge order of their product.



""It was, like, orders of magnitude bigger than anything we'd done before,"" Hodgson says. They were ecstatic. This is what they should've been celebrating. But then they read the payment terms. ""We discovered that we weren't going to get paid for three to four months. I mean, no small business can handle that.""The women had run headlong into an unspoken rule: the bigger the buyer, the longer they take to pay. And it didn't even matter what the official payment schedule was. ""If your invoice says net 30 or net 60 or net 90 — that's just a suggestion,"" Hodgson says. ""We know now that the average net 30 invoice pays in 54 days. But back then, when we realized all this, I just remember thinking, like, Was I sick one day in business school? Why does no one talk about this?""Related: 10 Small Business Marketing Strategies That Actually WorkThey had more questions, too. Why was this the status quo? Why did no one seem to think it was a big deal? And why — in a country that calls small businesses the backbone of the economy — had no one bothered to create a better solution?Suddenly, they couldn't stop talking about it. They talked with each other, and then with other small business owners, and then with academics and investors. And eventually, they decided to do something about it.Later that year, the duo cofounded NowAccount, a novel business-to-business financing solution that lets small business owners get paid for invoices right away, with low, flat-rate fees, while building up their credit and outsourcing the time-consuming task of tracking down payments. Since its inception in 2010, Now has fast-tracked almost $1 billion in payments for nearly 1,000 businesses, and in the past two years, more than doubled in growth.But getting to this point took a long time: years of asking, and listening, and explaining, and insisting that something could and should be done.""We had to convince people we could solve the problem,"" Abrams says, ""because it sounded like magic.""


Hodgson and Abrams met at a leadership program in Atlanta — but they might not have connected so fast if Abrams hadn't fessed up to her audacious ambition.It was 2004, and they were both enrolled in a tough session: The facilitator had researched attendees ahead of time, and made it his mission to target their insecurities, in order to prompt deeper conversation about biases. Hodgson is an extrovert who loves to talk — so the facilitator didn't let her do that. ""At the end of the weekend, he told me he needed me to know what it felt like to have no voice,"" she says. ""I did not like that.""Abrams is an introvert, so the facilitator treated her the opposite way — constantly pressing her to speak. Eventually, he asked Abrams a direct question: ""What is one great ambition you've never wanted to say out loud?"" She paused, then said she wanted to be president of the United States. Across the room, Hodgson remembers thinking, I always said that as a little girl, and girls don't say that out loud! When they broke for lunch, Hodgson made a beeline for Abrams in the buffet line.Related: 9 Tips To Grow Your Small Business With Social Media MarketingThe women were assigned to the same study group. ""We found that while we had different approaches to problems,"" Abrams says, ""we almost always aligned on solutions."" They became friends, and a couple of years later, founded a consulting company together, making use of Hodgson's business connections and Abrams' knowledge of local tax law. Then they founded Nourish. And that brought them to that bleak lunch in 2010, agonizing over how to get the money for their Whole Foods order. They were searching, once again, for an answer.They'd scrambled to find conventional bridge-funding solutions — a bank loan or invoice factoring — but found the first inaccessible, and the second predatory. Bank loans are hard to get for small business owners without solid credit, or for anyone who doesn't feel comfortable with personal guarantees. Recourse-factoring companies, which buy invoices from small companies, charge variable fees, along with additional accruing fees for late payments (which the small businesses can't predict or control), and often use invasive tactics like collecting money from the business's bank account on a daily or weekly basis. Plus, if a payment falls through, the small business is on the hook for the full payment plus late fees, which leaves a liability on its balance sheet for months.The best option Hodgson and Abrams had found — ""a creative factoring agreement from a community bank"" — also came with personal guarantees. This was uncomfortable for both women. Hodgson had a new baby and worried about losing her house because of the loan, and Abrams had a mortgage and a lot of student debt. Plus, she was financially responsible for her parents and niece.To both women, this situation just felt wrong. They knew they couldn't be the first entrepreneurs to find themselves suddenly ""growing out of business.""""When you encounter a massive problem that's been around forever,"" Abrams says, ""you tend to think, I can't possibly be the first one to see it. So you assume what's happening is your fault, or that the problem would have been solved if it could have been. And you usually stop there. But instead of critiquing ourselves, Lara and I decided to ask: OK, but why hasn't it happened?""


Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaWhen Abrams and Hodgson began talking about solutions, the first thing they thought of was simple: What if Whole Foods could pay them with a credit card? In this case, Nourish, the seller, would be charged the flat 3.5% transaction fee, and get paid right away. Then Whole Foods, the buyer, would pay down the balance on their own time with interest.But therein lies the dilemma: Whole Foods doesn't want to pay its suppliers right away — and certainly doesn't want to pay interest. And because it's a giant company, it doesn't have to. That's the way the capitalist cookie crumbles. Bigger companies set payment terms, and the smaller companies accept them — until they prove critical enough to negotiate.But what if Hodgson and Abrams created something for small businesses that was like being paid with a credit card?This is the idea that eventually became NowAccount: Small businesses would apply to be Now's clients, and pay an annual membership fee of $750. When clients received an invoice from a new buyer, Now would assess the buyer's risk, and if they approved, the client could start uploading invoices. Now would vet each invoice, then pay the client the full amount almost immediately, minus a flat fee based on the payment terms (ranging incrementally from 3% for a net 15 invoice, to 8% for a net 120 invoice). And Now would be reimbursed when the payment is made.Related: 5 Things Not to Do When You're Running a Small BusinessThis would shrink the payment schedule from a few months to just a few days. In the case of Nourish and Whole Foods, it would have looked something like this: If Whole Foods placed an order of, say, $50,000 worth of goods from Nourish, with 90-day payment terms, Nourish would take that invoice to NowAccount, who would confirm its validity with Whole Foods, and then pay Nourish $50,000 right away (minus the 7% fee for a net 90 invoice). Then Now would be reimbursed in, say, 117 days, or whenever Whole Foods actually paid.For a small business owner, the advantages of this setup are numerous: No added interest for late payments you can't control, no liability on your balance sheet, no unforgiving credit checks or invasive debt collection strategies, and no personal guarantees. Unlike factoring companies, which hold you responsible if a payment falls through, NowAccount absorbs the risk of every invoice it accepts. In this way, Now acts as a kind of insurance for their clients.Hodgson and Abrams knew their concept was groundbreaking.Unfortunately, at first, the people they needed to join them were not convinced. Part of the problem was that the concept didn't lend itself to pithy, 30-second elevator pitches. ""It's complicated to explain,"" Hodgson says. ""And because nobody had seen anything like this, when they heard 'get paid fast,' their brains immediately went to, 'Is it a loan? Is it a payday loan? Is it factoring?'""From the finance side, there was also some confusion about why this was even a problem. What's stopping any small business owner from going down to their local bank to get a loan at a lower annual interest rate, or negotiating better terms with their factoring company or buyer?


What financial institutions often overlook are the countless variable barriers for small business owners. Many are becoming entrepreneurs for the first time, figuring it out as they go, without a lot of financial education or resources.Patricia Wilson is a NowAccount client who worked in technology for 20 years before deciding to start her own consulting business, Online Media Interactive. When she started out, she says, ""Honestly, going after a bank loan didn't even occur to me. I was still trying to feel out what I wanted to do from a business perspective. And with traditional factoring companies, I was very intimidated by the aggressive nature of how they collect the money. I just wanted a way to have consistent income coming in.""Another Now client, Mike Riordan, is the founder of Freeze Sleeve, a cold/hot compression therapy he developed for his daughter, a pre-Olympic gymnast. Riordan had previously run a struggling construction company that tanked his credit, so he couldn't get a bank loan for Freeze Sleeve. And he was put off by the ""loan-shark mentality"" of factoring companies.""I think there's a kind of business amnesia that occurs in the financial sector,"" Abrams says. ""The people making these decisions forgot what it was like to be a small business owner."" Moreover, Hodgson thinks there's a misconception in the finance world that you can take funding solutions for large companies and ""miniaturize"" them. ""I tell people, 'Small businesses are not miniature large businesses. You can't just, like, shrink a solution,'"" she says. ""Think about it: If I'm a small business selling to, say, Walmart, and they're demanding net 90, that means they might actually pay in 120 days. So I'm essentially Walmart's free bank for 90-plus days. My cost of capital is way higher than Walmart's, so efficient economic theory suggests the best solution for Walmart is to borrow money really cheaply, pay me faster, and get a discount. But anyone who's tried that knows a large company will just take the discount and still pay you late.""Related: This Is the Unseen Advantage Your Small Business Might NeedIn fact, Hodgson tried this kind of dynamic discounting with one large retailer when they were running Nourish. She'd offer, say, a 2% discount on a net 30 invoice if they paid her in 10 days. But in the end, she says, the retailer just took the discount and still paid her late.""What am I going to do, sue them?"" she says. ""My legal bill would be way more than the 2%, so it's not worth it. I could threaten not to sell to them again, and they'd be like, 'OK, move over! There's a line of people who would gladly take your shelf space.' When you have an imbalance in power, efficient economic theory just doesn't work.""Dr. Richard Bliss, a professor of finance at Babson College and the national academic director for Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses, confirms this. ""It's the classic 'because they can,'"" he says. ""There's a huge power dynamic, and big companies just take advantage. I often hear stories from small business owners who are so excited they got this big contract, but they lose sight of the fact that they still have to make this positive from a financial standpoint. A lot of them don't have the rudimentary forecasting tools to plug in their new contract, look four months down the road to say, 'Holy smokes, we're gonna run out of money.' By the time they realize the predicament they're in, there are very few options.""Slowly but surely, investors began to hear Hodgson and Abrams' message. First came credit unions, then equity investors, and finally Goldman Sachs. Taking different types of funding presented some tension, Hodgson says, but she thinks it made the business more sustainable. ""Equity investors usually prioritize growth more than profitability, whereas lenders want you to be focused on profitability. So at times, I was like, Oh my gosh, I can't make everybody happy! But in hindsight, I think it forced a kind of discipline.""The thing about discipline is that it doesn't exactly lend itself to meteoric change. It's an act of faith that, eventually, the baby steps will get you somewhere.


""You know when your shoelaces are tied together, and you can't take a step that's longer than the shoelace or you fall on your face?"" Hodgson asks. ""That's the image that comes to mind about starting and scaling NowAccount. We had to go get capital and then get some customers, then we needed more capital and then more customers. And if I tried to do either of those too big, I'd fall on my face. So we just sort of trudged along, little by little.""NowAccount's investors were pulling on one shoelace, and clients were tugging on the other. Small business owners didn't need convincing that there was a problem. But they did need some convincing that these two nice Southern ladies weren't selling them some fanciful money ""magic,"" as Abrams says, ""or worse!""Related: Here's the Secret to Growing Your Small Business, According to Execs at UPS, Airbnb, Mastercard, and Other Big Brands""The first question we'd get from small business owners is, 'Why would you give us this money?'"" Abrams says. ""They were trying to understand: 'If this other financial institution wants to charge me 30% on my entire inventory, or this one wants my DNA swab, or to mortgage my house, why would I trust you?' Entrepreneurs are trained to believe no one is coming to help them, so we were trying to convince people we could untie their shoelaces when they'd gotten used to walking that way"" — restrained, cautious, and slower than they should have to.But once NowAccount started delivering on its promises, they started getting more applications than they could accept. This was partly because they needed more funding, and partly because they needed to mitigate risk. ""We wanted to serve more businesses, because that's why we existed,"" Hodgson says. ""But if we went too far, someone's going to take the dollar and run. So in the early days, it was a lot of learning, like, what are the signs? And analyzing data to tell us if certain industries or company profiles are more prone to risk.""Now learned to spot certain ""behavioral indicators."" For example, if someone has a Gmail account instead of a business email, it's worth a closer look. Maybe it's a fly-by-night operation, or maybe it's a new business that just hasn't set up its website yet. But with each invoice Now processed, its system became more informed. ""Every data point we have about a customer and who their buyer is, and when they pay, that just makes the system incrementally smarter,"" Hodgson says. ""So mistakes happen less and less as we grow.""And this practice of mitigating risk isn't just for Now's benefit. It's also become a crucial service for clients.Riordan, the founder of Freeze Sleeve, says the buyer-vetting that NowAccount does is invaluable. In addition to being able to sell to big companies that are ""horribly slow"" at paying, Riordan says, ""We also use NowAccount almost like our credit check people. Every time somebody wants to come on board, I send them over to Now, and they do their due diligence on the company. One time we had a cryotherapy business that wanted to go national with our products, and they gave us a very substantial order. But Now wouldn't approve them. We were frustrated because it was a big order, so we ended up doing it on our own. Well, guess what? That company went out of business and left us with a big hole.""Meeting with team members Archie Jones and John Hayes in 2015, in an antiques shop next to their office.Image Credit: Courtesy of Stacey AbramsNow was always intended to serve small businesses. But a few years in, something surprising happened. ""We got a call from Coca-Cola's chief procurement officer,"" Hodgson says, ""who was like, 'This seems to be a huge benefit to suppliers. Maybe we could partner to make sure more of them know about it.'""


Coca-Cola had been trying to diversify its supply chain to include more women and people of color, but its payment terms made it impossible for many of these businesses to work with them. ""They're going to take 90 days to pay, and if that's going to kill you, they can't give you the contract,"" Hodgson says.But with Now, Coca-Cola saw an opportunity: If there was a small business they wanted to buy from, but the supplier couldn't afford their payment terms, they'd send them to NowAccount. That way, the small business didn't have to worry about how long it would take to get paid, and Coca-Cola would know they had the capital to deliver. It was a win-win for everyone.Not long after, the city of Atlanta began a push to boost the local economy by connecting Atlanta-based corporations with local small business suppliers. Now was perfectly positioned to partner with the city to make these connections.Then, in 2020, the George Floyd protests happened, and corporations across the country started making public pledges to spend more with minority-owned businesses. At that point, Now realized it was sitting on a goldmine of data.Sure, there are plenty of business databases out there — but only Now has years' worth of invoice data, giving them visibility into which suppliers can deliver at what level.Related: 7 Strategies to Scale Your Small Business and Achieve Sustainable Growth""If you're a procurement person, and you've bought a database of businesses, and you're looking for one with a Latina founder, there are probably hundreds of them,"" Hodgson says. ""How do you pick? And most importantly, how do you know which of those hundreds can do a million-dollar contract versus a $5,000 contract? Because that matters. If I give you a contract that's too big and you don't have the staff to deliver, neither of us win.""What if they created a curated platform that helped big businesses find diverse suppliers capable of meeting their needs? It would be free for the small businesses to join, while the big businesses paid a membership fee. And that's how the next Now product — NowNetwork — was born.When Hodgson and Abrams talk about Now, people often ask: Why is it like this? Why don't these big businesses just pay their suppliers faster?Hodgson likes to tell a story about a conversation she once had with a Fortune 500 CFO. They were talking about NowAccount, and the CFO said, ""You know, this is fascinating, but I could probably just pay my suppliers immediately for cheaper than you can.""


""Well for sure you could,"" Hodgson replied. ""You're a Fortune 500 company and we're a startup. But you won't.""The CFO paused for a moment. ""You're right,"" she said. ""I won't because if I turn around and paid all my suppliers immediately, Wall Street would take me down.""What Hodgson and the CFO were acknowledging is how common it is for corporations to beef up their capital stacks by leaning on ""accounts payable"" — the money owed to suppliers but not yet paid.""Take any public company and look at their financials,"" Hodgson says, ""If you look at their short-term debt, like what they're borrowing from the bank, compared to their accounts payable — what they owe suppliers — their accounts payable are almost always two to three times what they owe the bank. Because there's a smart CFO who knows he can delay payments for free versus borrowing money at some cost greater than zero. If you yanked that away, they'd have to turn to more expensive capital, their net earnings would drop, and Wall Street would kill them.""This notion — that it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments — is provocative. But each year, the consultancy firm The Hackett Group does an annual analysis of something called Days Payable Outstanding, or DPO. It's an accounting measure that calculates the number of days it takes for a company to pay suppliers. And it sheds light on the pattern.Of the top 1,000 publicly traded U.S. companies, for the decade running up to 2021 (when payment terms started to shorten due to pandemic supply chain pressures), ""DPO was consistently increasing — around 5% year after year — which is significant,"" says Shawn Townsend, a director in Hackett's finance transformation practice. ""On a compounding level, that adds up to a 32% increase [in how long suppliers are waiting to get paid]. And you would assume the same trends are happening to an even greater extent to smaller companies, because it's about leverage.""Townsend says DPO can't distinguish between long payment terms and late payments. But when asked if it's common for corporations to deliberately delay payments, he says, diplomatically, ""It does happen. We hear some companies saying, 'This month, we told the accounts payable people, pay a certain group of suppliers, don't pay the others.' The most critical suppliers are always the first to get paid. And then the other ones, you know, they just stop the payments until the following month. It's very anecdotal, obviously, because nobody's going to admit that.""But Now's data is not anecdotal. They have unprecedented visibility into exactly when the biggest companies in the U.S. say they'll pay, and when they actually do.Related: 5 SEO Tips to Grow Your Small Business""We know what the normal behavior is for certain companies and certain industries,"" Hodgson says. ""I was talking to someone at a major bank and they said, 'Well, we typically pay in X days.' And I said, 'No you don't.' They said, 'Well, that's our policy.' And I said, 'But that's not what you do! I know because I've been watching you pay invoices for over a year.'""


More recently, the Now team has been asking what they can do with all this information. ""Could we partner with someone like Hackett, or start doing our own reports?"" Hodgson wonders. ""This data could be incredibly interesting to investors, because if you're investing in a company, and they are continuously paying very late, there may be a weakness in its business model. Or if you're a small business who wants to sell to the airline industry, and they're saying they pay in 45 days but they really mean 60, that could be the difference between making a payroll and not. It won't change reality, but you can plan for reality. And that's what got Stacey and I into all of this trouble in the first place.""Image Credit: Nicolás OrtegaA lot has happened since that fateful lunch in 2010. Abrams kept working at NowAccount during her tenure in the Georgia House of Representatives, but left the company in 2016 to pursue those two runs for governor. (Or as she says, ""I had this other job I was interested in applying for, but my application was rejected."") After that, she and Hodgson decided that NowAccount and NowNetwork should be separate companies, which act as partners with service agreements. Hodgson will run NowAccount, and Abrams will run NowNetwork.Unlike Hodgson, who's had a long career in business, Abrams admits she never really wanted to be an entrepreneur. ""I liked paychecks,"" she says. ""It was a frightening idea to be solely reliant on my own efforts.""The thing that changed her mind, though, was meeting Hodgson.""We often believe we have to be the leaders,"" she says, ""but having a partner challenges you. It helps you grow, sharpens your mind, gives you a different perspective. Lara and I have always been curious about what the other person knows.""Curiosity, more than anything, is what brought the friends to this place. And it's what will guide them toward whatever's next. ""Curiosity is about more than simply seeking information,"" says Abrams. ""We want to know: Are we asking the right things?""Related: 7 Networking Groups Every Small Business Owner Should Be Involved In

21,Outsource or DIY? 6 Signs It's Time for Virtual Assistance for Your Business,"Mar 4, 2024",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/6-signs-its-time-for-virtual-assistance-for-your-business/470028,"
So you've started your own company from home doing whatever you're passionate about, like making YouTube videos or selling handmade jewelry online. That's awesome! It can be satisfying to build something with your own two hands. But as customers and orders start piling in, you find you don't have enough hours to keep up.That's where outsourcing, or getting help from virtual assistants (VAs), comes in. As cool as it is being a one-person team at first, there comes a time when growth means getting additional support. But how do you know when that time has arrived? Here are a few signs it may be worth outsourcing some tasks rather than trying to do everything solo:1. You're working long hours — but not being efficientWe've all been there — it's midnight, and you've been glued to your laptop for hours doing social media posts, data entry, or customer service. While dedication is great, constant long days aren't sustainable and may lower your productivity. When you find yourself wasting time redoing work because you're overtired, it's a sign your efforts could be better spent focusing on higher-level tasks.



Related: This Is the No. 1 Skill You Must Master to Succeed at Work in 2024, According to a Tech CEO2. Tasks are piling upIf you open your to-do list and it feels never-ending, that's a hint you may need to offload some work. Are invoices, emails, orders, or other administrative things starting to stack up because you don't have time to keep up? Outsourcing mundane yet necessary tasks can help you get back on track.


3. You're spending too much time on low-value workAs business owners, our limited hours are best spent on work that drives growth and revenue, such as product design, marketing strategies, partnership deals, etc. But it's easy to get bogged down doing data entry, social media posting, or customer service replies that don't lever your unique talents. VAs allow you to delegate commodity tasks and focus on the work only you can do.Related: Wasted Employee Time Adds Up: Here's How to Fix It4. You're not able to commit fully to new opportunitiesIf a promising partnership or project comes your way, but you have to turn it down due to being too swamped already, that's an issue. Not taking worthwhile chances can limit your growth. By outsourcing mundane work, you free up precious time and mental bandwidth to seize any opportunities that come your way.5. Your work-life balance is sufferingWhile passion for your business is great, constantly working long hours isn't healthy or sustainable long-term. Are you missing out on family time, friend commitments, or hobbies and interests because you're chained to your laptop? Outsourcing gives back some of your personal life so you don't burn out.

You can't take a vacation without panickingIf taking even a few days off causes you anxiety about falling behind, it's evident you need support. Business owners deserve downtime to rest and unwind so they can stay fresh. VA help means you don't have to work alone.So, in summary — if your time is increasingly spent on low-level, repetitive tasks at the expense of strategic work, it's likely a sign your business needs assistance to thrive. The good news is high-quality, cost-effective virtual help from places worldwide has made outsourcing more accessible than ever for solopreneurs and small businesses alike.But how do you know what exactly to outsource and how to find and manage virtual help? Here are a few guidelines:


Assess Your Workflow and Define Outsourceable Tasks — Take a step back to analyze how you currently spend your days. What repetitive jobs could a VA handle, such as data entry, customer service, and social media posting? Make a list of tangible, clearly outlined tasks that don't require your unique expertise.Consider Costs vs Your Hourly Rate — Calculate how much your own time is worth per hour based on your desired salary. VA labor rates are generally far lower, so determine if outsourcing could save you money in the long run.Research VA Companies and Online Marketplaces — Sites like Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn provide profiles of hundreds of VAs worldwide with different specialties, languages, and rates. Read reviews to find out trustworthy freelancers.Be Ultra-Clear in Your Job Description — Whether you post on a marketplace or directly hire, leave no room for confusion by writing out very precisely what's required, including examples, templates, schedules, and style guidelines, if applicable. Clear communication upfront prevents misunderstandings down the line.Try out Candidates on a Small Scale. First — Before committing to an ongoing role, assign small, contained projects to vet candidates and see their skills, work ethic, and communication in action. Pay for these trials so they're treated as real work.Use Project Management Software — Whether it's Trello, Asana, or your own CRM, digitally tracking tasks helps ensure smooth delegation and collaboration. VAs should check in regularly through these tools rather than loose email threads.Maintain Open Communication — As the boss from afar, be available by phone or video call for any questions from VAs. Praise a job done well so they stay motivated while constructively addressing any issues. Maintaining good communication ensures quality control on their end, too.If you feel your business has outgrown solo DIY efforts and you're ready to bring on supportive help, consider signing up FREE for Hana Retail as your retail POS system today. It could be just what you need to gain back valuable time and focus on high-level growth without the hassle of finding and managing outsourced talent on your own.

22,The Miley Cyrus Approach To Marketing — Why It's a Radically Different Method For Achieving Brand Impact,"Mar 1, 2024",Sunny Dublick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-miley-cyrus-taught-me-about-marketing/469675,"
Miley Cyrus took home her first Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance this year. Shocked and elated, she took the stage to accept the award from none other than Mariah Carey and shared a very heartfelt speech:""And so there's a story I wanna tell that sums up this moment, and I wasn't gonna tell it, but now Mariah's here. So there was a little boy that all he wanted for his birthday was a butterfly. And so his parents gave him a butterfly net, and he was so excited. He just went outside out in the sun and started swinging and swinging. But with no luck, he sat down on the ground, he finally let go, and he surrendered, and he was okay that he wasn't gonna capture this beautiful butterfly. And right when he did is when the butterfly came and landed right on the tip of his nose. And this song 'Flowers' is my butterfly.""So, what does it have to do with marketing? Everything.



Current marketing theory is centered around amplification: more ads, emails and automation. The idea is that the more times we can reach a customer with our message, the better. Push out social posts, text ads, and Spotify spots, and hit them at every path along the buyer journey until they're worn down enough to buy.I liken this to chasing a customer down the street screaming, ""BUY NOW!"" as they frantically run as far away as possible — only we're doing this through screens, so it feels tolerable. Is it really effective, though? Or are we just casting the widest net possible over and over again, hoping to scoop up more (proverbial) butterflies?


I want to advocate for a different way, one that feels far less cringe-worthy. I want brands to stop chasing down business and start attracting it. What does that look like?Related: 7 Marketing Strategies You Need to SucceedStart with your offering(s)You need to have something that is ultimately an attractive offer to your audience. I ask every client what are the brands they aspire to be like. Apple always comes up. The new iPhone comes out, and there is a line around the block. We all want that kind of brand loyalty, right? The real question is: are we willing to do the work to get there?Apple didn't become a brand giant by creating the same products as the rest of the industry. It pushed category conventions every chance it could get. It constantly innovated and became cool because it was always on the cutting edge of new technology. Buying an Apple product was like a promise that you had the new, shiny toy everyone wanted. Their marketing just lets you know it's available, and frankly, they barely need it.


Apple's customers do most of their marketing for them. Think about what it would be like for your business to have an offer that's so good you know there will be a waiting list. Push yourself out of the thinking that 'this is the way things have to be.' What would it look like if you created something so amazing that you didn't have to force the message to convince people to buy? That is how you become an attractive brand. That's how you get your butterflies.Related: How to Bring Connection, Creativity and Results Together in MarketingKeep it realOne of my biggest takeaways from the Grammy speech was the need for surrender. Accepting the reality of where you are right now. That level of honesty and authenticity is crucial in building a great brand. It's the opposite of giving up; rather, it is realizing you have control over certain things, but a lot is out of our hands as businesses.It's letting go of our vice grip on metrics and being fine with letting life and joy become part of our marketing practice. Marketers have become so trained that everything has to have a way to measure ROI — and while I am not advocating wasting money, I am advocating that we allow wiggle room in our budgets and hearts for authentic brand connection. Not the PR stories, not the influencer partnerships. I mean genuine ways to live out your brand's purpose for your customers and employees.


If you created a business, it wasn't only to make money. I am guessing it was created to help people. Sometimes, we get so far away from where we've been and our purpose that the best thing we can do is surrender. Remind ourselves why we started or why we were so excited to work for a company in the first place. How do we get back to being a great brand?Related: How to Create Authentic Relationships and Build Customer TrustBe a good stewardThink about the brands you admire — do they need to convince you to buy? To chase you down? No. What does the boy with the butterfly do once it lands on his nose? Does he hop right up and start chasing it again? Or does he know he doesn't have to? Will he continue to attract great things because he is a magnet for success? I want to encourage you to be this magnet as well, and how you do that is by being a good steward to your customers.That means protecting their data, their interests, and their privacy. That means treating them with the respect they deserve. So often, we treat customers like numbers on a balance sheet. Just bombarding them with information to get their sale. This is not the way to make a great brand. This is being that pushy car salesman that no one feels comfortable around. When in doubt, all you have to do is put yourself in their shoes. Is this how I would want to hear about a brand like mine? Or does it feel weird? Is there a better way? Let empathy towards your community inspire you to do better and become the magnet of great customers.


One thing I feel passionate about as a marketer is that we have to find a better way. What this industry has become is a never-ending spiral of advertising. In essence, marketing should be about connecting with the people you want to help. We're not connecting by shouting messages at them all day, every day — in short, we're not being great partners with our clients.I hope that I can inspire you to new ways of thinking about marketing in a way that lets you attract all of the businesses you can handle without ever having to chase a thing.

""Stay in your lane."" We hear it all the time now — in our professional lives, in our personal lives, in our relationships. It's a turn of phrase that advises us to stick to what we know, guides us to specialize instead of generalize and encourages us to find a niche market and hold on to it. Sounds like good advice, right?I'm not so sure, actually. When I launched my PR business over a decade ago, I did just that: I concentrated on the market segment I knew best and aimed my services at only them. But over the years, I found myself curiously peeking into different industries, wondering how my business would change and how I would evolve personally if I pushed myself to try to enter new business sectors.Business owners have the luxury of trying to keep things fresh and exciting for themselves, and although I certainly have enough challenges in my personal life, it's amazing how I always seem to be inviting new challenges in my professional life. I think it's because it keeps me energized and on my toes. The world is moving so fast, technology is advancing so rapidly that I feel like my business simply has to transform in kind with the climate in which it operates.



That's why this is my new advice to fellow entrepreneurs: Master your lane, yes … but then have a little fun on the road, changing lanes and passing your competition as you enjoy the ride of traversing multiple highways and byways!Related: No Referrals, No Problem: 3 Ways to Win Clients in Highly Competitive Industries


Reasons to expandEntering new markets isn't for everyone, it's not appropriate for all businesses. A specialty cheese shop in Anytown, USA, may wish to stay exactly where they are, doing exactly what they're doing. Sure, the shop may want to add online sales for long-distance purchases, but it's their brand to service a mostly local clientele with an inventory not found anywhere else within a 150-mile driving range.But a candle manufacturer that started out focused solely on the home decor market can indeed consider branching out once home sales have plateaued. A client of mine expanded into the corporate sector, in fact, with a campaign aimed at company retreats and a new line of scented products for in-office relaxation techniques. Her sales increased 17% by the second quarter of entering the corporate space.So before you think about ways to expand, first consider the reasons you may want to expand, including:You've saturated your initial market and are experiencing limited growth potential. I started off in one downtown office in one foodie-friendly town, which worked great for my foundational knowledge base, the food and beverage industry. But after a few years, once I'd pitched to all the local restaurants and establishments I wanted to represent, I hit a bit of an impasse. From there, it was a logical progression to the hotel market in town.The new people you're bringing on have additional areas of expertise. As my business grew, so too did my staff. And they brought with them skill sets and industry know-how beyond my own. One of my copy editors, for example, had deep experience in book publishing. I used her background to break into the book promotion market, and before long, the one author I was representing turned into two, then three.To keep pace with current market trends. Some businesses can afford to stick to one thing only and do it exceptionally well. Others are more vulnerable to the variable winds outside. During the pandemic, when people were hardly dining out or vacationing (my niche markets at the time), they were purchasing goods for at-home consumption and concentrating on their home bases. This proved an opportune time for me to start widening my camera lens to retail brands and the real estate sector.Related: 4 Honest Truths That Will Make You a Better Boss


How to expand in four starter stepsOnce you have the drive and a valid justification to expand into new sectors, coupled with the bandwidth and the human resources to do so, here are some pointers I followed myself to shift my business from a hospitality and tourism-based firm to one that now encompasses the finance, tech, wellness, and nonprofit spheres as well:Step #1: Start by targeting adjacent industries. If, for example, you service the residential real estate market, put feelers out into commercial real estate. If your clients include malls and shopping centers, your experience will translate well to large event venues, like sports arenas. The objective is to bring some of your institutional knowledge to the table while learning the specific ins and outs of related fields.Step #2: Attend industry-specific events and conferences. You don't have to find clients first; a good approach is just to find a group of people in your targeted industry with whom you can network and from whom you can gain a better, deeper understanding of the field. At one national association meeting I attended, I invited a speaker who'd really impressed me with his presentation to lunch and asked if he'd be willing to mentor me. Several months of exchanged emails followed, in which he shared invaluable information and pointed me toward the most productive next steps.Step #3: Don't expand too fast. Pinpoint just one or two new industries at a time, then make it your goal to establish yourself within this realm before trying to cover even more new ground. Like any new terrain, the more you travel it, the more familiar you will become with the territory.


Step #4: In those new industries, limit your services at first. This is the equivalent of dipping your toe in the water to acclimate to the temperature instead of diving into the deep end headfirst. An example from my own transition journey: I do social media; my team knows social media. So when I took on my first financial enterprise, we didn't have to know the details of titles, liens and escrow right out of the gate; we only had to know how to put together an effective social plan for the client that yielded the expected outcomes. Over the course of a few months, we got to know the proper language and vernacular of this sector; the client was more than fine with initially providing us with appropriate jargon and content ideas for posts if only we could take this now-necessary task off their hands.Another example: When I first broke into tech, I felt a little out of water with my boutique lifestyle background. So I didn't offer this particular client my full marketing and PR package. I only pitched media relations to start, and once we'd proven our prowess in this area, our service agreement added publicity and advertising functions. Basically, then, the success of your contracts with minimal offerings will be a good litmus test for the rest of your transactions with the client.Related: 7 Empowering Strategies for Leaders Transitioning to New RolesServicing new industries in the last few years has been challenging and sometimes frustrating, but it's also been invigorating and surprisingly fulfilling. Each time I land a client in an area new to me, I feel a sense of accomplishment I never imagined when I was just starting out and simply hoping for half a dozen clients or so to keep me afloat.


Moral of the story: There's no need to limit yourself. When you feel it's time to reach, reach. You'll never know what you'll grab on to next unless you extend yourself!

24,Let's Bring Back the Human Element to Paying Bills — Here's 3 Ways to Nurture Vendor Relationships for Business Success,"Feb 26, 2024",Nick Chandi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-ways-to-nurture-your-vendor-relationships-to-fuel/469324,"
Turning a small business into a success involves many factors, but a big part of it is how well you get along with your suppliers. Since businesses rely on vendors for essential supplies, cultivating strong ties ensures a reliable supply chain, minimizing disruptions. Managing these connections can get tricky as businesses grow, but there are ways to make it smoother and more cost-effective.The human element is important in improving vendor relationships. Unlike large corporations, small businesses are more likely to engage in regular personal interactions with vendors through meetings, calls and visits. These personal connections often go beyond simple transactions and are more geared towards developing a symbiotic partnership with effective communication and mutual collaboration. The human touch adds empathy and reliability, transforming vendor relationships into partnerships built on trust and shared goals.How can the personal touch in Accounts Payable (AP) (the part of business where you make sure you pay your bills) help foster positive vendor relationships for the success of your small business? Consider these three approaches to ensure a strong and beneficial partnership.



Related: 3 Secrets to Streamlining Your Accounts Payable Process1. Personalize your communication strategiesTo build strong relationships with vendors, it's important to personalize communication. Understand each vendor's preferences and priorities, whether they prefer emails, phone calls, or in-person meetings. When you talk with them, take notes or write down what you remember about them after the meeting. Before you talk with them next, re-read your notes and ensure you don't ask the same question twice. A good Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) tool can help you keep track of how your clients want to be spoken to.


Successful personalized communication includes regular updates, timely responses, and expressing appreciation. Seeking feedback and addressing concerns promptly is important. Simple gestures like personalized thank-you notes, recognizing partnership milestones, or expressing appreciation for timely payments contribute to a positive and collaborative atmosphere in the vendor relationship.Related: 80% of Businesses Fail Due To a Lack of Cash. Here are 4 Reasons Why Cash Flow Forecasting Is So Important 2. Be transparent in financial transactionsTransparent financial dealings with vendors hold significant importance for several reasons. If you share financial information openly, it helps everyone trust each other and work together smoothly. Openly sharing financial information prevents misunderstandings and sets the stage for fair negotiations, potentially resulting in better terms for both parties.In terms of invoicing, clarity on payment terms is key. By discussing and agreeing upon invoices with clients before sending them out, you can ensure everyone is on the same page. No one likes costly, hidden surprises. Being clear ahead of time prevents misunderstandings and shows your commitment to fair and transparent business practices.


When creating invoices, use straightforward language and specify payment due dates. This expedites the payment process and establishes clear expectations, contributing to your business's streamlined and efficient financial workflow. By prioritizing transparency, you build stronger relationships with vendors and improve the overall efficiency of your financial transactions.Related: 4 Cash Flow Trends To Know About in 2024 3. Streamline processes for efficiencySmall businesses can make things run smoother by simplifying their payment processes. One way is by using software to handle tasks like paying invoices and keeping records automatically. This helps avoid mistakes and speeds up payments. Delayed payments are a common challenge, affecting 93% of companies. Another helpful strategy is setting up a standardized payment approval workflow for invoices, which are reviewed and approved quickly. This ensures that payments happen on time and keeps financial operations running smoothly.Also, adopting digital payments makes transactions faster and more accurate, making it easier for vendors. The total transaction value in the Digital Payments market is set to hit a whopping US $11.55 trillion in 2024! Connecting modern payment solutions with accounting systems is another smart move. This ensures that data is reconciled automatically, reducing the chance of errors and improving overall financial management. And with this, small businesses can save hours a week. Small businesses can make their financial processes more reliable and effective by making these changes.


The impact of streamlined procedures on vendor satisfaction and business success is substantial. Efficient processes mean vendors receive timely payments, fostering trust and reliability. This, in turn, improves the overall vendor experience, leading to stronger relationships.Related: Slow Payment Options Are Costing Your Business — Here's the Alternatives of the Future The success of small businesses hinges on strong vendor relationships built through personalized communication, transparent financial dealings, and streamlined accounts payable processes. Paying bills is not merely a financial transaction but a testament to the trust and reliability underpinning vendor relationships. Businesses uphold integrity and accountability by prioritizing transparent financial transactions, laying the groundwork for enduring partnerships.While technology helps us work more efficiently, the human touch – the personal connections we make – solidifies these relationships. Small businesses should prioritize open communication, mutually beneficial collaboration, and a personal touch to ensure enduring vendor connections, creating a powerful synergy for sustained growth and prosperity.

25,"AI May Not Take Your Job, But Someone Using AI Likely Will — Here's Why.","Feb 23, 2024",Lena Grundhoefer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/ai-may-not-take-your-job-but-someone-using-ai-will/469505,"
Artificial intelligence is changing the way marketing and PR agencies are run.Research shows that 68% of public relations professionals use AI, 68% of SEO experts are exploring it, and 61.4% of marketers are using it. It's easy to see why.AI usage in social media is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.04% through 2028, and large language models increasingly write online search results. We even have AI influencers taking over, with a reported 34% of American consumers putting their trust in them, and the highest-paid virtual influencer, Lu Do Magalu, is earning an estimated $16.2 million per year with sponsorships from brands like Adidas and Mac Cosmetics.



It's clear that AI is here to stay, and it's making a huge difference for companies in various ways, especially when creating online content. This is rapidly changing the tasks that marketers, SEOs, and PR professionals perform while augmenting their skill sets with powerful (albeit somewhat inaccurate) tools.If you want to build a successful agency, the traditional advice is to hyper-focus on one niche and be the best at it to generate revenue and grow your team. Using AI, however, a single person can do the work of an entire team, and many solopreneurs are using it to diversify their offerings as the technology creates dramatic shifts in legacy agency models.


Related: How to Own Your Online Narrative – Even When the Internet Owns YouExploring AI tools in marketingThere's no shortage of AI tools built for agencies–transcription tools like Otter AI and Descript, for example, make it easy to record and transcribe client meetings. These transcriptions make it easier to assign work to freelancers and ensure they have the client's exact wording and specifications.AI image-generation tools like Midjourney and Adobe Firefly can reduce operational costs while ensuring you have high-quality images for client social media, marketing, ads, and other channels. Runway ML takes visuals a step further by transforming text and images into video, and ElevenLabs provides AI-generated voiceovers.Finally, large language models like Perplexity make online research much faster and more efficient. Of course, there are also risks inherent in using AI in your agency.


Related: 10 AI Tools That You Should Be Using In Your Business This YearOvercoming risks of using AIExpect clients to have strict AI requirements, as a recent Cisco survey found that 27% of companies fully ban AI tools, while a majority limit employee use. This is because generative AI sparked a lot of controversy over the past two years, and there are various ethical considerations, including amplified biases and potential copyright infringement.Last month, a study from Gary Marcus and Reid Southen showed Midjourney v6 reproduces almost exact movie stills, and both Wacom and Magic: The Gathering drew heat online for using generative AI images in their advertising, and the latter fired their agency after the snafu.Related: What Will It Take to Build a Truly Ethical AI? These 3 Tips Can Help.


Making matters worse, AI image detectors like Hive and text detectors like Originality AI produce false positives, blurring the lines between human and machine-generated content. Even if you pledge not to use AI, the freelancers you hire may still introduce it into your workflow, causing unexpected problems.If you do use AI, there are four steps you can take to ensure it's being used safely and correctly.1. Don't publish AI outputs as your ownRaw AI outputs should never be used as the final published product, whether images or text. They aren't legally protectable, per the US Copyright Office's AI guidelines, and claiming AI outputs are your own is plagiarism. Since it's impossible to know what content most models were trained on, it's best to use AI either in the ideation phase or as one small piece of a finished product.2. Be transparent about using AIIf you use AI in any way, be upfront with clients and the public. Having AI usage laid out plainly in your contracts and any content using it is best. Being caught using AI without disclosing it can lead to drastic negative consequences, like this indie book cover contest that was canceled after the artist lied about the use of AI against the rules of the contest. If a publication doesn't want AI pitches or editorials, be sure to honor those requests.


3. Be careful with proprietary dataUnderstand that any information input into an AI may potentially be trained on or viewed by an outside party. Several instances were reported in the past year of ChatGPT leaking sensitive information to other users, and it's important to be mindful of what information is entered into any AI tools. Don't input anything into a prompt that you don't want anyone to see.4. Keep a human in the loopIt's easy to get lazy and submit mistakes you normally wouldn't when using AI. Channel Nine in Australia recently learned this the hard way when an image of politician Georgie Purcell was edited with Adobe Firefly and drew accusations of sexism. This technology isn't a replacement for humans–it's an augmentation. Be sure to thoroughly check any AI work before turning it in and making mistakes that ruin the reputation of your agency or client.Related: 3 Smart Things to Know Before Getting Started with AIGetting started with AI in your agencyAI can be a game-changer, and staying on top of technological advancements is important. It can give you a competitive edge over larger firms with a longer staff list. However, it requires purpose and care to implement correctly, and the consequences for misusing AI can be dire.


More than anything, honesty is the best policy. Companies are continuing to implement internal rules about the use of AI, and a subsection of consumers are always looking to catch a company using it without disclosure. As long as you properly label where AI is used in your workflow, the benefits and the efficiency that come out of it can be worth it.

26,The Owners of This Texas Farmers Market Took a Big Gamble. Here's How It Paid Off Bigger Than They Dreamed.,"Feb 22, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-this-texas-farmers-markets-gamble-paid-off-big/470139,"
Fall Creek Farmers Market in Humble, Texas, is not just a spot to stop by for your Sunday morning coffee and a fresh vegetable or two. Owners Jonathan and Andrea Haskin built this vibrant space with a vision to change their community's food shopping habits and educate their customers on the importance of buying fresh and local items.The couple came up with the idea for the market in 2015 when they started taking a longer look at what kind of food they had available to them and realized they had to travel far and wide just to source quality ingredients from local farmers. What would happen if they brought their community closer to the source?Related: Top Health and Wellness Franchises



To their delight, the Haskin's neighbors embraced the concept. Situated in the beautiful Fall Creek neighborhood, the market's outdoor setup is near a golf course and several walking trails, drawing tons of people and their pets into the space every Sunday morning.Jonathan and Andrea prioritize being present in their space and providing a personalized experience for every visitor. Getting set up two hours before the market opens and staying until the last group trickles out, the pair walk around to greet and share their story with customers. In the market's early days, their daughters sat at the entrance making bracelets for shoppers as they walked in.


This community feel is what drew in reviewer Forest B., now a regular visitor of Fall Creek Farmers Market. ""All of the vendors were so personable, willing to share advice and their specific stories,"" his review reads. ""I particularly enjoyed the cultural diversity. So much to learn at each booth.""With 20+ vendors spanning global cuisines, there is no limit to the kind of food you can sample at Fall Creek Farmers Market. On his first visit alone, Forest tried a Colombian coffee blend, two empanada flavors, Vietnamese egg rolls, and an Italian ice dessert. The cherry on top was getting to engage with the vendors themselves, learning firsthand about their products and journeys.Related: 4 Reasons Why You Should Enter the Health and Wellness Industry""One [vendor] that's not mentioned in my review is the Indian couple who serve prepared foods there,"" Forest said. ""They are a little bit older. That's completely different, say, from the couple who owns Frostbite, which is the Italian ice vendor. They're youngsters and [are] actually looking to you to provide them information on your journey here in the United States. So you just learn quite a bit about the people. Sometimes people are a little surprised to find out that you know a lot about topics in their areas, but the way you learn a lot is by talking to people and being open and receptive.""


Forest's experience is a perfect example of Jonathan and Andrea's educational ecosystem in action. First and foremost, the market aims to teach its visitors about the importance of fresh, quality food. The Haskins ensure their vendors share this passion and make an effort to educate every customer who visits their booth. 90% of Fall Creek's vendors farm and ranch full-time. Some even take agriculture classes at Texas A&M.""They live it as we do,"" Jonathan said. ""And it starts from the inside. We are really passionate about immersing ourselves into the market, and we are very selective with who we allow [to be] a part of our team.""Jonathan and Andrea's goal is to be the tipping point that pushes customers into the world of local food shopping, and they've found that preparation is key. They engage with customers online ahead of each sale to make sure they have all the information they need for a smooth visit. Because offerings shift each week to spice things up for shoppers and ensure seasonal produce stays front and center, Jonathan and Andrea provide a list of vendors and produce options in advance to help customers plan their meals and build out their grocery lists before arriving at the market.Related: How This Healthy Food App Scored a $200K Investment


The most faithful customers do around 80% of their food shopping at Falls Creek Farmers Market, which was the vision the owners had in mind when they set out to build a business.""It's not a craft show. It's not a bake sale. You can actually come and get your pastured eggs and real items,"" Jonathan said. ""Knowing where your food is from is a big deal. It's like getting a root canal or heart surgery. So it feels really good to be able to serve and to be able to give them access as we have it.""Not only is shopping locally good for your health, but it's good for the local economy. Forest stressed the importance of spending your money and time at small businesses.""Business owners typically are here from other countries. [They] come from backgrounds in which there was virtually no safety net, so they bring their knowledge to the United States. When I'm looking at these businesses, I'm looking at how I can learn more so I can help other people in the community continue to start these small businesses that make our economy run.""


Beyond making visits, reviewing is a powerful way customers can show support. Jonathan and Andrea take every review they receive to heart, always looking to expand the offerings and inclusivity of their space. They find it important to stay receptive to feedback, keeping the dialogue with customers open, genuine, and full of love.In addition to prioritizing customer education and building community, Falls Creek Farmers Market believes:Passion starts from the inside. Put love and care into what you do and it will trickle down to your partners and employees—and ultimately your customers.Preparation is key. Communicate online with your customers ahead of a sale so they know what to expect. Plus, make time to help out with any problems that come up.Supporting local is a great way to learn new things. Opening up your mind and heart to small businesses might just help you discover an important lifestyle change.Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Jonathan, Andrea, and Forest, and subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.Available on: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pandora and Soundcloud.Editorial contributions by Callie Morgan and Kristi Lindahl.

27,4 Reasons Why Your Customer Service Is About to Get a Whole Lot Better in 2024,"Feb 22, 2024",Mike Murchison,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-ai-customer-service-will-get-a-whole-lot-better-in-2024/469240,"
You've just assembled your new grill, but you're stumped on how to hook it up to the gas line. So you call customer support and start talking with an agent. Turns out they're an AI, not a person, but it's hard to tell the difference.Answering questions in conversational English, the agent asks you to share a video of the barbecue so they can ""see"" it — then talks you through a fix in real time. Problem solved.Sound like science fiction? Soon, such calls will be routine.



That's good news for consumers. When it comes to AI and customer service, we're going to see a virtuous cycle in 2024. As the technology gets better, cheaper and easier to use — a far cry from the stiff, robotic chatbots of just a year or two ago — more companies will embrace it.In turn, many people will have their first truly positive experience with an AI agent. Consumers are ready to engage. In a recent poll, eight out of 10 respondents said they're comfortable with using generative AI for customer support or service inquiries.


As the founder of a company that specializes in AI customer service, I know how much companies value this technology. Already, AI agents handle upward of 70% of customer conversations, according to one estimate. As those agents start outperforming their human counterparts in many respects, look for the quality of customer service to greatly improve.With that in mind, here are four trends that will drive a better AI customer experience in 2024.Related: Why AI Is the Next Revolution In Customer Service1. Generative AI for voice support goes mainstream""For billing, press 8."" We've all experienced the frustration of getting stuck in a phone menu with an automated voice agent whose only skill seems to be pressing our buttons. Good news for consumers in 2024: Those agonizing calls will soon be history.


That's because customer support is shifting from declarative to generative AI. For users, it's the stark difference between punching numbers and having a real conversation about why that mystery charge appeared on your credit card statement. Even better, rather than direct you to the billing department, the agent will give you an informed answer about what happened and even be able to resolve the issue on the spot.It's no leap to say that some of these experiences may soon prove more effective and satisfying than traditional interactions with human agents. Often, through no fault of their own, the people who staff support lines could use better training, don't speak the same first language as their customers and lack access to the business systems of the company they represent.The new breed of AI agents don't face such challenges. Capable of absorbing and following detailed instructions, they're fluent in your language of choice. These agents also play nicely with company systems, allowing them to handle tasks like tracking orders and issuing refunds. The most capable ones will have the same authority as a manager, removing the need to pass a customer between people to resolve an issue.For companies, the benefits are real. In one study, businesses using generative AI in contact centers tripled customer satisfaction versus peers that didn't.


2. Multimodal communication takes root in customer supportIn the new and improved world of AI customer support, voice is just one element of truly multimodal communication, which will spring to life this year.Traditionally, phone support, chat support and other channels like email have been largely siloed. We've probably all had the frustration of just wanting to text a photo or video on a service call, only to find there's no easy way to do it. Even as AI has transformed customer service, these platforms have remained largely walled off from one another. Until now.In 2024, customers will be able to contact a brand via their channel of choice, moving seamlessly between talk, text, video and pictures, just like they do in chats with friends and family. All of those channels will work together to help them best resolve an issue.Multimodal will give AI customer service agents the power to do everything from eyeballing a broken product to offering customized financial advice. Can't figure out how to mount that new OLED TV? Start a video chat with an AI agent, which can use machine vision to pinpoint exactly the mounting bracket you need, then text you a code to buy one.We caught glimpses of this fast-approaching multimodal future in Google's recent demo of its new Gemini AI model. The model is ostensibly a breakthrough, powering a chatbot that holds spoken conversations with users and can recognize, distinguish between and describe images. Yes, Google took heat for making it look like Gemini could process visual information instantly, but it won't be long before multimodal customer support will be table stakes for any business using AI agents.


Related: Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Human Interaction? 4 Ways AI is Impacting and Empowering Customer Experience3. Brands peer inside their AI agent's brainFor all of the upsides, some early efforts at generative AI for customer support have left companies and consumers frustrated. Brands have struggled with irrelevant or unhelpful answers, ""AI hallucinations"" and even bots that defy business logic. Just ask the car dealer whose AI agent offered one customer a brand-new Chevy for $1. The classic refrain: ""Boy, are these bots dumb.""What's often overlooked is that poor outcomes are usually the result of poor or unclear instructions from humans. Until now, however, it's been exceedingly hard for companies to peer inside their AI's decision-making process and understand the ""why"" behind decisions — the frustrating ""black box"" problem. But new software tools are shedding light on the reasoning that informs AI responses, giving brands a chance to see where things went wrong and to correct course.That makes a big difference in customer service, where understanding why an AI agent made a decision is just as important as the decision itself. In fact, it's the only way to drive improvement.


Let's say an agent gave a customer a refund that wasn't warranted. By using a tool to examine the agent's reasoning, the company discovers that the person who trained it gave conflicting instructions. What looked like a mistake on the agent's part was actually a management error. Knowing that, the company can issue new guidance to avoid future mix-ups.Like people, AI agents often have a good reason for a questionable decision, given the chance to explain themselves.4. AI manager becomes a hot jobThe growing capacity to course-correct AI agents hints at a broader trend in 2024. Smart companies are increasingly treating their AI agents not like a piece of software but like an actual employee. Brands seeing the greatest return from their AI investments have quickly discovered that it's not enough to simply buy an agent and set it loose. To thrive, that worker needs to be onboarded, measured and coached — like any other employee.And those tasks call for a new breed of manager we'll see more of in 2024.


AI employee manager is already a key role at companies like money management firm Wealthsimple, one of our clients. Along with setting goals for their AI agents, giving them feedback and helping them learn, AI managers must bring data analysis, project management and technical skills to the table. It represents a true leadership role — one with the potential to make an outsized impact on business results — and will become an important career stepping stone for young professionals across industries in 2024.Related: 5 Strategies to Protect Your Company's Customer Service from AI PitfallsSooner rather than later, AI agents will start collaborating with each other, too. For example, a customer service AI agent inside a streaming platform might notice that a login button is broken for iOS users. Time to alert the code generation AI agent to issue a fix. These generalist and specialist agents will need a new class of ""HR"" to coordinate them. At first, that job will likely fall to the CIO, who will turn to new dashboards to track the AI team's performance, analogous to performance management software for people.The biggest transformation of all in AI customer service this year may well be our own expectations. Early AI support experiences may have underwhelmed some of us. In 2024, prepare to be wowed.

When I started out as a marketer of both people and places, I'd learn as much as I could about my clients and then create collateral that presented them in their best possible light — relaying how educated and experienced someone was, broadcasting loud and clear how financially successful a business had been, how they dominated their market share.Nowadays, however, the very floor upon which I built my career and my business has been renovated. Nowadays, the public isn't so interested in hearing about what makes a company better than its competitors; their ears and eyes are more attuned to what the company can do to make their own lives better.In other words, instead of a professional culture of ""me, me, me,"" we're now in a culture of ""you, you, you."" Instead of saying, ""Look at how great our internal operations are,"" corporate voices are telling their buying public, ""We see you. We see your needs. You matter. You matter to us."" This has created some interesting developments in how we conduct business.



Related: Secrets Behind the Most Successful PR CampaignsThe age of the customer-centric marketplaceCustomer-centricity is a perspective that focuses on creating a positive experience for the consumer throughout all stages of your interaction with them. It's a mindset, but it's also a business strategy that informs an organization's decision-making by cultivating a deep understanding of customer needs and then designing deliverables to meet those needs.


Though the model is not particularly new, the ways it's being implemented in the marketplace are quite modern and pervasive, infiltrating all that businesses are advised to do. In ads, don't blow your own horn, offer solutions to your market's problems. In website copy, don't tout your own merits, engage with the customer where they are. In sales decks, make it about the audience, not the presenters.Putting the customer at the center of any type of business transaction has become SOP, both for brand reputation purposes and, of course, for earnings potential, with a white paper by Deloitte positing that ""client-centric companies are 60% more profitable compared to companies not focused on the customer.""Related: 4 Reasons Your PR Campaign Isn't Driving Sales — and How to Fix ThemExamples of customer-centric PRHere are a few ways my own business has embraced and leveraged this new normal.


Example #1: A restaurant. Traditionally, dining establishments pretty much always promoted themselves by sharing their menu, featuring photos of their ambiance, and sending invitations for special events. Since all that can easily be found online now, this client has pivoted to offering more immersive culinary experience to would-be diners — bringing the dining to them instead of vice versa. For instance, we're aggressively promoting the award-winning chef of the restaurant on TV and podcast segments, where he openly shares ""secret family recipes"" with viewers. A swanky new food truck can cater events on customers' premises, and private parties are also offered at the customers' chosen location.We also talked them into a punch card: 5 visits get you a free appetizer or dessert the next time you're in. Rewards programs are in — people like to be acknowledged for their repeat patronage and appreciated for their loyalty.Example #2: A cosmetics company. Instead of this year's marketing budget allocated primarily to photo shoots that spotlight the product line in magazines and digital ads, this customer has adopted the idea of turning the spotlight on the customer — one face at a time. Its newest PR campaign starts with an emailed invitation to take an online survey to win a free makeover. The survey is quite individualized, covering skin type, skin tone, daily facial routines, preferred color palette and so on. Based on replies, appointments are set at a local salon the company is partnering with, where the customer receives a complimentary consultation.No unrelatable supermodels promising unattainable results, no expensive glossy brochures, no hard sell of the merchandise. The crux here is truly personalizing the customer experience, which is key with today's savvy and time-pressed consumer.


Example #3: A pet store. Every pet owner needs to buy food and supplies, right regularly? So they either frequent your store or they don't — usually based on convenience of location and pricing. But what if you offered them more than just products to buy? What if you offered them ""A Vet for a Day,"" an event we scheduled on a Saturday from 9 am to 6 pm? The store paid the vet, but the visitors didn't; each got up to 10 minutes with the veterinarian to ask questions, have their pet looked over and seek advice on concerns about their animal.The goodwill this event generated cannot be overstated. Yes, sales increased and brand-new repeat clients were won, but the important thing to note is the absence of a direct sales pitch here. Rather, the essence of this campaign was identifying a customer pain point and offering a means to ease it.Related: How to Meet Customers At Their Pain PointsGuidelines for a customer-focused campaignWhat do all of these projects have in common?


They all started with in-depth market research that zeroed in on learning about each business's customer base. You can't just assume you know what your customers value; you have to conduct surveys, garner direct input, investigate and really listen to what your market is saying on social platforms, and then monitor the outcomes of initiatives.They put people in front of profits. An impactful customer-centric campaign shows that you genuinely care about your customers instead of showcasing your own superiority or excellence. You're allowed to be the best and encouraged to excel, but in today's climate, forming meaningful and lasting bonds is valued more highly than purely transactional relationships.The goal was to improve the customer experience at every point of contact. The more you can make each interaction customer-centric — whether that's a visit to your website, offering a free download or coming into your place of business and encountering something unexpected and delightful — the more you will stand out in the client's memory and thus sway their consumer habits.Closing thoughtsThere's always going to be a time and place for me to herald my clients' considerable qualifications, accomplishments and impacts. People will always want to be assured that they're in good hands and can place trust in reputable establishments.Nevertheless, there's no denying that today's standard of practice is about making an impression on your customers instead of trying to impress them. Give it a shot. Design a customer-focused campaign (or hire a pro to do it for you) and see where it takes you. Chances are, you'll travel farther than you ever have before!

29,Why Blockchain Technology Hasn't Dominated the Supply Chain... Yet,"Feb 19, 2024",Asim Rais Siddiqui,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-blockchain-hasnt-dominated-the-supply-chain-yet/469395,"
Blockchain technology has garnered constant debate ever since its inception, and the interest does not look like it will die out anytime soon. A piece of technology that holds the power to revolutionize existing systems, with experts back in 2017 predicting that the transformative powers of blockchain will be the perfect fit for supply chain management.However, as we look at the supply chain landscape over the past couple of years, the results are very different from what was anticipated, and the question lingers — why hasn't blockchain taken over the supply chain yet?Let's go over why this is the case.Related: Disrupting Supply Chain With BlockchainThe promise of blockchain in supply chainImagine a supply chain where every step is recorded in a ledger that can't be altered and is accessible to all authorized parties. With this kind of transparency, businesses can expect to see a great reduction in fraud, improved efficiency, and streamlined operations.



With 2.8% of the world's population already on blockchain, the technology holds great potential for revolutionizing supply chains. Blockchain is a favorite among experts due to some of its core attributes. These include:DecentralizationA major reason for blockchain's popularity is its decentralized nature, a breath of fresh air from traditional hierarchical structures. Since the launch of Bitcoin, the world has been moving towards decentralization, and it could mean big things for the supply chain realm.Let's think about a network where all participants, from suppliers to manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, share equal authority, and no single entity holds disproportionate power. This balance of power may help cultivate trust among stakeholders, as each party can keep track of all transactions.Related: Decentralization Can Be Your Friend


TransparencyThe transparency that comes with blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize supply-chain networks. It ensures that every authorized party has access to the same real-time data, eradicating any data asymmetry.This may especially be crucial in industries where accountability is important, like the pharmaceutical industry, where drugs can be life-saving or life-threatening. Knowing the authenticity of medication and keeping track of its expiration can help hold the right people accountable in case something goes wrong. Not to mention that it also increases customer confidence in the product.UnchangeabilityAccording to the KPMG Global Fraud Survey, more than half of the frauds committed were aided by the business' own technology, with 24% of the frauds having used these technologies to create false or misleading information in accounting records.One of the biggest advantages blockchain brings to supply chains is the inability to alter or erase any data that has been recorded on the network. This means that records of transactions, shipments and certifications are permanently etched into the digital ledger, which brings a new level of integrity to the supply chain.


SecurityWith supply chain cyberattacks in the United States affecting 1743 entities in 2022 alone, security breaches and data leaks have been rampant in supply chains for years and are only on the rise. The security mechanisms of blockchain offer a potential solution to this extremely troubling problem.Within a blockchain, transactions are secured using cryptography, and once validated, they are linked to the previous transaction, creating an unbroken chain. This makes altering old records an extremely difficult task. Apart from that, the business data will be spread across the network instead of being stored in a single location, making any centralized data breaches futile.Related: How to Mitigate Cybersecurity Risks Associated With Supply Chain Partners and VendorsChallenges faced by blockchain in supply chainWhile blockchain technology in the supply chain shows incredible promise, the path to seamless integration is treacherous and fraught with Herculean challenges. Let's look at some of the challenges you might encounter:


1. Unfamiliarity with the chain. Understanding and successfully implementing blockchain is not everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're a supply chain professional accustomed to traditional systems. Blockchain consists of several technical intricacies, like consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and cryptographic hashing, which require time and patience to learn. The learning curve can also be steep and often requires specialized training and expertise.2. Scalability issues. The lack of scalability is one of the biggest hurdles facing blockchains today. This is mainly due to the blockchain's consensus mechanism, which requires all participants in the network to agree on which transactions are valid. So the bigger the supply chain, the more difficult it will be to scale it with blockchain because, as transactions increase, the network's performance can degrade, leading to delays and congestion.3. Regulations and legal hurdles. The regulations and legalities that come with integrating blockchain can be daunting to many. There are many intricacies when it comes to data privacy and cross-border transactions in particular. The lack of knowledge available regarding these makes many business owners hesitate for fear that something might go wrong and they might encounter a legal pitfall instead.4. Costs and resources. I believe the most obvious reason why blockchain isn't as common in supply chains as people believed it would be is the heavy investment required to integrate it. Implementing and maintaining blockchain requires building the infrastructure for the chain, hiring blockchain experts, and incurring operational costs as well. This alone is enough to deter any small businesses considering investing in integrating blockchain into their supply chains.

Major Challenges Are Involved.The future of blockchain in supply chainAlthough these challenges are unnerving enough to scare away many keen entrepreneurs, some solutions are emerging to address them. These hybrid solutions involve integration with IoT devices, AI algorithms, and cloud platforms to reduce scalability and complexity concerns, making blockchain integration less complex and more desirable.

30,How the Happiest Cafe in Virginia Beach Fosters Charm and Community,"Feb 16, 2024",Emily Washcovick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/virginia-beach-entrepreneur-on-what-makes-happy-cafe-unique/469809,"
When Tomeka Wallace opened Happy Cafe in Virginia Beach, Virginia, she wanted to fill a coffee void. With nowhere in her hometown to get a cup of coffee up to her standards, she decided to take action. What began as a small cafe and sandwich shop became a diverse eatery serving breakfast, lunch and dinner in a cozy setting.The evolution didn't happen overnight and wasn't without some growing pains. Wallace's initial focus on healthful items like salads and smoothies proved difficult to sustain, even with a gym across the street.""We had people come in and say, 'You don't have soda? You don't have homemade sweet tea? You don't have fries?'"" she says.



Restaurant hours were another operating decision that Wallace struggled with in the early days. Although Happy Cafe used to stay open until 8 p.m., Wallace moved closing time to 3 p.m. when she realized that the dinner crowd was too small to sustain business operations for 13 hours a day.Ultimately, through trial and error — and an unwavering commitment to her customers — Wallace found her sweet spot. She taught herself how to navigate the kitchen, cooking up a delicious burger recipe and roasted potatoes to stand in for the fries people asked for. She even added dinner items to her menu to satisfy customers who missed her evening hours. Her tasty menu and friendly service have built a base of loyal customers and reviewers, including Yelp Elite Odester H.


""One of my favorite restaurants in the 757,"" Odester's review reads. ""If y'all haven't checked them out, you are missing out on a delicious, local, Black-owned, woman-owned restaurant. I went with a friend for dinner, and everything was delicious… The customer service is top-tier. The owner is so kind, and the entire atmosphere has you coming back.""Related: They Barely Had Enough Money to Set Up One Van. Now This Cleaning Company Is a Five-Star Operation With a Loyal Customer Base. Here's Their Secret to Growth.Wallace and her mother, who co-manage the restaurant, are huge believers in the power of good customer service. With an open kitchen, Wallace can greet customers from behind the grill as they walk in. Her mother is Happy Cafe's ""server mascot,"" drifting from table to table to make sure everyone is comfortable as they settle in.""There's three things. People come in for the ambiance [and] service. And food is always last,"" Wallace says. ""If we nail it with the service, but say there's something on the floor or a table may not be clean, they'll still come back because the service was good. If the food was messed up but the service was good, they're gonna come back. So service is everything.""


The welcoming community that Wallace and her mother have built keeps Odester coming back to Happy Cafe meal after meal. She appreciates that the owners know her personally and always take the time to ask how she and her son are doing.""They're not just there to say, 'What do you need? What do you want?' They're fine if you're [there] for an hour, two hours, three hours. They want you to have a great experience.""Wallace also brings this hospitality into her online presence. Even if it takes her a week or two to get to everything, she is determined to respond to all Yelp reviews and ""make it right"" with customers, whether that requires a staff meeting to discuss a mishap or adding a new menu item.These efforts don't go unnoticed. Customers like Odester value the personal touches Wallace adds to her reviews.


""Once you spend your money, the transaction is done. But the fact that she takes the time to go on Yelp, just saying, 'Hey, thank you so much,' it definitely makes you feel valued,"" Odester says. ""I haven't had too many responses from owners, so when they do [respond], I'm definitely going to come back. It makes me feel like, 'Okay, you value me [as] more than just a dollar.'""Related: Inside the Spa Where Calming Treatments Are Served Up With Craft BeerWallace likes to invest her limited time outside the kitchen in platforms like Yelp rather than social media, finding that review engagement is a productive way to draw in customers who are ready to spend.""I look at some places, and they have 50,000 followers, but do you have 50,000 people coming to your establishment within 30 days or within six months? If I'm doing things to get a big audience on [social] platforms, is that coming in monetarily? Say if we did an ad with Yelp, or I post that we're open, we get people coming in. That's where it matters to me.""


Online platforms are a great way for businesses to advertise what makes them unique. Like many reviewers, Odester is eager to invest in local, minority-owned businesses, and she appreciated that Happy Cafe conveyed its status as a Black-owned and woman-owned business via Yelp attributes. By searching for these attributes on Yelp, she's able to not only find places like Happy Cafe but also share them with friends, family and like-minded reviewers.Related: 'Why Are We Shouting?' Inside the Online Community That Is Helping Entrepreneurial Moms Connect, Collaborate and Stay Sane""When my friends come into town, they already know we're going to Happy Cafe,"" Odester says. ""And from me doing that, my friends now go on their own. I see them posting on Yelp, and they're at Happy Cafe, and I'm like, 'Why didn't you tell me you were going to Happy Cafe? I would've come!' Sharing businesses [lets] folks know that they're here and they're here to stay. So let's breathe life into them and do what we can do to make sure that [Happy Cafe] is here for 50, 60, 100-plus years.""Along with friendly and hands-on customer service, Happy Cafe believes in:


Staying flexible. Don't be afraid to try new things and scale back on changes as you figure out what works best for you, your staff and your customers.Responding to reviews. Engaging with customers online can improve your business operations and customer retention, helping customers feel like they are more than just a dollar sign.Develop a digital presence.

31,5 PR Tips Any Company Can Use to Get Media Coverage,"Feb 12, 2024",Kelsey Kloss,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-hacks-any-company-can-use-to-get-media-coverage/468533,"
Here's a simple truth: Companies like yours have incredible stories and expertise to share — and that's also what makes them so primed for press coverage. In turn, press coverage is incredibly valuable for your SEO, brand awareness, marketing collateral and overall credibility.Here's how to get more visibility for your organization so you can multiply your impact and help more people.Related: Yes, You Can Still Get Organic Media Coverage — and Here's Why You Should



1. Hone in on your specific expertiseThis can be fairly straightforward in some cases: A financial institute will cover all things money-related, while a gym franchise might be the go-to for fitness tips.However, sometimes a little more creativity is needed. For instance, we work with a Tai Chi expert who covers everything from fundamental internal martial arts to stress management tips, productivity at work (the principles of Tai Chi can help with this!) and balanced walking.


Getting creative with the expertise you offer can provide you with more verticals to reach. Typically, a company's mission can be translated into several different pillars of serviceable content for the media.2. Get credentialed spokespeople for your companyFirst and foremost, journalists will look for certain letters behind experts' names. They may be PhD, MD, CPT, CCWS, RDN or a wide range of other credentials.If you're the CEO of a company but don't have specific credentials for a certain area of expertise, pass the media baton onto someone in your company who does — or hire a spokesperson for that purpose. For instance, many fruit and vegetable companies hire RDNs to comment on healthy eating topics.Make sure your spokesperson is well-versed in how to translate complicated science into easy-to-understand terms for everyday media consumers. A journalist won't come back to a source for more interviews if that source's quotes are stuffed with jargon and clunky terms.


Try to strike a balance between conversational and detailed quotes. You want your spokesperson's soundbites to have personality but also to get the core of a topic in a meaningful way. Vagueness makes for weak quotes that are less likely to be published.Related: This is the Biggest Factor Holding Companies Back From Media Coverage — and 3 Ways to Fix It3. Have research to back up your claimsWhen your company's spokesperson makes a claim like ""pine nuts help to improve heart health,"" the journalist will likely look for a specific study to back that up. You can help by providing that research for them.However, ideally, the research should not have any conflicts of interest — meaning it wasn't funded by, say, a pine nut company. It's fantastic that private companies can fund research to contribute to scientific literature, but journalists are generally encouraged not to cover studies sponsored by parties that may have a conflict of interest (or, at the very least, they need to disclose the affiliation in their coverage).


You may also find it helpful to invest in infographics to translate key information your company wants to share. Infographics help translate complex data and give the media a valuable asset to publish, benefiting their readers. At the very least, they'll help a journalist easily understand your key data points so they can relay them in an article.4. Tell your story in vivid colorMany companies have incredible stories about why they launched, usually rooted in a passion for helping others. These can make beautiful long-form features that go beyond expert quotes (a blend of both is great for your company's media portfolio).Your product or service is what a target consumer will purchase, but it's your story that will attract them in the first place — or encourage them to stay a loyal customer.Make sure your PR efforts demonstrate why you set out to make an impact and how many people you've helped as a result.Related: 5 Key Things You Need Before Launching a PR Campaign5. Give journalists a first-hand experienceJournalists are offered everything from free DNA test kits to press trips around the world. This industry typically has many opportunities to sample out services or products.However, connect with the journalist to build a relationship with them first (or hire a PR team to do this for you). Not only can it be expensive to send out samples of certain products blindly, but some may take a bit of trust-building with the journalist before they try it.For instance, if you're offering biological age testing to a journalist, they may not feel comfortable participating unless they know you and your team well already.


Get lunch with them or hop on a video call where you can chat face to face. Public relations is built around relationships, and when you can combine strong ones with your incredible story and expertise, you'll be primed for success in the media.

32,3 Reasons to Increase Your Cybersecurity Protocols in 2024,"Feb 8, 2024",Sebastian Huelck,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-reasons-to-increase-your-cybersecurity-protocols-in-2024/468996,"
Cybersecurity is one of the biggest challenges facing businesses today. With the rise of technology and increasing connectivity, the threat of cyberattacks has become more prevalent than ever before. In fact, there are 2,220 cyber attacks each day, adding up to more than 800,000 attacks each year.That works out as a cyber attack every 39 seconds.The World Economic Forum has also highlighted the growing concern about cybersecurity, stating that cyberattacks are one of the top risks facing businesses in 2024. This was further emphasized at the recent Davos sessions, where experts discussed the need for stronger cybersecurity protocols to protect businesses and economies.



As the CEO of an 8-figure subsidiary of a publicly traded company, tec5USA, I understand the importance of prioritizing cybersecurity measures to protect our proprietary materials while growing our business. Cybersecurity is no longer just a concern for big corporations; small and medium-sized businesses are also at risk. Therefore, it is crucial for every business to have an effective cybersecurity strategy in place.In this article, I will discuss three key reasons why businesses should prioritize increasing their cybersecurity protocols in 2024.Related: Why Is Cybersecurity Important for Your Business? Neglecting It Could Be Your Downfall.1. Protect your business from costly data breachesAccording to Accenture, the average cost of a cyber attack for a business is $13 million. This includes not only the financial loss from theft or damage of assets but also the cost of downtime, lost productivity and recovery efforts. These costs can cripple a business, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises that may not have the resources to bounce back quickly from a cyber attack.Google Bard, an AI-generated tool, says cyber threats are increasing at an alarming rate. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime is expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, a significant increase from $3 trillion in 2015.Furthermore, failure to protect sensitive customer data can result in legal ramifications and damage to your business's reputation. In today's digital age, customers are more aware of their privacy rights and expect businesses to handle their data securely. One data breach can lead to a loss of trust from customers and ultimately impact the bottom line. For our client in Silicon Valley dealing in semiconductor manufacturing, it is mandatory.


There is also the prospective litigation cost if you are found to have fallen short of the cybersecurity protocols set out by regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act). These regulations set out a number of potential penalties for businesses that fail to protect personal data, including fines of up to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 million, whichever is higher.Implementing ISO 27001, an internationally recognized standard for information security management systems (ISMS), plays a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity within enterprises. By providing a systematic framework for managing information security risks, ISO 27001 assists organizations in safeguarding sensitive data and mitigating potential cyber threats. Central to ISO 27001 is the implementation of a set of controls tailored to address specific security risks faced by the organization. These controls encompass various aspects of information security, including access control, encryption, incident management and business continuity planning.Through the adoption of ISO 27001 controls, enterprises establish robust mechanisms for protecting their information assets, ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability. By conducting comprehensive risk assessments and implementing appropriate controls, organizations can identify vulnerabilities, proactively address security gaps and strengthen their cybersecurity posture. ISO 27001 fosters a culture of continuous improvement, prompting organizations to regularly review and update their security measures in response to emerging threats and evolving business needs.It provides a competitive advantage by differentiating the organization as a trusted custodian of sensitive information. Furthermore, ISO 27001 facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements and legal obligations, reducing the risk of non-compliance penalties and reputational damage.2. Safeguard your intellectual propertyIn today's highly competitive market, intellectual property is one of the most valuable assets a business can possess. Without proper cybersecurity protocols in place, your company's sensitive data and trade secrets are at risk of being stolen or compromised by cybercriminals. This not only damages your competitive advantage but also puts the future success and growth of your business at stake.


Effective cybersecurity protocols are a prerequisite for high-tech customers in protecting data integrity, and generally for data protection. In our case, working with clients in law enforcement, if you deal with sensitive data, and if it's construction or high-tech devices related, you need to make sure there are no data leaks out to competition, but also any other areas in the world that might be interested in that technology and want to copy it.Implementing strong cybersecurity measures, such as firewalls, encryption and regular data backups, can help safeguard your intellectual property from cyber attacks. It also gives you a competitive edge by assuring customers and partners that their confidential information is safe.Related: Cyber Attacks Are On the Rise — Here's How Your Business Can Continuously Prepare for Threats3. Ensure business continuity during geopolitical unrestA cyber attack can bring your business operations to a halt, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage. In some cases, businesses may even have to shut down permanently due to the severity of a cyber attack. Therefore, having effective cybersecurity protocols in place is crucial for ensuring business continuity.


The rapid rise in ransomware attacks, where cybercriminals hold a company's data hostage until a ransom is paid, highlights the importance of being prepared for potential cybersecurity threats.If you look at the global or geopolitical situation, we have growing tension between the U.S. and China and two wars going on in Ukraine and the Middle East. Whenever wars are happening, there's an increasing amount of cyber warfare. So the amount of hack attacks, denial of service attacks, viruses and ransomware is growing.In that environment, it's almost a necessity to have any kind of quality assurance framework — such as a cybersecurity framework — in this case, protecting you from these threats. It's become far more vital because of that changing business environment and the growing global threats we have to deal with.Regularly updating and maintaining your cybersecurity measures can minimize the risk of successful cyber attacks and prevent disruptions to your business operations. This not only prevents potential financial losses but also protects your reputation and maintains customer trust.


Related: 4 Top Cyber Threats Entrepreneurs Need to Know About in 2024Cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and hackers are always finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in systems. This is why it's essential to continuously update and improve cybersecurity protocols to stay ahead of emerging threats.It's predicted that there will be more than 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide in 2024. This means that businesses need to invest in training and hiring cybersecurity professionals to stay ahead of potential threats.As the CEO of tec5USA, I understand firsthand the importance of prioritizing cybersecurity protocols. By taking proactive measures to protect our business, we can continue to grow and scale without fear of falling victim to a cyber attack. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, it's crucial for businesses of all sizes to stay vigilant and prioritize cybersecurity in 2024 and beyond!

33,4 Cash Flow Trends To Know About in 2024,"Jan 26, 2024",Nick Chandi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/4-ways-to-improve-your-cashflow-in-2024/468245,"
Effectively managing cash flow is a key aspect of overseeing a business's finances, directly influencing its profitability, flexibility and overall financial well-being. This involves the continuous tracking, analysis and optimization of the money that comes in versus what goes out.When we think about the future in 2024, it's important to realize that many businesses struggle in their early years due to difficulties in managing cash flow. Out of every five businesses in the United States, one doesn't make it through the first year — they fail. And it gets even tougher: by the second year, another two out of every ten businesses close down, and by the fifth year, three more out of every ten go out of business. This underscores the vital role of skillful cash flow management for a business to survive and thrive over the long term.To overcome challenges and succeed in 2024, businesses should be ready to adopt new trends and technologies in managing their cash flow. Let's explore the important trends that will shape the financial landscape in the coming year.



1. Cash flow forecastingIn 2024, there is going to be a growing recognition among businesses regarding the pivotal role of cash flow forecasting, driven by the transformative impact of AI and machine learning technologies. These advanced tools empower organizations to analyze vast datasets, encompassing historical financial information, market trends, and economic indicators.As a result, businesses can now enhance the precision of their predictions and make well-informed decisions regarding future cash flows, marking a significant shift in the approach to financial planning and strategic decision-making.


2. Financial automationArtificial Intelligence and machine learning are bringing about a significant change in automating tasks for businesses. Automation will play a crucial role in streamlining routine financial tasks, such as invoicing, expense tracking and reconciliation. Businesses can reduce errors, enhance efficiency, and strategically allocate resources by automating these processes.For example, automating Accounts Payable (AP) and Accounts Receivable (AR) processes directly impacts cash flow. With AP automation, businesses can expedite invoicing, ensuring that invoices are sent out promptly. On the AR side, automation accelerates payment receipt by efficiently tracking and managing outstanding invoices. This speed in both invoicing and payment collection shortens the cash flow cycle, positively affecting liquidity.Moreover, AP and AR automation minimize errors in data entry and calculations. This increased accuracy reduces the need for time-consuming corrections and ensures that financial records align with actual transactions. By streamlining these financial processes, businesses gain real-time visibility into their cash position, allowing for better decision-making and proactive management of cash flow dynamics.Related: 80% of Businesses Fail Due To a Lack of Cash. Here are 4 Reasons Why Cash Flow Forecasting Is So Important


3. Instant payment technologyThe substantial impact of delayed invoices on 73% of businesses highlights the importance of timely payments. Traditional payment methods, which are both costly and time-consuming, taking 3 to 10 business days to settle, are being reevaluated. The launch of the FedNow Service in 2023 has fuelled the rapid growth of instant payments, with 331 institutions actively participating. Businesses, recognizing the importance of payment modernization, are investing in new accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) systems.Businesses can improve their cash flow position by seamlessly integrating instant payment option. The focus on modernizing financial processes addresses the challenge of late payments and positions businesses for a more streamlined financial future.Related: Slow Payment Options Are Costing Your Business — Here's the Alternatives of the Future4. Outsourcing for cash flow optimizationMany small and medium-sized businesses are now seeking help from outside accounting firms for jobs like cash flow consulting and accounting. This smart move frees up their own teams from everyday tasks such as bookkeeping. Instead, they can focus on important financial planning, analysis, and taking care of customers.

34,This Critical Mistake Is Slowing Down Your Operations — But There's 1 Simple Tool You Can Use to Change That.,"Jan 25, 2024",Francois Lacas,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/this-critical-mistake-is-slowing-down-your-operations/466751,"
Picture this: you're a business leader at the helm of a thriving company. Your days are packed with making critical decisions, steering your team toward success and ensuring customer satisfaction. Amidst this, the last thing you want is for your purchase-to-pay (P2P) process to become a bottleneck — slowing down operations, frustrating your team and potentially harming vendor relationships. A convoluted P2P process can not only waste valuable time but also lead to errors and financial losses — a risk no entrepreneur can afford.Now, picture a simpler, more efficient purchase-to-pay system. One where invoice processing, supplier management and payment processing are seamlessly integrated. Imagine the ease with which your team could operate, the time saved that could be better spent on strategic initiatives, and the reduction in errors that could translate to significant cost savings.This is not just about operational efficiency; it's about creating a competitive edge in an increasingly demanding business environment.



Understanding what makes for a good P2P process is crucial. A good P2P process can mean the difference between a financial year spent firefighting operational inefficiencies and one where you can focus on growth and innovation. In a world where business agility is paramount, can you afford to overlook the importance of a streamlined purchase-to-pay process?Related: 3 Secrets to Streamlining Your Accounts Payable Process


In my 23 years working with financial systems, one of the evergreen truths I've witnessed again and again is the fact that simplicity in processes benefits everyone. Simplicity is borne out of clarity of vision, and it begets quality of output.When implementing P2P automation, integrating numerous specialized tools — like one software for invoice processing, another for supplier management and another for payment processing — can lead to a disjointed and inefficient system. Instead of a streamlined process, businesses often find themselves navigating a complex web of incompatible platforms, leading to more confusion and inefficiency. Here are just a few reasons why simplicity is the key to a truly successful Accounts Payable process from every perspective.1. From a user experience perspective: The user experience — both on the internal side of a process and on the customer side — is central to the successful use of any kind of software. Streamlining software design often enhances its usefulness for the people who use it daily. A platform should be intuitive to navigate, as this allows it to be accessible to a broader range of people, which in turn enhances user satisfaction, customer retention and engagement. Conversely, juggling multiple apps to fill in the gaps puts more pressure on users to quickly learn an increasing number of interfaces, which is inefficient from both a time and cost perspective.2. From a safety and accessibility perspective: When it comes to invoicing and similar processes, sometimes the fewer hands required, the better. Ease of use is paramount in maintaining an operative system that is safe and secure. When users have a clear sense of how to use a given software, processes are more straightforward and self-directed, which can lessen the incidence of human error and oversight.


3. From an adaptability perspective: Excellent software takes complex integrations and API connections and creates simple, seamless integrations for the end user. Remaining flexible and responsive to the new tools, frameworks and solutions offered by technological innovation is crucial to remaining relevant as a software provider.4. From a cost perspective: When a company relies on multiple software architectures with numerous interdependencies to run processes, the cost of maintaining and supporting these systems is often considerable. Unpretentious and succinct software is typically less expensive to implement, test and maintain (and often achieves the desired results with fewer bugs as well) due to only having to pay for one comprehensive solution vs multiple specialized ones. Problems are easier to identify and attend to, saving organizations precious time and creative energy without sacrificing the essential process backbone.Why do we create new software tools and solutions in the first place?When selecting a P2P or AP automation solution, it's important to keep some distinctions in mind. There are three major categories on offer that companies must consider.Generalist solutions: These are versatile and can handle a broad range of accounting tasks. However, they may lack deep specialization in any one area. An example of a generalist solution is a well-established ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software application like SAP or Oracle. These systems integrate various business processes but may not offer the depth of features found in more specialized tools.Hyper-specialized solutions: These solutions offer a high level of expertise in a specific area of the P2P or AP process. For example, PayPal or Stripe could be considered hyper-specialized solutions focusing on online payments. These platforms provide advanced features and capabilities specifically for handling online transactions, but they might not address other aspects of the P2P or AP process.All-in-one Solutions: These solutions provide comprehensive coverage of the entire P2P or AP process, combining generalist breadth with specialist depth, and offering end-to-end capabilities from procurement and invoice management to payments and analytics. These solutions are designed to manage the entire process seamlessly, offering a high level of expertise across all stages.Related: 8 Tips for Setting Up a Killer Invoicing System That Always Gets You Paid


Finding the right balance between expertise and end-to-end scope to secure ROI and TCO – and a solution that optimizes user experience as well – is the key to accounts payable automation success. Truly brilliant solutions bring order and efficiency into areas of complexity and confusion thanks to their razor-sharp, ""simple"" elegance.When it comes to the accounts payable process, the best way to improve people's experience is to make the process as comprehensive and intuitive as possible. Business owners usually have enough on their minds as is, and they don't need a thousand and one options to choose from when it comes to running the essential elements of their businesses.It turns out you don't need countless tools to create something outstanding that satisfies everyone; you just need the right ones added at the right time. The more streamlined the AP automation process, the better the outcome.

35,PR Isn't Everyone's Forte. Is It Time For You to Bring in the Pros?,"Jan 24, 2024",Liang Zhao,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/pr-isnt-everyones-forte-is-it-time-for-you-to-bring-in/467114,"
As any startup founder or entrepreneur will tell you, managing your company's press and public relations can be a daunting task. The decision of whether to handle it in-house, consult with a freelance expert or bring in a PR agency is a crucial one that requires careful consideration. Here are some key factors to explore that may indicate it's time to enlist the expertise of a PR firm or freelancer for your startup and what options might work best for your team.Related: When to Spend on PR and When to do It Yourself (or Not at All)Lack of expertise: A complex media landscapeFirst and foremost: Know your limits. One of the primary considerations when deciding to hire a PR agency is the level of expertise within your team. If you or your colleagues lack experience in media relations, navigating the intricate media landscape can be especially challenging and take up a massive amount of time that could be focused elsewhere. A PR agency brings a wealth of expertise, helping you craft effective media strategies and secure meaningful coverage based on their wealth of knowledge, which much less stress on you and your team.



Freelancers are another fantastic resource offering cost-effective solutions for specific PR needs, allowing startups to access specialized skills without a long-term commitment. Hiring a freelance communications manager for a campaign, engaging a content creator for blog posts or bringing in a crisis management expert for a specific situation can be a huge value add without straining a startup's limited budget.By entrusting the complexities of media relations to seasoned professionals, you not only ensure that your brand is presented in the best light but also free up valuable time and resources to concentrate on your core business functions. This allows you to tap into the agency's proficiency, drawing on their insights and connections to navigate the media landscape efficiently and strategically. Ultimately, partnering with a PR agency or freelance expert becomes a strategic investment, enabling your team to benefit from their specialized skills and experience while optimizing your overall business focus.


Limited resources: Juggling responsibilitiesStartups often operate with limited resources, and if your team is already stretched thin with various responsibilities, dedicating time to effective media relations may be a luxury. A PR agency can efficiently manage your current media efforts, as well as plan crucial next steps, allowing your team to focus on core business functions while gearing your company for success.PR agencies also play a pivotal role in shaping strategic messaging for startups. They bring a fresh perspective, market insights and a deep understanding of how to position a brand for the best results. By working closely with your team, a PR agency can help distill complex ideas into clear and impactful messages that resonate with the media and your target audience, which is of particular importance when you're working to build your brand and reach your target customer demographic.It's important to note that collaboration, as in many industries, is an ongoing process. Regular check-ins and feedback loops help maintain alignment as your startup evolves and responds to market dynamics. A dynamic collaboration, rooted in a shared vision from the outset, not only enhances the efficacy of PR initiatives but also contributes to a more enduring and mutually beneficial partnership between your startup and the PR agency.Related: Should You Hire a PR Firm or a Boutique PR Firm? (And What's the Difference?)


Crafting a consistent narrativeConsistency is crucial in messaging. Whether it's a press release, a media pitch, social post, talking point or thought leadership article, the messaging should seamlessly align with your brand's identity, reflecting a cohesive and recognizable narrative. PR agencies invest time and effort in thoroughly understanding your brand, its values and its unique selling propositions. This deep understanding allows them to distill the essence of your brand into a comprehensive messaging strategy that resonates with your target audience — whether it's addressing journalists, engaging with stakeholders or crafting content, the agency ensures that the messaging remains coherent and aligned with your overarching narrative.The consistency achieved by PR agencies is not just about repeating the same phrases but about creating a holistic and evolving story for your brand. This involves meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that the tone, language and key messages align across all communication touchpoints. Consistency breeds familiarity, and a well-crafted narrative that remains constant across diverse channels fosters a sense of reliability and trust among your audience.Need for specialized services: Beyond media relationsPR agencies offer a multifaceted approach extending beyond traditional media relations, providing specialized services such as crisis management, social media management, media training and content creation. This comprehensive strategy ensures startups receive a holistic PR solution addressing both proactive and reactive communication needs.Additionally, PR agencies bring pre-established networks, saving valuable time in building relationships with journalists and media professionals. With connections spanning diverse media outlets, industries and even global markets, these agencies enhance a startup's reach, credibility and influence. The breadth of services and expansive networks collectively contribute to a well-rounded PR strategy, aligning with the unique needs of startups and positioning them for success in an ever-evolving media landscape.

The enhanced visibility and credibility garnered through effective PR can open doors to new opportunities, partnerships and investor interest, contributing to your company's overall growth.Overall, keep it simple — be sure that the decision to hire a PR agency aligns well with your startup's unique needs and goals, and be aware of the collaborative nature of working with a PR team or freelancer. If you find that your team lacks expertise, faces resource constraints, requires specialized services, aims for broader reach or is looking to grow aggressively in the coming year, it may be the opportune moment to consider bringing in the professionals. A well-crafted PR strategy can be a game-changer for startups, propelling them into the spotlight and paving the way for sustained success.

36,Here's How to Make Your Company Cash Flow Neutral in 6 Months,"Jan 18, 2024",Paul Geller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-make-your-company-cash-flow-neutral-in-6-months/468118,"
In 2022, investment capital was as tight as I'd ever experienced in my time as an entrepreneur. Considering I started my first business in 2002 during the dot com bust and my second in 2007 when the housing market bubble burst, that's saying a lot.I started my latest venture a few weeks before the world came to a standstill in January of 2020. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic at the time, interest rates remained low, and VCs were funding hyper-growth startups liberally, with limited concern around profit and short-term returns.We raised a friends and family round and took our first round of institutional investment at that time, but we were burning cash much quicker than we were taking it in. Given the economic climate, we didn't think our full seed round would take long to raise. We were wrong. As the Feds raised interest rates in an effort to curb inflation, startups like ours were the first to feel investors' belts tighten.In March of 2023, I had a heart-to-heart with some of my earliest investors. They told me I didn't understand how bad the capital contraction was going to be and that I needed to pivot away from growth and focus on building a profitable business as quickly as possible. Their assessment was accurate, but I didn't want to hear it. After some deep introspection, I decided to heed their warning. That's when the real work began.



Here's how we slashed our company's spending and became cash-neutral in six months.Related: Understanding Cash Flow in Your Business


Maximize your in-house expertiseAfter years of building businesses and working at startups, I was excited to finally have a company that was ripe for venture capital funding. We had dozens of commitments with respectable valuations, but as the market turned, the term sheets were harder to come by. As interest rates skyrocketed, investors could earn a 5% return by letting their money sit in the bank, and our funding leads quickly disappeared.I was ready to hire executive roles, 10x production and deploy big dollars on brand campaigns. I was reluctant to pull back my ambitions, but if we were going to survive the investment winter, I needed to get realistic with our goals. Walking away from hyper-growth was one of the most challenging things I've had to do.My background is in marketing, but I was outsourcing that area to others. I wanted a refined brand with a coherent narrative and hired expert agencies and consultants to develop it as I oversaw operations. If I wanted to relieve our balance sheet, however, I needed to start maximizing our internal resources — starting with myself.Research has shown companies that utilize internal talent and run leaner operations are more efficient and also have clearer communication and improved collaboration. I began by letting go of every outside agency and consultant and started to do the work myself: every Instagram post, every newsletter, every website edit and press release — it was all back on my plate.


Make the hard cutsIn today's landscape, the tools exist for founders to scale their knowledge quickly and educate themselves in areas they can't afford to outsource. YouTube and Instagram tutorials became my best teachers. It's a humbling experience to go back to ""marketing school,"" but also very empowering when you succeed.I love working with agencies. They bring fresh ideas and tons of talent, and they often come up with ideas you can't conceptualize alone — but they are expensive. If you aren't within your spending margin, outside support is the first place to cut. We cut ties with every single agency and consultant.Of all the cuts we made, the hardest were internal. In our business, maintaining a sales team in each region to educate bars and restaurants on your product is a must — when you wind down a team in a market, you may never be able to go back.My sales teams were incredible, but we hadn't seen a profitable month in any of the regions we serviced, so we had to let them go. Sacrificing what seemed like such an important investment in our business was challenging, but adopting a mindset of balancing growth with profitability meant strategically managing our costs.


Research published in the Harvard Business Review shows that smart companies don't think of cost-cutting as a one-time reaction to a slowing economy, but are constantly vigilant about costs even when revenues increase.Related: Why This Metric Should Be Prioritized Over Growth for Startup SuccessCultivate a culture of agilityRecognizing we'd over-prioritized growth and not put enough focus on profit was an exercise in both humility and frugality. It forced me to learn a lot more about my business and cultivate a culture of agility.When you have fewer ropes to hold, you can turn a ship more easily. What used to take us multiple strategy meetings and weeks of planning can now be done in one day, or, if it's just me, an all-nighter.As an agile team, we became more resourceful and found areas of opportunities we'd overlooked as a larger team. For example, while we were no longer positioned to invest in costly customer acquisition campaigns, we still had access to an email list of 50,000 fans.Instead of paying for new customers, we started engaging with our existing ones using our owned channels like email and social media for free. It meant slower growth but much more margin. A recent report by McKinsey showed that 80% of value creation by the world's most successful growth companies comes from unlocking new revenues from existing customers.I love my new lean company. I feel in control, our burn rate is minuscule, and we just had our first cash flow break-even month ever. That, in turn, has attracted a new crop of investors who look for companies that can turn a profit. Making the pivot from hyper-growth to building a fiscally responsible company isn't easy, but it can open up new opportunities and allow you to grow through any economic environment.

37,5 Innovative PR Strategies to Boost Your Brand in 2024,"Jan 17, 2024",Hannah Cranston,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-innovative-strategies-to-boost-your-brand-in-2024/467851,"
The onset of a new year brings a fresh perspective, encouraging leaders to evaluate and enhance how they communicate and connect with their audiences. Brands and their leaders are presented with the opportunity to redefine and strengthen their public relations (PR) and media approaches. The new year is a time for innovation and growth, and in the realm of PR, it's about crafting strategies that resonate with your audience and set your brand apart.Let's explore five transformative strategies that can redefine how you approach PR this year, ensuring your brand remains at the forefront of innovation and engagement.1. Be proactive, not reactiveThe cornerstone of a robust PR strategy is proactivity. Anticipating trends, understanding your audience's evolving needs, and preparing your narrative well in advance can position your brand as a leader rather than a follower. However, the magic lies in balancing this preparedness with the ability to pivot.



The PR landscape is dynamic, and success often hinges on your ability to swiftly adapt to unforeseen events and trends. Your PR strategy must continuously monitor the media landscape, understand emerging platforms and identify potential opportunities or threats. It's about having a strategic plan in place while being ready to make quick, informed decisions when the unexpected occurs. This blend of foresight and flexibility enables a brand to stay relevant and engaging in our fast-paced world.Related: Should You Hire a PR Firm or a Boutique PR Firm? (And What's the Difference?)


2. Storytelling over sellingConsumers seek more than just a product or service; they crave a connection, a story they can be part of. This shift necessitates a move from straightforward selling to compelling storytelling. Crafting narratives that encapsulate your brand's ethos and resonate with your audience's aspirations creates a deeper, more meaningful connection. These stories should be authentic, relatable, and, most importantly, reflective of your brand's values.Effective storytelling in PR is about weaving a narrative that informs, inspires and engages the audience. It's about finding the unique elements of your brand's story and telling them in a way that creates an emotional resonance with your audience, making your brand memorable and impactful.3. A 360-degree approachIn today's multifaceted media landscape, relying solely on digital media can limit your brand's reach. A holistic approach encompassing podcasts, Instagram Lives, broadcast media, and more can significantly enhance your PR strategy. Each medium offers unique opportunities and access to different audience segments.For instance, podcasts can provide a more intimate way to convey your story, while Instagram Live can foster real-time engagement. This diverse approach ensures a more comprehensive and impactful reach. A 360-degree approach also means integrating your PR strategy with other marketing efforts, ensuring a consistent brand message across all platforms. It's about leveraging each medium's strengths to create a cohesive and far-reaching brand narrative.

Think beyond the press releaseWhile the traditional press release still has its place, today's PR landscape calls for a more creative approach. It's about breaking the mold and finding innovative ways to share your story. This could mean crafting immersive digital experiences, collaborating with influencers in unique ways, or leveraging emerging technologies to create engaging narratives.The key is to think outside the box, offering your audience something fresh and unexpected, which in turn can generate more interest and coverage. It's about creating content that not only informs but also entertains and engages your audience, making your brand stand out in a crowded media landscape.Related: Waiting For a PR Crisis Is Like Wearing a Bullseye On Your Back.

5. The power of delegationHiring a dedicated PR team is a game-changer for any business looking to elevate its public image. The complexity and nuances of modern PR require specialized skills that only a dedicated team can provide. A PR team allows the brand to have experts solely focused on PR, ensuring that each campaign is well-crafted and aligns perfectly with the brand's overall goals and image. This dedicated team becomes the brand's storytellers and reputation guardians, adept at navigating the ever-changing media landscape and adeptly crafting the brand's presence in the public eye.Let this new year be the moment you ignite a transformative journey in your PR endeavors. Envision your brand not just as a participant in the market but as a trailblazer, setting new standards in how stories are told and connections are made.

38,Woman Goes Viral After Recording Her Disastrous Call With HR After Being Let Go: 'They Tried to Gaslight You',"Jan 16, 2024",Emily Rella,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/woman-goes-viral-for-live-recording-her-layoff-talking-back/468422,"
A TikToker is going viral after secretly recording herself getting remotely laid off from computer and network security company, Cloudflare.Brittany Pietsch recorded the nine-minute-long clip on January 12 after about four months with the company and said she knew that the layoff was most likely coming, which prompted her to start recording.But instead of gracefully accepting her fate, Pietsch was ready to fight back.



@brittanypeachhh Original creator reposting: brittany peach cloudflare layoff. When you know you're about to get laid off so you film it :) this was traumatizing honestly lmao #cloudflare #techlayoffs #tech #layoff ♬ original sound - Brittany Pietsch""I got let go by two people I didn't know: a woman from HR and a director man I've never heard of,"" Pietsch wrote. ""I wanted to stand up for myself because what did I have to lose?""


The HR team explained that her performance was not up to par and that many people were being let go, including her. But Pietsch told the people on the call (an HR rep and a director) that she had the ""highest activity"" amongst her team and that ""things have been going really, really well"" for her. She then questioned why her manager, or someone she had at least met, was not on the call.Related: Barbara Corcoran Shares What to Do If You've Been Laid Off""I disagree that I haven't met performance expectations. I really need an answer and an explanation as to why Brittany Pietsch is getting let go, not why Cloudflare decided to hire too many people then are now actually realizing that they can't afford this many people and they're letting them go,"" she said bluntly — and in the third person.Pietsch continued to push back and ask for direct answers about why she was really being let go, but HR didn't budge.


""I'll be honest with you, there's nothing that we're going to say in this call and the time that we have, that's going to undo the way that you feel right in this moment,"" the unidentified person said. ""I personally, I will do everything that I can to give you as much specific information as I can, after this call, I can't make any promises.""Still, Pietsch asked for answers, to no avail.""Despite constant positive praise from my manager, great meetings that I'm having, the amount of activity that I have has all been positive, I have not received any negative inclination, I have not been put on a performance improvement plan,"" she said in frustration. ""It just doesn't make any sense that you guys have still not been able to give me a reason why I'm being let go.""Pietsch's video garnered mixed reviews from commenters, with many praising her for asking for justice and explanation when most are afraid to speak up.""You handled this so well,"" one person wrote. ""They tried to gaslight you into it being based on your performance and not their company issues.""Related: How Do Companies Decide Who to Lay Off?""Good for you speaking up and being so composed with such little time to prepare,"" another said.Others were not as impressed with Pietsch's attitude.""The company just didn't make money and if it's sales you just didn't make enough money to justify them keeping [you]. It's business,"" one person wrote.""The points she made were valid, but it's a bad career move to post this online,"" another said.The now-viral video, which has been viewed over 1.37 million times on TikTok, prompted a response from Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, who wrote on social media platform X that the company laid off roughly 40 out of 1,500 workers in Pietsch's round.He also noted that the company doesn't always ""hire perfectly,"" and said that the company can usually tell within three months of a hire whether or not the employee is going to be successful or not.


We fired ~40 sales people out of over 1,500 in our go to market org. That's a normal quarter. When we're doing performance management right, we can often tell within 3 months or less of a sales hire, even during the holidays, whether they're going to be successful or not. Sadly,…— Matthew Prince ? (@eastdakota) January 12, 2024""The video is painful for me to watch. Managers should always be involved,"" Prince wrote. ""Any healthy org needs to get the people who aren't performing off. That wasn't the mistake here. The mistake was not being more kind and humane as we did.""Cloudflare was up over 69% year over year as of Tuesday afternoon.

39,Do You Need a PR or Marketing Professional? Here's the Difference,"Jan 11, 2024",Christopher Tompkins,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/pr-or-marketing-heres-the-difference/467216,"
So often, we hear the phrase ""I need to invest in a marketing professional to….."" and whatever follows that phrase is usually one of two things. They are either looking to boost their revenue and make more money or trying to create a reputation for their brand online that doesn't seem to be falling into place for them solo.While these two seem interchangeable, they require two different services and often different professionals.I am talking about public relations and marketing.Related: Should You Put Your Money Into PR or Marketing?How is your public perception?Whether you have a personal brand, a small business, or you're an executive for a large company, the way you present yourself is a make or break in your professional success.



It's all about public perception, and public relations professionals are the experts in creating the perfect plan for your brand to thrive.Taylor Swift's ascension from a regular celebrity to a cultural force of nature is a great example of public relations in action.We have seen headline after headline about her dedicated fanbase and the excitement around almost anything she does. Why? She and her team have crafted the specific narrative for her brand, and they make it a point to ensure the media portrays it as such.Behind the scenes, we didn't see the hard work and careful planning it took to build relationships, secure media appearances, and map out the desired image to present to the public.


All thanks to her publicist.On that note, reputation crisis management is a huge part of what public relations professionals do. As an individual or brand grows in popularity, it is only a matter of time before something happens that puts its reputation at risk. This can be a scandal, a product recall, or a viral customer complaint. If you spend time on social media, you know that one small issue can become a major problem for your brand overnight.This is where public relations experts come in — to do damage control and change the narrative.Just like celebrities, brands need to develop a reputation with their audience. This behind-the-scenes reputation-building can ultimately be what makes the brand successful or not.


Without the right branding, you cannot develop the correct message, leading to the wrong marketing.Ask yourself this question: Is your online reputation strong, or does it need work?Related: Should You Start With PR or Marketing First?Marketing comes into the picture to get resultsNever underestimate the power of a great marketing plan. Investing in a marketing professional is imperative for brands even with the slightest marketing knowledge.


Marketing professionals are important for two reasons: one, to clarify your brand message, and two, to increase your sales by pushing out content to your target audience.Now, if you are thinking to yourself, ""Is that all?"" those two priorities alone consist of a variety of tasks such as:Growing your audience and building a community around your brand.Finding ways to get your name out there through advertising.Developing new campaigns or repurposing old ones.Managing the entirety of your content process.Optimizing all of your pages and content for SEO.Handling influencer collaboration with your brand.Analyzing the data to continue to improve each campaign and stay relevant with your audience.The reason is that a marketer's job is to come in and create a strategy that involves content, design, and visibility that will align with your brand image and the audience you have acquired. Without a clear picture of what they are selling, your message will fall on deaf ears.The marketing world is changing every day with new trends, technology, and communities to join. There are a vast amount of avenues to keep up with, and you can't let your image falter in any community you are a part of.


That's where marketers come in.On top of that, as we have seen in the last decade, consumer preferences and actions have changed drastically. To keep your brand relevant and ranking #1 on every search engine, you need someone who knows how to navigate this world efficiently.Marketers are driven by the results they achieve, and when they have a clear picture, their job becomes much easier.Related: Little Wins Are the Secret to Motivating Your Team — and Yourself


How PR and marketing go hand in handPublic relations and marketing go hand in hand and complement each other to achieve a similar end goal. These goals are creating brand awareness, building a positive reputation, and ultimately increasing sales.For example, a strong PR campaign takes the first steps in creating a buzz in the media and potential customers, while marketing campaigns use this buzz to drive sales and increase a brand's visibility.So, remember, they are not the same, but they are both essential pieces of the puzzle for any successful brand.

Business operations have numerous obstacles, from creating new products or services to customer acquisition and retention. However, turning a profit often emerges as the most significant hurdle.

41,4 Smart Strategies for Safeguarding Your Business and Brand Reputation in a Crisis,"Jan 10, 2024",Danielle Sabrina,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-safeguard-your-business-and-brand-reputation-in-a/467683,"
Today's business landscape is almost entirely digital. While the opportunities brought about by the digital age are nearly limitless, this new era has also ushered in waves of new threats — and savvy business owners must be not only aware of those threats but ready to protect their businesses against them and the damage they can do.Your brand's reputation is everything. Today's customer has a wealth of options at their fingertips and is more selective than ever. Simply stated, a good reputation attracts customers, and negative brand associations repel them. Creating a solid and strategic brand management plan is the first step in mitigating the potential harm that can come to your company via the internet, and this quick guide will help you get started.Related: 7 Ways to Recover After a Reputation Crisis



Identifying potential threatsBefore you can create a plan to mitigate potential threats, you need to understand where they might come from. For instance, social media is a common culprit. While social media can be harnessed to connect with your customers and spread the word about your company and the products or services you provide, it can just as quickly turn into your worst enemy.When customers feel they have had a poor experience, they often take their complaints to social media. Depending on factors ranging from the popularity of the unhappy customer's account, the severity of the experience and how many others have had a similar negative experience, a post like this can quickly go viral, destroying the reputation you've built for years in a matter of hours.


This type of public criticism can be difficult to manage. It can happen fast, even overnight, and a prompt response is needed to mitigate the damage. If a business is unprepared and takes too long to formulate that response (or the response doesn't resonate), the damage may be irreversible.Strategy: Outline potential threats to your business's reputation, including social media, unfavorable news stories, product or service quality issues and negative reviews. Just knowing where to watch is critical, and this list is a good starting point.Proactive brand monitoringNow that you know where potential threats could occur, how will you know when they do? It's impossible to monitor every possible channel around the clock personally. Fortunately, plenty of tools are available today that can actually do that for you. This makes a huge difference in brand protection because the earlier you can respond to negative activity, the better off you'll be.Strategy: Invest in reputation management software. Compare tools to determine what will work best for your company and your industry. Look for tools that offer social media listening, sentiment analysis and competitor monitoring to start with, although you may wish to add more depending on how frequently you find that your company is discussed online.


Related: Why You Must Monitor Your Online Reputation Before it Hurts YouAddressing negative feedbackIt's been brought to your attention that a customer has made a complaint about your company. Unfortunately, it's gone viral, and your brand's reputation is diminishing quickly. What do you do now?In almost every case, the right strategy is to address this issue head-on with honesty and transparency. Ignoring the problem won't make it go away, and if attempts are made to hide the full story, it will become an even bigger problem when the truth eventually comes out. A negative media experience doesn't have to be the end of the road, though. Use the negative feedback to improve your products or services, and you — and your customers — will come out ahead.In 2018, Starbucks received serious backlash when a manager called the police on two Black men who were waiting for a business meeting. The two men were arrested, and the situation blew up in both the press and on social media, with #BoycottStarbucks trending. Starbucks responded quickly, with CEO Kevin Johnson releasing a sincere statement and apology, referring to the situation as ""reprehensible."" His statement included a promise to do better, and the following month, more than 8,000 Starbucks locations across the country closed for an afternoon of racial bias training.


Strategy: Create social media scripts and talk tracks around every situation you can imagine, no matter how unlikely they may seem. Nobody ever wants to admit that a member of their organization could make a bad decision or that their product could injure someone, but both of these scenarios happen all the time, and organizations need to be prepared for the possibility. Train members of your team on how to talk to the media, and let employees know to whom they should direct media inquiries.Maintain transparency and authenticityTransparency is always the ethical choice, but it's even more important during challenging times. Your choice will significantly impact how your company is perceived by the public and even whether it can successfully navigate a crisis.Customers, investors and internal stakeholders like your employees need to feel like they can trust your company. Listening to and honestly addressing concerns offers reassurance during challenging situations. Acknowledging mistakes and committing to improvement displays authenticity and prevents rumors from starting and spreading.Strategy: Always speak honestly and authentically. Show empathy, especially if a party has been harmed. Listen when feedback is given. Has a deficit in your company been highlighted? Be prompt in creating a plan to address this deficit and then follow through.


Don't let a crisis catch you off guard. A smart and strategic communication plan partnered with transparency and authenticity will help you successfully navigate the inevitable challenging situations that an online society is bound to throw your way.Related: The Crisis Won't Kill Your Business If You Get the Response Right

42,Should You Hire a PR Firm or a Boutique PR Firm? (And What's the Difference?),"Dec 18, 2023",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/should-you-hire-a-pr-firm-or-a-boutique-pr-firm-and/465675,"
More and more businesses are recognizing the value of public relations to put them — and keep them — on the map of today's highly competitive, highly saturated marketplace.The marketing strategies that businesses used to rely on before the digital age — like prominent Yellow Page listings, newspaper ads and distributed flyers announcing store openings — are no longer effective and cutting-edge promotional tools. Such priorities as social media presence, brand buzz and cross-platform messaging have replaced these traditional approaches.Experts in financial consulting, fashion merchandising or home health services aren't expected to be experts in these newer means and modes of company publicity. That's what PR and branding pros are for. And that's why businesses of all sizes are increasingly realizing that they can benefit immensely from forming B2B partnerships with specialists in these new spaces and places.



Related: 4 Reasons Your PR Campaign Isn't Driving Sales — and How to Fix ThemWhy hire a PR firm?Here are some of the top reasons businesses contract with a PR specialist as part of their overall business plan:


To increase brand awareness and break into new marketsTo strategize ways to stand out from the competition and make an impressionable mark in your industryTo take advantage of market trends and customize campaigns to target influencers and audiencesTo manage all media/community relations and deliver content marketing assetsTo provide crisis management when neededTo leverage the power of outside expertise to accomplish internal goalsIf you're at a place in your business's evolution where you recognize it's time to bring in PR expertise, should you go the boutique route … or not?Related: Why You Need A PR Agency and How to Choose One WiselyBoutique vs. not boutiqueIn the world of PR, there's not always a tremendous difference between the two types of firms, but there are significant differences.Staff size: Boutique firms tend to have a smaller staff but one with a higher degree of experience in particular domains. All-round PR firms have more bodies in seats to handle a large client list, but some may lack specialization and in-depth knowledge.


Overhead considerations: A smaller boutique operation obviously equates to lower overhead expenses (which are inevitably passed on to clients to some degree in any business model). Larger umbrella firms, on the contrary, charge more, but those heftier invoices can also come with access to more resources and a wider reach in the industry.Portfolio volume: Boutique firms purposely limit their client list to a curated selection of business types and sizes, usually SMBs (small to medium-sized businesses). They don't promise they can be everything to everybody because they likely don't have that capacity. Full-service firms will undoubtedly have larger capacity, and for proponents of the ""bigger is better"" theory, that's an important deciding factor. Just keep in mind that bulkier portfolios also carry larger retainers, sometimes with longer-term commitments.Level of care: A smaller, more intimate PR firm usually takes pains to deliver a more intimate experience characterized by a white glove approach and 24/7 care and accessibility. They might not want to answer your call on a Sunday, but to retain your business and keep you happy, they will! Larger firms aren't as dependent on each individual client to stay in business, and because they have larger staffs, they have greater turnover. Both types can dispense utter professionalism and skill, but the boutique firm's agency background often equips them with a more personalized touch.Advantages and disadvantagesWhen it comes right down to it, any PR outfit has the same objectives, purpose and mission: to broaden your presence in your market and spread the good word about your quality brand and business. So the distinction mainly comes down to a difference in scale.


Full-service agencies have the bandwidth to take on more clients simultaneously and manage larger projects and campaigns across numerous industries. They also have more employees to see to clients' needs and sometimes top-level talent on staff, like a copywriter who pens Super Bowl ads (and commands a top-level salary!).However, because boutique firms have highly seasoned and versatile specialists on a more compact team, you can get more bang for your buck when it comes to industry-specific expertise. Boutique firms can be more flexible in contract terms, more agile in tailoring services and more affordable for clients with budgetary constraints. And yet, they may face limitations in terms of scalability, so that needs to be considered.It all depends on your preferencesBoth boutique and non-boutique firms can cover the full range of expected services — media outreach, content marketing, product launches and event coordination, to name a few. Whereas the full-service firm takes a more panoramic view over a vaster amount of space, the boutique firm adopts a niche focus and caters to highly individualized client results.If you like the idea of taking on an established entity with a macro vision and far-reaching feelers to make a nationwide or even worldwide dent, a generalist firm might be for you. Likewise, if you'd prefer to work with multiple individuals across multiple departments. However, at a boutique firm, you're far more likely to work with the same small team from project start to finish.


Either way, it's a good idea to research the firm's track record and customer testimonials. In doing so, assess the firm's capabilities, competencies and specialties. Before signing on the dotted line, ask how the firm visualizes relations with clients, how they prioritize client tasks and how much attention you can expect to receive per month. How accessible will they be, and how do they divvy up responsibilities between them and you?Ultimately, the decision of who to hire hinges on your particular business needs at this particular time. If a reputable boutique PR agency can meet those needs effectively and affordably, why not start smaller in size and narrower in focus? You can always go bigger and broader if you decide to cast a wider net in a larger pool!

43,Does PR Actually Help Increase Sales? Yes — Just Do It Right and Be Patient,"Dec 14, 2023",Irina Proskurina,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/does-pr-actually-help-increase-sales-yes-just-do-it/466114,"
Should PR serve the purpose of boosting sales along with other strategies? This question has long been a subject of discussion among business experts. While PR professionals traditionally focus on brand awareness, reputation and media exposure, business owners want to see these factors reflected in increased revenue.PR is an invaluable tool that becomes an integral part of many business processes, from shaping consumer perceptions to influencing people's purchasing decisions. Although PR emphasizes brand image and visibility first and foremost, its ripple effect extends to consumer behavior, which ultimately translates into increased sales figures for businesses.In this article, you'll learn how PR can positively influence sales when implemented as a long-term strategy and get tips on maximizing this effect.Related: 4 Reasons Your PR Campaign Isn't Driving Sales — and How to Fix ThemPerceive PR as part of the business ecosystemPR is part of a larger chain reaction in your company. Product quality, marketing strategies and customer service all shape the image and value of a business, and PR can amplify their impact through media storytelling. In other words, don't expect PR to create a strong brand narrative out of nothing. Build it into the fabric of your company's culture, values, and actions. PR is most effective when it aligns with the authentic identity of your brand, highlighting and amplifying the inherent strengths that already exist within your business.



To leverage this ecosystem, you need to encourage your sales, marketing, and other specialists to use PR as an extra asset in their work.Make sales reps and PR professionals work togetherIncorporating PR into sales will boost the effect of the former by highlighting brand credibility. It leads to enhanced customer confidence and increased conversion rates.Here's what sales managers can do in conjunction with PR:Provide potential customers with a media list that reflects the company's recognition and reputation as an industry leader;Use media publications to create branded presentations that align with the overarching brand narrative;Browse publications for comments and identify potential leads among commenters, etc.This collaboration works wonders. PR itself doesn't have immediate ROI because it takes time to build a solid brand reputation and boost the SERP ratings of your web pages. However, sales managers can leverage PR's groundwork right away in their strategies.


Related: Crafting The Best Public Relations Strategy For Your BusinessMarry PR to marketingPR and marketing have essentially the same goal – to attract and retain customers and drive business growth. That's why it's only natural that the two should work in tandem.While marketing can quickly and powerfully impact sales, PR is a long-term game. Luckily, marketing managers can tap into PR to make it instantly valuable and important for sales growth. For instance, marketers can:Use PR insights for targeted ad and marketing campaigns. PR-generated data, such as media coverage analytics or customer feedback obtained through PR efforts, helps marketers refine and adjust their strategies. This information can help tailor marketing campaigns to cater to the audience's preferences and trends observed in PR engagements.Enhance influencer collaborations. PR experts know how to find celebrities and influencers to endorse your brand and expose it to their followers and fans. Marketers can work with PR to identify the best potential collaborators, initiate contact, and score a great deal to boost your product promotion, leading to more sales.Choose the right media outlets to generate quality leadsDon't go random when you want to secure publications about your business in media. Selecting the appropriate outlets is crucial for generating high-quality leads through PR strategies. Choose the media that resonates with your niche and target audience — this way, your message will reach the right demographics.


For instance, if your product caters to tech-savvy consumers, collaborations with tech review websites or guest features in relevant industry online magazines can yield valuable leads. These leads can then be further nurtured through engaging content tailored to the specific audience's interests and pain points. Tech-savvy consumers often seek in-depth information and insights, so providing them with detailed guides or informative articles that bring real value. The leads will associate this value with your brand and be more likely to turn into paying customers.Related: How to Get Media Coverage For Your BusinessEngage in industry events to communicate with your target audience directlyPR is not just about media engagement. Active participation in industry events provides a direct line of communication between a business and the target audience. This creates fruitful opportunities for lead generation and reputation building.Have a PR specialist you work with track relevant industry events and pick those that will best align with your brand's goals and target audience. It may be trade shows, conferences, or exhibitions that allow brands to engage with potential customers face-to-face, showcasing products or services in a personalized manner.


For instance, hosting a booth at a beauty expo enables cosmetic companies to offer live demonstrations and active engagement with attendees. This exposure translates into potential leads and increased sales prospects.Last but not least: Don't chase (just) numbersRemember: PR is not directly responsible for sales. It deals with building relationships, enhancing brand perception, and shaping public opinion. While sales metrics are important, PR primarily focuses on fostering trust, credibility, and goodwill among stakeholders.The value of PR extends beyond immediate numbers, emphasizing long-term brand reputation and loyalty, which ultimately contribute to sustained business success. Prioritizing meaningful connections and a positive brand image over solely chasing numerical metrics allows PR efforts to lay a solid foundation for future growth.If you want to track the specific metrics pertinent to PR campaigns and their impact, pay attention to:


Media impressions. Measure audience reach through media coverageSentiment analysis. Assess public perception (positive, negative, neutral)Website traffic. Monitor increased visits due to PR effortsLead generation. Measure leads attributed to the campaignIf all these metrics demonstrate positive trends, you can be sure that PR is working in your favor and contributing to sales growth, even if this correlation is not immediately obvious.

Liza Anderson, now founder of Anderson Group Public Relations, got her start in PR more than 20 years ago working for Warren Cowan of Rogers and Cowan. ""Considered the godfather of PR,"" Cowan was one of the first to represent Hollywood icons like Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor outside of the studio system in the 1950s, Anderson says.Needless to say, a lot has changed in the decades since Anderson's early PR days.

45,The 5 Essential Elements of a PR Pitch That Will Land,"Nov 24, 2023",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-essential-elements-of-a-pr-pitch-that-will-land/464295,"
In my world of all things public relations, ""pitch"" is the MVP of my lexicon. As a verb, ""pitch"" lies at the core of my business: it's what my team does for virtually every client on my list, and it's arguably the single-most strategic action in launching a full-blown marketing campaign. As a noun, ""pitch"" is the actual written asset we produce: we throw something into the big wide media net and hope it hits its mark.""Hope"" is not a word I like to emphasize. My clients don't want to hear, ""I hope I can get you press coverage"" or ""I have high hopes that we can place your product announcement in this magazine."" No, what they want, what you want and what I want — for all our businesses — is to produce pitches that get noticed, get read and get picked up right out of the gate.The mission is clear. Accomplishing that mission is a whole other ballgame.



Is there a secret formula for effective PR pitches?Many things go into a good, solid pitch. Presentation matters — it should look crisp and clean, use an eye-catching but easy-to-read font and be laid out nicely, sure. Length matters — too long, and the reviewer will likely just skim over it; too short, and you won't be able to generate a message with any real substance. Tone matters — overly formal comes across as stuffy, boring and antiquated; overly informal comes across as too casual, amateur and unprofessional.But if I had to narrow down my recipe for a potent, compelling, attention-grabbing pitch, I'd zero in on five staple ingredients that form the base of all of my firm's pitches.


Related: PR Pitches Getting Lost in the Abyss? This Storytelling Advice Will Help the Right People Find Them.Five action steps to craft a results-generating pitch#1: Do a deep dive. Do not go in blind. Do not ""wing it."" Do not sit down at your desk and tell yourself, ""Something will come to me once I start typing."" Instead, do some research. Then, do some more research. A pitch with an informed viewpoint and data-driven assertions will hit the target over vague, general ""rah-rah"" pieces 10 times out of 10.One of my strongest pitches ever? It was about burgers. I studied the ins and outs (pun intended) for hours on end — what people in the food and beverage industry had already written about burgers, what went into the best burgers and what consumers cared most about in their burgers. My pitch was thoughtful, well-founded and had style. The journalist picked it up right away, writing back to me that it was the best pitch he'd ever received.#2: Ensure impeccable grammar. Never underestimate the power of a typo … to sink your pitch right into the mud. Though I'm long on vision, I'm short on the finer points of the English language, so nothing leaves my office that hasn't been pored over by a grammar and punctuation expert on my editorial team. Draft. Edit. Proof. Repeat.


Remember that journalists are writers; they respond to good writing and toss faulty writing directly into the trash can. When your pitches are well-written, grammatically correct and error-free, they will align so much better with the brand you're promoting and will allow the messaging (not the avoidable mistakes) to grab the spotlight.Related: Are Your PR Efforts Falling Flat? Here's How to Fix It#3: Adopt a newsworthy angle. I've said it before, and I'll keep on saying it. To get in the news, you have to bring something new to the table. You have to infuse the well-traveled terrain with a breath of fresh air that feels refreshing and interesting to the media rep.To find a novel angle, return to the research board. What hasn't been said yet? What hasn't been considered? What intriguing spin can you put on your subject matter that will capture your reader's attention and pique their curiosity? Unless you've settled on an angle that will direct the course of your pitch, don't start randomly clicking away at the keyboard. Wait until you're inspired by your own approach to increase the chances that you'll inspire your audience.


#4: Turn selling into storytelling. Let's face it: what a pitch is really doing is trying to sell something. You're trying to get the media to ""buy"" what you're peddling, to take the bait so you can get them on the hook. But a soft sell almost invariably beats out a hard sell, and the key to soft selling is the narrative technique.It's one thing to tout a revolutionary new skincare product on the basis of its chemical composition, regenerative properties and competitive price point. It's quite another to actually illustrate its life-changing qualities through the words of Janice, a new convert who is obsessed with its silky texture, delicious scent and mind-blowing results around her eyes.Facts appeal to the intellect. Stories appeal to the emotions. When you're trying to reach people, the emotional route will often get you to your destination more persuasively and dynamically.Related: How to Write a Winning PR Pitch


#5: Add your own flair. Enough with the AI and ChatGPT already. We've barely gotten started in this arena, and I'm already encountering far too much copy that sounds generic, robotic and soulless. There is a place for personality in the business world, for a singular voice and vision. And a pitch is an excellent vehicle to transmit your particular flair.Some pitch writers go for humor, some seek logic and some chase the utterly perfect tagline. Me, I'm a heartstring-puller. That's just my default mode when working with clients, the press, anyone. So I write from the heart when I'm pitching, with the goal of touching another one. Don't be afraid to imbue your pitch with passion; people react to that when they sense it's authentic.Don't neglect this final stepDo you know how full your inbox is? Well, the media's boxes are positively overflowing. So don't wait to be ""discovered"" amid all those written proposals. Pick up the phone to follow up on your pitch. Invite the recipient to coffee. Try to develop relationships with media contacts. Like you, they're looking for the next big success story, and if you add this final step, you just might find it together!

46,How Crisis Taught Me to Ask for Help,"Nov 21, 2023",Cheri Beranek,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-times-of-crisis-teach-us-to-ask-for-help/465152,"
The first time I reached a point of crisis, I let myself get overwhelmed. Everyone kept asking me for more, and I never said no, never asked for help, and never admitted I had no idea which way to turn. So, I got fired.Looking back, I could have averted that crisis if I had known it was okay to ask for help. Crisis happens to everyone. We can all think of a time when we had no idea how to move forward, left or right. The pandemic put the world into a state of crisis, but a crisis can also be small; it can be real or even imagined. The experience puts us into a state of inaction, frightened to a standstill. That is a crisis point.In life and business, most of us confront many mini-crises along the way. But I have found that rather than a sign of weakness, asking for help is an opportunity for growth.



Related: 4 Keys to Achieve Business Success in a Time of CrisisWatch others in crisis and learnWorking remotely during the pandemic gave me the opportunity to learn how to work on my business rather than in it. I would watch other people in crisis, but at my level within the company, I would not actually see their crisis until they had arrived at the point at which they should have asked for help — but did not. I then took the opportunity to either provide support or direct it as needed to the individual, the department, or the situation. But watching others have those moments also allowed me to look closer at my own world.


During my recovery from COVID-19, I observed others in crisis from one step even further removed. That distance allowed me to see I needed to be more aware of needing to ask for help before it affects the work of others. It became clear that in a crisis, we first need to get to safety before we can solve the problem. Whenever we feel physically or emotionally unsafe, or even unsafe in our professional opportunities, we should step back from the situation and find a safe way to start over.Finding this safe way often means asking for help, but for many people, it can feel uncomfortable saying, ""I don't know what to do."" Instead, I advise people to admit, ""I don't know the norms in this company in terms of how this is done."" Every company has a different way of doing things. Using this framing allows someone to offer help without feeling like we have to minimize our intellect or skill.Related: 5 Ways to Help Your Business Win in Times of CrisisAsking for help deepens relationshipsWe cannot go into every task assuming someone will always look out for us, but there will inevitably be times when we need support from those who will. When we do find ourselves needing help, first, think about who we have let down in the process of reaching a point of overwhelm and apologize. Then, ask for help with a plan on how to fix it. This is not a model for regular use but a mechanism to deepen relationships.


My son is 25 and in his second professional position, nine months away from his MBA. When he needed to help his fiancee through a personal crisis, his company allowed him to work remotely, but he found it difficult to keep up with his work. When he returned to the office, he was overwhelmed, telling me, ""There's so much to do, and I don't know where to start!""Firstly, I thanked him for reaching out. Then I told him to go to his boss for help, rather than trying to do this on his own, armed with a proposal of how he would use that help to move forward. Within 48 hours, everything was back under control. His boss even apologized because, as he put it, ""My job was to have your back while you were gone, and I missed some things as well."" What could have been the start of a professional downfall for my son turned into a bonding experience.Of course, in a toxic culture, asking for help might not work, and it may be better to remove ourselves from that environment. Asking for help is not a 100% reliable toolkit, though it has been surprisingly reliable in de-escalating conflicts. When in an argument with someone, saying, ""I need your help,"" shows I am looking up to them rather than being at odds with them, cooling the other person's frustrations. Without that emotion, everyone can think more clearly and move on from conflict with healthier relationships.Related:  4 Ways to Make Sure Your Business Survives the Unexpected


Reaching out gives people powerMy grandchildren are both approaching two years old and learning to talk. They know what they want — water or a bottle — but often find it out of reach. It turns out ""help"" is one of the first words a two-year-old will learn. The help of others gives them power. In the same way, asking for help in the workplace empowers us with our colleagues' collective knowledge and expertise.Whether a crisis is professional or personal, talking it through with others who have gone through it previously can help. After I got divorced, I first hid it from the company, and while I had partners who had my back professionally, I eventually reached a personal crisis point. Only when I asked for help from someone who had gone through divorce previously did I have a better chance of being more effective.People can be afraid to ask for help, so if we see an individual going through a crisis we have gone through before, we should reach out and offer that support. Asking for help fosters a culture of support and psychological safety where everyone feels valued and capable of achieving their goals, leading to greater success for the individual, the team, and the organization. In a constantly evolving world, the ability to ask for help has gone from a useful skill to a necessary tool for navigating the modern workplace.

President and Fellows of Harvard College ruling on affirmative action. Throw in shifting popular opinion on this issue, and we seem to have reached an inflection point. It might seem tempting for companies to follow the pendulum and bend to popular pressures, but in my opinion, that would be the wrong course.In fact, now more than ever, smart organizations and their HR teams are doubling down on sustained DEI strategies. They understand that the surest way to get value from people is to cultivate an environment where everyone can contribute. And this is not only the right thing to do: Study after study has shown that it's also the profitable thing.Shifting windsDiversity, equity and inclusion jumped to the forefront in the weeks following the 2021 murder of George Floyd. His death led to mass protests around the country, the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement and pressure on corporations to take a stance.



The result? About half of the firms on the S&P 100 pledged to dramatically increase diversity. Giants like Meta committed to hiring 50% of its workforce from underrepresented communities, doubling the number of Black and Hispanic workers. Job ads for chief diversity and inclusion officers nationwide swiftly rose more than 100%. Suddenly, it seemed, incremental progress had been replaced by an avalanche.Fast forward three years, and these efforts are no longer being championed in the same way. Some found rationale in the Students for Fair Admissions decision, but in reality, momentum changed as soon as the headlines went away. Just look at the downturn in tech throughout 2022: Among the first people and programs cut were those working on DEI.


Sadly, both of these pendulum swings were knee-jerk responses to external factors. Achieving real progress, however, requires slow and sustained effort, and to do that, companies must base decisions on facts and numbers, not public pressure.Related: Want to Attract Diverse Talent? You Need to Work on Your Employer Brand — Here's Why.Data as the true path to DEIThose early pledges and statements might have been admirable, but many were vague and difficult to track accurately. In many instances, where most of the associated money was spent remains a mystery.We live in an age of rich digital footprints — in customer data, for example, which fuels the ability to track and use fine-grained information about buyers. A similar level of insight is increasingly available in the context of employees. With people analytics, it's possible to move beyond rote racial and ethnic breakdowns and map progress toward a broader brand of diversity.


For instance, consider the power of organizational network analysis (ONA), which measures collaboration among people. Companies can fill quotas and feel good about themselves, but ONA provides a way of knowing if diverse employees are getting seats at the table.Related: Does Mandatory Diversity Training Work? A DEI Expert Reveals The Pros and Cons.Such tools responsibly monitor a person's experience at work (for example, analyzing calendar invites to see who is brought into important meetings and who is left out). ONA can also passively monitor internal platforms, looking for staff members who are under-utilized or worse, isolated. Companies can go even deeper into that information to understand how people of diverse backgrounds fit in, and then determine how to help them feel included.An equally vital strategy is bringing a quantitative lens to pay equity. Despite good intentions, pay gaps remain a challenge across many organizations, in which compensation decisions are often based on a mix of habit and intuition. Considering how many state and local jurisdictions are now getting serious about pay transparency, organizations need to step up, and data can help as well. Companies can start with smart compensation tools that analyze how much team members are being paid (and, more importantly, how much they should be paid) based on performance, potential, tenure and comparables. Notably, such quantitative lens recommendations are rooted in hard data, helping to remove human bias.


A wider gazeFinally, to push DEI forward in this post-affirmative action era, we have to get beyond broad definitions of what it means to be diverse, equal and included. Improved people analytics plays a central role here, evaluating a workforce across dimensions traditionally overlooked. One consideration might be determining how parents are doing in the workplace and/or focusing on new immigrants or people with disabilities.Factors like age, sexual orientation and socioeconomic background affect a person's job experience. When companies rely on broad pledges to boost diversity metrics, they ignore the other vital aspects of the people they take on as team members. Better data ultimately translates to broader insights and a better worker experience.Related: Know a DEI Skeptic? Use These 3 Strategies to Engage ThemThe payoff? When it comes to DEI, strong companies aren't seeking accolades or simply responding to popular pressure. They're motivated by an intrinsic understanding that equitable treatment is the right thing to do — from human and business standpoints. Ultimately, paychecks don't drive loyalty or performance, but employee experience does. In that sense, prioritizing DEI will always be investing in a better future — for your teams and your company.

48,Is Your Relentless Pursuit of Efficiency Actually Hurting Your Business? Here's How to Tell When You're Taking Productivity Too Far.,"Nov 17, 2023",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/is-the-relentless-pursuit-of-efficiency-hurting-your/463876,"
When I think back on my childhood in Turkey, I remember summers on the family farm, where my cousins and I would play outside for hours, inventing our own games and make-believe worlds. Our parents would only appear when it was time for dinner — poking their heads outside and calling us in from the olive groves.Nowadays, parents like myself feel pressure to ensure our kids are engaged in structured, enriching activities year-round. Summer isn't just a time to kick back and do nothing. Instead, it's an opportunity to get a leg up on the next school year. As author Anne Helen Petersen has observed, this obsession with optimizing children's time has a pronounced impact. Writing about her college-aged students in a 2019 BuzzFeed article, she explains that they were diligent — skipping few classes and religiously attending office hours, but were also ""paralyzed at the thought of graduating"" and stymied by assignments that required creativity. They were, as Petersen puts it, simply scared.Our society's emphasis on productivity has all sorts of unintended consequences, and they're certainly not limited to young people. The drive for near-perfect efficiency is infused into both leadership and the work culture broadly, and in many ways, it's backfiring. As CEO of my company Jotform, I've witnessed occasions when over-prioritizing productivity had decidedly counterproductive results for both employees and the business. Let's take a look at some of those unintended consequences.



Related: Are You Too Efficient to Innovate?Diminishing returnsWhat are the telltale signs of an organization that values productivity and efficiency above all else? In my experience, certain behaviors — such as being always on, skipping lunch breaks and otherwise burning the candle at both ends — are often encouraged and rewarded. And yes, employees may get more done in terms of boxes ticked on a to-do list or hours billed to clients, but this kind of environment also breeds corrosively competitive behavior among colleagues. Those willing to do more and do it faster will rise, and those who aren't will fall.


That may sound just like good old-fashioned capitalism, but there's a hitch: Writing for Harvard Business Review, Roger L. Martin explains that as systems become more efficient, certain players will game them. In time, goals will emphasize less the long-term good and instead embrace a paradigm of ""that which delivers the greatest immediate value to the dominant player."" In short, when every employee is out for themselves, the long-term health of an organization suffers.Before I started my own company, I observed that kind of workplace culture firsthand. There was less collaboration, more burnout, and worse yet — those who survived and went on to management perpetuated the same culture. When employees are less collaborative, innovation wanes, and when they are always worried about getting more done, there's no room for the kind of unstructured time that's so vital for creativity.Nancy C. Andreasen, chair of psychiatry at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, studied a small group of high-performing creatives — successful professionals in arts, sciences and mathematics. In a 2020 Washington Post article, she says that for many of them, ""letting their mind run freely is a big resource for their creativity.""Related: Stop Measuring Employee Value by ProductivityIt's hard to escape such a dominant culture of promoting productivity, but as I discovered in my own company, there's a far more positive approach to take.Focus on meaningful workIn the never-ending quest for maximum productivity, we can lose sight of the ""why"" of it all. Why did I choose this job, launch this company or build this brand, and what kind of work reconnects me with that greater purpose?Each time I remind myself of my and my company's mission (to make our users' lives easier by automating everyday tasks), it's easier to focus on truly meaningful work. I worry less about how much I'm doing and more about doing things that make an impact. In order to dedicate more time to these efforts — and as I outline in a recent book, Automate Your Busywork: Do Less, Achieve More, and Save Your Brain for the Big Stuff (Wiley) — I take advantage of automated tools and systems. That way, I make headway on valuable work without risking burnout.So, get in the habit of reminding yourself of the ""why."" Consider what kind of work you want to do more of and which things will actually move the needle for your career or company.


Create jobs with true valueLeaders can also take an active role in making employee roles more meaningful. Operational efficiency can't be ignored altogether, but it's critical to remember that staff members are more than just tools to be optimized.In the same above-mentioned Harvard Business Review article, Martin explains how we can make jobs valuable in the long term. He describes companies investing in employee engagement and education and why this leads to better customer service, lower turnover and increased sales and profits. One way to do this is by building in slack periods so team members have time to serve customers in unanticipated yet valuable ways. It may not be the most immediately efficient approach but it is demonstrably more beneficial over the long term.Related: 5 Effective Ways to Build a Winning TeamThe broad takeaway is that when we focus less on individual and organizational efficiency and more on the essence of our work as entrepreneurs (serving customers in one form or another), the payoff is seen in ways more nuanced and valuable than simply boosted productivity. Efficiency may be drilled into us from an early age, but that doesn't mean we can't make a conscious effort to accomplish meaningful work rather than just more.

49,HR Teams Need AI to Unlock Organizational Success — But There's One Thing Holding Them Back.,"Nov 16, 2023",Alon Ghelber,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/hr-teams-need-this-1-thing-to-unlock-organizational-success/463787,"
Industry leaders have long recognized HR as the fulcrum of organizational success. It stands to reason, after all, that the department charged with molding an enterprise's identity and culture should have the most profound impact on how it achieves its organizational goals. It also follows, then, that with generative AI models at the vanguard of business innovation, human resources should be considered a pivotal area of development for leaders seeking to optimize their organizations through digital transformation.Current data bears this logic out, with recent research showing that 76% of HR leaders feel their organizations must leverage AI in the next 12 to 24 months to keep up with competitors in terms of organizational success. Yet, while some are embracing applications like generative AI in HR, benchmarking indicates that around 48% of leaders are still not exploring their use. This raises some key questions, namely: Are the benefits of AI genuinely significant in HR? And if so, why aren't HR leaders taking the plunge to embrace it?I'll explore these questions in this article, shedding some light on how enterprise leaders can confidently leverage AI to best empower organizational success.Related: Why Every Company Should Be Thinking About Artificial IntelligenceTransformative potentialIn HR departments, where there is such a strong administrative focus, the power of AI to automate repetitive tasks and expedite data processing is nothing short of transformative. As such, the potential applications for AI are both extensive and varied.



One area where AI can have a major impact is employee relations. For instance, enterprises can utilize AI to analyze responses to pulse surveys, allowing them to gain meaningful insights into employee sentiment without needing to invest substantial resources in the process. Additionally, AI can be used for predictive analytics, using massive volumes of current and historical data to forecast changes in employee turnover. In this sense, AI can enable enterprises to be more dynamic and responsive to HR trends to boost employee engagement and retention, even when operating at scale.AI can also serve to enhance talent acquisition. Businesses can leverage the power of AI algorithms to scan the resumes of job candidates and shortlist the most optimal matches — a traditionally painstaking task. Moreover, AI applications can help promote better outcomes in the screening process by selecting candidates based solely on objective, standardized criteria, eliminating the possibility of unconscious biases skewing results.Were this not enough, AI can also be applied to a plethora of other HR duties, from performance analysis to resource allocation, risk management, and more. So, if the benefits of embracing AI are so considerable, then what's at the root of HR leaders' misgivings?The AI fear factorIn my view, the trepidation around AI in HR can primarily be attributed to an aversion to perceived risk.


Of course, there certainly are risks associated with using artificial intelligence in HR. Utilizing generative applications, for instance, naturally raises concerns about ethics, privacy, and security, as it requires companies to provide large quantities of potentially sensitive data to AI models. In fact, Gartner predicts that by 2025, 70% of all enterprises will rank the ethical use of generative AI among their top concerns, and understandably so. In many cases, however, I believe that the perception of the risks around AI is skewed by a misunderstanding of how such tools should be implemented.In essence, it would appear to be a question of adoption. Companies that are leading the exploration of AI in HR are those with a proven track record of successful transformations, such as IBM, who have emphasized the benefits of the technology in improving aspects like candidate selection, hiring cycles, compensation planning and employee support. Those who are more hesitant, then, must be those who are less confident in their ability to adopt the technology.When uncertainty prevails around the implementation of new technologies, the potential benefits of using them, however immense, will always be dwarfed by the perceived risks.Related: The Top Fears and Dangers of Generative AI — and What to Do About Them


The thoughtful approachTo gain the confidence to embrace AI wholeheartedly, enterprise leaders need to carefully evaluate their approach to its adoption. That starts with dispelling misconceptions about the technology.AI models are not the all-knowing, ungovernable entities that they are often suggested to be. Quite the opposite, in fact. While modern AI models are undoubtedly impressive in their ability to process, analyze and extrapolate from data, the fact remains that they can only work from the data they are fed. This is why data governance is critical.By establishing comprehensive policies and guidelines on how data assets should be stored, updated and maintained, organizations can keep a firm grasp on what data AI models will have access to. Additionally, by designating teams to conduct regular assessments of AI models, companies can prevent erroneous or discriminatory outcomes in HR that might result from machine learning biases.In conjunction with proper data governance and regular auditing, businesses should seek to develop more comprehensive onboarding processes for those utilizing AI tools. This should entail the establishment of designated communication channels for employees to provide feedback on AI-powered technologies.


Moreover, a thoughtful approach to AI adoption should involve the utilization of a digital adoption platform, which can provide employees with personalized, real-time guidance on how to use AI tech proficiently. Such a platform can help mitigate risks associated with user error and enable IT to monitor the use of new tech to weed out shadow AI.By employing these measures, companies can create an internal framework that enables the seamless integration of AI tools for HR.Related: Watch Out for These 5 Artificial Intelligence Problems in HRThe future of AI in HRWhile AI applications have enormous potential in human resources, the sensitive nature of the data they will be required to handle is proving a cause for trepidation at many organizations. That needn't be the case, however, as taking a thoughtful approach to adoption can assuage the concerns associated with the use of generative AI.


By engaging in proper data governance and auditing and implementing purpose-built adoption solutions to facilitate the transition to AI, you can confidently embrace new technologies in HR. As a result, your enterprise will be empowered to evolve its internal culture, improve overall performance and reach its organizational goals with greater consistency and velocity.

50,4 Reasons Your PR Campaign Isn't Driving Sales — and How to Fix Them,"Nov 9, 2023",Kelsey Kloss,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-reasons-your-pr-campaign-isnt-driving-sales-and-how/464308,"
Many entrepreneurs who have tried PR and then stopped say something similar: ""I paid a lot for PR, but it didn't lead to sales.""It's certainly a frustrating situation to be in. Brand awareness is great, but it doesn't mean anything if it doesn't help you reach your goals. Your PR efforts need to be closely aligned with your overall marketing strategy. However, only one in five PR professionals is involved in developing a company's overall marketing strategy, per Meltwater. This leads to missed opportunities for connecting media coverage to your KPIs.Here's the good news: Fixing this is usually a matter of fine-tuning certain parts of your PR campaign so you can convert brand awareness into meaningful sales.



Below are four reasons why your campaign may not drive sales — and how to adjust your efforts to start making more from media coverage.Related: 5 Media Strategies Every Entrepreneur Needs to Know


1. There's no defined customer journeyYour company just got featured in a digital publication with 15 million monthly visitors. Congrats! But, now what?Your PR strategy should detail how a potential customer who just discovered you via the media moves from brand awareness to conversion. Keep in mind that most customers don't go directly from one to the other — even in the most simplified marketing funnel, they first must move through the interest/consideration phase.Work closely with your PR and marketing teams to determine how you will nurture new audiences in the consideration phase until they're ready to convert.That may involve these tactics on the website page your media coverage leads to:


A newsletter sign-up box (offering high-value content)An offer for a free trialA downloadable white paperA 1-1 consultationThis is especially important if your media coverage sends audiences to non-eCommerce pages. For example, if one of your spokespeople is featured as an expert and the article leads to their bio page, there should be a clear ""next step"" for customers (like those outlined above) to move them closer to a purchasing decision.Related: 5 Ways Companies Can Create Content That's Actually Helpful2. The landing page from the press has a bad UXIf the press directs new visitors to your website, but the links are broken, images are sized poorly, it's not optimized for mobile, or it's difficult to navigate, they'll quickly bounce off the page.The website pages you provide to the press should be among the most inviting, intentional ones you create since they play a key role in moving potential customers through the funnel. Better UX can increase conversions by up to 400 percent, per research from Forrester.


Whenever you're mentioned in the press, put your company's best foot forward to make an unforgettable first impression.Related: 5 Things Journalists Wish You Knew About Getting Press Coverage for Your Company3. You're targeting the wrong publicationsWhile getting coverage in a giant publication feels amazing, it may not lead to the most sales. Some of the most lucrative placements we've seen for clients have been in regional outlets where their community comes together to support local businesses.As an example of that, one of our firm's clients has been featured in several national publications that are fantastic for credibility and visibility, but a local broadcast segment contributed to a 224 percent increase in their online sales in just one month (not to mention a spike in brick-and-mortar sales).


Even for nationwide or global companies, a niche publication can reach more high-intent audiences. If you're a nutrition app company, landing on Good Morning America is great for exposure, but you may actually reach more customers who are ready to convert with coverage in a small outlet focused on healthy eating or weight loss.4. Your social media channels don't reflect the customer journeyAs mentioned before, potential customers typically aren't ready to buy when they hear about your company. However, they often engage with companies on social media after their first exposure to them in the media.For instance, if someone reads about you in an online article, they may follow you on Instagram as a next step to learn more about your company. Make sure your social media channels are nurturing new audiences through every stage of the marketing funnel.Social media strategy should be a key part of your 360-degree marketing efforts and reflect your media coverage for cohesiveness. Repurpose your broadcast appearances for TikTok or Instagram Reels and showcase quotes from your interviews in static posts. Then, just as you would for your landing pages, make sure there's a clear next step in the customer journey.


In fact, social media can be one way to shorten the customer journey from brand awareness to conversion. It has traditionally been thought of as a top-of-funnel brand awareness tool, but 93 percent of executives say that companies are increasingly moving eCommerce to social media, per a Sprout Social report.Throughout all of these efforts, think about what steps will lead your customers from brand awareness to conversion — and be there to offer them high-value content every step of the way. Also, make sure your PR team is actively part of overall marketing decisions. When you do so, you'll see more impactful results from your investment in PR.

51,Employee Benefit Costs Are Increasing. It's Time for Employers to Fight Back.,"Nov 8, 2023",Trent Bryson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/employer-strategies-for-managing-spiking-healthcare-costs/463586,"
Recent developments and analyses of the healthcare sector compel me to address the alarming rise in healthcare costs. We are witnessing the steepest climb since 2012, a pivotal year that saw the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).Click to learn how to save on business insurance now!Affordable Care Act and its ImplicationsThe ACA was crafted with the noble ambition of making healthcare more accessible and affordable for Americans. However, some unintended consequences have emerged from its implementation. Chiefly among them, healthcare plans now lack the incentive to manage and control costs diligently. The framework of the ACA unintentionally placed insurance companies in a position where increased payouts to providers translated to more profit, rather than encouraging thriftiness and cost-efficiency.



Additionally, the law created an incentive for insurers to acquire clinics, pharmacies, and the like, and to steer customers to them rather than rival providers. This strategy channeled revenue from the profit-capped insurance business to uncapped subsidiaries, which in theory could allow insurers to keep more of the premiums paid by patients. 


Pharmaceuticals and Vaccine PricingAnother layer of complexity to our rising costs is the pharmaceutical sector. The U.S. is unique in allowing pharmaceutical companies to advertise directly to consumers. Consequently, patients, influenced by polished commercials, are often inclined to request specific drugs, bypassing a physician's expertise in the process. This leads to potential over-prescription and soaring drug expenses.Moreover, recent pricing changes in vital vaccines have intensified the strain. Pfizer and Moderna, for instance, significantly increased the prices of their Covid-19 vaccines this year. As a result, the federal government now finds itself paying almost three times the original price per dose. Alarmingly, this rate is higher than what is being paid by countries that invested considerably less in vaccine research and development.Related: Why Better Employee Benefits Can Be More Attractive Than Higher SalariesIgnoring the ObviousTwo in 5 adults have obesity and 1 in 11 adults are considered severely obese. At 36.2% according to WHO, the United States is the most obese developed country in the world. It is well established that obesity is prevalent, associated with adverse health consequences, compromises the quality of life, and poses a burden on the health care system. There is a long history of ineffective dietary recommendations that ignore food processing as driving the obesity epidemic. It is a crisis that politicians are too afraid to take on for fear of being insensitive.


Inflation in StaffingAnother undeniable pressure on healthcare costs comes from the rising inflation in staffing across the sector. As demand for healthcare professionals outpaces supply, salaries and benefits have naturally seen an uptick. While this is a testament to the importance and value of healthcare workers, it undeniably contributes to the escalating costs of healthcare services. Just this week in California, we saw a strike with the union demanding higher wages.Demographic ChangesLastly, it's essential to consider the demographic shift. In 2010, the segment of the U.S. population aged 65 and older was at 13%. Today, it stands at over 16%. This increasing percentage corresponds to more significant healthcare needs and, subsequently, a surge in costs.New Strategies for Cost ManagementAs a consulting firm deeply entrenched in these challenges, we've been closely monitoring corporate responses. Many companies are proactively taking the reins to control pricing and costs. We are seeing a trend toward exploring self-insured models, reference-based pricing strategies, and even a rollback of the expansive coverage of benefits. This rollback is an effort to counteract the 'great resignation' and strike a balance between employee retention and cost-effectiveness.Get a business insurance quote in 3 simple steps


While the ACA has undoubtedly made healthcare more accessible for many, the interplay of its unintended consequences, rising drug prices, staffing inflation, and demographic shifts have synergistically elevated costs. As always, we are here to guide and assist you in better understanding and maneuvering through these intricate challenges. If you are not exploring self-insured or partially self-insured options, I would encourage you to reach out to our team and ask how it can help your company.

Andrew Garson, 41, a once big-time public relations executive based in New York City, pled guilty in a Manhattan federal court on Wednesday for involvement in a scheme that ultimately defrauded his former employers out of millions.Despite having an established career and earning accolades, including being named a ""40 Under 40"" public relations executive by PRWeek magazine in July 2018, Garson spent years deceiving and causing substantial financial harm to his employers.According to court documents, between approximately 2014 and 2018, Garson held executive positions at two marketing public relations agencies in New York, referred to as PR Firm-1 and PR Firm-2. During his time at the firms, Garson covered expenses from PR Firm-1 by making unauthorized payments from PR Firm-2, causing the latter to ultimately pay for many of the projects and campaigns led by Garson at PR Firm-1. Garson also used his company credit card to buy a luxury watch for $14,000, falsely claimed it was for a client's event production, and later sold it for $4,000 and pocketed the funds personally.



Related: Christian Influencer Found Guilty of Defrauding Dozens, Ordered to Pay Nearly $90,000Furthermore, Garson submitted multiple reimbursement requests for the same expense, causing PR Firm-2 to reimburse him more than once for the same expense. Once his fraudulent behavior came to light, Garson was fired from PR Firm-2, after which he deceitfully obtained more than $5,000 in unemployment benefits from the New York State Department of Labor by providing false information about his separation from the company.


""Andrew Garson betrayed his employers time and time again, causing millions of dollars in losses,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. ""Garson's fraud scheme was multifaceted and manipulative, and he has now admitted to greedily exploiting his employers' trust to line his own pockets.""Garson, who pled guilty to one count of wire fraud, will pay $3,754,068 in restitution to the victims of his crime, and his sentencing is scheduled for February 28, 2024. Wire fraud carries a maximum 20-year sentence; a federal judge will sentence him.Separately, Garson was hit with a $10 million civil lawsuit in November 2020 from one of his former employers, alleging that during his tenure as an executive vice president for sports and entertainment projects, Garson deceitfully acquired $2.5 million. The former employer accused him of manipulating budgets and fabricating marketing campaigns, some entirely ""fictitious.""The lawsuit claims that he convinced celebrities such as Megan Fox and Mindy Kaling to participate in unauthorized projects. When the stars requested payment for their involvement, the firm was hit with ""demands for payment and/or lawsuits"" for ""over budget"" projects that were never approved. The lawsuit is still pending.

Public relations (PR) is a multi-faceted effort to manage and build a positive reputation. Powerful PR work includes many things, such as media relations and public sentiment. PR plays a critical role in business success by providing comprehensive brand management.Some important PR efforts include building brand awareness, being proactive in creating powerful brand messaging, managing marketing campaigns, monitoring reputations and doing damage control in response to adverse incidents that attract negative attention.Related: Why You Need A PR Agency and How to Choose One Wisely



How do you assess your PR needs?To assess your PR needs, start by defining your goals and objectives for PR. Identify your target audience and stakeholders. Make a list of the PR services you need and the scope of the services required. Before searching for a PR agency, calculate a realistic budget for your PR.Now that you know what you want and how much you can pay, the next step is finding an agency that is a good fit.


How do you identify potential PR agencies?Begin your search for agency candidates by conducting thorough online research, including exploring agency websites, reading industry news and checking publications. Seek advice through social media and professional networks. You may want to consult industry-specific directories and associations. Ask for recommendations from industry peers and colleagues.Create a checklist of desirable agency qualities and give weight to the various factors on a ranking scale of one to 10.For a real-world PR firm evaluation, use this checklist:Industry experience and expertiseTrack record and past client successReputation and credibilityClient retention rateCreativity and innovationTeam composition and qualificationsCommunication and responsivenessAbility to understand and meet business objectivesMeasurable results and ROIAlignment with company values and cultureLook for an agency with experience in your industry or niche.

Research industry awards and recognition.After you have assembled as much research as possible, the next part of the process is to meet with PR agencies for an evaluation.Related: The 5 Answers You Need Before Hiring a PR Agency


What should you ask PR agencies when you meet them?Schedule initial meetings with your top picks. During the meetings, focus on the PR team and past results to understand their PR strategy and planning approach. Ask about the team's expertise and experience. What is the founder's story? What has been the growth trajectory of their clients? How many companies have they grown?Request all media hits they secured for two or three clients over the past 90 to 120 days. Look to see what kind of press the founder and the agency secured for themselves.Discuss reporting and performance measurement. How do they compensate staff for a key performance metric hit? How many promotions have the members of the team, who would be assigned to your account, received in the last 12 to 18 months? What does their company off-site look like?After collecting all these key data points, assess their ability to adapt to your specific needs and goals, and don't be shy when talking about money.


Can you afford it?PR agencies may use different fee structures. Most require a retainer to get started, and then the billing for services may be project-based, hourly or some combination. Request detailed pricing proposals from each agency under consideration. Compare pricing in relation to the services offered. Naturally, you will want to negotiate the terms of the agency agreement and ensure transparency regarding costs.Typical PR campaigns cost between $10,000-$15,000 per month and are executed over 6-12 months. If you're planning to IPO, plan on spending $25,000 or more per month. Large and publicly traded companies need much larger budgets to effectively run campaigns that involve a mix of corporate communications.Is there a cultural fit?Ensuring a cultural fit between your needs and the PR agency is usually more important than cost. Cultural misalignment can botch a PR campaign. When you evaluate the agency's organizational culture and values, consider compatibility with your company's culture. Determine if the agency aligns with your brand's image and messaging.Assess communication style and responsiveness to determine the alignment with your usual business practices. For example, what is your expected response time when you send an email or leave a voicemail?


Evaluate the choices by conducting thorough due diligence on the agencies. Investigate each agency's reputation and online presence. Look for past controversies, legal issues or ethical concerns for the agency and key executives. Verify the agency's errors and omissions (E&O) insurance coverage, credentials, certifications and licenses. Check with industry associations and regulatory bodies for validation of an agency to ensure that it is in good standing.Related: Pros or Pretenders?

Draft a detailed contract that outlines services, deliverables and timelines. Have an attorney review the agreement. Set up communication channels and reporting mechanisms for an ongoing relationship.The key steps in the PR agency selection process are to assess your needs, identify potential candidates, meet with them, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses and then decide. By following these key steps, you may choose a suitable PR agency. Encourage ongoing communication and collaboration with the chosen agency to avoid serious problems and maintain an alignment of interests as you move ahead.

In today's business, establishing a strong brand presence and gaining authority are crucial for entrepreneurs and businesses. To achieve those goals, you must have a solid public relations (PR) strategy in place — and there are two key pieces of that strategy: guest appearances on podcasts in your niche and using social media properly.So how do you do it? Well, let's first go over the importance of PR and media coverage, as well as the benefits of being a guest on podcasts and using social media. Not only can using these strategies enhance an entrepreneur's reputation, expand their reach and ultimately drive more traffic to their business, but it helps give an entrepreneur trust and credibility. If a potential client can't find much about your business on Google or social media, you're in trouble. Staying relevant with current PR, podcast interviews and repurposing them for social media content will help you achieve the success your business needs to scale.Related: How to Attract Sales Leads through Your Podcast Guest Appearance



Build brand awareness through pressPublic relations is a strategic communication process that helps entrepreneurs create and maintain a positive image in the eyes of their target audience and the public. By leveraging PR, entrepreneurs can manage their reputation, effectively communicate their brand's story and differentiate themselves from the competition. All well-known businesses have press, and you should, too.Media coverage and press releases are essential components of PR and branding. Being featured in reputable publications and or having press releases published can significantly boost a business's credibility. Media coverage provides third-party validation, positioning the entrepreneur as an authority in their niche and gaining exposure to a much larger audience. Additionally, the right media coverage can lead to increased brand awareness, which can convert into new customers, strategic partnerships and investor opportunities.


Hire PR helpHaving the right team to help properly share your story with the media is a huge part of building a public identity with trust and authority. A great public figure business coach or PR agent can help you gain a competitive edge in your industry, as they will have established relationships with journalists, editors and influencers. This allows them to secure media coverage and feature placements, increasing your brand visibility.Podcast guest appearancesThe popularity of podcasting has opened up new doors for entrepreneurs to reach their target audience. Appearing as a guest on popular podcasts allows entrepreneurs to share their expertise, give insights and connect with a new audience.Podcasts provide a valuable opportunity to tell one's story in a conversational format, allowing entrepreneurs to showcase their personality and authenticity. By sharing their experiences, lessons learned and industry knowledge, entrepreneurs can establish themselves as thought leaders and build a rapport with listeners they may have not had before. The credibility gained from these interactions can lead to increased brand loyalty and new customers.Additionally, podcasts often have a niche focus, catering to specific industries or interests. By requesting to be a guest on podcasts aligned with a like-minded audience, entrepreneurs and business owners can reach a highly targeted demographic and generate quality leads and possible fans. Each podcast appearance serves as an endorsement and recommendation from the podcast host, enhancing the entrepreneur's reputation with the listeners, which is why being a guest is so valuable.

Find podcasts that align with your expertise, interests and story so that you can add value to their audience. You can use platforms like Apple Podcasts, Spotify or Podchaser for your research. It's wise and recommended to listen to any podcast show before you send a pitch. Get a feel for the type of guests they typically have on their show.Create a 1-page media kit to give a brief on who you are. Include photos, a short bio, website link and your social media handles with insights. This makes it easy and attractive to present yourself professionally, especially if the show gets lots of pitches.Once you have done your research, know you're a good fit for the show and can add compelling content, it's time to develop a strong email or DM pitch. Make sure to include your credentials and potential topics that you can share with their audience. Your pitch should be what you can do for the podcast and their audience, not why you want to be on their show.


I recommend pitching yourself first for free, however, if time is money for you, hire an expert to do the pitches for you. A good PR firm can easily book you on ideal podcast shows.Synergistic impactWhile PR and podcast appearances are powerful strategies on their own, their true potential is realized when they are combined. By strategically coordinating PR efforts and podcast appearances, entrepreneurs can amplify their brand's visibility and credibility exponentially.For example, entrepreneurs can leverage their media coverage by sharing it with podcast hosts and producers, increasing the likelihood of securing guest appearances. On the other hand, podcast appearances can generate interest from media outlets, resulting in additional press coverage and creating a cycle of positive exposure.The synergy between PR and podcasts helps create a consistent brand narrative. When entrepreneurs align their messaging across media coverage and podcast interviews, they strengthen their expertise and brand identity. This consistency builds trust and recognition among the target audience, building long-term relationships and loyalty.

Make sure to share your media articles and podcast interviews on Instagram, LinkedIn and ""X."" Your story may inspire others and get shared many times on social media, giving you additional free traffic and brand awareness.PR, podcast appearances and social media all go hand-in-hand. They are all a part of branding and are important tools that can help entrepreneurs reach their goals, land more business and pave the way for long-term success.

56,From Side Hustle to Full-Time Success — 6 Ways to Turn Niche Interests into Profitable Ventures,"Oct 5, 2023",Bidhan Baruah,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/from-side-hustle-to-full-time-6-ways-to-turn-a-niche-into/462299,"
A few years ago, my friend Sabah turned her passion for cooking into a chef-on-demand business. She started off serving her local Cleveland area, quickly growing to cover other major Ohio cities and plans to expand even further. She is just one of the many people I know who have turned their passion project into a successful business.We all have our passion projects. We do them because they're fun, or we like the challenge, or they're our way of doing some good in the world. From time to time, though, our niche interests and hobbies lead us to marketable ideas. For many, that's as far as it goes; they don't know how to take the next step.Sabah had a shortcut — she's married to my friend and business partner, who knew not only the next step to take but all the steps after that. If you're not lucky enough to have a spouse or friend who can help, here's how to turn your passion project into a successful business.



Related: Ten Tips To Turn Your Passion Project Into A Business1. Run it by friendsWhen we have that eureka moment, it sometimes blinds us to flaws in our logic. Get a quick check. Run your idea by a few trusted friends. They may be able to point out roadblocks you didn't think of. Or they may know a way to help bring your idea to life.


2. Analyze the marketChances are, others have had your idea. Sabah wasn't the first to think of a chef-on-demand service, but when she analyzed the market, she realized her idea could still work. Market analysis requires thoroughly researching consumer trends and expectations, market size and the demand for your offering.To truly excel, you must conduct a thorough analysis of your rivals. While they may offer a comparable product, you must surpass them. By pinpointing what they lack, you can capitalize on it. Keep in mind their customer feedback is crucial in identifying gaps.When you look hard at similar businesses, you might find opportunities to fill the gaps they're leaving.3. NetworkNetworking with others who have launched their business or product can be invaluable. They're ahead of you on the journey and can help you avoid costly missteps.


If you're lucky, you may find someone with similar experience and a willingness to mentor you. A good mentor can help you find the path forward when you hit a roadblock.Keep the lines of communication open with your network and your mentor. They know the twists and turns and can save you a lot of headaches and expenses.4. Build an MVPIn the software development world, a minimum viable product (MVP) is a way to test your idea with a small group of early adopters. It's essentially an early product version with just a few core features.For Sabah, the MVP was a limited menu with a select set of chefs — and she was one of them. Once she proved her idea would work, she hired more chefs and added more meals to the menu based on the feedback she got from her customers.


The early and genuine feedback is the goal of an MVP. The lessons you learn fuel product improvements at the beginning of the development cycle when it's easier and less expensive to make changes.It also gives you evidence that either supports or exposes the flaws in your assumptions about the idea.Related: 5 Tips for Solidifying MVP, and Why It's the Most Important Aspect of Building a Startup5. Get helpSabah didn't build her business alone. She knew she needed help to build the web applications her fledgling company needed and outsourced that work. Trying to do everything leads to stress, burnout and costly mistakes. It also takes you longer to get to market, allowing competitors to beat you to the finish line.


Don't try to go it alone. Engage freelance help or outsource product development to a team with the knowledge and bandwidth to quickly build a high-quality product.Knowing when to get help involves recognizing your strengths and weaknesses. Maybe you can build the product but need help with market analysis. Or building a brand identity and marketing the product.Outsourcing some of the work also frees you up to focus on what you're good at and can take a lot of stress off your shoulders.Related: Asking For Help Is Good For You and Your Business


6. Keep your finger on the pulseMarkets and trends can shift rapidly. Ensure you're monitoring customer needs and what your competitors are doing. Otherwise, your product may be outdated by the time you get launched.It's been a joy to watch the growth of my friend's business. She's met challenges with grace and never let setbacks slow her down. And that, too, is key to turning your passion project into a successful business: believing in your vision enough to stick with it, no matter what.

57,Pros or Pretenders? How to Choose a Reliable PR Agency in 6 Steps,"Oct 2, 2023",Irina Proskurina,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-choose-a-reliable-pr-agency-in-6-steps/459664,"
If you own a business, you know that reputation is everything. It's not enough to know what your brand is about and its values – you must communicate all these things to clients, partners and stakeholders. This is where PR places your company on the map and establishes the right communication channels. But with so many names out there competing for clients' attention, how do you know you're hiring a reliable PR contractor?In this guide, you'll discover six tips to help you choose a professional, result-driven PR agency that will work to effectively build your brand reputation and make your brand stand out on the market.1. Look for an agency with a rich media catalogA long list of media outlets in an agency's database is not just a sign of extensive connections in the industry. It also means it will be easier for a media expert to select the outlets that perfectly fit the client's criteria, such as budget, niche and target audience. Let's break it down with a simple comparison:



Bad agency: Offers you a list of a couple of dozens of media to choose from to publish your story. It's unlikely you'll find an outlet that satisfies all your PR needs – even the core ones.Good agency: An extensive media catalog with outlets covering various industries, reader demographics and geographic regions. No matter what your PR goals are, you'll be able to find the right place to publish and promote your business.


Related: Why You Need A PR Agency and How to Choose One Wisely2. Analyze the media you're offered to appear inRemember: quality always beats quantity. Instead of bringing your brand name to the pages of several little-known or low-quality outlets, it's crucial to focus on choosing a few or even one reputable source. Expert PR agencies live by this rule and would not waste your time and money on publications with little to no impact.Bad agency: Likely chooses cheaper outlets with fewer readers to save their (not your) budget. They might also conceal what outlets your piece will feature in until the moment of publication.Good agency: Focuses on results and transparently communicates the selection of reputable outlets, even if it means a higher price. You will be able to make an informed decision and know exactly what impact the PR campaign will have on your business growth.


Related: How to Make the Most of Your Public Relations3. Request the agency's portfolioImagine you come to a real estate agency looking to buy a property. An agent keeps pushing you to buy this ""amazing"" apartment with a ""great"" interior design and a ""fantastic"" infrastructure. But they never tell you where the property is or even show you any pictures. That's what happens if you work with a PR agency that has no open portfolio. It's a leap into the unknown, often not worth the risk.Bad agency: Doesn't have a portfolio. Agents refer to vague NDAs as an excuse, so you don't really see any examples of the agency's work and achievements.Good agency: Shows you real client cases and publications. Better yet, it has a diverse portfolio published on its website, so you can take your time to see and analyze it.


4. Seek full clarity on price and service-wiseWhen something is too good to be true in the PR industry, it probably is. So, if you found an agency that offers publications in great media for unusually low prices, it's reasonable to be suspicious. Always explicitly ask for all the details of each publication. Does it come with special tags? Is it a full-on piece about your brand or just a mention? Try to eliminate all the blind spots.Bad agency: Sells you a publication marked as ""advertising"" so that search engines will treat it as an ad, not a piece of organic content. Or will promise a high-profile placement but deliver a brief mention in an unrelated article.Good agency: Is straightforward about prices and services. Will tell you what page your publication will appear on, whether it will carry any tags, etc. You'll know for sure where you land.Related: 10 Tips to Negotiate Like a Boss


5. Look for diverse contract optionsTraditional PR agencies often insist on signing long-term contracts regardless of their clients' needs. It means a higher price and a lower level of flexibility. What if you can't afford it consistently due to financial struggles? Or perhaps you will no longer need the PR services in a couple of months. Canceling such contracts can be costly and legally painful.Bad agency: Pushes you to sign a year-long contract and make a large advance payment and is not fully transparent about the cancelation policy.Good agency: Strives to be flexible. Offers short-term contracts and is open about the cancellation policy, ensuring you have the freedom to tailor your PR services according to your needs.6. Read real client reviewsWhen choosing a PR agency, it's smart to see what other clients have to say. Reviews provide valuable insights into how the agency operates, the quality of its services, and whether it can truly meet your needs.


Bad agency: Avoids sharing client feedback or only shows you a few cherry-picked positive cases. Or it has many generic reviews that lack specific details about the agency's actual performance.Good agency: Is proud of its track record and will show you a range of feedback, both positive and constructive. Reviews include photos and/or links, feature brand names and real company representatives.All these tips revolve around one core idea: work with professionals. Just like you're looking for a qualified doctor to attend to your health, an expert mechanic to fix your car, or an experienced teacher to educate your children, only say yes to a PR agency that inspires trust and shows professionalism. After all, PR is a key aspect of your brand's reputation and success.

59,3 Ways Logistics Leaders Can Edge the Competition by Embracing Industry Problems,"Sep 26, 2023",Mark Ang,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-logistics-leaders-can-edge-the-competition-by-embracing/459372,"
The logistics and supply chain industry is embarking on a new era characterized by significant advancements in technology and sustainability. As the sector moves forward, inspiration for continued progress comes from an unexpected source: SpaceX. SpaceX has earned its place as the leader in space, but it's not because the company dedicated all its attention to one single service or solution — quite the opposite. SpaceX was founded in 2002 to make more affordable rockets. The team famously obsessed over space-related problems and, in time, decided to aim higher and expand its mission. This resulted not only in more affordable rockets but also multi-use rocket and communication technologies that have disrupted the global space industry.The takeaway for logistics leaders here on the ground? A lot of good comes when you keep focus on the problems you're trying to solve rather than fixating solely on your solution.



Related: New Trends And Technologies Evolving Supply Chain And LogisticsThe benefits of obsessing over the problemSpaceX is a perfect example of an organization that never takes its focus off the problem it's trying to solve. This philosophy encourages teams to evaluate big challenges their industry and customers face from different angles, staying attuned to shifts that may affect their approach. When teams are constantly re-evaluating whether there is a better way, they are driven toward new and comprehensive solutions that could ultimately benefit customers, individual organizations, industries and even society at large.


When logistics leaders hone in on industry challenges, these three benefits will follow:Long-term sustainabilitySolutions that stem from a deep understanding of an issue are more likely to be sustainable in the long term. This rings especially true in logistics where labor shortages, fuel costs, lack of warehousing space, inventory management, supply chain disruptions, delivery delays and heightened consumer expectations are on the rise. Fortunately, renewing focus on the industry's challenges — and how these problems came to be — presents an opportunity for leaders to see lasting benefits.By understanding the root causes of core problems, leaders can focus on addressing the underlying issues rather than develop temporary Band-Aid solutions that only temporarily relieve the symptoms.Unobstructed innovationLike SpaceX, continually obsessing over a problem allows teams to examine each challenge from varying perspectives over time, which could lead to brand-new solutions. By evaluating problems from different angles, logistics leaders can infuse innovative thinking into every corner of their company and culture.


As an example of innovation, let's take another look at the word ""sustainability."" We've touched on long-term sustainability from a business perspective, but what about sustainability from an environmental standpoint?It's estimated that today's retail supply chain accounts for some 25% of global emissions. High carbon emissions in the sourcing, manufacturing, warehousing and shipping processes as well as material waste and energy consumption throughout the supply chain are to blame. Simply investing in carbon offsetting won't make a difference. Logistics leaders need to think beyond a quick fix and get comfortable exploring bold alternatives, like electrifying their delivery fleets and providing carbon-neutral deliveries. If leaders empower their teams to stay focused on the problems at hand and think about possibilities beyond their service or solution, providers might unearth planet-positive innovations.Related: 6 Ways to Grow Your Logistics Business as an EntrepreneurElevated customer satisfactionObsessing over solving the problems industries and customers face can lead to increased customer satisfaction. Why? Because customers want to be heard and want their needs addressed — and they'll stay loyal to companies that provide a positive experience.


With an understanding of the challenges plaguing the logistics industry, leaders can take a customer-centric approach to problem-solving. It's a strategy that ensures solutions are tailored to exceed customer needs and expectations. The same goes for key stakeholders. When every player in a logistics operation understands the problem — and continually assesses where things stand and how they impact partners and end customers — it's easier to gain consensus on solutions that better serve the company, partners and their shared customers.This approach also helps leaders avoid unnecessary risks. By understanding the problem, leaders better grasp the potential risks and how they affect customers and stakeholders. Rather than wandering too far down the wrong path, leaders can develop strategies to mitigate risks and instead focus time and energy on how to best serve customers.The logistics industry is experiencing pivotal shifts, but there are lessons to be learned from entrepreneurs in other verticals. Regardless of industry, there are endless opportunities to enact positive change. Leaders who obsess over industry problems and their root causes — and how they impact key stakeholders — have a powerful edge over their competition to develop innovative and lasting solutions.Related: #5 Key Areas Logistics Businesses Should Focus for Growth

60,6 Strategies for Optimizing Cash Management When Starting a Business,"Sep 20, 2023",Stephen Bittel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-optimizing-cash-management-is-a-critical-early-lesson/458867,"
I was asked in an interview once what the three biggest mistakes I made were when starting my business. In coming up with a response, I quickly realized they all revolved around cash management. (For those wondering, I started undercapitalized and with a negative net worth, not understanding the importance of managing a balance sheet and cash flow, and entering a number of down business cycles without enough liquidity to seize opportunities properly.)Effective cash management is an indispensable skill for entrepreneurs. It plays a pivotal role in the success and sustainability of a venture, and if the metaphor for a business is an engine, cash would certainly be the fuel. Without proper management of cash resources, i.e., enough fuel to keep the engine running, no business can survive, no matter how good the idea is.Related: 3 Cash-Management Strategies for Improving Cash Flow Issues and Optimizing Efficiency



The challenges of cash flowEntrepreneurs must understand cash flow dynamics as early on in the process of starting their business as possible. It allows you to anticipate and manage your company's financial health, weighing sources such as customer payments, loans or investments against rent, payroll and supplier payments, to name just a few inflows and outflows. The timing of these inflows and outflows can seriously impact a company's ability to cover its financial obligations, invest in growth and weather financial uncertainties.Businesses in their earlier stages are also more likely to face challenges with cash flow due to their newness and instability. Irregular revenue streams, high upfront costs for product development or marketing, and the time it takes to establish a customer base are all stepping stones that are unique to new businesses that hold the potential to make or break a company. Entrepreneurs also may underestimate the time it takes to convert sales into cash, leading to temporary cash shortages. Seasonal fluctuations, unexpected expenses, or delays in accounts receivable collection can exacerbate cash flow problems.


When cash isn't managed effectively, it becomes a struggle to meet its financial obligations, leading to missed payments, damaged supplier relationships and even — God forbid — legal troubles. As I experienced myself in the early days of my company, insufficient cash reserves can also hinder growth opportunities and prevent a business from capitalizing on strategic opportunities or adapting to market changes. Consistent poor cash management will eventually erode confidence in your company, making it difficult to secure funding in the future or build new partnerships. Ultimately, poor cash management causes much more than financial woes; it's a fundamental threat to a business's overall sustainability.Related: 10 Expert Tips on Managing Cash Flow as a New BusinessStrategies for optimizing cash managementWhile my company is now over four decades old, I can still remember the pain points I felt in my early days of learning cash management. Below, I have highlighted what I believe to be essential strategies for getting a handle on cash flow early on and setting your business up for success and longevity.Create and maintain a cash flow projection: First and foremost, entrepreneurs should always have a detailed cash flow projection that outlines expected cash inflows and outflows over a period of time. Companies should aspire to be proactive rather than reactive whenever possible. With a well-constructed cash flow projection, entrepreneurs can make informed decisions about resource allocation while also mitigating financial uncertainties.Set realistic financial goals: This may seem like a no-brainer, but you would be surprised how many people don't understand what ""realistic financial goals"" entail. Whether you are a party of one or your business has grown into a team, short-term and long-term financial goals in tandem create a roadmap that guides decision-making. Without clear and achievable financial goals, overspending and underspending are more likely.Keep an eye on costs: Make a point to regularly review your expenses and identify areas where costs can be reduced or eliminated without compromising the quality of your products or services. Consistency is the key factor that is most often neglected, but what was once deemed essential can become superfluous in just a few months. We all have that subscription service that is being charged to our personal bank account each month even though we no longer use it—small expenses over time can quickly add up to be large detriments and opportunities lost as a result.Negotiate supplier terms: Another common trait I have noticed in entrepreneurs first starting out, is a hesitancy to negotiate. Our society's relationship with money is strange — many of us have grown up being taught that talking about money at all is impolite, but to successfully optimize cash management, one must get comfortable with speaking openly about it. Negotiating favorable payment terms with suppliers, such as extended payment deadlines or early payment discounts, can help you manage your cash flow more effectively.Consider cash reserves: Maintain an emergency cash reserve to cover unexpected expenses or revenue fluctuations. Having cash on hand ensures you can continue operations without relying on credit in times of need. Much of the narrative today likes to talk about how we live in ""uncertain times."" Still, as someone who has navigated a business through several financial downturns over the past forty years, I can tell you that there will always be periods when you need to be able to rely on cash reserves. Don't underestimate their importance.Regularly review and adjust: Cash management is an ongoing process that requires continuous attention and adjustment. Regularly monitoring cash flow and reviewing your budget makes your business agile and resilient in the face of changing market conditions, allowing you to seize opportunities and mitigate financial risks effectively. As the saying goes, there is no ""holding steady"" in business.It's a dynamic world, and optimizing cash management means consistently reassessing what is working and what isn't for your business. The earlier you learn this, the better.

United Airlines mishandled passenger incidentIn 2017, United Airlines faced a PR disaster following the release of a video depicting a passenger being forcibly removed from an overbooked United flight. The viral incident quickly led to widespread public outrage and criticism of the airline's handling of the situation. At first, United not only appeared to lack empathy but failed to address the situation appropriately, creating an even bigger problem for the leading airline and its carefully cultivated image.Blowback from United's initial response to this crisis helps illustrate the importance of tact, empathy, and genuine concern in the crisis management process, especially at the outset of the problem. Whether your brand is in the right or not, taking responsibility, apologizing sincerely, and outlining preventive measures you'll take to avoid future issues is paramount.

BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spillBP's response to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and subsequent oil spill significantly damaged the global energy brand's image, quickly spiraling into a major reputational crisis with years-long impact. BP's initial response was generally regarded as slow and defensive, leading to public outrage and accusations of negligence. The company struggled to contain the environmental damage and faced significant legal and financial repercussions well after the incident.While the Deepwater Horizon disaster was unique in scale and scope, it helps show the need to proactively address crises, respond quickly and transparently, and collaborate with experts whenever needed to mitigate brand erosion and demonstrate accountability.Related: A 3-Step Plan for Handling Any PR Crisis


4. Equifax's data breach fiascoMajor credit reporting agency Equifax suffered a massive data breach in 2017, exposing the sensitive personal data of millions of consumers across the country. A slow response to the crisis, coupled with inadequate communication and mishandling of the situation, resulted in severe damage to the company's reputation, eventually leading to congressional hearings.While the Equifax breach was significant in scale, data breaches at any level can create a PR nightmare for a business, sparking negative headlines that put the agency's credibility on the hot seat. Combatting that lousy news and restoring trust with customers requires a careful and comprehensive crisis response effort that includes swiftly informing all affected parties and zeroing in on transparency, prompt communication, and clearly outlined remediation efforts and measures designed to prevent future breaches.5. Boeing's 737 Max crisisTwo deadly crashes between 2018 and 2019 involved Boeing's 737 Max aircraft, shining an unwanted spotlight on the aircraft manufacturer and its product development and oversight process. Unfortunately, the company's initial response only seemed to make things worse, receiving significant criticism for lacking adequate transparency and accountability. The crisis led to a global grounding of the aircraft, a halt in production, and a loss of public confidence in the company.Though extreme, Boeing's 737 Max crisis serves as an object lesson to any brand coping with product-related issues, demonstrating the importance of prioritizing safety, cooperating with regulatory authorities, and communicating openly and honestly about the steps you're taking to resolve the problem.


Learning from the pastHigh-profile PR crises offer invaluable lessons not just on managing your brand during challenging times but also on building a reputation management plan that limits the damage and keeps you in firm control throughout the process. Engaging in swift and transparent crisis management that prioritizes public safety, demonstrates empathy, and takes responsibility are all fundamental principles of crisis response that can help protect your brand while preventing things from worsening down the line.Additionally, fostering a culture of integrity, implementing robust compliance and ethics programs, and prioritizing the well-being of employees and customers will contribute to building a resilient and trustworthy reputation.By learning from the mistakes and successes of these high-profile cases, you can position your business to navigate crises gracefully, safeguarding your reputation and securing long-term success in a competitive business landscape.

62,5 Key Things You Need Before Launching a PR Campaign,"Sep 14, 2023",Kelsey Kloss,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-key-things-you-need-before-launching-a-pr-campaign/458443,"
You've worked with your internal team or a PR agency to create a clear marketing strategy. You have your list of dream media outlets. You identified your customer persona and the media they consume. However, beyond these big-picture elements, there are still more granular details that need to be addressed. These little things can make or break your chances of coverage but can be easy to miss during the excitement of launching your first campaign.A savvy PR campaign can be a powerful driver of brand awareness for your company. Here are five basic things to secure before it launches to prepare yourself for success.1. Branded photographyImagery that speaks to your offerings is particularly important if you're selling a product since journalists and editors will look for a high-resolution photo to feature in print, digital or on the air.



Although you can provide some environmental shots, it's most important to send images showing the full product (with no edges cropped off) on a plain white background. This allows for consistency with other product shots if the journalist is creating a digital list — or allows their design team to easily cut out a product for a print feature.If your PR campaign is focused on you as an expert rather than a specific product line, provide professional headshots of yourself. These will go on your ""About"" page (more on that shortly), social media platforms and beyond to contribute to your trusted expert status. They may also be requested for digital articles and podcasts. Having one consistent headshot across platforms can help you gain recognizability.


Related: How to Prepare for a Personal Branding Photoshoot Like a Pro (and Why It Matters)2. ""About"" and ""Press Room"" pagesMake sure you or your company has a strong ""About"" page that clearly states your mission and credentials. If you're being quoted as an expert in a digital piece, the journalist will link to this when they first mention your name.This is also the place to think about leading new audiences through the marketing funnel. For instance, if someone reads an article and clicks through to your ""About"" page, provide your credentials, offerings and a form to sign up for your newsletter on that page. From there, you can nurture that lead toward conversion.Your ""Press Page"" is also key. This landing page on your website houses your recent company news, media coverage and media contacts (who a journalist should contact if they want to interview you).


Even if you only have internal company news releases or a few podcast guest appearances to share, this page is important to set up. It signals to the media that you're ready to be interviewed as an expert and makes it easier for journalists to contact you.3. Designated experts and titlesDetermine who will be speaking on behalf of your company, whether that's you or another spokesperson. Your designated expert should have solid credentials, whether they're based on accreditations, licenses or industry-specific accomplishments. This is the most important element that a journalist or producer considers when choosing an expert to feature.Your chosen title can also set the stage for your future PR and marketing goals. For instance, if you'd like to get more bookings as a speaker, make sure your title includes ""speaker."" Or, if you're an author with an upcoming book release, ensure your title includes that you're an author and the name of your book.A sample title might be Jill James, MD, a gastroenterologist at Belly Company and author of the upcoming book Happy Belly (to be released January 1).Related: 5 Things Journalists Wish You Knew About Getting Press Coverage for Your Company4. Topics of expertiseMake a list of the topics you or your company's experts feel comfortable speaking about. This helps set up profiles on sites like Qwoted, an online network that connects media with experts.It also makes it easier for you or your PR team to respond to journalist queries on sites like Qwoted or HARO (helpareporter.com), in which requests for specific experts are sent to your inbox daily. For example, if you're a personal trainer and already know you're comfortable speaking about running tips, you or your team can more quickly respond to related queries. Journalists working on these queries are often on tight deadlines, so time is of the essence.Your main PR content pillars should also be represented throughout your social media, website and brand partnership strategies to tell a cohesive story about your thought leadership in the industry.


Likewise, get clear on your ""off-limit topics"" that you never want to speak about so your team doesn't waste time pitching the wrong queries.5. Affiliate links for productsIf you want more media coverage for your products, sell them on a common affiliate site like Amazon or Etsy (if possible). Usually, journalists need to choose from a list of affiliates to include in a story, so their media company receives a portion of the sales. Some of the best-known holiday guides require Amazon links only.It's ideal to start growing this arm of your business well ahead of time so you have a number of positive reviews when the media considers your product for coverage.Related: 5 Media Strategies Every Entrepreneur Needs to Know

63,How to Respond When You're the Target of Bad Press,"Sep 7, 2023",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-kinds-of-bad-press-and-how-to-handle-each-of-them/458014,"
As a 15-year publicist, I can tell you that simplistic, feel-good adages don't always hold true. Not all press is good press; in fact, in our current culture of basically everything going online instantaneously — whether it's true or not, confirmed or not — bad press can be quite damaging, running the gamut from words that wound, at the least, to total ruination, at the worst.To take just one timely example: In the late summer of 2023, popular entertainer Lizzo was sued by three of her former dancers for creating a hostile work environment and for sexual harassment. The damage was immediate (including the cancelation of the Made in America festival she was headlining, omission of her name from a song Beyoncé performed only hours after the case was announced, others coming out of the woodwork with similar allegations) and the backlash is ongoing: criticisms of her lack of accountability, haters predicting her doom, the press having a field day with the negativity surrounding a pop sensation known for her stance on body positivity.Basically, bad press can transform into a bad reputation in a New York minute, so you have to take it seriously. If you don't grab the reins of the narrative, someone else will — and then they'll be in charge of the direction in which the subsequent news goes, not you.



Though most of us don't have to deal with the immense notoriety that can come with immense fame, we all live in the same world at the same time. If you're in business for yourself in the digital age of the early 21st century, here are three types of bad press you're likely to encounter and starting points on how to handle them.Related: Don't Let Your Biggest Client Become Your Biggest Nightmare — You Should Fire Them Instead. Here's Why.


Scenario #1: Negative reviewsEveryone's a critic these days, right? Customer comment sections of websites are free and virtually anonymous to access, not just allowing bad reviews but almost inviting them. Let's face it: Are you more likely to post about a positive experience you had or to wield the power of a negative testimonial when you're unhappy with an experience? The point being: if there's a forum to publish a bad review of your company, your service, or your product, you'd be a unicorn not to get at least some bad reviews at least some of the time.What can you do about it?Don't take every negative review to heart. Many are just one voice about one encounter, and reasonable people (the kind of people you want as clients) understand that one two-star review does not outweigh a multitude of four and five-stars and does not accurately reflect the whole of your enterprise.Do not respond personally to what amounts to a personal anecdote — especially when you're coming from a place of reactionary emotion — and train your staff to refrain in kind. No exceptions.Instead, appoint a spokesperson from your internal communications team or hire an external crisis management specialist to be the voice of your company when something needs to be said, and then rely on that person to ensure consistency and accuracy of messaging.Related: 3 Tips for Dealing With Negative Reviews Like a True EntrepreneurScenario #2: Troll commentsLike it or not, trolling is another thing that's not going away in modern society. Many faceless, nameless lurkers on the internet (hello, Reddit) and especially on social media are only too eager to initiate potentially inflammatory conversations or instigate conflict, usually just for a sense of self-importance. Trolls love to weigh in on comments that have gone viral or well-noticed posts — the more eyes that see their contributions, the better. Sometimes troll comments are just ridiculous and can be ignored … but sometimes, especially when there's a lot of them on a related theme, it's time to look at how to respond.


What can you do about it?Have a system in place to address or resolve the comments. Don't wait until your brand is trolled to devise a plan of action.Assess the volume of commentary. If we're only talking about a few derogatory comments, it's okay to hide or delete them.But if there's a significant amount, you need to search for the kernel of truth in them and look into doing things better to create a new truth. If an apology is called for, have one curated by an expert. Trolls are trying to get a rise out of you, but a PR pro isn't emotionally invested, and so won't rise to take the bait.Whatever you do, don't clap back. You can respond, but don't clap. There's a time for silence, such as when the comments are simply unfounded and do not call for redress. But silence can also make things worse when a response is warranted. If you think you can easily kill off the bad buzz with a direct, objective, fair response, go for it.Scenario #3: Dislike of your brandAn article critical of your brand just got published. Ouch. A food critic didn't like your new tasting menu. A fashion blog panned your new yoga pants. Your customer service department got three thumbs-downs in a row. Professional criticism can feel like a personal attack when you're the one ultimately responsible for quality control, and your natural first impulse is to get upset, followed by a desire to sling some mud back at the source. Don't.What can you do about it?Instead of recoiling from the sting, lean into it for a few minutes, considering the level of validity of what's been said.If you can find some — and you probably will (I truly believe the media isn't out to get us business owners but, rather, serves as neutral ""secret shoppers"") — just acknowledge the experience and what you can learn from it.Call a team meeting to investigate any changes worth making to improve the situation, like trying less salt in the soup or adding a question about customer satisfaction to the end of your call center's script.With new best practices in place, feel free to broadcast them loud and clear via a press release, a posted blog on your website, or a newly added product description line.Yep. Negative press is a reality of doing business. The bad news? The situations discussed above are becoming more widespread by the day. The good news? Because they're so ubiquitous, you're not alone in learning how to navigate them with tact and finesse. When you see red flags waving on your business landscape, view them as an opportunity to forge ahead smarter and stronger, and you'll be better equipped to act rather than react.

64,10 Strategies for Businesses to Navigate and Thrive in Times of Crisis,"Aug 28, 2023",John Peitzman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/10-strategies-to-help-businesses-thrive-in-times-of-crisis/457945,"
In times of crisis, businesses face unprecedented challenges that can test their resilience and ability to adapt. However, with the right mindset and strategies, it is possible to not only survive but also grow from these circumstances. Many companies invest significant time, money and other resources into crisis prevention. The reality is that this can be futile because crises will happen. And they will often be unforeseen. So, it is more about having the right foundational components in place to address them when they do happen.Here are ten effective ways businesses can prepare for, learn from and grow from a crisis without being overwhelmed by it.Related: 5 Ways to Help Your Business Win in Times of Crisis



1. Foster a culture of open communicationMaintain transparent and open lines of communication with your employees, customers and stakeholders during a crisis. Trying to hide or artificially mitigate problems once they occur is not only disingenuous, but it takes critical energy away from what is important. Share updates, address concerns, and actively listen to feedback. This approach builds trust and enables everyone to work together towards a common goal. Ultimately, how you engage with your workforce and the impacted community during a crisis will go a long way toward forging even stronger relationships.2. Build strong relationships with stakeholdersDevelop and maintain strong relationships with your customers, suppliers, investors and other key stakeholders. During a crisis, these relationships can provide valuable support, resources and collaborative opportunities. Cultivate a sense of partnership and mutual trust that extends beyond challenging times.


3. Analyze and learn from past crisesStudy past crises, and identify the lessons learned. Conduct thorough post-crisis analyses to understand what worked well and what didn't. Use these insights to refine your crisis management strategies, update your protocols and enhance your overall preparedness.4. Seek professional guidanceRecognize when you need external expertise to navigate a crisis effectively. Engage with consultants, industry experts or mentors who can provide valuable insights and guidance. Their experience and knowledge can help you make informed decisions and identify new opportunities for growth.Related: How to Communicate Effectively During a Crisis5. Establish crisis management protocolsPrepare for crises by creating a comprehensive crisis management plan. This is not about trying to identify every potential risk and developing strategies to mitigate them. This is about the process. Knowing who does what and who supports whom when something goes wrong. Assign specific roles and responsibilities to team members, and establish clear communication channels to ensure efficient decision-making during a crisis.


6. Invest in technology and digital capabilitiesLeverage technology to enhance your business operations and customer experience. Embrace digital transformation, and invest in tools and platforms that allow for remote work, online sales, and effective communication. Adapting to the digital landscape equips your business to navigate crises with agility. Allow, invite, and maybe even require employees to learn all of the platforms. The better-rounded your employees are, the more adaptable and resilient your business will be.7. Embrace a growth mindsetDevelop a growth mindset within your organization. Encourage your team to view crises as opportunities for learning, innovation and growth. This mindset will foster resilience and enable your business to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. Fear is often the most powerful negative component of any crisis. When the collective mindset is support, resilience and perseverance, it leaves little room for fear.8. Prioritize employee well-beingRecognize that your employees are the backbone of your business. During a crisis, prioritize their well-being by providing support, resources and opportunities for growth. Regularly check in on their mental health, offer flexibility, and foster a positive work environment that promotes resilience. A great way to do this is to pair up responsibilities so no one person shoulders too much of the burden.Related: 3 Keys to Leading a Business Through a Crisis


9. Diversify creativelyOne way to address diversification is to avoid over-reliance on a single revenue stream that can make businesses vulnerable during a crisis. Explore new opportunities, and diversify your revenue streams to ensure stability. This could involve expanding into new markets, offering new products or services or establishing strategic partnerships. This is a huge opportunity to diversify how you choose to diversify.Rather than relying on the same resources, invite employees to feel more vested by asking them for ideas on diversification and expansion to meet and exceed the needs and wants of customers. This will bring fresh ideas and create a stronger sense of pride and dedication from employees. Likewise, diversify the knowledge base by educating more employees as to the roles, responsibilities and processes of others so that more people can fill more roles as needed.10. Stay agile and adaptableIn times of crisis, adaptability is crucial. Embrace a flexible mindset, and be prepared to pivot your business strategy, offerings or operations as needed. Monitor market trends, customer needs and industry developments closely, and be willing to make necessary adjustments to stay relevant and resilient.Navigating a crisis can be overwhelming, but it is also an opportunity for businesses to learn, evolve and grow. By building strong relationships and open lines of communication, implementing effective crisis management protocols and staying agile, businesses can not only survive but also thrive in the face of adversity. With strategic planning, agility and a commitment to continuous improvement, businesses can emerge stronger, more resilient and better prepared for future challenges.

67,How Web 3.0 Will Open Up New Frontiers in Public Relations,"Aug 17, 2023",Brian Yeung,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-web-30-will-revolutionize-the-public-relations-industry/457379,"
The rise of Web 3.0 is set to transform all industries. Public relations (PR) is no exception. With the emergence of decentralized technologies like blockchain, Web 3.0 brings new possibilities for PR professionals to connect with their audiences in ways previously thought impossible.Blockchain technology, for instance, can enable PR practitioners to create secure and transparent channels of communication that protect user privacy by giving individuals greater control over their personal data. This can build deeper trust between brands and their audiences, leading to more meaningful relationships.Meanwhile, Web 3.0 technologies such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offer a unique way to engage audiences by creating digital assets that have value and scarcity, which can be used to incentivize participation and reward engagement. NFTs can be used to create unique digital experiences and reward audiences for their engagement and loyalty.



Some companies have started testing the waters of incorporating Web 3.0 technologies into their communications campaigns. Established businesses started developing digital assets on the metaverse or creating corporate NFTs.What are the top strategies for PR professionals to harness Web 3.0 technologies in their communications campaigns?Related: 3 Tips to Take Advantage of the Future Web 3.0 Decentralized Infrastructure1. Leverage NFTs to create a unique audience experienceOne of the primary attractions of NFTs is their capacity to tell brand stories in innovative ways. Public relations professionals can incorporate stories into NFTs and deliver them through collectible assets. NFT-compatible PR campaigns give consumers access to brand content, exclusive events, digital assets and special offers. Brands can now collaborate with their customers more closely than ever, rewarding them for their loyalty and attention.Nike, for example, has acquired virtual goods company RTFKT which specializes in digital sneakers. By leveraging RTFKT's virtual sneaker drops on its Web 3.0 marketplace, Nike creates new digital collectibles Air Force Ones that are positioned as more than just NFTs; but virtual creations. This approach fosters a sense of belonging and personalized interaction, strengthening the bond between Nike and its dedicated fanbase.2. Build a niche community on the metaverseBrands can leverage the metaverse to build a niche community by tapping into its unique privacy features. As consumers become increasingly privacy-conscious, the metaverse's decentralized nature and anonymity options offer a safe and secure space for users to engage with others who share similar interests. By creating a branded presence within the metaverse that prioritizes user privacy, brands can cultivate a loyal following among niche communities.


Teaming up with People of Crypto Lab (POC), major metaverse platform, The Sandbox, has co-launched launched the Valley of Belonging, a safe and vibrant space that celebrates diversity and inclusivity. The immersive experience allows platform members to participate in an LGBTQIA+ Pride Parade and explore various activities and meet diverse personalities. This initiative showcases the potential of the metaverse in fostering social change and creating a welcoming environment for marginalized communities.Related: The World Of Web3: A Beginner's Guide To A Space That's Set To Change The World As The Internet Once Did3. Integrate metaverse into your online and offline presenceM2O2O (metaverse to online to offline) is a strategic approach that aims to create a seamless user experience across different platforms. It involves using the metaverse as a starting point and transitioning to online and offline platforms. This approach can be used to create immersive experiences that allow users to engage with brands and products in a more personalized way. By connecting the metaverse to online and offline experiences, brands can create a cohesive and memorable user experience that fosters loyalty and engagement.Last year, Coca-Cola's ""Share a Coke"" summer campaign in Mainland China, Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong showcased a remarkable fusion of audience connectivity in both the Web 3.0 domain and the physical realm. The campaign transformed Coke bottles into connection points for friends. It also featured a ""Metaverse Music Festival"" where users customized avatars and engaged in music battles and a WeChat-embedded game with social sharing elements. The campaign bridged the virtual and physical realms, creating memorable moments for Coca-Cola fans.


The emergence of Web 3.0 technologies marks a new era of engagement for PR professionals. With the inclusion of NFTs, metaverse and other cutting-edge Web 3.0 technologies, brands now have the tools to create unprecedented experiences and forge deeper connections with their audiences.As the new age of Web 3.0 continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications that will revolutionize the way brands engage with their customers.The future of PR is here, and it's time for us to embrace it and unlock the full potential of Web 3.0. With limitless possibilities and new frontiers to explore, the only question remains: Is the sky still a limit?Related: Boost Your Business's Online Presence By Leveraging These Web3 Marketing Trends and Tactics

68,Don't Give a Sales Pitch to a Journalist — Tell Them Your Story. Here's Why.,"Aug 12, 2023",Mark Macias,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/dont-give-a-sales-pitch-to-a-journalist-tell-them-your/455398,"
As entrepreneurs, it's in our blood to always be selling. But when it comes to public relations, pump the brakes on the sales pitch when speaking with reporters.Over the years, I've watched entrepreneurs, CEOs and business owners jump right into their sales pitches with reporters. I suspect they see this media interview as another opportunity to sell their products to a larger audience.That's not how it works with journalists. Reporters tell stories for a living. They don't want to hear subjective information on why your product or service is better than others, even if it comes from a client testimonial — they want to hear the story.



Related: 5 Secrets to Talking to the Media (And Not Sounding Like a Fool)Don't talk about 'how the sausage is made'A popular mistake I see even the smartest entrepreneurs make: They want to tell how the sausage is made. Unless you're speaking with a trade reporter writing for an industry-specific audience, stay away from the backstory.


Let me give you an example: A few years ago, I worked with a physician who continued to start each interview with how his surgical procedure worked. I took science and biology classes in college — like most journalists — but I don't think any of us remember the medical jargon. Journalists don't want to hear a long lecture on anatomy.With most articles, writers have only 1,200-1,500 words to tell the entire story, and if you're lucky, they will give you 20 minutes to talk at most. In TV, it's even shorter, with 120 seconds for most on-air segments — so don't waste the first 10 minutes going in-depth on how the sausage is made. Instead, focus this valuable time on explaining how your procedure is more advanced or different from previous approaches. Start your conversation with the end result; not the beginning.This approach applies to any industry — tech, health care, politics, etc. If you're selling a new mobile app, don't go into the coding or cloud experience. Keep the conversation focused on the client benefit and value-add from your product, and stay away from any industry lingo. It only confuses the reporter.PR sells the story — not the productThis might sound counterintuitive on the surface, but if you're hiring a publicist or PR agency, you want to see results that grow your business. That's understandable, and it will happen. Our expectations are aligned.


But an interview with a reporter is not the time to ask for the sale. These interviews should be focused on the client or customer. You can highlight this message by focusing on the five Ws of journalism: who, what, when, where and why.Who is your product or service helping?What is different about your product or service?Why should we care?Where is this being used?This is just a blueprint and in no way the only approach to your story messaging. At the very least, if you ask these questions before your interview, it will keep you focused on the story versus the sale.Related: 5 Media Strategies Every Entrepreneur Needs to KnowPR won't save your businessI get worried when I hear potential clients tell me they are hoping PR can save their business. It's even more distressing when you hear fear in their tone.


PR is not going to save your business. If your business is hemorrhaging money before you hire a PR agency, it's likely a larger issue than publicity alone. Any publicist who says PR can save your business is probably engaging in the same entrepreneurial approach rooted in our blood.So what value does PR bring if it can't save your business?PR will bring your product or service more exposure. If news outlets are talking about your storyline, it will always be more credible than any advertisement. And unlike ad campaigns where the promotion ends when the budget ends, media stories continue to reach eyeballs long after the PR campaign is over. In many ways, the cost decreases over time.Google doesn't reveal much about its search algorithm, but they do publicly admit to putting a priority on quality content and news exposure. If Entrepreneur or the New York Times is writing about your business, search algorithms will rightly prioritize your business with search. It gives your brand the added exposure needed for the search lift.Just remember, the effects of PR don't always happen overnight. A targeted media campaign will drive traffic to your website or store, but your end product still needs to be interesting. And that's probably the most important point to remember: Brag about what is interesting, not what you're selling.

69,How to Increase Your Brand's Exposure By Integrating These 2 Tools,"Aug 10, 2023",Jessica Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-ways-to-use-pr-and-social-media-to-boost-your-brand/456619,"
For centuries, businesses have used different methods of communication to connect with potential customers. Social media platforms are among the latest options that companies have to connect to their target audiences. Having been around for less than or just about two decades, it would be easy to think that social media platforms have little in common with other disciplines, such as public relations (PR).Take a closer look, though, and it becomes clear that PR and social media communications complement each other and have the potential to strengthen the impact of both. By choosing an integrated approach, brands can strengthen audience engagement and amplify brand exposure.Understanding the synergy between public relations and social mediaThe Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) defines PR as a ""strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics."" Compare that to social media, and it soon becomes clear how much the two disciplines overlap.



Both are centered around strategic communications processes, with planned messages directed at specific audiences. Both disciplines also aim to benefit both businesses and potential clients at the same time. In the case of PR, audiences benefit by learning more about a brand; brands benefit by building trust.On social media, both sides benefit from direct, unfiltered access to the other party. In addition, brands and audiences also enjoy greater control over the time and the exact content that is published.


Combining the two methods allows brands to increase the audiences reached by their messages and amplify messages across different channels. The goal is to leverage respective strengths while overcoming potential weaknesses.Brand teams have several options to integrate their PR and social media strategies for their respective benefit. If your brand has a successful PR strategy, consider adapting it for your chosen social media platforms.The details of this adaptation will vary depending on the nature of your business and your PR and social media goals. In many cases, your brand team will be able to craft compelling social media content from storytelling-based PR activity. You may also consider running a social media contest to coincide with a product launch to increase the reach of your brand messaging.Here is a closer look at individual tactics:


1. Enhancing brand messaging and storytellingWhen your team aligns the messages it shares with the public across public relations campaigns, press releases and social media content, those messages are amplified. Audiences will notice consistent brand communications across different channels, clarifying what the business stands for.The same principle applies to storytelling. Learning about a company's history, key people like founders, and the story behind products and services brings a brand to life. Storytelling has been at the heart of PR strategies for decades, and social media platforms provide more direct outlets.Related: Want to Do a Public Relations Push? Focus on Social Media First.2. Amplifying PR success through social mediaSocial media platforms allow brands to amplify PR successes by sharing newspaper, broadcast and online media stories the brand was mentioned in. This is an effective way of increasing the audience of a brand's PR without losing the added credibility of having been published through a third party.


Sharing links to or images of press mentions or media interviews works well in this context. Brands should also leverage industry awards or similar recognitions for both PR and social media.3. Collaborating with influencersInfluencers can effectively combine the directness of social media marketing with the credibility of messages filtered by a third party. Selecting the right influencers and developing lasting relationships can go a long way toward increasing a brand's reach and ultimately driving sales and business growth.For years, Nike has leveraged athletes successfully as influencers to build its brand reputation within the sporting community and among the general public.Related: Fixing the ROI Problem With Influencer Marketing


4. Engaging with the audienceDirect audience engagement is perhaps social media's most significant advantage over public relations. Social media allows brands to engage directly with their audiences.Brand teams have a chance to respond to audience comments without delay. They can also initiate direct conversations without the formality of running market research focus groups, for example. Airbnb has used this approach to ask customers on Twitter what they would improve on the platform.This type of direct engagement helps build a community around a brand and facilitates a more casual approach to communication when appropriate. Starbucks uses this tactic successfully on Meta's Facebook by responding to customer comments with emojis.Another benefit of social media is access to user-generated content. Sharing consumer product reviews and other content generated by verified customers can vastly increase a brand's credibility and consumer trust.


Like all strategic marketing activity, integrated PR and social media efforts should be measured to check their effectiveness in terms of reach, audience engagement, website traffic and other key metrics.Integrating PR and social media allows brands to benefit from the strengths of both while using one to cover the potential weaknesses of the other. Social media's direct communications between brands and consumers complement PR's potential to increase brand trust to develop long-term customer loyalty.Related: How Modern PR Differs From Traditional PR — and Why It's a Crucial Part of Any Successful Business Strategy

70,"Yes, Hollywood is Staged — Here are 5 Reputation Strategies I Learned While Working with Celebrities","Aug 9, 2023",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-reputation-and-crisis-management-strategies-i-learned/456466,"
C'mon, is there anyone out there who doesn't think Kim K. and Pete D. were a curated love affair? Hollywood is full of set-up relationships and staged situations aimed at one goal: garner media attention. And the more attention, the better, because increased media attention translates directly to increased dollar value.Brand image is everything to a celebrity's career. When the image is positive, it can influence everything from box office share to book sales, from what tequila flies off the shelves to what paint color is all the rage. One utterance of a coined term can go viral within hours. One sighting of a piece of clothing on a certain someone can catapult a design star overnight.But when a celebrity brand takes a hit, it can be devastating. It isn't always — some reputations prove more resilient than others, but if the damage is great enough, fans and followers will knock you off the pedestal as quickly as they hoisted you up there.



In my 15-year career in PR, I've worked with various celebrity types, including influencers, A-listers and corporate bigwigs. A crisis can pop up at any time, especially in today's hypersensitive cancel culture, and that's when more than just a hastily tweeted apology or lying low for a while is called for. That's when it's time for a crisis expert to step in with some strategic moves that have the power to move the needle in the direction you want it to go.Here are some of the tried-and-true methods that have gotten my clients out of hot water when it threatens to scald their reputations permanently.Related: Why Investing in Reputation Management is Crucial for Your Business Strategy1. There's always a scapegoatIn every narrative, there has to be a villain. And your job is to make sure the villain isn't your client. Case in point: When I handled a celebrity divorce, the famous one, my client (the husband), was getting raked over the coals for some silly choices and behaviors — he seemed like the bad guy in the story, but really, his not-well-known wife was the one cheating.We documented everything meticulously and were able to back up our claims of her infidelity; in the process, we pointed the blame where blame was due and salvaged his career. We didn't make the wife the scapegoat; she was the scapegoat. But the public didn't know that until we told a more accurate story than the one that was initially circulated.Related: How to Turn Failures Into Wins As an Entrepreneur


2. Someone is pulling the strings for the other party, so you'd best have someone doing the same on your sidePeople work hard to build a life, a name or a brand. An insurance policy is needed to ensure they don't lose it all at the whim of public fodder. A publicity specialist is that insurance, operating behind the scenes to move pieces into place and leverage connections to rewrite a narrative heading south.PR firms are often hired for just this purpose alone — for on-call crisis management and nothing more — because it's far better to have already an established relationship with an expert in your corner than to seek out a stranger once a crisis has arisen frantically.I remember a story that was about to break about a client of mine that would have reflected poorly on him because of a bit of misinformation. Because I already knew and trusted him quite well, I believed his account of things. I picked up my cell phone, called the CNN writer, and got the nonfactual information edited out from the story. If I didn't have that in with CNN, my client's career could have suffered greatly.3. Use the press to your advantageThe press can be your enemy, but it can also be your friend. It's its own form of gossip mill and works in quite the same way. You know how bad news can spread like wildfire when the media sinks its teeth into a juicy story? Well, the opposite is equally true: Good news can be canvassed far and wide if you have a worthwhile story to tell and get it out there in time.


If there's anything the PR community has learned in this day and age of big-name and big-brand crises plastered all over social media, it's that narratives have power. On behalf of your clientele, you need to tell the narratives they want to be publicized. The press literally follows celebrities around everywhere. It's just as easy to get them to snap a shot of your client speaking at a charity brunch as it is to get a shot of them sneaking out of a late-night club bleary-eyed. Book the photo op. Get the views. With enough views, a new story is written.Related: 5 Ways to Make Journalists Actually Want to Publish Your Brand's Stories4. Know when to hold them and when to let them goAll this said, there is a time and place to sit tight and wait things out. Strategizing is one thing, but smart management is another. When someone's sizzling in the flames of bad press, that's not the time to open their new restaurant or launch their new fragrance. Wait until the fire has died down but isn't completely out — when your client is still a hot object of media attention but no longer the catch of the day — and then have them rise from the ashes.5. Listen, learn and do NOT repeatHelping someone out of a pickle once or twice is to be expected when you manage reputations. Anyone can get into a bit of trouble over almost anything these days. But if a client keeps making the same mistakes, you can either choose to cut them loose, or you can firmly guide them to stop pushing the repeat button!


Attend to what's being said about a public figure or brand; learn what you can from how these reports affect (or do not affect) your interest; and then, at almost all costs, avoid getting in hot water again. The easiest way out of a sticky situation is to not get into it in the first place.PR is an art, not a science, and like any art, you can get training in it to learn how to draw your own portrait, paint your own scene and write your own script. With media training and advice from publicity veterans, you can get ahead and get in front of the story — the story you want to tell.

71,How to Get Your Brand Featured in Any Publication,"Aug 8, 2023",Jackson Cunningham,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-steps-to-get-your-brand-featured-in-any-publication/456844,"
For any entrepreneur, establishing a strong presence in the media is crucial for brand growth and success. Getting featured in prominent publications helps create buzz around your brand and can significantly boost your company's visibility, credibility and customer base. However, securing media coverage is not an overnight process; it requires a well-planned, long-term strategy focused on building meaningful relationships with writers and editors. I've followed this process while building my DTC cat brand tuft + paw, and it's paid serious dividends.Related: 5 Ways to Get Media Coverage for Your BrandThe importance of PR for brand growthPublic relations plays a pivotal role in shaping your brand's image and expanding its reach. A well-crafted media presence can elevate your business above competitors, attracting new customers and potential investors. It is essential to view PR as an ongoing investment in your company's future rather than a one-time promotional tactic.



Building long-term relationships with writers and editorsRather than adopting a hit-and-run approach to media coverage, focus on building lasting relationships with journalists, bloggers and editors. Once you have a good rapport going, engage with them on social media, share their articles, and provide valuable feedback. Show genuine interest in their work, and avoid bombarding them with self-promotional messages. Remember, successful PR is symbiotic — it's about collaboration, not just seeking one-sided benefits.Step 1: Create a master contact sheetOrganize your media contacts by creating a master sheet that includes information such as names, emails, publication affiliations and notes on previous interactions. Keep track of who you've already contacted, and identify the high-priority contacts. This will help you stay organized and maintain a personalized approach when reaching out to writers and editors.


Step 2: Monitor competitor coverageStay informed about your competitors' media coverage using tools like Ahrefs. Set up alerts to be notified whenever a competitor receives a link from a notable website. This provides valuable intel on which publications and writers are willing to create content about your industry/niche and gives you a starting point for your PR outreach. Over time, you'll also develop a sense for your competitor's PR strategies, which is valuable in its own right.Related: 5 Ways to Build and Maintain Valuable Relationships With JournalistsStep 3: Reach out to authors and editors directlyWhen a publication features your competitors, seize the opportunity to reach out to the authors or editors directly. Use tools like Rocket Reach to find their contact information through LinkedIn. Here's where the actual relationship building starts. Craft a concise and genuine email introducing yourself, your business and your desire for coverage. Offer free products with no strings attached to pique their interest and encourage engagement.Remember, writers and editors are inundated with free products, and their job is to determine which ones are worth their time. If you have a good product that stands out from the competition, they will be inclined to review it or include it in their content.


Step 4: Keep your email short and meaningfulWhen contacting writers and editors, keep your email short and to the point. Avoid lengthy pitches, and focus on building a connection instead. A simple and genuine message can go a long way in forging a lasting relationship. Here's an example:Hi X, I'm Jackson. I run a DTC cat brand and I'm looking for coverage from good writers/editors. Can I send you a free product no strings?In two sentences, I'm letting them know who I am, the purpose of this email and what I can offer them. Instead of spending time on compliments, I simply ask for coverage from ""good writers/editors,"" which expresses my admiration for their work.The ""no strings attached"" inclusion is a crucial aspect of this strategy. Don't go in expecting something right away. As a stranger, it's best to do them a favor first, let the product do the talking and see where it leads.


Related: How to Build Strong Relationships With the Media (and Why It's Vital to Your Success)The goal: Building lasting relationshipsUnderstand that immediate media coverage might not be achieved through initial outreach. The primary goal is to build rapport and trust with writers and editors. If your product resonates with them, they might cover your brand in the future or even recommend you to their colleagues. Focus on creating a lasting bond, as this can lead to more significant opportunities down the road.Securing media coverage for your brand is a powerful way to elevate its reputation and attract new customers. However, successful long-term PR is not about seeking quick coverage but rather building strong, lasting relationships with writers and editors. By following the steps laid out here and employing a well-planned approach, creating a master contact sheet, monitoring competitor coverage and crafting meaningful outreach emails, you can increase your chances of getting featured in any publication.Plugging away at this manual PR work over months and years will create a snowball effect that can lead to even greater rewards. Remember, genuine connections and mutual benefits form the foundation of fruitful PR endeavors that pay off in the long run.

72,7 Strategies for Being Proactive (Instead of Reactive) in Shaping PR Narratives,"Aug 3, 2023",Hanna Shanar,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-be-proactive-instead-of-reactive-in-shaping-pr/456512,"
The world we live in is a constant dance of change and adaptation, and no industry knows this better than public relations (PR). But in an era where information moves at the speed of light, PR professionals cannot simply react; they must anticipate. They must 'futurecast.'Futurecasting, a blend of data analysis, expert opinion and intuition, offers an innovative path forward for PR professionals. It's not about predicting exact outcomes; instead, it's about identifying trends and potential scenarios as well as providing strategic foresight to shape an organization's PR narrative proactively.What futurecasting entailsThe ever-evolving digital world necessitates a shift from traditional PR methods. Instead of crafting stories solely based on past events or current situations, we must incorporate a forward-looking lens. We must weave narratives that not only inform about the present but also illuminate possibilities for the future.



This is not a simple task. It requires keen observation, in-depth research, strategic creativity and an understanding of socio-cultural dynamics. It means monitoring various fields — from economics to technology to politics to the environment — and discerning how emerging trends could influence public perception and behavior.For instance, as climate change takes center stage globally, companies and organizations must be prepared for increased public scrutiny about their environmental footprint. A futurecasting PR approach might involve creating a narrative about the company's commitment to sustainability before any controversy arises. By doing so, they establish themselves as proactive leaders rather than reactive entities scrambling in the face of criticism.


To successfully futurecast, PR professionals need to foster a culture of continuous learning, foster strong networks across various fields and become adept at distilling complex information into compelling, future-oriented narratives.Analytics tools are essential, but they need to be coupled with human insight. Futurecasting requires us to understand the data but also to interpret what it implies about our shared future. We must consider how various factors — from global economic trends to local cultural shifts — might intersect to shape the public's perception of an organization or issue.Collaboration is also key in futurecasting. PR professionals must work closely with experts from diverse fields to gain a multi-dimensional perspective. In this light, the PR expert becomes not just a communicator but also a facilitator of dialogues, a catalyst for cross-disciplinary insights that fuel future-oriented narratives.How to integrate futurecasting into your PR toolkitWhile the concept of futurecasting is inspiring, the application can seem overwhelming. How do we bring the lofty ideals of futurecasting down to earth, incorporating it into everyday PR practice? Here are some practical strategies to help integrate futurecasting into your PR toolkit.


Embrace interdisciplinary collaboration: In order to anticipate future trends, PR professionals need to understand a wide array of fields. Building strong relationships with experts in areas such as technology, climate science, sociology or economics can provide valuable insights that inform your futurecasting efforts. Attend cross-industry events, participate in online forums, and engage in conversations outside your comfort zone.Integrate data science: Futurecasting isn't about gazing into a crystal ball, it's about interpreting data to predict potential trends. Learn the basics of data science, or work with data scientists to understand how various pieces of information can come together to form a bigger picture. Leverage machine learning algorithms to process large amounts of data and uncover trends that might not be apparent at first glance.Cultivate a culture of continuous learning: Futurecasting requires an ongoing commitment to learning and curiosity. Encourage your team to stay informed about the latest news, research and developments in various fields. This could involve setting up internal knowledge-sharing sessions, subscribing to relevant publications or providing training in new areas.Practice scenario planning: One of the key techniques in futurecasting is scenario planning, where you create various plausible future situations and devise strategies for each. This exercise encourages innovative thinking and helps your team become more comfortable with uncertainty.Harness the power of storytelling: Futurecasting is as much about crafting compelling narratives as it is about analyzing trends. Once you've identified potential future scenarios, work on creating narratives around these. These stories should resonate with your audience and align with your organization's values and vision.Prioritize agility: The future is unpredictable, and while futurecasting can give us a sense of direction, we need to remain flexible. Cultivate a culture of agility within your team, emphasizing quick decision-making and adaptability.Ethical considerations: As PR professionals, we have a responsibility to use futurecasting ethically. It's not about creating fear or exploiting uncertainties, but about fostering understanding and empowering audiences to navigate the future.By integrating these strategies, PR professionals can shift from being reactive to being proactive, charting a course through uncertainty and shaping the narrative of tomorrow. Remember, the goal isn't to predict the future with perfect accuracy. Instead, it's about broadening our perspective, staying agile and keeping our narratives relevant in a rapidly changing world.


When successfully implemented, futurecasting offers a competitive edge. By staying a step ahead of trends and public sentiment, organizations can better shape their narratives, strengthen their reputations and build stronger connections with their audiences.In conclusion, futurecasting represents an exciting frontier in PR. It challenges us to rethink our strategies, sharpen our insights and deepen our understanding of the world around us. As we look ahead, we must remember that the ultimate goal of PR is not just to react to change, but to be a part of it — to help shape the narratives that guide us into the future.In a world where change is the only constant, the most successful PR professionals will be those who can not just keep up with the pace of change but stay one step ahead. Futurecasting is the tool that allows us to do that. It's not just about responding to the winds of change but setting our sails to navigate and influence the direction of those winds. And in doing so, we chart the uncharted in public relations.

74,This Department Might Be Holding Your Business Back. Here's How to Change That.,"Jul 31, 2023",Paul Rubenstein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-hr-might-be-holding-your-business-back/455652,"
A while back, I went through the talent strategies for a dozen companies across numerous sectors and came to a frustrating conclusion: It was hard to tell them apart, fueled as they were by nostrums like ""reduce turnover,"" ""improve engagement"" and ""increase diversity.""Increasingly, it's a challenge to tell the industry or geography of an organization if you read its talent strategy with the company name covered up. Too often, it contains just broad generalizations only loosely connected to leadership, business process or planning — is disjointed from day-to-day decisions about individual people. Sometimes, such a strategy isn't even written down.Be forewarned that sameness does not yield greatness. Those prevailing similarities are indicative of a real problem in the HR world: We've hit a wall.



Decades of progress pushed the profession into what it is today: a business unit that's good at reducing risks and keeping talent costs low. But processes perfected through multiple transformation cycles — from specialization and scale of David Ulrich's ""three-legged stool"" to digital transformation and moving processes to the cloud — have now become the problem. Too many companies have fallen into the trap of looking at every problem through an HR lens, instead of asking the important question, ""Is this an HR problem, or a business problem?""Today, this department has a golden opportunity to better shape business outcomes. Companies that articulate and execute talent strategy well will have a clear competitive advantage in a fast-evolving economy, where finding and retaining the right people is the challenge.


Here's how HR can get out of its way and start driving real results.Related: 5 Ways HR Can Drive Success In Today's Turbulent TimesThink differently about dataTraditional HR data about headcount, compensation or diversity has never gone far enough. Oriented inwardly, it has served to meet certain needs (including compliance, risk reduction and planning) while offering little practical guidance to the rest of the company. It's time to change that.This means tapping into new datasets that reflect modern work. Let's start with skills data. Businesses should consider not thinking in terms of ""roles"" and start thinking in terms of skills — getting beyond headcount and understanding the critical knowledge that defines the highest-performing departments, or individual workers. HR can create real value for those outside that department only when people data is layered with business data. The only limit is imagination.


Armed with skills data, businesses can move the needle — can predict an ability to deliver on products, understand where they stack up next to competitors and get ahead of recruiting challenges, instead of just reacting to them. The good news is that thereare contemporary skills-mapping platforms that can provide precisely these insights.Related: The Benefits and Drawbacks of AI Integration in HR DepartmentsAn eye to the networkThere is another and equally critical data set: network. Static org charts rarely provide insights into how knowledge is transferred and how work gets done inside organizations. Far more valuable is an understanding of a peer network: Who is meeting, emailing, Slacking and videoconferencing? This information spotlights the real water carriers inside an organization, and contemporary organizational network analysis platforms are revealing more detail in this area all the time.


Today, people data is typically locked behind HR's walls, but value only emerges when it's blended with critical business metrics. Combining network and people data might illustrate, for example, who is over-leveraged with meetings and at greatest risk of burnout. Combining people, network and CRM data can also show sales leaders how staff members really spend their time, and so help find a path to achieving quota.Related: HR Analytics: How Should Big Data Be Used in the Workplace?Don't just react… drive changeTapping into this new and blended data helps us to connect people practices with the bottom line, but that's just part of the challenge. We also need to ensure that it's being used proactively, not reactively. Until now, HR has been largely staring into the past; we've been stuck asking people to enter data on how the year went when we could be showing how their year will go — or better yet, how their year could go.With the right people analytics, applied in the right way, we can peer over the wall and change a company's trajectory — can spotlight, for instance, not simply a team's highest performers, but what patterns of behavior they share. Then we can use that information to guide others along a path to high performance. But for that to happen, we have to put new insights into the hands of people managers — the frontline leaders who are best positioned to impact teams.


Do you know who does this well? Finance. Think about how CFOs communicate with their companies. They distribute key financial information like profit and loss statements regularly to the entire organization. That information shapes every decision, at every level. HR data, meanwhile, is locked away in the name of privacy and legal compliance. This overly cautious approach all but ensures being stuck in a reactive mode, with more and more analysts gazing into the rearview.Related: This Entrepreneur Has Solutions for HR Problems You Didn't Know You HadWe've got a wealth of people data. Put it where it counts — in the hands of those who make daily decisions that shape people's experiences at work, and in turn, directly affect the bottom line. Otherwise, what are we even doing?In this age of scarce and expensive labor, HR has never been more important. There will be winners and losers, and the companies that don't articulate and execute on talent strategies will almost certainly be left behind. It's time for this vital department to truly shine, to lead from the other side of the wall.

75,Your Public Messaging Strategy Starts With Your Inner Circle,"Jul 21, 2023",Adam Horlock,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/your-public-messaging-strategy-starts-with-your-inner-circle/453858,"
Public messaging strategy for any startup or business must include a broad, audience-capturing strategy designed to build and keep a solid customer base. As entrepreneurs and startups, hours are spent planning strategies for public messaging and brand awareness. While time and money are well spent, in many cases, it assumes your family, friends, closest colleagues and collaborators, vendor partners, and other verticals understand what you do. Guess what: They probably do not. In many cases, clear messaging should start here.Instead, many entrepreneurs immediately feel tasked with getting what they perceive as the ""best messaging"" to as many as possible. Mistakes, such as ad spending with no clear direction or strategy are made. We have all seen the little league sponsorship, billboard ads and ineffective social media ad buys. Before any spends are made, the strategy must come first.For those lucky enough to start with referrals and a strong lead flow, build and own that before launching into costly campaigns, as it is almost always easier to build on an existing customer base than trying to spend time and money pursuing new audiences. While eventually necessary, maximize what you have before launching into new ad spends. For those who have to build from scratch or start with just a few core customers, it is vital that strategy comes first and consistency second. If what you do cannot be explained by your own family and closest friends and colleagues, how can the general public adequately explain or be compelled to purchase?



Start with your inner circleFirst, you. Start over if you cannot explain the problem you solved in two to three sentences. Depending on how long it takes to explain, anything from key messaging to all-new brand strategy work may be needed. The fastest way to determine what is required is when working on the explanation or ""elevator pitch,"" how quickly can you get to the core of the message that the ideal customer will care about and visually see themselves benefiting, rather than the capabilities or capacity your business offers that you care about.Far too often, entrepreneurs and founders get stuck in their messaging, using an ongoing explanation of features, capacities and how great the company or customer service is rather than directly addressing the customer's need or problem. Every part of key messaging must be narrowly focused on solving customer problems, making better solutions for their needs and making the path to those solutions easy to utilize.


Second, speak with your inner circle. After multiple conversations, if your own family, friends and colleagues cannot adequately explain what you do and why you do it, how can a potential new investor or new customer?This is a practical and undervalued way to start developing key messages and different sets of ""elevator pitches"" for different audiences, depending on the spread and diversity of your customer base. The best way to start is to choose those not involved in the same industry yet understand how vital getting key messaging right is to your business. While they may already understand some elements of your business beforehand, how you solve problems and provide solutions typically is not understood.Consider this an inner circle focus group, and get them to ask questions and make suggestions. While not all will be helpful, you may be surprised by some of the responses, and if conducted properly, it will get you thinking about how much is being left on the table regarding sales with a lack of understanding from your customer base.Third, customer base. Your customer base should be your most vital referral partners, with vendors a close second. Do they fully understand everything offered by your business to purchase more than what they currently are and to start referring others?


Too often, startups in growth mode want to push to gain more traction with a broader audience without first building on the existing audience currently purchasing. Start by asking this question: Has the purchasing power of the existing customer base been maximized, and is our public messaging strategy working to pursue this outcome? Does the existing customer base feel your brand's value and see increased spending on higher-cost goods and services as an investment and a better purchase?How do key messaging, education of services and brand positioning employed by your business produce outcomes where existing customers would recommend not only purchasing from you but purchasing higher priced and better-valued goods and services repeatedly?Build with public messaging strategyEvery successful marketing strategy must include a solid public messaging component that presents to the right audience the problems solved and the solutions offered. Without it, you may have the best solutions to save millions for other businesses or organizations. Yet, only some will understand how those solutions directly help or address their problems or needs.Public messaging must capture a feeling of value, preferably by finding a space where your brand is seen as the only or the best place to purchase. From there, messaging must own that value, hold onto it and consistently tell that story repeatedly.


This is an area too essential to assume your brand has it right. Establish the core of the business, stay consistent and remember that you are not just selling products and services but a brand story. Tell it well and consistently.

76,The 5 Principles You Need to Create a Magnetic Brand Image,"Jul 12, 2023",Jonathan Brierre,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-get-clients-to-look-for-you-not-the-other-way/454483,"
When I think of branding, my inner journalist relates the word to the concept of storytelling. Effective branding takes prospects on a journey where they fully understand what you do, why and how.Beyond that, a genuinely magnetic brand is polarizing and unique. The more magnetic a brand is, the less it needs to compete for new clients. With its unique positioning and compelling value proposition, prospects and new clients are naturally drawn to such a brand.As someone who's worked in sales and public relations for almost a decade, I know how hard it can be to create a brand with genuine gravitas. Here are some branding principles that can help your business shift from looking for new clients to having new clients look for you.



Related: 5 Timeless Storytelling Strategies to Use in Your Next Marketing CampaignEngage your clients' emotions with planning and structureWhen your client pays for your brand's services, they have identified an emotional gap between where they are and where they want to be after your intervention. Magnetic branding empathizes with prospects and communicates an understanding of the value of its services.


Humans are emotional beings; we only do business with companies we know, like and trust. For our brands to evoke a sense of confidence in our clients, we have to ensure that we not only know how to bridge our clients' gaps but that our clients know that we know how to do so too. Our prospects love to see structure, process and general planning regarding our services. Again, storytelling is critical as your customers want to journey with your services.Communicate a clear and straightforward value propositionA common mistake we tend to make when branding is that our storytelling is long-winded and broad. We often overcommunicate the services offered and overestimate our prospects' attention spans. In this digital age, we collectively suffer from information overload. That said, our responsibility as branders is to ensure we are concise and accessible when communicating our value. The easier a prospect understands how we can help them achieve what they want, the greater the chance we convert them as a client.If you asked your prospects if they understood what you offered, would they be able to answer quickly and clearly? If not, perhaps that's a sign you need to work on this principle.Cultivate your brand positioningWhat unique things do you do best that add to your value proposition? How do you differ from your competition? These are questions to consider, for the more unique your offer is in your niche, the more you may find clients that work with you because you're so different. If your brand doesn't have much unique value, perhaps reflecting on how you can grow as a business and person would be helpful.


Have other people talk about your services and brandCollecting and showcasing testimonials is a great way to build trust with your leads and prospects. However, beyond just featuring your past clients on your social media or landing pages, an excellent way to generate social proof is by getting featured on the news. By having articles written and published about you in different news outlets, you can again increase your trust in your clients, thus increasing their chances of converting into paying customers.Getting different news features under my belt has undoubtedly opened many doors for me. I've since found it easier to sell products, get hired, land speaking engagements and generally attract higher-quality clients. Not only am I perceived as more of an authority in my niche, but I can also have a broader impact since more people trust my brand with my social proof.Invest in your public relations strategyHaving multiple ways to communicate with the public is vital to increasing the credibility, reach and accessibility of our brands. Being strategic is necessary as not all messages are suited for all mediums. Some things are best said in a press release, while others are on a social media post or website landing page. Hosting events and press conferences can also be great ways to communicate with our desired audiences.Typically, our public relations strategies are put in place to achieve one of two things — to build hype and credibility in a brand or to protect the brand's long-term reputation. Either way, an effective public relations strategy can make our brands more resilient, notable and trustworthy in the eyes of our prospects and general audiences.


Growing a brand can be a daunting task for anyone. There are many ways to achieve the same ends, and we often can lose sight of our customers' perceptions while trying to balance growth under whatever constraints we may have. However, we business owners are servants to the human nature of our prospects and clients. The brands that more deeply understand and appeal to said human nature are the ones that end up being more successful and magnetizing. Hopefully, you can apply the principles described here to your business and watch as you find new paying customers quickly and gracefully.

78,5 Ways HR Can Drive Success In Today's Turbulent Times,"Jul 7, 2023",Jesse Meschuk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-ways-hr-can-drive-success-in-todays-turbulent-times/454647,"
We live in an era in which the role of human resources is often challenged: media reports routinely fawn over the ability of artificial intelligence to replicate many ""traditional"" HR tasks, the move to remote work (and the switch back) has many HR teams struggling to find their place to support shifting workplace cultures, limited people budgets have required increasingly difficult choices and the weakened economy have left many HR teams with skeleton crews, many of which report they are stressed out - and burned out.Against this backdrop, now is an excellent time to take stock of the future of human resources. In this age of turbulence and transformation, how and where can HR teams focus on making the most significant impact on their organization?1. Build Employee Commitment - From Day OneHR is traditionally the first point of contact for newly hired employees, but the experience can often be underwhelming. The tasks associated with onboarding are often mundane and standardized.



In the last few years, many companies have focused on maximizing engagement and excitement by sending or providing employees with company merchandise, notes from their CEOs, or even decorations for their home office. These steps help make an employee feel welcome but don't drive real commitment.Outside of the C suite, HR is the department best positioned to help new employees understand why their company exists and how it contributes to society while building commitment around the kind of corporate culture and initiatives the organization is driving. It takes more than words on a screen to communicate whether employees have bought into a company's broader purpose.


Focus on ways to help every employee understand their role in bringing the company's purpose to life, showing employees why the work they do will matter every day in the lives of others, ask them to think about how they can help further the mission of your organization and to find ways to improve in that goal constantly. You will jump-start commitment and maximize effort from day one.Related: Watch Out for These 5 Artificial Intelligence Problems in HR2. Relentlessly drive focus to drive resultsIn a constantly shifting world, priorities seem to change quickly. Most employees report they are overwhelmed and don't have the basic time to think — or work — on their given tasks. HR is in a prime position to help organizations drive focus.Job Clarity: ensure every employee clearly understands their role and what is expected of them. Go beyond job descriptions and onboard talent by providing a more robust understanding of their role and how it fits into the broader picture of their respective departments and the company.Goal setting: setting clear, stretch goals that are difficult but achievable can disproportionately drive long-term performance. Set organizational goals using simple communication tools like the ""one-page strategy"" concept articulated by One Page Solutions. Then, cascade these goals to every employee. Calibrate goals to ensure you don't have unintended conflicts, train managers on prioritizing and focus your people on what matters most.A culture of feedback: the best, high-achieving cultures are comfortable giving regular feedback up, down and across the organization to help everyone improve. Train employees on the art and science of feedback: how to make observations first, then assessments, describe impacts and provide ideas to make improvements.3. Pair people with technology and champion the possibilitiesGenerative AI will absolutely transform how work gets done. Embrace it for the benefit of your team, their workload and all employees who will appreciate the responsiveness. Imagine an AI script that walks an employee through a series of choices to pick the most appropriate medical, dental and vision plans during Open Enrollment. Not only does this save time, but it could also be customized based on their specific situation, life events for them or their family, and more. Consider standardized assessments, training tasks and even videos as potential areas to explore with AI.


Related: The Benefits and Drawbacks of AI Integration in HR Departments4. Create global talent plansWork-from-home and remote jobs are likely here to stay, despite the current shift and ask from many leaders coming back into the office regularly. That only underscores the need for corporate leaders, HR included, to go the extra mile to make human connections with remote employees ― and to understand the cost-benefit analysis of remote work.HR teams can help coordinate strategies to add more rigor to the remote work decision process: Which jobs need to be done in the office? Which are better outsourced to lower-cost locations? What locations best fit the work your company needs?HR can help identify lower-cost talent hubs as potential sources for remote work, effectively maximizing an organization's productivity while minimizing expenses. HR should assess if there are clusters of talent that are cheaper and easier to recruit from, but also whether the savings from employing a remote strategy is worth the trade-offs such as in-person oversight, team camaraderie and cohesive workplace culture.

In times of financial stress, pressure can build to push diversity, equity and inclusion practices to the back burner. But an important function of HR teams will always be their ability to apply data to safeguard against implicit bias when hiring and recruiting employees. In the long run, this can be a competitive business advantage.As organizations start to employ talent more globally, it's increasingly important to consider ethnic diversity, understand different cultures and learn how best to work with people from unfamiliar backgrounds.

From optimizing your website for an influx of traffic to updating your social media profiles, we'll cover the key areas you need to focus on to ensure your brand is ready to shine when the spotlight hits.Related: 3 Step Process to Get Exposure and Press Coverage for Your Business



Preparing your website for increased trafficYour website is your brand's home base. It needs to be ready to handle an increase in traffic without crashing. Check with your hosting provider to ensure your plan can handle a surge in traffic. If necessary, consider upgrading to a plan with more bandwidth.The website design should be user-friendly, with straightforward navigation to important pages like product details, your ""About Us"" page and your contact information page. Load times should be quick, as slow websites can deter potential customers. Use tools like Google Page Speed Insights to check your site's speed and get specific recommendations for improvement on your site.


In today's mobile-first world, ensuring your website is mobile-friendly is not just an option but a necessity. A responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes is essential. To make your website more mobile-friendly, consider the following:Simplify your design: A cluttered website can be challenging to navigate on a small screen. Keep your design clean and simple, with plenty of white space.Make buttons and links large enough to be easily tapped with a finger.Use larger font sizes: Small text can be hard to read on a mobile screen.Test your website on various devices: Use tools like Google's Mobile-Friendly Test to see how your site performs and get specific recommendations for improvement.Also, consider adding a FAQ section to address common questions and reduce the load on your customer service team.Optimizing your product listingsNational media exposure can significantly increase traffic to your product listings, whether on Amazon, your website or another platform. Optimizing your listings is crucial to make the most of this opportunity.For Amazon listings, begin with a compelling product title incorporating relevant keywords. This enhances your product's visibility in search results and helps it stand out in the crowded marketplace.


High-quality images are also vital. Showcase your product from multiple angles, including close-ups to emphasize unique features and depict the product in use to provide potential customers with a comprehensive understanding of what they're purchasing.In addition to images, Amazon's A+ Content is a powerful tool for enhancing your product listings. This feature allows you to add additional images, comparison charts and more detailed product descriptions. Use it to tell a compelling story about your product and brand, enticing shoppers to add-to-cart.The bullet points on your product detail page should be clear, concise, and packed with valuable information. Optimize them for Amazon SEO by including relevant keywords but remember to keep them shopper friendly. These bullet points often form a customer's first impression of your product, so make them count.For product listings on other platforms, the same principles apply. Use high-quality images, write compelling descriptions and incorporate relevant keywords. Ensure your product listings are easy to find and navigate and provide all the information a customer might need to purchase.


Here is some additional context for optimizing your product listings on various platforms:Use clear and concise titles: Your product title should be descriptive and include the most important information about your product.Write detailed product descriptions: Your product description should tell a story. It should highlight the features and benefits of your product and explain why it's better than the competition.Use high-quality images: Images are often the first thing a customer sees, so make sure they're high-quality and showcase your product effectively. Include multiple images from different angles and consider using videos.SEO quick tips: Use relevant keywords in your product titles and descriptions to improve your search engine rankings. However, avoid keyword stuffing, which can harm your rankings and make your listings less appealing to customers.By optimizing your product listings, you can improve their visibility and capitalize on the influx of attention due to your national media exposure.Related: How to Optimize Your Site for Search Without Actually Doing SEOMaintaining consistent brand messaging across platformsConsistency is key when it comes to branding. It's essential that your brand messaging and visual patterns remain uniform across all platforms — be it your website, Amazon listings or social media profiles. This creates a unified brand experience, reinforcing your brand identity every time a potential customer interacts with you, regardless of the platform.


Start by ensuring your brand's voice is the same on every channel. This voice should reflect your brand's personality and values. For example, if your brand is playful and youthful, your voice might be informal and energetic. This voice should stay that way across all platforms, from the tone of your social media posts to the language in your product descriptions.Next, consider your visual branding. This includes your logo, color scheme, typography and recurring design elements. These should be consistent across all platforms to create a recognizable brand pattern. For instance, if your brand uses a particular shade of blue in its logo, that shade should appear in your social media graphics, website design and even your product packaging.Consistent branding not only helps increase brand recognition but also builds trust. It shows that your brand is professional, reliable and focused. It also makes your brand more memorable. When your brand messaging and visuals are consistent, they leave a stronger impression, making it easier for potential customers to remember your brand.Remember, every interaction a potential customer has with your brand is an opportunity to reinforce your brand identity. Maintaining consistent brand patterns and messaging across platforms allows you to make the most of these opportunities and build a strong, recognizable brand.


Setting up coupons and discounts properlyCoupons and discounts can be a great way to convert interested visitors into customers. However, it's crucial to set these up properly. Avoid allowing shoppers to coupon stack to avoid unexpected losses unless that's part of your strategy. Ensure the terms and conditions for each discount are clear to prevent confusion. Set expiration dates for your coupons to create a sense of urgency.Promote your discounts effectively through social media, email newsletters and on your website. Consider using a countdown timer for limited-time offers to increase the sense of urgency. Also, track the performance of your discounts to understand which ones are most effective and why. This will help you refine your discount strategy over time.Updating your social media profilesSocial media is often the first place people go to learn more about a brand they've seen in the media. Make sure your profiles are up-to-date and reflect your brand accurately. This includes your bio, profile pictures, and any pinned posts. Your bio should communicate what your brand is about and what makes it unique.Regularly post engaging content and interact with your followers to build a strong online community. Use a consistent tone of voice that aligns with your brand personality. Respond promptly to comments and messages, showing your audience you value their engagement.


Consider using social media management tools to schedule posts and monitor your brand mentions. This will help you maintain a consistent posting schedule and stay on top of any conversations about your brand.Related: How to Create a Standout Social-Media ProfileWhy preparation is essentialNational media exposure can be a game-changer for consumer brands, but only if you're prepared to make the most of it.

80,3 PR Strategies to Help Your Startup Attract Investors,"Jun 29, 2023",Evgeniya Zaslavskaya,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-pr-tips-to-help-your-startup-attract-investors/454234,"
Launching a product is a thrilling milestone for any startup. And it's the most obvious time to use PR to support your quest for world domination, along with the impending funding announcement that will no doubt follow. But what if you have a pre-launch startup?For example, Airbnb used press releases to generate buzz about its platform before it even launched. The company's first press release, issued in 2008, announced the launch of its website and invited people to sign up as hosts or guests. And in April 2009, Airbnb received $600,000 from Sequoia Capital, which was a turning point for the future market leader.My PR agency works not only with startups but also with venture capital and hedge funds. They all say in one voice: Media presence matters. Of course, articles alone won't pave the way for you to succeed. Investors consider a variety of factors when making decisions. Still, a personal brand and unique expertise that attracts the attention of the top-tier media helps to build investor confidence in you, laying the bricks for future growth.



So, here are the strategies you can employ to use PR to land funding without ruining your chances of being covered at launch.Related: How PR Can Attract Investors and Add Value to Your Startup


1. Define your target audienceBefore diving into the deep end of PR, take a moment to understand your target audience, just as you might research who's at your poker tournament table before you play. Who are they? What are their pain points? How does your product solve their problems?Identifying your future clients' needs and preferences will inform your PR strategy and help attract investors with a vested interest in your product's success.Remember, investors themselves are also part of your target audience, so you need to know what matters to them. A tip: VC companies receive more than 1,000 proposals a year and are primarily interested in businesses that require an investment of at least $250,000, as stated in Embroker. According to Harvard Business Review, more than 30% of deals come from leads from VCs' former colleagues or work acquaintances. Other contacts also play a role: 20% of deals come from referrals by other investors, and 8% from referrals by existing portfolio companies.Building your brand as a founder, and becoming the champion in your niche, is a great way to be referred, talked about, and strengthen a VC's view of your team — a metric that remains top of mind for potential investors.


2. Use all types of PR, and not just the obvious onesWhile much attention is paid to product launches and funding announcements, there are many other types of PR a pre-launch startup can leverage.Data stories, where you use the millions (or billions) of data points needed to make your solution work to find interesting, and often contrarian, insights, are massively underused. If you have data showing that a situation is much better or worse than the understood norms, there's a story in that.By offering data stories to tech publications as guest articles, you'll raise your position on the leaderboard of known subject experts, which will strengthen an investor's view of you and your team.Expert commentary is also underused and can be a great way to introduce yourself to your target journalists. By offering quotes on the day's topic, while in your particular niche, you can get your name in lights and be seen as a guiding voice. By the way, one study shows that PR campaigns that include an expert comment in the original press release have 64% more placements than those that do not — so don't underestimate commentary power.


They say content is queen and king. With strategic content marketing, such as blog posts, videos and podcasts, you can cleverly sprinkle keywords related to your company throughout your material. This not only pleases the SEO gods but also positions your company as a wise sage in the industry.For example, the painting app Procreate created a YouTube beginner's artist series, which gave it a way to attract new users. And thanks to transcription and wise SEO choices, this made them a name in that artistic niche.Self-publishing is a great way to build a platform that backs up your expert credentials, including in the eyes of investors. You can publish on LinkedIn, Medium and Substack, for example. And consistency is key. Try to have a new commentary on your niche topic at least once a week.Just be careful not to announce your startup or talk about your product, or journalists won't want to write about your launch when you're ready to open the floodgates because you already made the announcement yourself.


Related: 5 Effective Thought Leadership PR Tactics for Your Startup3. Journalists hold the keys, so get to know themJournalists and reporters are like gatekeepers to the arena of media. To capture their attention, establish relationships before your product launch on social media, share insights and offer exclusives. Remember, a little flattery never hurts, either.Be aware of the sheer amount of competition you'll face. Top-tier tech journalists receive 100-400 pitches daily from startups that want them to write their stories. It's often critical, and always wise, to have experienced people working for you when attempting to gain media coverage.According to HubSpot Blog Research, the most effective pitches are personalized to each recipient's interests. So, customize your pitches, show genuine interest in their work, and make them feel like they're an integral part of your journey.


Investors crave trust like plants crave sunlight. You can build a fortress of trust around your territory by strategically promoting positive stories, sharing tales of triumph and showcasing your expertise.PR can make a splash before you're ready to jumpLaunching a product is like jumping off a diving board — exciting and nerve-wracking all at once. But with a well-crafted PR strategy, you can make a big splash and catch the attention of both your future customers and potential investors.Understanding them is crucial for effective PR, so identify their needs first. Leverage data stories and expert commentary for media attention, use content marketing and self-publishing, and engage with journalists to enhance visibility — and don't forget about personalized pitches to build relationships and aid media coverage.After all, trust is key to winning investors, especially for a pre-launch startup, so use every tactic in the game to promote positive stories and showcase your expertise.

81,Why a Solid HR Infrastructure is a Must-Have for Business Growth,"Jun 29, 2023",Steve Arizpe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-a-robust-hr-infrastructure-is-crucial-for-business/454388,"
While it is a well-known fact that entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized business (SMB) leaders wear many hats and juggle numerous plates due to their size, it can be easy for them to become laser-focused on their products, services and customer base as they build their company, possibly dropping the most important plate – human resources (HR).As savvy business leaders and industry experts continue to emphasize the importance of implementing an HR infrastructure, especially one that is more robust that lays the groundwork for attracting and retaining top talent, it can be perceived as an overwhelming task, which may rank as a low priority that leaves companies vulnerable as they plan for growth.Related: Good Customer Service is a Disappearing Art — Here's How You Can Be Different



A robust HR program that makes a difference — handled in-house or by an external HR company — is a must-have component in today's business environment. As SMB leaders weigh their options, three things to keep in mind include:1. People are the greatest assetPeople are the foundation of success at all company levels. They are indispensable and often make or break a business. Employees are the ones who have intricate knowledge of a company's products/services; they are on the front lines interacting with clients and potential customers; and employees given the freedom to be intrapreneurs are often responsible for developing new products, services and processes that affect change and growth within a company.


The impact of people on a business cannot be overstated – without people, there is no business – they are an integral part of every facet of business operations. From initial customer contact and daily nurturing programs to product/service development and high-performing leadership, people are the greatest asset to business growth and ongoing success.It takes the right people in the right positions working for the right company to make a difference. This begins with a robust HR program that incorporates effective and efficient recruiting and hiring practices that attract qualified candidates based on a company's purpose, mission, corporate values and job qualifications, which may indicate they have a similar outlook and will be a great fit for the culture and role.While recruiting and hiring practices continue to evolve, one of the best ways to find top talent is through an employee referral program that offers monetary rewards for new hires. Employees serve as brand ambassadors who tout the benefits of working for a company to their network of like-minded connections. This saves recruiters time and money and helps new hires feel more comfortable and tied to a company with familiar faces in the workforce. An employee referral program should be a part of all HR programs.Related: 4 Ways to Make Sure Your Employees Are Your Best Asset


2. Culture is keyWhen entrepreneurs and SMB leaders adhere to the philosophy that people are a company's greatest asset, it goes without saying that creating and nurturing a culture that takes care of them should be a top priority. A culture that puts people first in all areas, including attracting, recruiting, onboarding, training, employee benefits, performance management, career development and recognition, is creating an environment that results in increased employee engagement and high levels of employee retention for long-term careers within a company.When companies take care of their people, there is a trickle-down effect, and everything else falls into place because happy employees typically display discretionary efforts and often consider their jobs as a calling, which leads to a stronger culture and greater growth opportunities.As SMB leaders take care of their people with robust HR initiatives, some tried-and-true components that should be part of the program include generous PTO, flexible schedules, competitive compensation packages, top-notch healthcare, training or upskilling opportunities, performance management, career planning, mentoring plans, tuition reimbursement, EAPs with mental health and wellness components, financial fitness plans, community involvement opportunities and employee recognition programs.When companies address employees' holistic wants and needs, from career and finances to health and community, workers feel more valued and content, freeing them to focus on their daily responsibilities. This creates a stronger culture that sets the stage for dedicated employees, increased engagement and greater employee retention that leads to company growth.


3. HR is dynamicSavvy leaders understand HR is a dynamic discipline that has dramatically risen in prominence through the years, constantly changing to meet the needs of an evolving workforce and the companies it serves. HR infrastructure should be tailored and refined to meet the needs of a company, as opposed to a stagnant, one-size-fits-all solution. When leaders work with in-house or external HR teams, they should develop a strategy that serves their needs and is scalable for future growth – always putting their people first.HR technology has played a significant role in dynamic HR that complements the human touch and should be part of a robust HR infrastructure. HR technology not only benefits HR departments with time/cost savings and greater employee insights, but it also streamlines processes for new hires and employees, providing consistent best practices across the company.From payroll processing, people analytics and performance reviews to onboarding, benefits enrollment and online training, HR technology leads to greater efficiencies and increased employee retention and performance.While a robust HR infrastructure is necessary for employee retention and the growth of a business, it should be viewed as a welcome addition to business operations because it helps leaders scale their business with consistent best practices and procedures efficiently to help companies take care of their people. As SMB leaders build their companies, it behooves them to implement an HR infrastructure that makes a difference.

82,Your PR Is Doomed Without a Consistent Digital Strategy. Here's Why.,"Jun 27, 2023",Evgeniya Zaslavskaya,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-your-pr-is-doomed-without-a-consistent-digital-strategy/453030,"
As a head of a PR agency, I'm often reached out to by brands asking me to launch a full-scale digital PR campaign. Rather unexpectedly for them, sometimes I decline or suggest they push their plans back a bit.The reason is that I firmly believe PR won't make sense if a brand hasn't established a solid digital strategy. Getting featured in some top-tier media is nice, but it won't necessarily result in many new leads, increased online visibility and skyrocketing revenue. Top-tier publications alone won't bring you clients or brand awareness, especially for brands that hardly have any digital presence.Imagine you've got a car and want to level it up and tune it. Ah, the neon lights and shiny car rims. Are you good to go? Maybe. Only if you are certain that all the rest performs well. Gear unit, engine, headlights — are you sure these work fine? PR is the tuning that you make while ignoring all the rest.



The ""Featured in top-tier media"" bar on your website is good, but it won't matter if this is not part of your consistent digital presence strategy.Related: How to Improve Your Business' Digital Presence


Think long-term, and align efforts with other teamsIncluding PR in the long-term digital marketing strategy is the number one thing I recommend to the brands. Pavel Katz, CEO of growth marketing agency Digital Bands, also emphasizes the importance of having a content strategy that covers all digital channels and making sure PR publications are aligned with it: ""Outline a very particular content plan with specific dates and leave some place for the unscheduled posts and announcements. Press releases and planned publications should be reflected in it too. I know this sounds like quite a lot of work for several teams, but this will take your digital marketing efforts to the next level.""Things only start here. After the content strategy is ready, there are a number of other steps that will help brands enhance PR efforts.Talk to sales. Talk to marketing. Talk to SEO and business development teams. Your digital presence might diverge unless your efforts align with the other departments. Tip: Schedule a call with a sales/business development lead, and ask them to help you map a buying persona. That'll help you know [rather than guess] who your target audience is. Even if you do B2B, there's always a particular person behind this ""B"" who will decide whether to cooperate with you. Know the pains of this person, address them, talk to them, and help make a well-informed decision through PR.Level up your socialsAlong with the PR publications, social media is your brand's front face, which clients and other stakeholders judge you upon. Ensure your online reputation strategy syncs with the PR and social media teams. Hints: Agree on the tone of voice, discuss crisis management steps in advance, and discuss what kind of brand image you broadcast through socials and PR efforts.


Don't forget to show your PR publications to your social media audience. You can launch a paid social campaign that showcases the PR mentions and target a particular audience that you'd like to see your posts. It allows you to increase your PR reach and tweak the ad displays as per your targets. For example, you can show Facebook ads with a PR mention to people who submitted requests on your website. It also doubles as a solution to an eternal PR metrics problem: You can track how many people have seen and engaged with your publication through such ads.For instance, after my previous article was featured in Entrepreneur, I posted a link to it on my LinkedIn along with a catchy intro that encourages my connections to read the entire post (you can do better than ""I was featured in /media/, read the entire piece here,"" but most intros do boil down to that). Journalists appreciate when their pieces are placed on social media and get additional coverage. I noticed it got decent traction and engagement from my colleagues and friends, so I launched a small-scale paid social ads campaign on LinkedIn, which gave my post a proper boost. It's a win-win for me and the media: The article is seen more often, gets more hits, and I can track down how many people saw my feature.Related: 3 Ways to Build an Online Presence With Social MediaTechnicalities and HyPRlinksAudit and fix your website. That's an art in itself, but leveraging Google Analytics is a good start. This way, you can identify how your website performs and what can be improved. Example: We had a client whose website sucked when it came to its technical performance; it just didn't load quickly enough. All the hreflangs, XMLs, javascripts and other front- and back-end incantations might damage your website performance and hence hurdle PR. No one wants to deal with trudging through sloppy pages.


Digital PR implies media linking to your website; thus, exploring your current backlink profile makes sense. You need to know which websites have already linked to you to gain momentum by securing new links. Often, links from niche websites will get you more reach than from top media.You can use SEO tools for both technical website audit and backlink profile exploration. These may seem tricky, but as I advised earlier, you've talked to the SEO team, right? PR + SEO is a secret weapon neglected by 9 out of 10 PR specialists I speak to, so be among the few who use it.Take your timeAs I mentioned in the beginning, I often advise my clients not to start the PR campaign right away. After all, the odds are they won't even need PR at their current stage, and it's fine. Sometimes we prefer to ramp up our efforts gradually, and the first steps can be pretty straightforward. Linking back to your website in your YouTube video descriptions is PR, too. Asking a partner you've cooperated with to announce your cooperation on their social media also matters.It'll be much easier to gain traction in the media you want to be featured in if your overall digital presence is solid and your brand's digital efforts are aligned. There are no details that won't matter. Before you make it to the main page of the media you dream about, you've got to do your digital homework.

83,5 Common Misconceptions About Public Relations,"Jun 23, 2023",Aidan Sowa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/debunking-5-common-misconceptions-about-public-relations/453041,"
Public relations (PR) plays a pivotal role in shaping a company's image, managing its reputation and building strong relationships with stakeholders. However, there are several misconceptions surrounding the field of public relations that can hinder entrepreneurs from fully leveraging its power.In this article, we aim to debunk some of the most common misunderstandings about public relations, shedding light on its true value and potential for entrepreneurial success.Related: 3 PR Myths Hurting Your Business



Misconception #1: Public relations is just about media coverageThere's a prevalent misunderstanding when it comes to the realm of public relations: That it's exclusively about securing coverage in the media. Indeed, engaging with the media plays a fundamental role in the toolkit of a PR professional; however, it's merely a part of the broader spectrum of responsibilities encompassed within this field.To begin with, public relations is essentially about strategic communication. It's the process of meticulously planning, executing and managing communication between an organization and its various stakeholders, including employees, customers, shareholders and the wider community. In a world where information is rapidly disseminated and readily available, strategic communication is crucial to ensure that the right message reaches the right audience at the right time. This may involve everything from crafting compelling brand narratives and key messages to developing comprehensive communication plans for product launches or corporate announcements.


Moreover, public relations plays a vital role in managing a brand's reputation. In this digital age, a company's reputation can be made or broken within minutes, thanks to the power of social media and online reviews. As such, PR professionals must constantly monitor public sentiment and be prepared to take swift action to mitigate any potential damage to the brand's image. This involves not just reactive measures — like crisis communication and response — but also proactive steps, such as corporate social responsibility initiatives and transparency in business practices.Furthermore, public relations extends into the arena of community engagement. PR practitioners understand the value of forging strong relationships with the community in which the organization operates. Through initiatives such as volunteering, sponsorships and local events, they work to position the brand as a responsible and engaged member of the community. Such efforts not only enhance the brand's reputation but also strengthen its relationship with the local market.Stakeholder relations is another crucial facet of public relations. Every organization interacts with a myriad of stakeholders, from employees and customers to shareholders and regulators. Each of these groups has unique interests and concerns, and PR professionals play a key role in addressing these. They facilitate open and effective communication between the organization and its stakeholders, helping to build trust and foster strong relationships.Public relations also involves working with influencers and thought leaders to bolster a brand's credibility and reach. In today's connected world, influencers can have a significant impact on consumer perception and behavior. PR professionals, therefore, seek to cultivate positive relationships with these individuals and leverage their influence to benefit the brand.


Misconception #2: Public relations is only for established companiesAnother common misunderstanding is that public relations is reserved for large, established companies with substantial budgets. In reality, public relations can benefit businesses of all sizes, including startups and entrepreneurs. Effective PR can help small businesses gain visibility, build credibility, attract investors and engage with their target audience. By crafting compelling stories, leveraging social media and building relationships with relevant influencers, entrepreneurs can effectively position their ventures in the market and compete with larger competitors.Related: 4 Guiding Principles for Building and Deploying a Great PR StrategyMisconception #3: Public relations guarantees immediate resultsOne of the most persistent misconceptions about public relations is that it yields instant and guaranteed results. PR is a long-term strategy that requires consistent effort, relationship-building and adaptability. While well-executed PR campaigns can generate significant buzz and media attention, it takes time to build brand awareness, establish credibility and nurture relationships with key stakeholders. Entrepreneurs must understand that PR is an ongoing process that requires patience, perseverance and a willingness to adapt strategies as needed.Misconception #4: Public relations and advertising are the samePublic relations and advertising are often mistakenly used interchangeably. However, they are distinct disciplines with different objectives and approaches. Advertising involves paying for media space to promote a product or service, while PR focuses on earning media coverage through strategic storytelling and relationship-building. PR helps build trust and credibility by leveraging third-party endorsements, whereas advertising relies on direct messaging and controlled brand communication. Integrating both disciplines can yield powerful results, but it's essential to understand their unique roles and strengths.

While PR professionals can help shape public perception and navigate difficult situations, they cannot fix deep-rooted operational or product issues. Entrepreneurs should not solely rely on PR to address underlying problems but rather ensure their business fundamentals are sound. By aligning PR efforts with a solid foundation, entrepreneurs can leverage PR as a strategic asset to support their overall business objectives.Public relations is a multifaceted discipline that goes beyond securing media coverage. Entrepreneurs must dispel common misconceptions and recognize the true value of PR as a strategic asset for building a strong brand, managing reputation and engaging with stakeholders. By understanding the broader scope of PR, entrepreneurs can harness its power to gain visibility, establish credibility and ultimately drive business growth. As with any business endeavor, success in public relations requires a proactive and strategic approach, continuous effort and a deep understanding of the target audience.

84,How Real Estate Agents Can Effectively Leverage the Power of Public Relations,"Jun 23, 2023",Aidan Sowa,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-real-estate-agents-can-leverage-the-power-of-public/453043,"

85,How AI Can Augment Human Creativity with Efficiency,"Jun 23, 2023",Zach Cutler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-generative-ai-can-augment-human-creativity-in-pr/454000,"
As the co-founder and CEO of Propel PRM, a public relations management (PRM) platform, I have had firsthand the transformative impact of AI-driven technology on the PR industry. Indeed, one of the most exciting developments in the past few months has been the rise of generative AI platforms enabling PR professionals to work more efficiently and more effectively.People in communications are quickly adapting to the use of generative AI, and the technology seems to portend a major shift in how corporate communications will be done going forward.Related: Why Are So Many Companies Afraid of Generative AI?



What does it do?At its core, generative AI enables machine learning algorithms to generate new content based on existing data sets. In PR, this means that AI is used to create first drafts of press releases and pitches and importantly for people in communications, media list building. This is because media list building requires in-depth knowledge of the journalistic landscape to understand who to pitch to, but it also takes up the vast majority of a person in PR's day.Generative AI trained on large language models (LLMs) can automate these core communications tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data and information from across the internet within seconds, identifying patterns and trends that human comms professionals might miss. By being able to tell people in PR, with near pin-point accuracy, how they will be able to create the most impact for their organizations, using these generative AI tools ultimately leads to more effective and targeted PR campaigns.


How is it used today?The datasets being leveraged to enable generative AI to alleviate the work of PR pros varies depending on the needs of the PR campaign. For example, AI might analyze social media data to identify trending topics and create tailored content, look through previous articles to understand what a journalist is most likely to write about and whether they would be a good fit for a particular media list, find similar journalists who would be interested in receiving a particular pitch or press release, or simply look at data from successful pitches to understand the most effective way to structure a pitch for maximum effect.Of course, as with any new technology, there are concerns about how these algorithms will change the PR industry. One is that AI-generated content might lack the creativity and nuance of content created by humans, make mistakes, or create inappropriate or offensive content. While these are valid concerns, they can be mitigated by ensuring that AI models are trained adequately on good datasets and, most importantly, that the results are curated and edited by living, breathing human PR professionals.Related: How to Leverage Artificial Intelligence in Public RelationsPeople have the powerOne of the best ways to work with AI and ensure that the communications professional gets the best results is by treating any created outputs as a first draft. Anyone using this technology must understand the risks of using it and therefore needs to edit any output they receive from an AI-powered generator. And yet, despite this need for editing, I've found that AI can still get 70% of the legwork done when it comes to creating content. However, that remaining human-driven 30% really turns a good first draft into a strong, compelling final product.


Another worry is that AI might replace human PR professionals altogether. While it's true that technology can automate many of the more mundane tasks in communications, humans will always be required for the strategic work and relationship-building inherent to the job. Therefore, I believe that human expertise and intuition will always be essential in the PR industry, but AI will enable PR professionals to work more efficiently and effectively.Of course, AI models will become more sophisticated and better at analyzing complex data sets as development continues, and they will be able to generate more targeted, nuanced and effective content in achieving PR goals. At the same time, human PR professionals will continue to play the critical role of crafting the messaging and strategy, building relationships and providing strategic guidance.Ultimately, the successful integration of generative AI into the average PR professional's workflow will depend heavily on the collaboration and partnership between human communications professionals and AI algorithms. Only by working together can PR people leverage AI's power to achieve their goals while ensuring that the content they create is ethical, practical, and aligned with their values and objectives. I'm excited about the opportunities that generative AI presents, and I believe that by embracing this technology, we can create more successful PR campaigns that benefit our clients and society.

86,I Accidentally Became a Successful Entrepreneur. Here Are 5 Mistakes I Learned to Avoid When Starting a Business,"Jun 8, 2023",Emily Reynolds Bergh,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-mistakes-to-avoid-when-starting-a-business/452538,"
I hardly know how I got to be a boss in the first place. Though I'm a public relations specialist now, I actually earned degrees in philosophy, psychology and social work. My future sights were set on making the world a cheerier place; I suppose, one trip abroad, one unexpected adventure and one conversation at a time. I intended to travel forever, meet as many people as possible, and somehow land a career that would endlessly feed my endless curiosity.A book I was invited to co-author in grad school, Beyond Burning Bras, sparked an interest in writing, and before long, I found myself with a food-writing gig at Taste magazine in Texas, which led to a few more related freelance projects.But the next thing I knew, I was a divorced mother of two with no financial support and no full-time job, so much for cheery. Desperation led me to take the first offer I got at a PR firm in Austin, and that was the turning point after which I never looked back.



Looking forward a few years later, I felt compelled by some unknown force to venture out on my own. I had no idea how to pay the rent, but I strongly desired to apply what I'd learned thus far — namely, the power of telling stories. Of hearing stories. Of sharing stories.PR is nothing if not storytelling, and my own story has been fraught with as many pitfalls as triumphs. Now that I'm comfortably situated on the perch of my own firm — surrounded by an incredible team, with a different husband and with three more kids added to the mix — here's a handful of invaluable ""do not"" lessons for aspiring entrepreneurs that I learned from falling down the ladder I climbed.


The five biggest missteps in starting your own businessMisstep #1: Launching a company without a business plan. Even though I had a few marketing courses under my belt, I had absolutely no business knowledge when I opened up shop. How many hours would I need to work weekly to get my startup off the ground? What essential staff did I need to have in place? What metrics would indicate growth? Clueless, I had to learn all this by trial and error (mostly by error). Get a clue. Write up a plan.Related: How to Write a Business PlanMisstep #2: Starting a business with no capital. I had no money when I went out on my own. Zilch. I crashed into some — literally — when I totaled my car and got $15,000 for it. Don't do that. Don't count on a miracle, a big casino win or a lawsuit to fund your business. Prioritize the cost of living for your family and wait to hang your shingle until you have enough seed money saved up or have secured a reasonable line of credit.Misstep #3: Hiring too fast. As soon as I had enough business to bring on support staff, I did so frantically and rather indiscriminately. See, it was a catch-22: I couldn't deliver on the client contract until I had enough personnel on board, but I couldn't hire the personnel until the contract was in place. So I was always rushing to fill spots and find specialists.


I remember seeing a post on Facebook one day: ""I cannot believe my boss just hired me after one day of interning."" Guess who the boss was? Eventually, a mentor of mine gave me a game-changing nugget of advice: ""Hire slow, fire fast,"" instead of the other way around.Related: Three Hiring Mistakes Hurting Your BusinessMisstep #4: Taking out a $100K loan for someone else's expertise. I can admit it now: I was a terrible boss in the beginning. I was calling my team at all hours of the day and night, expecting so much of them without providing any direction or training. In turn, their output was disappointing, and they were exiting faster than I could replace them.I realized I needed help learning how to be a boss, and I convinced myself that paying my friend's husband a massive fee for his business coaching was something I should do. Ultimately, it was just too great an investment for skills I eventually would have learned on my own if I'd just been more equipped from the get-go (see misstep #1). Be prepared before you leap … and you won't have to pay someone else to catch you when you fall.


Related: How to Utilize Public Relations Without Sacrificing Your Own NarrativeMisstep #5: Trying to cover all the bases, playing all positions. When I started, I offered too many skills to potential clients, figuring the more services I provided, the better my chances of landing them: marketing, PR, brand development, advertising, promotion — you name it, I'd sell it.But if you try to do too many things, you'll never gain mastery over just one. I remember pitching to a large hotel group once, and the CEO told me he'd settled on my firm because I'd presented on only PR. From that day on, I decided PR would be our primary specialty area, and to this day, it constitutes 90% of my business.Yeah, I had more than my share of slipups on my entrepreneurial path. But through it all, I've been driven by three things: Social connection is my muse. Creating community is my motivation. And scripting stories is my mojo.


It's challenging raising five kids (not an exaggeration either; at last count, that's how many heads were at the dinner table), coaching sports teams and serving on several boards while running a five-city PR firm out of my home office. But I've never shied away from challenges — they got me where I am today … and I really like the view from here.

How does a PR team create business credibility?For clients and customers to invest their time and money into your business, they need to trust you.

Maintaining a trustworthy and credible reputation means that new clients won't hesitate to employ your services or purchase your products. So, how does a business like yours become ""reputable""?A PR team creates connections with existing, reputable media outlets to promote your business. They generate content, typically a guest blog or feature, that is sent to magazines, journals and other outlets to be posted and shared with an established readership.

A PR team will leverage their existing connections and forge new ones to place information about your business with a reputable podcaster or outlet whose audience aligns with your brand's aesthetics, goals and values.


Sharing your brand's storySharing your brand's story means connecting with your intended audience through the narrative you create around your brand. This narrative can include your history, values, goals and more. It helps new and existing customers understand who you are as a company and why they should invest their time and money in you. Podcasts and blog features can be a great way to tell your brand's story in a longer format. Telling your brand's story gives clients something to root for, an ethos that compels them to stick around with your company. Part of having a PR team is their ability to use outreach to expand your audience while making your business appear legitimate and credible.This is an excellent opportunity to talk about your brand's mission, involvement with social activism, core values, or modes of sustainability/ethical consumption utilized by your brand. Some customers and clients look for these aspects before deciding to make a purchase.Building positive relationshipsPR also aids in forming positive relationships with your potential and current customers. Part of confirming that you are a reputable business and crafting a narrative surrounding that business is so that your clients return to your company, not your competitor. You want people to be aware of your brand and loyal to it.Connecting with existing media outlets, influential individuals and other reputable sources will aid you in promoting and maintaining a thriving business.

88,"In a Downturn, It's Not Enough to Have Good Financials — Brand Visibility Is the New Currency.","Jun 7, 2023",Masha Bucher,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/brand-visibility-is-the-new-currency-heres-how-to/452360,"
As the economic climate continues to fluctuate and uncertainty prevails, the only thing startup founders should be doing is ensuring their survival. In a downturn, having solid financials is not enough — you need to be visible. Without effective visibility and publicity, even the most profitable and financially healthy companies may struggle to attract the attention of potential investors.In more prosperous times, startups could often capitalize on the market as VCs are flush with capital. However, with funds harder to come by, founders must actively seek ways to create a halo effect, induce FOMO (fear of missing out) and signal they're a worthy investment.Time and time again, visibility has proven to be tied to positive financial outcomes and success. I've been asked by many founders how they can generate visibility successfully and quickly, and here are my tips.



Related: How to Increase Your Visibility Online and Attract More ClientsBuild in publicStay connected with your community and consistently update them on your progress. Leverage every single channel in your arsenal (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and TikTok if relevant) to create consistent excitement around revenue traction, noteworthy achievements or milestones and unique insights you've gained while building your business. Challenge yourself to post two to three times per week across all channels. Don't decide between channels — in 2023, you have to execute on all of them. Consistency is key.


Don't forget to highlight your team. Investors should be able to see a strong, capable team behind any startup, not only a leader. I most like the combination of seeing practical tips, insights from team building and team celebrations together with transparent metrics that showcase the direction of the business.Craft a 'David vs. Goliath' narrativeWho is the incumbent in your industry? Challenging the market leader is a high-reward strategy for generating visibility. By taking a contrarian stance or disagreeing with industry giants, you can get a reaction out of investors and other stakeholders and get them to pay attention. Leverage the power of controversy to differentiate yourself from the competition.For example, You.com is an artificial intelligence search engine that's positioned themselves as taking on Google and Microsoft in the current AI arms race and has gotten a lot of attention as a result of it. Sam Altman's contrarian tweet on the role of VC generated almost two million views and got the attention of Vinod Khosla, Paul Graham, Alexis Ohanian and others. Elon Musk is marred in controversy every day but the reality is that people care about his actions.Work with unexpected niche influencersRather than relying on traditional paid campaigns, which can be expensive and often have limited impact, partner with emerging artists and niche influencers to create more creative and engaging content. Louis Vuitton is a stellar example — its recent collaboration with artist Yayoi Kusama was wildly successful as much as it was unexpected, marrying the fashion house's iconic LV logo with Kusama's signature bright polka dots. It was worn by celebrities and enabled both brands to tap into new audiences. I'm surprised tech brands aren't doing similar collaborations.


My advice is to find emerging artists and creatives that are relevant to your niche. Work with them on a campaign or co-host events, dinners and other experiences to showcase your company in an engaging way. I recommend that most campaigns combine a strong collaboration with surprising but relevant influencers together with a top media outlet writing an exclusive.Related: How to Skyrocket Your Business to the Top With Thought Leadership and VisibilityFocus on educating consumersWhen you help consumers become smarter, they'll never forget it. Helping your customers learn and grow will help you create a loyal community that organically spreads the word about your company on social media. Provide educational resources, host workshops and create interactive experiences.For example, Skye, a leadership coaching marketplace, recently hosted their Limitless Summit; speakers included the CEO of Myers Briggs, CEO of Handshake, Meta's director of global L&D, VCs and executive coaches who did workshops on navigating conflict, cultivating culture at scale, the physiology of brain health and wellbeing, building transformational companies and more. By educating consumers and thereby building a meaningful community with high stickiness, this has helped the company attract investors who are not only looking for financial returns but also to support companies that are making a positive impact in the world.


Dress to impress — Go for an unexpected designGo for an unexpected design when it comes to external-facing materials, whether it's your website, pitch deck, marketing collateral, social media posts and others. Specifically for investors, your pitch deck is often the first point of contact. Alongside a fantastic team and promising traction, a visually striking and creatively designed deck and website are sometimes the deciding factors on whether I take a meeting.Consider incorporating bold colors, interactive elements and intuitive navigation to create an engaging user experience that reflects your brand's personality. Remember, in a downturn, standing out is crucial and an unexpected design can be the catalyst that draws investors and customers in.Related: 7 Shortcuts to Build Early Visibility For Your BrandGet out of your bubbleHost events and invite people from unexpected diverse backgrounds to participate in captivating discussions. By inviting speakers and attendees who may not typically be part of your industry or network, unexpected magic can happen. It's not as hard as you'd think: imagine bringing together artists, scientists, actors, photographers and lawyers all together at the table with technologists for a dynamic exchange of ideas and cross-pollination of knowledge. This can lead to new opportunities for collaboration and growth and, most importantly, for inspiration and insights that you'll be remembered for.

89,The Delicate Dance Every HR Person Must Master,"Jun 1, 2023",Victoria Maitland,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-delicate-dance-of-balancing-empathy-and-professionalism/452209,"
Employees hold people in human resources to unique standards but with a weight as heavy as those they hold for a CEO. As HR professionals, we have to hold both the company and the employee at the same time. We need to know which side we must be on and at what time, depending on the situation and how to push back on one side or the other, or both simultaneously. This is the delicate dance HR professionals need to learn to be successful. By practicing the right steps, we can attempt to master it.Related: How HR Professionals Can Effectively Balance the Needs of the Employees and the BusinessBalancing empathy and professionalismIn HR, communication is everything. Without it, people start to fill in the gaps with their own narratives — ""They only care about the bottom line."" An organization without healthy and transparent communication is the prime environment for gossip to thrive, especially in sensitive situations like mergers and acquisitions. Everyone has horror stories, which feed into rumors of job cuts or loss of benefits because ""I know someone who went through the same thing.""



But communication is very nuanced, and HR professionals must appreciate that nuance to communicate and explain with a balance of empathy and professionalism. We often must communicate strategically, giving different audiences the information they need at the right times for the most effective delivery. Otherwise, we may be backed into an uncomfortable corner or say the wrong thing.Know your audience, read the room and bring empathy to every conversation, especially when communicating hard decisions. Behind closed doors with the decision-makers, I might express my feelings about the unfair situation differently. I can be honest, express empathy around the situation and even explain what went wrong to build trust in my advocacy for employees, but I need to balance that with respect for the leadership team at all times, even if they were the cause.


Related: The Core Belief That Drives My HR CareerHow the choreography moves to musicAfter acquiring a company in the UK, we merged the business first, leaving those in the back office to run in parallel until we could complete the process. We had promised everyone could join our benefits plan by the second quarter, and the remaining employees were excited as the date drew near. Unfortunately, we got delayed. Financial, controllership, IT and other system integrations in Brazil caused a backlog, pushing that date to the third quarter.HR had no purview over resolving these issues, and the delay was completely out of our control, but to this group of people, we were going back on everything we had promised.As the one responsible for communicating the decision, I told them the truth: We underestimated the work it would take to get everyone up and running in our systems. In part, this was because the organization had too many manual processes that, I admitted to them, we knew we needed to fix, and I apologized that they got caught up in that.


I struggled to deliver that message — it was not an easy choice. Others might have swept it under the carpet or, worse, given them no explanation. Instead, by delivering the information in a real and transparent way, I showed them a little of the ""behind the curtain"" difficulties of running a global business so they could empathize with the hard realities that happened in that process when different geographies own different parts of the process. As hard as the pill was for them to swallow, they appreciated that I was honest, empathetic to their situation, and willing to apologize.Related: How To Create a Work Culture Where Everyone Has A VoicePractice the steps and danceToeing the line of the company's interests while being an approachable leader that employees go to for support takes social and emotional intelligence and a basic understanding of human psychology and communication.Here are three steps to practice balancing empathy and professionalism to put the ""human"" back in ""human resources"":


Be honest. The HR dance requires communicating with integrity from a place of honesty. We are all human. We don't always have all the answers or control in making decisions, and it's OK to admit that. I have left HR conversations dissatisfied with the answers because they felt canned; dishonest. I want people to come away feeling that they got an honest answer, even if the response is not what they wanted. They may not like it, but they can respect it, knowing they were seen and heard as a person.Trying goes a long way. Even when we know we have little influence over the outcome, if we do our best in a given situation and communicate honestly, saying, ""Let me try,"" can go a long way. I always offer to try when employees come to me asking for more resources or help to manage too much on their plate. With the simple effort of saying, ""I've got you, I see you, I'll try,"" even if I try and come back with no news or bad news, they see HR as their advocate, feel heard and validated, and will respect that I tried.There's a lot of power in an apology. Even in the face of hard decisions and bad news that HR has no power to change, it is amazing how much an apology can make people feel better. When I say, ""I understand this is unfair, and I'm sorry on behalf of the organization it's happening to you. I wish it could be different,"" people hear this as a genuine apology, even without personally taking any blame for other people's decisions. I acknowledge the organization taking responsibility so employees can at least feel respected despite the outcome.Related: Next Time You Apologize, Say More Than 'I'm Sorry.'The more you use these steps with the people on your team, the more they learn to trust they can approach you for help or with feedback, which provides valuable information that we in HR need to do our jobs better. Go into every situation already having thought out how to explain it, offer people a way to ask questions, and be as available and honest as possible. This is how you gain the respect and trust needed to maintain a healthy and loyal team and, ultimately, an organization that trusts HR vs. being gaslighted by them.

90,5 Questions to Ask a PR Pro Before Hiring Them,"May 29, 2023",Anastasia Chernikova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-questions-to-ask-a-pr-professional-before-hiring-them/451835,"
One of the most popular questions from a company hiring a PR agency is what journalist contacts they have and how deep their relationships are.While it's understandable to think this is important, it's not the right question to ask a PR person. Regardless of who they know, they'll only get responses if they bring their contacts a pitch that captures their interest.This means it's far more essential to find someone who can help you proactively source and react to newsworthy topics, generate fresh ideas to position you as a thought leader and assist you with creating angles and high-quality pieces that outlets will be eager to publish.



So, instead of asking who they know, focus on what they know, and ask them these five questions. Each answer will show you what results you can expect and if a particular PR professional is a good fit for your needs.Related: How You Can Help Your Public Relations Provider Help You


1. What angle can you suggest for my story?News agency, Reuters, notes that relevance is the number-one driver of a great story, so another way to put this question would be, ""Why should people care about what I'm saying?""Your piece should be interesting to readers (including the editor or journalist you're pitching to!) and have a unique perspective that makes it stand out from the crowd. The right PR agency should be able to suggest at least broad ideas about your business that can be later tailored to specific publications and will resonate with their readership.2. What is the headline going to be?The headline either grasps attention or loses a reader. Research shows that 80% of people will read a headline, but only about 20% read further than that. There is fierce competition for readers' attention, so putting extra attention on the headline can be the difference between your content getting viral traction or only a few clicks.When deciding whether or not to work with a PR agency, ask them what your story's headline is going to be, and they should be able to produce a few options in a way that grabs your attention and makes you want to keep reading. This will also give you a good idea of what the focus of the story will be and whether it aligns with your business objectives.


Even though it's almost never useful to spend a long time coming up with a headline (editors usually want to make their own), it's a great exercise to filter for the best PR pros who understand both business and journalism.3. What's the news peg we're going to hang our story on?The idea of a ""news peg"" means finding a relevant current event to tie your story to. It's similar to the angle, but it's more like what your angle is going to hook around. For instance, a greentech company could tie a thought leadership piece to an upcoming climate change summit or the ongoing European energy crisis. A cybersecurity company can tie a new product launch to a recent public data breach or call for government regulations on a trendy technology.Finding the right ""peg"" for your story helps to make it timely and relatable. People read the news to have something to talk about with others, so pegging your story to an event is the ideal way to get it shared, read and talked about. Many large publications won't even consider a story without a news peg. Be sure to check if your PR agency is immersed in the relevant news and can offer a way to logically insert you into the agenda.Related: Why You Need A PR Agency and How to Choose One Wisely


4. Which publications are we going to target?When working with a PR agency, you want to make sure they have experience pitching to the publications that are relevant to your business.It's worth mentioning that the agency might not rattle off a list of tier-1 publications, and that's not always a bad thing. It's normal to think that you should always aim for the biggest outlets, but that's not necessarily true. Instead of listening for ""big names only,"" ask them why they chose each outlet, which media formats they plan to focus on and who the readers are.Sometimes, opting for more niche publications can enhance your reach and give you more leverage, boosting your ability to get your story in front of the right people. This is why asking these questions instead can help you gain insight into whether or not they understand your business objectives and how to appeal to your target audience.5. Who are we going to target, and what format will we use?As a writer whose work has appeared in outlets like Forbes, Fast Company and other large publications, I receive pitches every day. I've only written for those magazines as a freelance contributor, but people would suggest opinion pieces to me all the time as if I were an editor who had the power to approve or deny publications for the site.


These pitches show me how little media training PR people have because they don't know the difference between a staff editor, a commissioning editor and a freelance contributor, and the formats they can offer to them. I've even seen these types of emails from people who are working with large consulting agencies. People without any background in journalism rarely understand how newsrooms work, and it leads to major blunders like this, which may get them blocked in journalists' mailboxes.The piece of advice here is to always pick the right editor or reporter to target with your pitch. If it is a news piece, you don't send it to a commissioning editor, and if it is an opinion piece, any reporter would not be a good fit. Study the formats that the people in the newsrooms work with, and try to offer the most relevant piece so that it has the most chances of getting picked and published in the magazine.Related: The 5 Answers You Need Before Hiring a PR Agency

92,How to Stop Your CEO's Reputation From Damaging Your Business,"May 24, 2023",Jennifer Maloney Adab,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-stop-your-ceos-reputation-from-hurting-your-business/452096,"
When I first moved to the ""dark side"" — an ominous phrase used by my journalism peers to describe transitioning into public relations — the media landscape was different.At the time, the only way to reach a mass audience was to get your news picked up by one of the handful of media outlets that had a monopoly on reaching the mainstream public.As such, CEO communication was standardly delivered through spokespeople — a PR pro would craft a message on behalf of the CEO, then distribute it to the appropriate editors and producers. Removed from the complex world of optics, a CEO's reputation was neatly wall-gardened by this process.



Those days are gone. Widespread adoption of social media has given every employee, customer and investor a virtual window into the operations of the businesses that interest them and the lives of the executives who run them.Recent research shows 82% of employees expect business leaders to use social media to communicate about their company's mission, vision and values — and by a ratio of four to one, prefer to work for a CEO who uses social media compared to one who does not.Just as the landscape has shifted, so has the role of the CEO. No longer can a company's top executive be expected to operate without active participation in company communication. Yet, many leaders, particularly those in legacy industries like finance and law, haven't adapted to modern expectations. The recent Silicon Valley Bank collapse was a shining example of how not investing in an executive communication strategy can literally kill a company.


Amidst company leaders going viral for callous and unsympathetic communication, here's how to make sure your CEO's reputation is helping, not hindering, your company.Related: Creating a Brand That Drives Your CEO ReputationBuild an online presence Privately held or not, we've entered the era of building companies in public. Every person your CEO interacts with has an opinion and a social media channel to share it on. As such, building an online presence for your CEO isn't a vanity project — it's reputation management.When leaders aren't intentional about creating an online thumbprint, the narrative around who they are and what they stand for is left to Google's evolving algorithm. In the absence of an executive content strategy, a negative tweet, poor customer review or inaccurate press quote may be the first impression your CEO is making online when stakeholders do an online search.


Platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter impact search rankings and if properly leveraged, can build virtual communities that result in real-life business opportunities. But don't pawn your CEO's social media presence off to an inexperienced employee. Building a personal brand for your CEO involves tapping into their personality and lived experience to create content that aligns with the strategic objectives of the company and speaks to the needs of the audience they are targeting — a complex process that requires support from a seasoned executive communications consultant who can also caution against communication that could lead to an issue or crisis.Considering four out of five investors use digital media to make an investment decision, having a strong online profile for your CEO can not only improve optics, but it can also help land funding, sales and strategic partnerships.Related: 6 Data-Backed Reasons a CEO Should Take the Time to Build a Strong Personal BrandEmpathize with the needs of stakeholdersIn recent months, we've seen several CEOs go viral for the wrong reasons. Andi Owens, the CEO of MillerKnoll, an American furniture company, became web-famous when a video of her unsympathetically addressing her employees' concerns was uploaded to social media.


In the video, Owens, who made $5M in 2022, lectured employees — the average of whom made $44K — to focus on sales over personal compensation. Owens made a sin many CEOs and company leaders make on a regular basis: She failed to empathize with the needs of her stakeholders.Before a CEO puts out any form of sensitive communication, it's important to anticipate the questions the audience might have and gauge sentiment around the topic. Often this can be done by distributing an anonymous survey in advance to solicit candid feedback from the target group on the topic and how it affects them. When you're not attuned to the needs of your stakeholders, you're less likely to respond with the information that's most important to them — or worse, offend them or raise concerns. This can cause irreparable damage to your business.One of the best ways to stay in tune with your stakeholders' needs on an ongoing basis is to create pathways for two-way communication. In the digital age, social media can be one of the most efficient tools for monitoring public sentiment and staying engaged with your stakeholders.Related: How to Build a Reputation That Leads to SuccessDon't be afraid to build in public In working with CEOs for nearly two decades, I've noticed one common hesitation when it comes to speaking publicly on a trending topic: ""My company hasn't perfected that, yet.""


While having mastered a solution to a widespread challenge is nice to have, it's not necessary to have a point of view on it. Building in public — the idea of openly sharing challenges, learnings and personal reflections as they occur — can be an effective way to humanize a company leader and build a community around their online profile.Building in public doesn't mean you have to operate with radical transparency, but you do have to be willing to test out ideas and solicit stakeholder feedback publicly. Sharing an op-ed, newsletter or thoughtful LinkedIn update gives a CEO a high level of control over their narrative, and if done strategically and consistently, can be an effective way to establish their purpose and intention.Building a personal brand isn't a traditional part of being a CEO, but in the age of algorithms and viral videos, it is becoming a prerequisite.The good news is, company leaders don't have to be charismatic or even comfortable with public speaking to build a public profile, they just need to be intentional and strategic about their online reputation. By investing in an executive communications strategy, CEOs are better positioned to protect their reputations and those of their companies, through the ups and downs of business.

93,"After Her Brother's Death in Iraq Became News, a PR Strategist Learned Firsthand Why the Way We Tell Stories Matters — and It Changed Her Career","May 24, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/her-brothers-death-in-iraq-changed-the-course-of-her-career/452434,"
With more than two decades of experience as a communications strategist and media-relations expert under her belt, Ami Neiberger knows what it takes to tell a story the right way. Today, she owns and runs Maple Avenue PR, a firm helping nonprofit organizations, trade associations, government agencies and small businesses improve their communication.But the journey Neiberger took to get where she is now was a difficult one. In 2007, having started her own public-relations firm a few years prior, she found herself navigating the complexity of media attention intertwined with tragedy after her 22-year-old brother Christopher was killed in the line of duty in Iraq.Neiberger, the oldest of four, was on a beach vacation in Georgia when her aunt told her the news over the phone. ""I actually dropped the phone and started screaming,"" Neiberger recalls.



A whirlwind followed. A funeral was held in Florida. Then the family flew to Washington D.C. for Christopher's burial at Arlington National Cemetery. One day later, Neiberger's husband had emergency surgery for a condition that could have killed him — on the couple's wedding anniversary.Related: Celebrate Memorial Day By Serving Others | Entrepreneur


Over the course of the chaotic 10 days that followed her brother's death, Neiberger also fielded inquiries from the press. ""My brother died at the height of the troop surge in Iraq at the time — so it was news,"" she explains. ""And it occurred in August when there's not a lot of other news going on, so it was bigger news than it might have been at another time of year.""A soldier's death is news to other people, but Christopher was her little brother, and with more than a decade between them, she'd held him when he was a baby and gotten him up for school. ""[He] liked to play jokes on people and could be a really deep thinker,"" she says. ""He was an amazing person.""Neiberger notes that media attention in such situations ""can be very overwhelming."" But her family consented to media coverage when Christopher was buried at Arlington.""They weren't going to be in our faces asking questions,"" Neiberger says. ""They're just allowed to film and take photos at a distance. We wanted people back home to see how this young man who grew up in our community was being honored by his country for what he gave. And for the sacrifice he made.""


""Even though some of these things have occurred in my life, I still do great work. I'm still a great PR person.""In the aftermath of her brother's death, Neiberger had to figure out how to carry on in all aspects of life — including her business. Many clients thought she was still on vacation, but others had seen the announcement of Christopher's death in The New York Times. ""That level of distress became a lot for them to handle,"" she says, ""and it just became very quiet.""But Neiberger resolved to get back to work despite the quiet, figuring that, at the very least, she could start with responding to proposals. She didn't think much would come of it — but it did. She landed a couple of them, one of which turned into a large job that lasted many years.Another thing that helped Neiberger pick up the pieces? Taking a look at her supportive friends and clients, and being sure to communicate: ""Hey, even though some of these things have occurred in my life, I still do great work. I'm still a great PR person.""Neiberger had already done a lot of nonprofit work, but Christopher's death did change the course of her practice. She connected with more organizations that supported military families, Gold Star families and veterans, and began working with the Tragedy Assistance Programs for Survivors (TAPS), which supports grieving military families.


Neiberger's done work for the National Military Family Bereavement Study and the National Veterans Legal Services Program, which has been a client of hers since 2008.Additionally, she testified before Congress a few times on management at Arlington National Cemetery. She also helped lead responses to the Arlington National Cemetery scandal and the Fort Hood and Navy Yard shootings.Neiberger works with the Memorial Day Flowers Foundation as well. The organization, which gathers volunteers to hand out flowers for placement at Arlington National Cemetery and other cemeteries across the country, is short flowers this year, Neiberger says — they have about 80,000 flowers for their Arlington tribute and would need 310,000 to honor every gravesite. You can donate here and volunteer here.Related: Make a Personal Connection to Honor the Fallen This Memorial Day


""The rest of America goes to the beach, [but for me], Memorial Day really changed in its meaning.""Neiberger continues working on some veterans issues today, like the flowers project, though not with ""the level of intensity"" she did in the immediate aftermath of her brother's death. The general nature of her work has also changed, in part due to the pandemic.""I'm not in D.C. as often anymore as I used to be,"" Neiberger says. ""Some of that's also by design. I try to work from home a lot. I only go into the city once in a while now, not every week, one or two days a week. It's just a different pace of life that I'm at right now.""Neiberger's also joined a women's co-working space, AWL Creative, noting it's nice to learn about other women's businesses and think about how to grow hers in new ways, and is working on a couple of books, alongside her consulting work. ""Life is good and busy,"" she says.For more than 15 years, Neiberger has been on media call, working over Memorial Day weekend. ""The rest of America goes to the beach,"" she says, ""[but for me], Memorial Day really changed in its meaning.""


Neiberger usually spends her Memorial Days at Arlington in Section 60, where Christopher's buried, with some of the other families.""My brother died a little over 15 years ago now,"" Neiberger says, ""and there are times that it's still challenging, where just a song can come on the radio or something will happen, and it suddenly feels just like it did before. There's always going to be that sense of loss there. I think what changes is our ability to manage it and navigate it, where it doesn't knock me off my feet as easily as it did early on.""Related: How the Memory of His Fallen Brothers Powers Dakota Meyer's PassionArlington's Section 60 garners a lot of public attention because it's where the Iraq and Afghanistan gravesites are; as a result, it's not uncommon for CNN to be set up filming all day on Memorial Day, Neiberger says.


""There's a piece of me that's really grateful that people remember,"" Neiberger says, ""but at the same time, there's a piece of it that can be incredibly intrusive.""There's a ""fine line to walk"" in how such sensitive moments are depicted, she adds. But covering them in a respectful way can also bring a sense of peace.""If a family chooses to allow press coverage or photography, that's a way to share that experience and how that person is being honored by their country with the community back home,"" Neiberger says. ""For our family, that was important. I had a sense too when everything happened that you only get a very narrow window of time to talk about the legacy that your loved one is leaving.""

94,Why Organizations Must Take a More Modern Approach to HR — and How to Do It,"May 12, 2023",Ian White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-organizations-must-take-a-more-modern-approach-to-hr/450665,"
Over the last few years, employee expectations have evolved alongside global, social and political events. In fact, despite current market conditions, 40% of Americans plan to look for a new job this year, seeking employers that prioritize flexibility and culture while valuing creativity, talent and hard work. To keep pace with these expectations, People leaders must recreate the People function with an employee-first approach, which includes:Making data-driven decisionsRolling out flexible work structuresFocusing on clear career paths and pay transparencyUpleveling diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) effortsTraditional HR can't address these shifts independently, but a modern approach to HR can. And people operations is the next frontier of what modern HR looks like. All organizations need strong people operations to build on the traditional HR responsibilities, like compliance and policy, by incorporating forward-thinking, people-first initiatives that support a data-backed approach to employee experience.Related: 6 Steps Your HR Team Can Take to Leave the Dark AgesHR: Function vs. actionOver 35% of employees believe HR's primary function is to advocate for the organization — not its employees. Why? Because when it comes to employees, the traditional HR function is reactive, not proactive. For example, if an employee asks a question about a benefit or policy, an HR leader often provides an answer straight from the handbook. Or when an employee quits, HR opens a requisition, posts the job opening and works on hiring for that position.Modern people operations requires a system of action, not just the existing framework of compiling and reviewing data. A strong people operations function doesn't sit in the background and ask if it's compliant — it asks questions designed to push an organization forward. A modern People team strengthens its entire organization by:



Preemptively assessing employee onboarding, training, performance evaluation and compensation needs.Collaborating closely with finance teamsHolding training and information sessions on new benefits and open positionsProviding real-time access to people dataFacilitating connection and collaboration at all levels of the organizationProactively recruiting and hiring individuals based on an organization's business goalsImplementing informed, strategic and equitable people practicesAll of these responsibilities revolve around one common theme — putting employees first.


People operations: The new HROnly one in four employees say their People leaders do a good job of balancing their needs with those of their organization. This stems from a reliance on the historical approach to HR, focused on compliance and back-office tasks. HR teams need to evolve, which starts by embracing their role as people operations, a modern, employee-centric approach to HR. Adopting the tenets of people operations will help build employee trust, by leaning on these six attributes.1. People data visibilityLeaders should start by asking, ""How are all of my employees accessing the information they need to make informed decisions?"" People leaders must eliminate people data silos so that employees at every level can get insight (such as where Joe from engineering is based) and take action (like updating their address), without depending on the People team. Traditional, siloed solutions miss telling the whole story because data doesn't live in the same place, and not everyone has access. Organizations should instead adopt a people operations platform to provide a single source of unified truth for the whole organization.Even better, managing and storing people data in one place creates a positive ripple effect organization-wide. Executives can strategize more efficiently and effectively, tracking metrics over time like DEIB, forecasting and employee retention. Meanwhile, managers are empowered to make decisions faster, more intentionally and with less bias. And employees can access the information they need to feel invested in their organization — like org charts, employee directories and personal employee data.Related: Are Your Employees Happy With the Support You Provide?


2. DEIBOver 90% of U.S. workers want companies to commit to DEIB efforts. Yet, we know that DEIB continues to be an area where employees feel like their employers are lacking. A people operations platform can help People leaders improve DEIB programs by drawing data-backed insights from across the organization. Armed with the right data, companies can track and measure DEIB goals over time. However, it's not enough to just track your People data — employees need their leaders to take action.Leaders can mobilize by including employees to develop DEIB initiatives that matter to them. For example, leaders can organize employee workshops to build plans, analyze data and design support systems, such as employee resource groups. Workshops, such as inviting subject matter experts to organization-wide meetings, drive DEIB initiatives forward and provide a safe space for conversations about past, current and future experiences.3. TrainingTo maintain an employee-first culture, organizations must invest in their people's growth. Nearly 95% of people say they'd stay in their role longer if their company invested in learning and development opportunities.It's no longer enough to offer a learning and development stipend — leaders need to empower their people with direction on how to use this kind of benefit. Start by creating a list of recommended programs, courses and resources by department. Encourage your People team to create regular learning and development check-ins with department heads to ensure employees are getting value out of these opportunities.


Alternatively, build this programming into required meetings. For example, host a leadership training course offered throughout the year at regular intervals, and encourage follow-up discussions across manager teams (i.e., create a ""management"" Slack channel to facilitate these conversations). Either option creates a ""default"" so that employees know exactly how to benefit from learning and development opportunities and will walk away knowing their company is invested in their growth.4. Ongoing feedbackThe annual review no longer matches employee expectations. Instead, employees want their leadership to embrace continuous performance management. Over 55% of employees believe that annual reviews have less impact on their performance than more regular, consistent constructive criticism and positive feedback.Organizations should facilitate regularly scheduled reviews at least twice a year or quarterly. More frequent conversations offer opportunities for managers to:Address smaller issues before they escalate into more significant problemsIdentify and address employee pain pointsRecognize accomplishmentsWhile continuous performance management will look different from one company to another, managers must always maintain consistent communication to cultivate trust and alignment with their employees and to better support team success.Related: How HR Professionals Can Effectively Balance the Needs of the Employees and the Business


5. TransparencyWhat is employee-employer trust built on? Transparency. Employees need transparency from their managers and their leaders. While many HR teams have taken steps to transition from compliance officers to employee advocates, people still lack confidence in the HR function. To embrace transparency, People leaders should formalize internal communications through scheduled check-ins and meetings, signaling their commitment to workplace culture and trust.Lacking trust or confidence in their People leaders, employees may struggle to remain engaged or feel a sense of belonging. Almost 65% of employees say trust directly impacts their sense of belonging at work. When leaders embrace honesty and authenticity about organizational goals and changes, their teams feel supported, prepared and respected.6. Flexibility with accountabilityIn an employee-first culture, People leaders value a healthy work-life balance. When employees have time to take care of their physical, mental and emotional health, they arrive at work as their best selves, feeling supported.To help employees attain a healthy work-life balance, companies should move away from the traditional 9 to 5 schedule. Instead of tracking time spent online, organizations should track progress against results and output. A people operations platform helps leaders set fair, clear and measurable output goals, even when employees have ""flex"" days every other week. Leaders must focus on the results of those goals to inform performance management.


People operations is the new HR, and the HR function must adapt to the new normal of today's workplace. Organizations shouldn't throw traditional HR practices out the window but should instead embrace a more modern approach to HR, rooted in employee-first initiatives and outcomes.

96,3 Tips to Ensure Your HR Department is Properly Empowered to Protect Your Employees and Business,"May 8, 2023",Kim Williams,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-tips-to-ensure-your-hr-department-is-properly-empowered/450937,"
Too many founders have learned the hard way that weak people practices can expose their employees to risk, their company to costly legal jeopardy and leave their reputations indelibly stained.Today's employees are seeking values-driven companies and come with a deeper understanding of their rights. If your HR shop isn't screening applicants with an eye toward culture or speaking frankly with you about the impacts of key hires, your ability to shepherd your organization toward future success will be impaired.Worse, if your HR head has not been trained to act impartially or empowered to intercede quickly, it can result in systemic problems that prevent victims from finding justice. This pushes victims to seek other remedies, which show up daily in viral callouts and highly publicized court cases.



Beyond unflattering headlines, many startups can see their financial value decimated just as they were taking off. If it's not attorneys' fees and settlement costs, it's lost customers and potential partners due to the negative coverage. Even if a lawsuit exonerates your company, the mere accusation can come at a price, and extended court battles can expose sensitive internal company dealings.Related: This Entrepreneur Has Solutions for HR Problems You Didn't Know You Had


To prevent this, you must focus on how to set up a respected and experienced HR team that is empowered to handle misconduct allegations from the start, even if it involves someone from your executive team. It is on you to create a culture that supports calling out, investigating, and punishing workplace misconduct — be it harassment or discrimination, bullying or any other unlawful action.When setting up your HR department, here are three steps to help you avoid misconduct from arising in the first place — or, if it does arise, to ensure it is dealt with quickly and consistently.1: Hire experienced HR leaders who share your company's valuesIt can be difficult for HR staff to discern which aspects of a grievance are true and which ones aren't. Add in a power imbalance like those that occurs between a manager and a subordinate, and HR may find itself not only caught between two employees but between higher-ranking staff who want the problem to simply go away. If you have not hired HR professionals with the experience to navigate the necessary conversations and evenly enforce the rules, you may be held liable for any wrongful acts that follow.As a founder, you must prioritize hiring HR executives who are strong and principled leaders. When interviewing potential candidates, ask them how they would handle tough allegations and what processes they would utilize to ensure fair outcomes for all parties. Based on their answers, you want to ensure they see eye to eye with your company's values. You may also want to seek out experienced HR chiefs who have handled tough employee accusations before.


After hiring the right talent, you need to make clear that they have the authority and the responsibility to handle all misconduct allegations equally, no matter who is accused — even if it's someone on your executive team.Related: Here's How Companies Are Ensuring Women's Workplace Safety2. Create protocols that protect victims and your company, not the accusedA National Women's Law Center study found that as many as 70% of those who report harassment face some form of retaliation. And 37% noted that nothing happened to the harasser after the complaint. But even when the company is engaged, many will still farm out the process to outside investigators and attorneys. This, too, lends itself to a predictable pattern and usually concludes with a benign acknowledgment of the complaint followed by language indicating that the company took all steps required by law to resolve the complaint. What this really means is that they took as little action as possible to avoid liability.Unfortunately for these companies, there are many experienced attorneys watching and waiting for this. They know that there is likely to be damaging information in investigative reports and will use the discovery process to gain leverage for their client. This can be prevented if the company takes appropriate action from the beginning.


This requires, first, conducting a fair and neutral investigation. This doesn't require hiring an outside firm. A victim's claims can often be verified by interviewing key staff and reviewing written communications and other records.Second, if the accusations are deemed to be true and serious, take swift action to hold the offender accountable. In many instances, that means terminating his or her employment.To ensure your process of investigating and ruling on a case is respected by all parties, it should be based on protocols that treat all accusations equally. This will ensure everyone involved — from the HR team to the executives, to the accuser, to the accused — has the same rights and responsibilities.3: Empower HR to let go of toxic employees, even if they are high-performingProper handling of an allegation is rarely an issue when a low-level employee commits an offense. If an hourly worker engages in misconduct, companies can often be counted on to take appropriate action. But when it's a highly-valued officer, decisions may be weighed against the perceived value the employee brings to the company. This reflects a misunderstanding of the true costs of these individuals.


An abusive person in a management position can cost more than many realize through high employee turnover and productivity problems. Half of employees who leave their jobs do so, at least in part, because of bad managers, and replacing employees costs a company as much as 50% of the person's salary. In terms of productivity, one study found that teams with toxic managers yielded 27% less revenue per employee than well-managed teams.A similar effect can be measured for public companies. When a high-level official of a publicly traded company gets called out for wrongdoing, the hit to the company's stock price can cause the rapid loss of millions or even billions of dollars in market cap.Protecting these abusive employees isn't just wrong. It's costly and potentially fatal to your business. This is why it's important to make clear to your HR department that it has the power to terminate employment for any employee based on the results of a fair investigation, even if they are high-ranking or high-performing.You may think none of this applies to you or that accusations will never occur in your company, but the numbers tell a different story. 60% of U.S. workers have experienced or witnessed workplace discrimination and, unfortunately, 40% reported being retaliated against after speaking up.


In every one of these cases, the company has exposed itself to potential liability. Increasingly, law firms are looking out for opportunities to step in on behalf of these victims. You can protect your company and your employees by doing exactly that — protecting them, not the accused.

As an entrepreneur, you've probably got your hands full with your primary business. But if you're interested in generating a side income while simultaneously networking and building your audience, you should consider getting involved in a public speaking side hustle.What exactly does this entail, and how do you get started?Monetizing your public speakingLet's start with the most important topic: how do you make money as a public speaker? If you look around your city, you'll likely find many events that would allow you to speak for free. So how do you monetize this?



Direct paymentsIn your later stages of development, your personal brand will be strong enough and popular enough that you can make money by speaking alone. Businesses, universities, or other organizations may be willing to pay you thousands of dollars for just a few hours of your time. Unfortunately, when you're first starting out and your reputation is minimal, you probably won't be able to make much money this way.Related: 8 Reasons a Powerful Personal Brand Will Make You Successful


Book salesConsider printing a book in line with your speaking topics, which you can sell when giving a public address. If people are impressed with what you say, they'll likely buy your book.Networking and marketing opportunitiesPublic speaking is also a great way to network and meet other people, while simultaneously promoting your business.

These are some of the most important steps to follow:Cultivate niche expertiseMost people don't want to hear from an average person. They want to hear from someone who's truly an expert in their field, whatever that field happens to be. If you want to become an effective and in-demand public speaker, you need to cultivate that niche expertise. What topic or area could you study that no one else seems to be covering? Do you have years of experience in a particular field that you could use? Feel free to exercise your creativity here; you can always apply what you learn in one field to a different field. What's important is that you have a set of knowledge and experience that most other people don't have.Hone your public speaking skillsIf you want to be a successful public speaker, you need a specific skill set. You need to be able to hold yourself confidently, project your voice, articulate your words well, and gesticulate without looking like a crazy person. It takes practice to refine these skills, so spend some time practicing in front of friends, family members, or a camera if you have to.


Establish a personal brandYou'll be a more effective public speaker (and marketer for yourself) if you have a personal brand behind you. Who are you? How do you market yourself? And how do people find and interact with you?Get active on social mediaOne of your best tools for marketing yourself and finding new public speaking opportunities is social media. Make sure you claim your individual social media profile on a wide variety of different social networks and consider joining groups that are relevant to your area of expertise. Meet and engage with other people interested in public speaking.Related: The 5 Keys to Building a Social-Media Strategy for Your Personal BrandLook for low-hanging fruitChances are, you can find some ""low-hanging fruit"" public speaking opportunities in your area with a rudimentary search.

Get featured on podcastsIn line with this, try to get featured on podcasts relevant to your area of expertise. There are millions of podcasts out there, and hosts of niche shows are constantly looking for new people to interview.Network aggressivelyIt's hard to overstate just how valuable professional networking can be in any career — and in public speaking, it's even more important. Take the time to build relationships with venue owners, event organizers, and other public speakers like you; these relationships can lead you to even better opportunities and help you master the art.Work your way to bigger and better opportunitiesKeep pushing for bigger and more prominent speaking opportunities. It may take some time, but you can eventually reach higher echelons of reach and popularity this way.Even if you never imagined yourself as a public speaker, it could be an amazing money-making opportunity for you. With more refined public speaking skills, more experience under your belt, and a more prominent personal brand, you could even turn this into a full-time, lucrative gig.

99,The A-La-Carte Approach to Public Relations Is a Game Changer for the Industry,"Apr 24, 2023",Hanna Shanar,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/this-new-approach-to-pr-is-a-game-changer-for-the-industry/449506,"
Public relations (PR) agencies and firms have long been instrumental in shaping the public image and reputation of their clients. Traditionally, these agencies have operated through a variety of mechanisms that relied on long-term contracts and bundled service packages to deliver results. However, the PR landscape is witnessing a significant shift with the rise of the a-la-carte approach, allowing clients to purchase on-demand publications in major outlets like Maxim.This article explores how this new method is poised to revolutionize the PR industry and explores its benefits, challenges and potential implications.Related: 10 PR Trends That Will Explode Your Brand in 2023



Traditional PR agency and firm operating mechanismsAt the core of traditional PR practice is media relations. PR agencies have cultivated strong relationships with journalists and editors, enabling them to pitch stories and secure coverage for their clients. This has been supplemented with press release distribution to announce new products, services or company news, with PR professionals crafting compelling press releases and distributing them to various media outlets.Crisis management has also been a critical component of PR services. Agencies are called upon to handle sensitive situations, such as negative press or scandals, in order to minimize damage to a client's reputation. This involves crafting appropriate responses, coordinating with legal teams and managing media inquiries.


Other key services include content creation, event management and influencer marketing. PR firms generate content on behalf of their clients, such as blog posts, articles and social media updates, to maintain a consistent brand image and engage with target audiences. Additionally, they plan and execute events designed to generate media coverage and raise awareness of their clients' products or services. As social media has grown in importance, PR firms have increasingly collaborated with influencers to promote clients' products or services, leveraging the influencers' large followings for maximum exposure.The challenges of traditional PR modelsWhile traditional PR models have proved successful in the past, they often come with their own set of challenges. Long-term contracts and bundled services can be expensive, especially for small businesses and startups with limited budgets. Moreover, the lack of flexibility in these models can make it difficult for companies to adjust their PR strategies as their needs change.Additionally, the traditional PR approach may not always provide the best value for clients. Companies may find themselves paying for services they don't necessarily need or not receiving the attention and customization they require due to the ""one-size-fits-all"" nature of bundled packages. This has led to a demand for more tailored and flexible PR solutions.Related: 4 PR Trends You Need to Know for 2023


The a-la-carte revolutionThe a-la-carte approach to public relations is disrupting the traditional model, offering clients the flexibility to purchase on-demand publications in major outlets. This new method presents several key advantages.First, a-la-carte PR promotes cost efficiency. Clients only pay for the specific services they need, rather than committing to a long-term contract with a comprehensive package. This allows businesses to allocate their PR budget more effectively and avoid paying for unnecessary services.Second, this approach provides greater flexibility. Businesses can choose the services that best suit their needs at any given time, allowing them to be more agile and responsive to changing market conditions. For instance, a company might opt for crisis management services during a scandal and switch to influencer marketing when launching a new product.Third, the a-la-carte model fosters innovation within the PR industry. As agencies and firms begin to offer more modular services, they are encouraged to develop new and creative solutions to meet their clients' unique needs. This could lead to the emergence of specialized PR providers, focusing on niche services and expertise.


Potential implications of the a-la-carte revolutionThe rise of the a-la-carte method in public relations has the potential to significantly impact the industry as a whole. As clients increasingly embrace this new approach, PR agencies and firms will need to adapt to remain competitive and relevant in this rapidly changing landscape. Although this model is currently provisionally patented, some potential implications of the a-la-carte revolution include:Shift in agency focus: PR agencies and firms may need to reevaluate their service offerings and focus on providing highly specialized and customized services. This may lead to a more segmented industry, with agencies specializing in niche areas or services, such as crisis management or influencer marketing.Greater collaboration: The a-la-carte model could also promote increased collaboration among PR agencies, with firms partnering together to provide a more comprehensive suite of services to clients. This could lead to the rise of PR ""super-agencies"" that offer a wide range of specialized services under one umbrella.Emphasis on quality: As clients gain the flexibility to choose specific services, the demand for high-quality and effective PR solutions is likely to grow. Agencies and firms will need to focus on delivering exceptional results in order to retain clients and attract new business.Adaptation to new technologies: The a-la-carte revolution could also drive PR agencies to adopt new technologies to better serve their clients. For example, firms might leverage artificial intelligence and data analytics to identify trending topics, monitor client reputations and create highly targeted PR campaigns.Increased transparency: The shift to an a-la-carte model could lead to more transparent pricing structures and service offerings in the PR industry. Clients will be able to compare services and costs more easily, leading to increased competition among agencies and driving innovation.Related: These Trends are Going to be Revolutionary for the PR IndustryThe rise of the a-la-carte method in public relations is set to transform the industry by challenging traditional operating mechanisms and offering clients greater flexibility, cost efficiency and innovation. As businesses increasingly embrace this new approach, PR agencies and firms will need to adapt to remain competitive and relevant in this rapidly changing landscape. The a-la-carte revolution in PR is just beginning, and it will be fascinating to witness the impact it has on the industry as a whole. Embracing these changes and adapting to the evolving needs of clients will be crucial for the continued success of PR agencies and firms in the future.

100,Looking for a Game-Changing Way to Showcase Your Expertise? Why a Book Is the 'World's Best Business Card',"Apr 21, 2023",Anna David,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/why-writing-a-book-is-the-ultimate-way-to-showcase-your/449788,"
With distrust around social media growing and de-influencing all the rage, it's getting harder to determine who to believe and who to blow off.But one activity still provides credibility, and it's far from new — it originated in the 14th century.Writing a book.A book, you say. Wouldn't publishing social media content be much easier and more effective?Not really. A few years ago, prioritizing social media made sense. But as time passes, business owners are better off focusing on showcasing their authority.



""Social media fame can create so-called experts who aren't actually experts,"" says business strategist Maresa Friedman. ""I went viral for not wanting to give up my seat on a plane. I am hardly an expert on plane seating, yet now that's something I'm known for."" She adds, ""A book gives you the opportunity to show that your knowledge exceeds a 90 second video made by a guru who two years ago wasn't even in the industry.""Look at it this way: Would you be more likely to trust James Clear (#1 New York Times bestselling author of Atomic Habits, with over 5 million copies sold) or Tai Lopez (someone with 2.8 million Instagram followers who became known for raving about how everyone should read while standing in front of a Lamborghini)?In a day and age when someone can take a summer class at Harvard and then list on LinkedIn that they're Harvard alumni, even the sort of credibility that institutions used to provide has been leveled.Related: 5 Reasons Why Writing a Book Is a Smart Move for Entrepreneurs


Lack of trust makes us feel less safeInfluencers have been caught doing everything from making racial slurs to shilling mascara while actually wearing fake lashes. And yet entrepreneurs spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on social media marketing.Given what we've experienced in the past few years, it makes sense that we're primed to prioritize actual authorities over fake authorities. ""When you live in a society that considers people who aren't always educated about a topic 'experts,' it makes us feel unsafe,"" says dual board-certified psychiatrist Dr. Josh Lichtman. ""After surviving a pandemic, people are tired of feeling unsafe, and so they're turning back to actual authorities for guidance.""Books are the ultimate authority builders""A book is like the world's best's best business card. It gives you that topical authority,"" said Nick Loper recently on the Write About Now podcast. ""It signals this is what I know about because I wrote a book on the topic.""Using a book to establish authority is nothing new. Even before the time of the seven-second attention span, how-to books were the sort of currency that bestowed immediate legitimacy on the author. After all, Robert Kiyosaki went from struggling entrepreneur to expert in real estate investment when he released Rich Dad Poor Dad in 1997.


Tim Ferriss, meanwhile, transformed from a behind-the-scenes entrepreneur to someone who would probably pass the ""Does my mom know who he is"" level of fame after releasing The 4 Hour Workweek in 2007. Even though he appears to work at least 400 hours a week, the book made him an expert in spending four hours doing anything (including cooking and working out).What a book gets youMost business owners aren't going to skyrocket into top podcasts, TV shows, and the most widely read blog on the internet.But any founder or CEO who creates a book that demonstrates how they were able to build their business will, with a high-quality book, be able to enter the public discourse.""Every single time, event bookers will pick a published author over someone who hasn't written a book,"" says speaking coach and author Topher Morrison, ""even if the other person is a better speaker and has a better demo reel and is more entertaining.""


The same is true when it comes to traditional media. When I published a humorous novel about my recovery from addiction in 2007, I immediately found myself on the Today Show and CNN as an expert.I don't see trust in influencers increasing any time soon. And given that books have been building authority for almost 600 years, I don't see that decreasing anytime soon.

Effective public relations campaigns require precision in every aspect of planning and execution. One crucial component is communication: It should be concise, clear, and consistent across every channel you leverage for outreach. Get your messaging right by tailoring it specifically to your target audience's preferences using their desired mediums — from traditional media outlets like newspapers or magazines (print) and TV/radio broadcasts (broadcast), as well as social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter (digital) among others — ensuring maximum visibility where they are most likely present online or offline.Related: How to Boost Your Brand Awareness and PR StrategyDeveloping a crisis communication planTo successfully manage crises in business, one must be well-prepared and execute a solid crisis communication plan. This essential aspect of public relations can protect your organization's reputation and limit damages incurred.Measuring the efficacy of your efforts via metrics like website traffic, social media engagement, lead generation and media coverage is vital for continual improvement. When a crisis hits, any organization must respond quickly with accurate information to the public. This is why developing a crisis communication plan beforehand is so important.


In this plan, potential risks are identified, and response strategies for each scenario are outlined in advance. Transparency and accountability should be emphasized; owning up to mistakes and communicating the corrective measures being taken can help prevent future crises from occurring.Finally, messaging consistency ensures that all spokespeople are unified in their presentation of information. When navigating a crisis situation, it's essential to be aware of how your communication efforts are being received by both the media and your audience.Maintaining strong relationships with journalists and industry influencersStay on top of media coverage and public sentiment to gauge their effectiveness, making necessary modifications as needed. But even beyond crises, maintaining strong relationships with key journalists and industry influencers is invaluable for garnering positive news coverage that helps spread your brand message.Take a proactive approach by providing these individuals with relevant information about your company or sector, along with compelling story angles. Acknowledging the hard work of journalists who cover your brand is not only courteous but also essential to fostering positive relationships within the industry.


Expressing gratitude for their support helps build rapport and increases the likelihood of future coverage. Remembering to hold appreciation as part of your PR strategy shows that you recognize how important collaboration with members of the media is in boosting visibility for your business.Social mediaThe use of social media by companies is increasingly becoming a crucial aspect of modern public relations strategy. It allows brands to interact directly with potential customers, offering them exceptional opportunities to engage and communicate by sharing informative articles, industry updates or even just simply acknowledging feedback given from patrons. The success of this tool relies on wisely selecting appropriate platforms based around target demographics while maintaining consistency in regular posting schedules aimed at keeping online communities informed along with delivering meaningful, engaging content built upon genuine customer values.Related: 4 Guiding Principles for Building and Deploying a Great PR StrategyBuilding a successful brand reputationEffective public relations has long been heralded as one of the most powerful tools available for building a successful brand reputation. With strategies ranging from targeted messaging campaigns to social media engagement tactics, companies have numerous options for making their presence known among consumers while also enhancing customer loyalty over time.


By paying close attention to feedback from customers while also carefully curating content and interactions across multiple channels, even small firms can achieve big results when it comes to boosting their image and maximizing impact on bottom-line performance metrics like revenue growth or share price valuation.In the forever-evolving world of public relations, success doesn't just happen; organizations need to be proactive and authentic and also maintain consistency in their communication strategies. Proactivity enables businesses to get ahead of emerging trends rather than being reactive or caught off guard by unfavorable news cycles. Authenticity in PR communication establishes better relationships with stakeholders by building trust through transparent communication tactics that align with organizational values, strengthened by consistent messaging until they become ingrained into the brand identity.

102,Dominion v. Fox News: A $787.5 Million Crisis Management Lesson,"Apr 19, 2023",Kevin Kaminyar,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/dominion-v-fox-news-how-to-avoid-a-corporate-crisis/449933,"
The defamation suit settlement between Fox News and Dominion highlighted important crisis management lessons for business leaders.As both sides prepared to make their opening arguments in the trial, Dominion Voting Systems reached a settlement in its storied defamation case against Fox News.Judge Eric Davis declared Tuesday afternoon that the parties had settled with a protracted post-lunch delay. Judge Davis did not specify the conditions of the settlement. At a post-trial press conference, Dominion attorney Justin Nelson said that Fox settled for $787.5 million. Although the nature of any non-financial provisions of the settlement is unknown, it is doubtful that Fox News anchors would provide an on-air apology.



The voting machine company's suit, which initially sought $1.6 billion in damages, stemmed from the right-wing network's airing of false claims that Dominion was complicit in a nonexistent scheme to rig the 2020 election against the incumbent, Donald Trump, who lost to President Joe Biden.Court documents indicated that the discovery in the lawsuit revealed a wealth of astonishing internal Fox emails that demonstrated hosts and other employees were aware they were presenting false statements but continued to do so nonetheless, allegedly out of concern that viewers would migrate to rival right-wing networks.


Legal experts were astounded by the enormous amount of convincing evidence Dominion gathered against Fox, which appeared to put the initiative in the plaintiff's favor in terms of a prospective settlement.Related: Here's Why a Crisis May Actually Be the Best Thing That Can Happen to YouFour steps business leaders can take to manage a corporate crisis effectivelyCorporate crises can occur at any time, and business leaders must be prepared to handle them effectively to minimize their impact on their organizations.

103,"Facing Financial Trouble? Understand the Difference Between Insolvency, Liquidation, Bankruptcy and Administration","Apr 12, 2023",Shoaib Aslam,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/facing-financial-trouble-here-are-your-options/448676,"
When a business faces financial difficulties, several different options and processes can be pursued to resolve the situation. Insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy and administration are commonly used in this context, but it can be challenging to understand the differences between them.Let's explore and explain these terms clearly and concisely and help you understand the critical differences between insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, and administration.What is insolvency?Insolvency refers to a financial situation in which a company cannot pay its debts as they become due. It can occur for various reasons, including declining sales, increased expenses, or a significant drop in the value of assets. Insolvency is a warning sign that a company is facing financial difficulties and may not be able to continue operating as a going concern. Insolvency can lead to more severe financial problems, such as liquidation or bankruptcy if left unchecked.



Related: How will the Revised Bankruptcy Code Benefit SMEsWhat is liquidation?Liquidation is converting a company's assets into cash, either through selling those assets or terminating the business. Liquidation can occur voluntarily when a company decides to close down its operations and sell off its assets or involuntarily when a company is forced to liquidate its assets due to financial difficulties, such as insolvency or bankruptcy.


The proceeds from the liquidation are used to pay off the company's debts and obligations, and any remaining assets are distributed to shareholders or creditors. The goal of liquidation is to close down the business and distribute its assets in an orderly and efficient manner, to maximize the value returned to creditors and shareholders.What is bankruptcy?Bankruptcy is a legal process that relieves individuals or businesses that cannot pay their debts. The process is designed to provide a fresh start for individuals or businesses struggling with financial difficulties and to give creditors a fair and equal distribution of the bankrupt entity's assets.In a bankruptcy proceeding, a court-appointed trustee takes control of the bankrupt entity's assets and sells those assets to pay off the entity's debts. The assets are sold in a way designed to maximize the value returned to creditors. Depending on the jurisdiction, the assets may be sold as a whole or in parts. The proceeds from the sale are used to pay off the creditors, with the priority of payments determined by law.Bankruptcy can be a complex and time-consuming process. Understanding the legal implications of bankruptcy and its impact on a person or business's financial situation is essential.


Related: 6 Steps Resilient Entrepreneurs Take to Rebound From BankruptcyWhat is administration?The administration is a process used when a company is facing financial difficulties and cannot meet its debt obligations. The administration aims to protect the company and its creditors and find a solution that will allow the company to continue operating as a going concern.In administration, a court appoints an administrator to take control of the company and its assets. The administrator's role is to assess the company's financial situation, manage its affairs, and negotiate with creditors to find a solution that will allow the company to continue operating. The administrator may also sell off parts of the company or its assets to pay off its debts.Administration provides a moratorium on legal action by creditors, allowing the company time to restructure and find a solution to its financial difficulties. The aim is to find a way to repay creditors and keep the company operating rather than closing it down and selling its assets through liquidation. The company may be liquidated or bankrupt if a solution cannot be found.

In contrast, liquidation refers to converting a company's assets into cash to pay off its debts. Insolvency is a warning sign that a company may be heading towards liquidation, but liquidation is the final stage when the company's assets are sold off.Liquidation vs. Bankruptcy


Liquidation and bankruptcy are similar in that they both involve the sale of a company's assets to pay off its debts. However, liquidation occurs voluntarily when a company closes its operations and sells off its assets. At the same time, bankruptcy is a court-ordered process initiated when a company cannot pay its debts.Bankruptcy vs. AdministrationBankruptcy is a legal process in which a court takes control of a company's assets and sells them to pay off its debts. At the same time, the administration is a process in which an administrator is appointed to take control of a company and its assets to find a solution that will allow the company to continue operating. Bankruptcy is the final stage of a company's financial difficulties when all other options have failed, while administration is an earlier stage of the process when the aim is to find a solution that will allow the company to continue operating.Each process has its legal implications and consequences. Understanding the differences between insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, and administration is important to make informed decisions about the best course of action for a company facing financial difficulties.

104,What You Need to Know About Doing Your Own PR vs. Handing Over the Reins,"Apr 11, 2023",Kristen Shea,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/should-i-outsource-my-business-pr-or-do-it-myself-it/446669,"
Public relations is essential to any organization's marketing and communication strategy. It involves creating and maintaining a positive image for the founder and its products or services through various media channels, including traditional print and digital media, social media, brand collaborations and other digital platforms.One common question founders face concerning PR is whether to hire an in-house team or outsource to a third-party agency. Of course, both options have advantages and the decision ultimately depends on the organization's needs.Related: In-House Production vs Outsourcing: How to Achieve the Best Content Marketing Results No Matter Who's In Control



In-house PR teamIn-house PR teams are embedded within the organization and have a closer relationship with other departments, such as marketing and sales. This close relationship between the PR team and broader marketing and communication strategies can actively benefit the creation of a consistent brand message across all channels and the alignment of PR efforts.Investing in an in-house PR team can facilitate a deeper understanding of your brand among your employees as they become fully immersed in your organization's culture and values. This immersion lets them collaborate directly with your broader marketing and communication strategies, resulting in more effective PR campaigns and a more robust brand image. Over time, this can lead to significant success and revenue for your company.


Despite the advantages of having an in-house PR team, there are also some disadvantages. Agencies can offer a more comprehensive range of skills and experience, including media relations, crisis management and social media strategy, which can be invaluable to a PR campaign's success.Another potential drawback of having an in-house team is that they may be less objective than external agencies, as their focus is on your organization's perspective. This narrow focus may lead to a lack of consideration for external audiences' viewpoints, resulting in a disconnect between your messaging and the public's perception of your organization.Related: In-House or Outsourced? How Do You Decide?The DIY PR approachEntrepreneurs considering doing their PR should be aware of some drawbacks. First, doing PR in-house can take time, diverting your attention from other essential business aspects. Secondly, entrepreneurs need the necessary skills and experience to execute a successful PR campaign.


Apart from the time and skills required, more objectivity is another significant concern with doing PR in-house. Entrepreneurs are often emotionally invested in their brand and messaging, which can cloud their judgment and prevent them from seeing the perspective of their target audience. This lack of objectivity can lead to messaging that fails to resonate with the audience, resulting in poor PR results.Third-party PR agencyOne of the main advantages of outsourcing PR to a third-party agency is that it provides access to a broader range of skills and resources. PR agencies have more experience and expertise than an in-house team and can offer a fresh perspective on your messaging and branding. They also have established media relationships and a broader network of industry experts that can be invaluable for getting media coverage, building your organization's reputation and developing PR strategies.Another advantage of outsourcing to a PR agency is that it can be more cost-effective in the short term. PR agencies eliminate the need to hire full-time staff and the need to invest in resources such as office space and equipment. Outsourcing public relations services to an agency can benefit smaller organizations needing more money to support and maintain a full-time in-house team.Furthermore, PR agencies are often better equipped to handle unexpected crises or negative media coverage. With their expertise and experience, they can quickly develop a crisis communication plan and mitigate any potential damage to your organization's reputation. This ability can be especially crucial in industries prone to public scrutiny or where negative publicity can severely impact the organization's operations.


However, you must do your due diligence when choosing a PR agency. Look for agencies specializing in your industry or niche and with a proven track record of success with similar clients. Ask for case studies and references to ensure that the agency has experience achieving the types of results you're looking for.Related: Hiring vs. Outsourcing: How to Recognize the Right Moment to Add Talent to Your TeamIt's also important to consider the agency's communication style and responsiveness. A good agency should be transparent about its strategies and tactics and open to feedback and collaboration. They should also be responsive to your needs and concerns and communicate clearly and regularly about the progress of your PR campaigns.Another factor to consider is the agency's culture and values. Look for agencies whose values align with your own and whose culture fits your organization well. This alignment can help ensure that the agency accurately understands your brand and messaging deeper and can help create a more effective and authentic PR campaign.


Ultimately, the key to outsourcing PR to a third-party agency is finding an agency you can trust that understands your business and goals. By researching and carefully vetting potential agencies, you can avoid the pitfalls of outsourcing PR and create a successful and effective PR campaign that helps you achieve your goals and build a positive brand image.The decision to hire an in-house PR team or outsource to a third-party agency depends on the organization's specific needs. Both options have advantages and disadvantages; the best choice depends on your goals, budget and overall strategy.

105,The Key to Retaining Your Employees Is Right Under Your Nose,"Apr 7, 2023",Alison Stevens,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-best-way-to-retain-employees-is-to-use-these-6/447568,"
The year started off with HR continuing to make headlines, as news of massive layoffs within tech and other industries have dominated headlines and discussions about the incredible capabilities of predictive AI — like those displayed by ChatGPT — have complicated the hiring process. It might seem that, after years of record-low unemployment and rapid hiring pushes, 2023 will usher in a new era for managers and employees alike; one that may again favor employers' interests, juxtaposed by a strong desire for employees to feel a sense of purpose and belonging at work.While candidates will likely have less leverage going into negotiations than they did at the height of the Great Resignation, the power balance in the workforce may not shift as significantly as one might think. Unemployment is still incredibly low and there are still roles sitting unfilled at businesses around the country. News of layoffs elsewhere may even send employees who feel undervalued or at risk in their current roles to seek new opportunities to get ahead of an unforeseen loss of income.That's bad news for employers looking to cut costs. In general, the reality is that retaining workers costs less than hiring new employees, even if it means paying tenured employees more or working with them to better address needs or concerns. This has always been the case as onboarding and training takes time and effort, slowing productivity until the new employee gets up to speed. However, it's even more important in today's labor market, where workers are regularly seeing their compensation increase by almost 10% when they change jobs.

106,How to Turn a Crisis into an Opportunity by Managing Negative Publicity,"Apr 5, 2023",Adam Petrilli,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/dont-let-crisis-control-you-5-expert-tips-on-effective/448255,"
Today's businesses face countless risks, from compliance mistakes to saying the wrong thing out of turn. A public relations (PR) crisis can topple even the most well-respected company. A press release, worded to announce an impressive new social-impact program your company is launching, should be a good thing until you're accused of leaving out a key group of people.A PR crisis is costly and can happen to any company at any time. In our business, we see some of the most well-deserving professionals struggling to keep their brands afloat after a misunderstanding or, in some cases, a false accusation. There are plenty of instances when the criticism is warranted, but what if it isn't?Some companies decide to be quiet and wait for the storm to pass. Yet, it takes a simple Google search for that bad press to tank the next partnership agreement or opportunity for a company. What do you do then?



In my years of experience supporting companies through some of the most challenging situations, I encourage you to take action warranted and guided by those who can see what's happening through an outside lens. Here are the most effective steps to manage a PR crisis.Managing a PR crisis in the momentThe news hit. The story is out. It's completely decimating your stocks, and you're worried about what it will do to your team's reputation. In that heat of the moment, you need to act not necessarily fast but carefully. Crisis communication requires logic and clarity, not a rash decision that could further paralyze your efforts.


As a successful business professional, you've likely learned to remain calm during difficult moments, from equipment failures and losing great employees to times when your company isn't hitting sales goals. Apply the same type of steady leadership in a PR crisis moment.Related: 8 Ways to Stay Calm During a CrisisDevelop a response teamStart by developing a group of key people who understand how to react and the importance of responding with the company's best intentions at heart. This should include a crisis communicator and an in-house professional who will execute your response plan. Assign specific leaders within the company to address the specific situation and allow that person to react. Turn to a media relations company that can create a strategy based on what works.Focus first on determining the extent of the damageWho is impacted?How extensive is this?What are the specific implications of the event?Then, empathize in some way with those directly impacted. Your communication skills here will be critical. Do not admit guilt or fault. Don't apologize but sympathize with those affected. ""We value your privacy."" ""We know the importance of providing our clients with the best service.""


At this moment, you don't need a solution, but you do need a statement. Draft a clear, concise statement that relies on the necessary facts. Don't lie or leave out critical information that impacts any other person's safety, health, or finances.Related: 3 Core Values to Lead Your Crisis Communications PlanGet tools in place to monitor the conversationA core component of your success in working through this difficult situation is being able to hedge off more bad news or control the ongoing message. It's not as easy as it sounds – a good press release isn't enough.Consider the use of software to monitor what's happening on social media. With a 24-hour news cycle, conversations multiply, potentially worsening harm. These tools can help you know what's being said so you can be proactive.


Crisis Management Is an Ongoing ProcessWith some core steps in place, you're wondering what's next. When I work with clients facing a crisis like this, every response is modeled after what's occurring and the best steps forward. However, there are a few key steps we often focus on.1. Get a gripHow bad is this, really? You're angry, frustrated and worried. Yet, you cannot overreact, as that will likely worsen the situation.2. Act quickly with careYou shouldn't put off providing some type of crisis communication. Instead, aim to make a statement – even a simple one – as soon as you can work with a professional to do so.3. Determine the responseWhat will the response entail? Sometimes this is a monetary situation where you'll need your insurance carrier on speed dial. Most of the time, though, that's not what you need to focus on. Instead, focus on helping the people first. What can you do to alleviate your pain right now?


4. Identify what went wrongWe often hear of companies doing this later, pushing off the need to address the cause later. Yet, you still need to acknowledge that you're working on it. You also need to know what's put you in this situation so you can prevent it from worsening.5. Work with those who have influenceOnce you deal with the immediate problem, it's time to start controlling the message. To do that, you need to reach out to those most likely to influence your situation, provide only the information they need, and deliver it in a way they cannot question it.That's a lot to ask. It's simply not easy. Yet, proper PR crisis management can help your organization to pull through, minimize financial loss, and, ultimately, to turn a bad situation into a good one.I cannot stress the importance of taking care of a PR crisis with careful thought and meaningful, controlled action enough. What you do now helps to control not just the outcome but what people think of your company (from customers to investors) for years to come. You must find a way to afford a misstep here.

107,Answering HR's 2 Most Important Questions: Why Do People Join Your Company and Why Do They Leave?,"Apr 5, 2023",Brad  Rencher,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-do-people-join-your-company-and-why-do-they-leave/445040,"
Human resources professionals today face a tough perception gap. On one hand, technology has given us outstanding tools that seek to help clarify what our employees want. But, on the other hand, we still struggle to understand what drives people away.The HR experience really boils down to two questions: Why do people join your company? And why do they leave?To answer the questions, leaders look at data sets like number of people hired, average length employed, turnover and where we are hiring. We also have reams of dynamic data like pulse checks, mid-year and annual reviews, exit interviews and anything else that can be coded, counted and analyzed.



But when all of that information is digested, we still don't have a complete picture. People are attracted to what companies say they have and end up leaving because of what they don't have, but we don't know how to address the problem.In my career, I have come to understand that we have to look beyond the data in order to understand how companies can improve their HR experience, engage employees and help people bring their best selves to work. The following strategies can help HR organizations move the levers in their favor.


Related: 5 Reasons Why Your Employees Are QuittingUnderstand how your team handles moments that matterIt's important that leaders take the time to learn how their teams respond in significant moments. These moments define the gap between what we say we have and what we are missing.Moments that matter can be big, such as: How do we respond to a pandemic? How do we get everyone safely connected to each other and working from home? And how does this happen within weeks or days?Moments that matter can be small, as well. How do we celebrate success? How do we talk to somebody when they are late with a deliverable? These are little things, done in small steps, that make the moments that matter more meaningful.


Track how individuals within your organizations embrace meaningful moments and how they deal with conflict. Provide opportunities for people to succeed by working to their strengths — someone who approaches these moments head-on will have a different approach from those who deflect in favor of stated policies or simply avoid it and focus on relationships.Understanding how your teams will handle the moments that matter and are empowered to act to their strengths will drastically improve your HR experience and encourage your best people to stay. Keep a close eye on your employee turnover and make adjustments as necessary.Related: Why Good Employees Leave — and What You Can do About ItStrengthen your values and cultureA company's culture is how things get done. In that way, your culture nearly always determines whether or not you succeed.


When we, as HR leaders, look at the core values that inform our culture, we need to ask whether they truly reflect the makeup of the organization. If they do, they can be incredibly powerful, adaptive and flexible.That doesn't mean leaders can simply copy and paste values from one organization to the next. It's important that our values — and by extension, our culture — truly reflect how people make decisions.However, everyone brings values with them as they move to new opportunities. HR leaders must help employees understand how their values align with the organization. Open, honest discussions will help individuals see where their values overlap and how they can influence their new company.Embracing the company's values and culture is a reflection of what we do during the moments that matter, and helps answer the questions of why people left their prior jobs and what brought them to you. Your eNPS scores will reflect the hard work of building the cultures and values that deliver a meaningful HR experience.


Related: How to Create a Company Culture That People Will Be Excited to JoinEmpower your HR experience makersWe hired hundreds of people at BambooHR during the pandemic. And while we were fortunate to continue growing, we also worried about building positive relationships and culture when most of those new hires never set foot in our offices.Fortunately, one of our managers began doing something extraordinary.To this day, every time her department brings on a new person, she sets up individual Zoom meetings to introduce them to every other member of the team. The manager introduces everyone and hangs on for a minute or two, then leaves so the two employees can get to know each other.


These meetings are a small investment of time for most people, but they are moments that matter. Building relationships is the only way to create a strong bond between an existing team and the new members that are joining.The people who stand up during those moments that matter and use them to teach or support others are HR experience-makers. They bridge that gap between how we think work gets done versus how we really work together. Empowering these key employees will help companies navigate the answers to those two simple questions: Why do people join your company and why did they leave?Companies that want to create a powerful HR experience for their employees have to learn how their teams handle moments that matter, build cultures based on those values and empower HR experience makers to create connections. Getting these key pieces right will not only help your teams today, but influence how you grow tomorrow.
