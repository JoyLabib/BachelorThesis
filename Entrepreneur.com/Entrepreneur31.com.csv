Today, Joshua Britton is the founder and CEO of Debut, a biotechnology company delivering ""high-performing"" cosmetic bioactive ingredients ""at unprecedented speed."" But before the startup began to innovate in the biotech space, it was just an idea, one that stemmed from ""some academic research,"" ""a lucky Uber ride"" and a ""vision for the beauty industry,"" Britton says.Image Credit: Billy Economou, BE Studios. Joshua Britton.Britton completed his Ph.D. in biochemistry and organic chemistry before furthering his studies at University of California, Irvine. Afterward, he decided to apply what he'd learned to ""this new thing called cell-free and synthetic biology,"" which refers to the processes within biotechnology that enable the creation or modification of biological organisms. Essentially, enzymes or microbes can be ""taught"" how to make powerful ingredients — including plant or flower molecules — in a reactor in a lab setting.



Naturally, the process comes with massive implications for the multi-billion-dollar beauty industry, which relies on natural ingredients for fragrance and other properties. Britton decided it was time to bring the biotech mainstream. But, of course, he also needed to fund the venture. While working at the back of his professor's lab by day, he had a side hustle driving for Uber at night to earn some extra cash. When he got to talking with one passenger and pitched her his idea, she was sold — and wrote him a $100,000 check to support his efforts.Related: EntrepreneurTV Is Now Live — and Free.

Britton's passenger would be Debut's first investor, but certainly not its last: The company raised $22.6 million in a Series A round led by Material Impact in 2021 and $40 million in a Series B round led by BOLD, the venture capital fund of L'Oréal, the world's largest cosmetics company, last year.""Whenever people want [fragrance] products, they have to effectively use agriculture to get them.""Debut has already brought the technology to market with a consumer skincare brand called Deinde, which targets inflammaging, a process associated with the aging of the human body. The products contain Naringenin, a potent polyphenol typically found in grapefruit peel that's been clinically proven to strengthen the skin barrier and reduce inflammation. According to Britton, the clinical claims allow for ""product differentiation in market,"" and many brands are coming to Debut as they seek to convert from other mainstays like Vitamin C, niacinamide and squalane.But fragrance will be Debut's next frontier, a move that coincides with growing consumer demand for transparency and natural ingredients — and concerns over the beauty industry's impact on dwindling natural resources. The majority of fragrance ingredients from fragrance houses are cultivated, perhaps from the ""from the lavender fields of France"" or the roots of a certain type of tree, Britton says, which requires land, water and agrochemical use.

One Company Dared to Go Where None Had Before — and Even Levi's Is On Board.""Whenever people want these products, they have to effectively use agriculture to get them,"" Britton explains. ""The fragrance industry has been very good at hiding the fact that the majority of fragrances are actually chemically derived. If you dig pretty deep into them, you'll find that they're made from petroleum-based synthesis. And that's just what we're looking to change.""""There could be 200 or 300 compounds in there all at different levels. And you have to be able to mimic that exactly in a bioreactor.""When it comes to fragrance, Debut is all about ""mimicking nature."" Sometimes, that means mirroring a single ingredient, a process that's not unlike making wine or beer, where a watery, sugary solution is mixed with a cell, but instead of producing wine or beer, it produces a fragrance model, Britton explains. It's a method that involves limited land use, no agrochemicals and ""very little waste.""


Of course, some scents ""are very complex mixtures"" that require a careful balance of different notes — and Debut has developed the technology to replicate those as well, Britton says. ""The nose is so sensitive that if you have a fragrance from a root, for example, what you'll see is there could be 200 or 300 compounds in there all at different levels,"" he explains. ""And you have to be able to mimic that exactly in a bioreactor. If you [don't], then you won't have the same smell, and the product won't be successful.""Related: The Future of Food: How Biotech Will Save Us AllDebut is all about putting successful products in the hands of consumers — foregoing biotech's standard horizontal integration model, whereby companies seek out a scientific solution that's then produced at a very small scale for a vertical one that emphasizes the end consumer and product from the start, according to Britton.""When we think about how to bring synthetic biology to people, it's in the form of tangible products,"" Britton says. ""That means that we have to not only do groundbreaking research but also interact with our consumers and users. We have to understand how to make formulations. We have to make physical products.""

1,The SEC's New Climate Transparency Rules Mean Sustainability Isn't Just a Buzzword Anymore — Here's How to Embrace It.,"Apr 22, 2024",Christine Wetzler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/green-entrepreneur/what-the-secs-new-climate-transparency-rules-mean-for-you/470994,"
Discussing sensitive topics can be challenging for business owners. This is one of the top three or four reasons I receive initial calls for public relations assistance addressing a hot-button issue. The latest confusing trend is sustainability and how to talk about it openly. Surprisingly, people need clarification about how much to talk about it, why it's important and when to bring it up. There's even a new word for this fear: ""greenhushing.""The most recent bit of pressure on companies regarding eco-messaging is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) recent efforts to enforce regulations that protect investors and maintain market integrity. Basically, the SEC has revised environmental transparency rules and introduced mandatory climate risk disclosures for public companies.This is the first time a sustainability mandate has emerged nationally, and it's expected to have a notable impact. In my opinion, even for private companies, it's a call to pay attention and stop neglecting this discussion.



We are entering an era where climate objectives, targets and governance frameworks will become mandatory in corporate reporting. This shift also aligns with the increasing consumer demand for environmentally and ethically sustainable products — a trend that, despite its popularity, has seen many companies struggle to translate into tangible demand.Related: Sustainability for Entrepreneurs — Why It Matters (and How to Achieve It).


The paradox of consumer demand and greenwashingConsumers' enthusiasm for sustainable products often starkly contrasts with their actual purchasing behavior. While surveys indicate a robust desire for sustainability, sales frequently need to catch up to expectations for new, environmentally conscious products. This discrepancy is exacerbated by greenwashing — where claims of environmental stewardship are not backed by practice — further eroding consumer trust and complicating the landscape for genuine initiatives.I'd counsel any company today to prepare for sustainability discussions and engagement. It is now an unavoidable topic. Because I have been a fractional CMO and external public relations consultant since 2002, I've received many calls from companies facing these watershed moments. Here is the advice I'd give a leadership team aiming to be more vocal about sustainability.The imperative of transparencyIn this context, the necessity for transparency is undeniable. Beyond mere regulatory compliance, transparency is crucial for cultivating consumer trust and loyalty. Companies must now proactively measure and refine their approaches to climate change, so this journey has got to start with a comprehensive understanding of your environmental footprint, including greenhouse gas emissions, resource utilization and waste generation.Typically facilitated by external consultants or an internal sustainability team, this foundational assessment is critical for setting realistic sustainability goals and improvement strategies. Employing standardized tools and frameworks like the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Life Cycle Assessment provides a methodical approach to this task and will result in data and benchmarks you can use consistently in your messaging efforts.


Armed with this data, specific and time-bound goals can be set that meet compliance requirements (if necessary) and drive significant environmental and social improvements. Engaging stakeholders, particularly employees, at this stage, helps bring to the surface any practical concerns and integrate these insights into the goal-setting process.Related: 70% of Consumers Say They'll Buy 'Green' Products, but Only 5% Actually Do. That's Due to a Common Marketing Mistake By Eco-Friendly Brands.The role of public relations in implementationPublic relations in the realm of sustainable messaging goes beyond just issuing press releases. PR is a strategic tool for amplifying and embedding climate-change initiatives into the corporate ethos. Compelling storytelling highlighting a company's progress and impacts on sustainability can significantly boost its reputation and foster third-party credibility.Leveraging various channels — from press releases and social media to comprehensive sustainability reports — enables these stories to reach and resonate with a broad audience, sparking engagement and advancing the sustainability agenda.


Cultivating a sustainability-centric culture internally is essential. Companies can ensure that sustainability principles are deeply ingrained in every aspect of their operation through regular educational programs, active participation in sustainability initiatives and acknowledgment of individual and team contributions. This not only reinforces the company's commitment to sustainability among employees but also mobilizes them and other stakeholders as ambassadors of these values.Continuous monitoring and evaluation of sustainability initiatives and how they are being perceived in public are vital measurement points to consider when assessing progress. Like any meaningful initiative, setting and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) allow companies to measure effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. Further, engaging with employees and stakeholders through feedback will enrich this process and provide real-world insights.It seems counterintuitive, but in my experience, challenge is often in partnership with opportunity. Tackling tough subjects can uncover opportunities for innovation, stakeholder engagement and corporate accountability that otherwise would've been dormant. Talking specifically about sustainability is not always about compliance. It is a chance to appeal to buyers and lead the market with integrity, innovation and vision.

2,AI Will Radically Transform the Workplace — Here's How HR Teams Can Prepare for It,"Apr 19, 2024",Alex Goryachev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/ai-will-transform-the-workplace-heres-how-hr-can-prepare/472581,"
Our workplaces are about to undergo an unprecedented level of transformation, and HR will take center stage. Artificial intelligence will dramatically reshape HR in a way that goes beyond recruiting, hiring and talent management. Leadership teams at all levels need to embrace this change to transform and lead their organizations forward.It's the people, and not the technology, that makes AI initiatives a success. Intrapreneurs, in particular, are the driving force behind it. As I shared in Fearless Innovation, I noticed this when I was working on the innovation agenda for the Great Places to Work study — the most innovative companies were those that had a leadership team that was embracing intrapreneurship and were open to change.HR is the beating heart of any organization, and as such, it needs to take center stage in both adopting and leading ethical and innovative AI transformation across the organization.



Related: How Artificial Intelligence Is Reinventing Human Resources4 tectonic shifts AI will drive in HR1. A new wave of massive reskilling


As AI becomes more prominent across business functions, the need for new skills will only grow. Forty percent of enterprise leaders believe that their workforce would need to reskill as a result of AI and machine learning. In fact, research shows almost a third of all hours worked in the U.S. could be automated by 2030.All of us need to reskill to some extent to be relevant in the AI era. Not only would people need to re-train, but generative AI is introducing a whole host of professions that have been non-existent until recently, from AI ethicists to human-AI interaction designers. Some of these roles might sound futuristic, yet they are becoming increasingly relevant as technology advances.2. The great restructureAs automation takes center stage across more business functions, there will be the inevitable need for organizations to restructure and rethink how they work. This transition will not only involve the integration of new technologies but also introduce a shift in the workforce dynamics. Intrapreneurs will need to identify gaps both in skills and operational processes and forge brand-new roles for themselves and those they manage. HR must play a key role in enabling a smooth and easy transition in this regard. The transition will not be smooth or easy, and it's only HR that has the capability to make it impactful.


3. Arrival of ""digital humans""""Digital human"" may sound like an oxymoron, but that's the term that's starting to appear in business and operational plans. More roles, regardless of industry, are becoming digitally enhanced where some form of AI assistance is embedded in their everyday work. A real-life example is the introduction of the digital nurse — AI-powered healthcare agents which have already been proven to outperform human nurses in certain tasks.Imagine the impact these digital roles will have on the workforce the more sophisticated and prevalent they become. Eventually, HR will need to create policies and systems in place that account for this new type of ""staff augmentation.""4. Regulating the robot


The threat of AI bias and misuse is serious. Not only can the technology put many jobs at peril, but potential improper implementation can expose organizations to serious liability and negatively affect the workforce. From avoiding bias to inclusivity, HR teams play a critical role in the ethical deployment and management of AI technologies.HR professionals will be tasked with navigating the delicate balance between leveraging AI for efficiency and ensuring that its application upholds fairness, privacy and non-discrimination.Related: How to Successfully Implement AI into Your Business — Overcoming Challenges and Building a Future-Ready TeamWhat HR intrapreneurs must do to embrace AI the right wayThe future of work is being shaped by AI adoption, and its success hinges on the right approach from the outset. My experience shows that for successful organizations, one universal trait stands out: the presence of change agents. Every organization, regardless of size, benefits from intrapreneurs who are open to change and committed to spearheading transformation efforts. These intrapreneurs are pivotal in driving the future of work, as they help orchestrate the integration of new technologies into their business models.


HR and talent leaders should harness this dynamic, encouraging a symbiotic relationship with intrapreneurs to develop customized solutions for AI adoption, ensuring that they are not just keeping pace with technological advances but are actively shaping their trajectory.Securing a seat at the table:HR should take a proactive stance in the adoption of AI, even if it is still in its early stages within your organization. By securing a position at the forefront of the AI initiative, HR can and should facilitate and guide the entire organization in embracing this significant change.As AI has the potential to impact every facet of the organization, it is imperative for HR to not only understand and advocate for this technology but also lead its integration across all departments. HR should encourage and support intrapreneurs and all employees to leverage AI in their daily tasks, demonstrating its value not just for operational efficiency but for personal and professional growth as well.


Master the technology:To effectively navigate and regulate AI, HR must first understand it thoroughly. Grasping the full potential of this technology is crucial for reaping its extensive benefits. HR plays a vital role in identifying the necessary tools and skills that employees must acquire and then integrating these learnings into daily work practices.Before implementing AI more broadly, HR should initiate comprehensive training programs that not only educate but also reassure employees about AI's role in the future of the business. By leading these educational initiatives, HR can shape the structure and effectiveness of these programs, ensuring they meet the needs of the organization and its workforce.Related: 3 Ways to Prepare Your Business For an AI Future


Looking aheadGenerative AI has the transformative potential to redefine the business landscape, but realizing this vast potential hinges on more than just the adoption of technology. It critically depends on the talent within the workforce, driven by HR and bold intrapreneurs. These visionary leaders don't just implement new tools; they exemplify their use, demonstrating the profound impact of AI across every level of the organization.HR plays a pivotal role in fostering this environment, enabling intrapreneurs to guide and inspire every individual they touch. Together, they turn each employee into a catalyst for change, igniting a widespread passion for innovation that deeply resonates and sustains long-term success.

3,They Designed One Simple Product With a 'Focus on Human Health' — and Made $40 Million Last Year,"Apr 18, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/simple-health-focused-product-led-to-40m-in-revenue-in-2023/472859,"
Branch Basics founders Marilee Nelson, Allison Evans and Kelly Love ""never set out to sell soap,"" let alone launch a cleaning brand that would generate tens of millions in annual sales.But the company's ""mission to create healthy homes"" while keeping cleaning routines simple continues to resonate with customers — 50% of whom are returning, according to the brand. Among other select accessories, Branch Basics offers a comprehensive ""starter kit,"" which features a fragrance-free, ""plant- and mineral-based"" cleaning concentrate along with various glass bottles that can be filled with different combinations of the solution and water to meet specific needs: from wiping down a bathroom counter to doing a load of laundry.Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics. Marilee Nelson, left; Allison Evans, center; Kelly Love, right.



The story of how the company came to be begins with Nelson, who, after battling chronic illness, was told that she'd never have kids and needed to go on dialysis. Nelson wasn't sold on the prognosis and turned to another doctor who used ""food as medicine"" — a leap of faith that ""literally changed her life,"" eradicating those health issues and even inspiring her to become a medicinal cook. Later, after her 10-year-old son was exposed to pesticides and suffered brain and immune system damage, she took another hard look at environmental factors that might contribute to healing.""His immune system had been so damaged that he could not detoxify the things we're all exposed to every day,"" Nelson says, ""and he would have extreme reactions. I took one box and thought, Oh, I'll keep my favorite perfumes in here, favorite skincare products and things, in the closet, and when he gets better, I will bring them back out."" However, according to Nelson, the box's removal made such a significant difference that it showed her ""how important it is to [recognize] how powerful these chemicals are."" Nelson's son started to heal, and when word of mouth spread, she developed a course to help other people better understand the products in their homes.


Related: How This Pediatrician-Turned-Entrepreneur Transformed a Health Policy into a Consumer Product for Kids""Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel.""Nelson's niece, Allison, had a similar experience. Diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, Evans was told by doctors that ""no lifestyle change"" could help her heal and to take birth control indefinitely; in college, she faced a range of symptoms — muscle aches, loss of motor skills and more — and says she was prescribed numerous medications to no avail. At the time, Evans and her aunt Marilee weren't particularly close, but she consulted with her and realized that some simple lifestyle changes just might help her feel better.According to Evans, removing certain products with synthetic ingredients and eating whole foods did help her condition improve, and as graduation neared, she decided to spend eight weeks with Nelson in the Texas Hill Country, where she'd learn more about healthy living from her aunt. Her friend Kelly joined her, and despite being in good health, also noticed a transformation — ""My dry itchy eyes, headaches, muscle aches are all gone,"" Love recalls, adding, ""the more I learned about all this, it just made sense to me: Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel, how we think, how we act.""

The organization also notes that even naturally occurring fragrances, such as citrus, ""can react to produce dangerous pollutants indoors.""


""Nontoxic"" labels on products aren't the be-all and end-all either, Nelson notes. After all, ""it's the dose that makes the poison,"" as the Swiss physician and chemist Paracelsus said nearly 500 years ago. According to Nelson, looking at the ingredients themselves is key. The founders want people to feel empowered to examine any product — from Branch Basics or another company — and understand the ingredients being used. To that end, they offer a $99 ""Toss the Toxins"" course to ""walk you through a step-by-step process to remove products that pollute your home and body.""Related: Go Green Or Go Home: 3 Ways Industrial Facilities Can Clean Up Their Acts""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce.""Branch Basics' ""minimalist"" product line is meant to make the whole process easier — and save time.

It's so safe it can be used on the skin.""


""Our 32-ounce liquid concentrate cleans your windows, cleans your baby's bottom, cleans your produce, takes off your eye makeup, cleans your countertops [or] your hardwood floors — whatever depending on the the ratio,"" Evans adds.The approach is resonating with customers, the company reports. Gross sales grew around 42% year over year from 2022 to 2023, with revenue hitting $40 million last year. The company currently has more than 50,000 product subscribers, 600,000 email subscribers and 10,000 five-star reviews on its concentrate and Oxygen Boost, which amplifies the power of the concentrate ""for tough cleaning jobs.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics""We know that human health is our priority... [that] keeps everything aligned.""The company's laser-focused commitment to its customers — it reportedly responds to every single customer question on Instagram and TikTok — no doubt fosters a lot of that brand loyalty. What's more, Branch Basics boasts a 6% referral rate compared to the industry's 2% average.""We approach everything [by asking] What do we want?"" Love says. ""What's missing in the market? What do we, as people who are moms, as people who are health-conscious, need and want? Because, most likely, other people would need and want those things, too.

AI tools have the potential to improve marketing efficiency and innovation, but leaders must understand what can be outsourced to technology and what requires a human touch. If you're talking about more detailed and technical content assets, these must be developed with the significant control and insight that only human writers and subject matter experts can provide.Strong marketing and PR programs need human skills, ranging from emotional intelligence, voice and tone, to contextual adaptation. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini, and other AI tools are capable of stunningly fast outputs, to be sure. However, they'll never be humans with a lifetime of human experiences interacting with other humans.AI's (limited) role in content creation — and why it should stay that way

5,Successful Brands Use These 4 Radical Practices to Attract Loyal Customers,"Apr 17, 2024",Adam Kroener,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-successful-brands-should-embrace-radical-transparency/472395,"
In today's marketplace, consumer trust has become paramount for businesses seeking lasting success. A study by Edelman found that 81% of buyers cite brand trust as a deciding factor in their loyalties and purchasing behaviors. With the proliferation of information sources, companies can no longer maintain opaque practices obscuring key details. They must operate in full transparency to earn customer confidence and allegiance.As the CEO of Carbliss, an alcoholic beverage brand, I've witnessed firsthand how radical transparency around all production and business operations drives powerful consumer loyalty and business growth. From our earliest days, we committed to an unwavering open-book approach that has helped cement valuable, long-lasting relationships with our customer base. Below are the four criteria and best practices we prioritize to maintain transparency and customer loyalty.1. Hands-on customer dialogueToday's empowered consumers can easily see right through that disingenuous smokescreen. What they crave from the brands they embrace is true candor about every key aspect, including the ingredients, sourcing practices, pricing rationale, regulatory challenges, and more underpinning the products they consume.



One key way I nurture this culture of authenticity is by being directly involved with a huge volume of customer inquiries myself. This past year alone, I answered around 8,000 emails from Carbliss distributors, retailers, consumers and fans.Ongoing candid dialogue is critical for comprehensively understanding how customers perceive our brand identity, product qualities, and customer service experiences in an unfiltered way.


Through raw, unapologetic honesty in these interactions, even when the facts may be unfavorable or unpleasant for the customer to accept, we actively cultivate invaluable trust. The simple truth is that you cannot build enduring customer loyalty through automated and impersonal responses or convoluted corporate jargon.Related: Don't Talk to Another Customer Until You Learn This Simple Customer Service Secret2. Shining light on complexitiesEmbracing this level of radical transparency means being prepared sometimes to face intense scrutiny from confused, perhaps deflated customers seeking simpler truths. We've found that the payoff is an extraordinarily powerful brand reputation anchored in truth that ultimately breeds sacred trust and loyalty.At my company, we willingly spotlight the very details that other brands may conceal or try to downplay, like our need to use ""artificially colored"" labels on cans despite the colors being derived from natural sources, like the brilliant blue of butterfly pea flowers.


We take every opportunity to explain the nuances of regulatory complexities that result in obligatory technical labeling jargon. We balance that by reaffirming our core principles of prioritizing high-quality ingredients that we legitimately consume ourselves and provide to friends and family without hesitation.3. A culture of authenticityAs you grow and scale, it's important to maintain transparency throughout your team. This can be in the form of understanding the intricacies of the product, the runway to profitability, or the purpose of their unique role in the overall strategy. Our employees, regardless of role, deeply understand the ingredients, sourcing, and production methods behind our products so they can convey that knowledge accurately and credibly in their customer-interactions activities.Our detailed FAQ content clarifies common misconceptions, from our avoidance of artificial colors to our premium pricing rationale based on operational costs and premium product positioning. While some buyers may be dismayed at certain realities we present, we insist on honesty because we've learned it's the only path to fostering long-term customer understanding, respect and allegiance.Related: How to Lead With Authenticity and Build a Thriving Workplace


4. Transparent best practicesFor companies in any industry aspiring to foster powerful brand loyalty by operating in total transparency, below are my personal principles:Be unconditionally open about all business practices by prioritizing clear, forthright communication with customers at every opportunityHave customer-interaction teams be prepared to personally respond to every inquiry with unvarnished candor, excluding no unpleasant truthsThoroughly educate and train all employees on the paramount importance of authenticity in all their customer-interaction words and actions.Embrace both positive and negative customer feedback as a welcome opportunity to demonstrate a real commitment to constant improvement.Ensure all marketing content and messaging accurately reflects the true nature of your products, services, and practices without ambiguity.Be unafraid to openly discuss your company's genuine challenges, as this humanizes the brand relationship.Related: 5 Examples of Companies Succeeding Through TransparencyWeathering backlash to cultivate loyaltyCertainly, this radical embrace of transparency sometimes means facing backlash from those who are displeased with newly revealed information that clashes with their expectations. Cultivated ironclad trust and loyalty far outweigh any short-term friction. When you deal truthfully and withhold nothing from your customers, you attract buyers aligned with your values who appreciate your courage and unwavering integrity.If you're ready to foster true customer loyalty and propel sustainable growth, it's time to embrace radical transparency across your organization. Don't complicate realities; shine a light on every aspect of your products, operations, and business practices. Deal in truth relentlessly, even when facing scrutiny. Your authentic soul and unwavering integrity will attract devoted brand advocates aligned with your values.

Responses have been edited and condensed for clarity.Image Credit: Courtesy of CCRSP INC. Dr. Amareen Dhaliwal. How were you introduced to EdTech, and what inspired you to start your side hustle in that space?When I had the opportunity to tutor STEM classes in college, I quickly realized teaching was my passion. I excelled on the newly formatted MCAT and decided I wanted to help students achieve higher scores (one of my students even reached the 99th percentile!). A college friend suggested I create a pre-med club focused on innovative learning experiences, which sparked my interest in curriculum development and the use of learning management systems supported by professionals in medical and scientific fields. The idea to build a website and offer tutoring services emerged after I hosted a successful MCAT seminar, and my commitment to tutoring in college laid the foundation for my future endeavors.



My tutoring venture expanded into a holistic coaching experience, which focused on the psychology of studying, anxiety management and wellness, including the utilization of 24-hour planners, exercise and nutrition. This comprehensive approach led me to pursue a psychiatry residency. Despite not initially seeing myself as a business person, the need for innovation in MCAT preparation drove me to entrepreneurship.Related: Best New Shows for Entrepreneurs (Streaming Free)


After collaborating with peers in clinical trials, we launched online clinical research courses, aiming for excellence and continuous improvement. This endeavor was more than a business; it was about making a meaningful impact and addressing broader needs. CCRPS INC was founded to address the underemployment of foreign medical graduates and healthcare professionals in the U.S. despite their impressive credentials. Together with colleagues in clinical trials, we aimed to provide educational courses to help these individuals secure entry-level positions that offer both competitive salaries and a sense of purpose. We established a strong online presence, developed expert-led courses and focused on education and career preparation. Our commitment to quality content quickly earned us recognition and trust, positioning CCRPS as a leader in the field.What were some of the first steps you took to get CCRPS off the ground?First, we identified our niche by recognizing a gap for non-clinical medical professionals seeking valuable career paths. We built a user-friendly website and formed partnerships with providers, building trust by seeking out video and audio reviews from graduate students to help other students have a better idea of our comprehensive and in-depth educational approach. We collaborated with experts to create high-quality course materials and secured the necessary accreditations to establish credibility. We also offered comprehensive career support and focused on quality education, which spurred organic growth through referrals and a robust online presence.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Building and growing a startup requires constant ""figuring out"" of challenges. The biggest challenge was meeting and surpassing our clients' needs so they could continue to grow. Additionally, delegating to the right people requires trial and error; you can't expect to get it right from day one!

How long did it take you to see consistent revenue from your work within EdTech?From the outset, our business achieved net profitability, a testament to our compelling curriculum. Starting with one in-person student whose enrollment funded our initial website and SEO efforts, we adopted a strategy that allowed us to reinvest early profits into expanding our operations. This approach was essential in both our foundational stages and as we scaled, particularly with the MCAT company.Despite promising early enrollments, our focus has always been on student success and quality education rather than merely generating revenue. This commitment enabled us to reduce prices over time, making education more accessible and aligning with our belief in the importance of affordable education. Engaging students meaningfully requires commitment, evidenced by our successful partnerships with contract research organizations and our lean yet effective operational model.How do you balance your entrepreneurial pursuits with a demanding career in medicine?Following a year-long hiatus to launch CCRPS, I transitioned back into my residency.

7,Jon Bon Jovi and His Son Jesse Want You to Play 'Pink Pong' With Their Top-Rated Rosé This Summer. You Game?,"Apr 15, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-jon-bon-jovi-and-his-son-jesses-rose-is-built-for-fun/472478,"
This week The CEO Series brought us to New York City where I got to play a heated game of ""pink pong"" against Jesse Bongiovi, the co-founder of Hampton Water, the highest-rated French rosé in America. Jesse started this company with his dad, Jon Bon Jovi, who you may know as the world-famous musician, back in 2018 and since its launch, the brand has won a ton of accolades and has stocked a ton of wine fridges — it's currently the country's third best-selling French rosé.Watch the video above to learn all about the launch and explosive growth of this company, and to find out which of us was crowned the pink pong champ!Origin of the company""I came up with the concept back in 2016. My family had a place out in East Hampton, on the east end of Long Island, for basically my whole life. And the running joke out there was that people drank more rosé than they drank water. My family was no different. And once I turned 21, I started to realize that my friends were showing up with bottles of rosé at bonfires and pool parties. But they were not buying the high-end, classic stuff. They were too intimidated, and it was too expensive. But the liquid was nowhere near as quality as these high-end French rosés, so I started to form this idea that you could create a lifestyle brand, and bridge the gap between high-quality wines and brands like White Girl Rosé and Babe Rosé. So I designed the label, designed the bottle, and came up with this concept of the Hampton Life. We partnered with Gerard Bertrand in 2018 to make the liquid. It is a French Provence style rosé, grown in the Languedoc region.""Related: A Look Inside the Company That Is Making $500 Million a Year Serving Italian Beef Sandwiches Made Famous by 'The Bear'A family passion""For us, this is not a celebrity brand. It's a family business. And the important thing about our storytelling as a brand has always been the father-son story. Our message has always been that we're a French rosé that speaks to you in a way that no other French rosé does. We have incredible ratings. We have a unique-looking name and label. And oh, by the way, this is the guy that brought it to you. And so that's always been the cherry on top. It's never been what we lead with. Now, does it help that my father is who he is? I'm not too proud to say that it's not a great way to get our foot in the door. But what we realized right away is that all the press and attention is great, but in the end, it needs to taste great and that's what has people coming back to buy another bottle.""



Thinking outside the bottle""This brand is about fun. Playing pink pong and things like that. No other rosé brand is doing this kind of stuff. For me, it's all about inspiring you to have a good time while you're drinking this. Are you creating great memories? Are you spending time with those that you love? We want to break down that barrier of entry to make it so that it's approachable, to make it so that it's fun, to make it so that a 23-year-old who has never bought a high-quality 90-point-rated wine wants to give it a try.""Check out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

Greg Kerr.When did you start your side hustle, and what inspired it? I'd been running a literary-inspired apparel brand, Miles to go, and had begun making enamel pins as one of the products we offered back in 2015. Some friends began asking me for help to get them made because of how confusing overseas production can be. Around that time, my wife and I decided we'd try to have a baby, and on the day we found out we were pregnant (Father's Day in 2016), I bought a domain for Pin Game Strong. I saw there was a demand for help within the artist community, and I initially thought if we could put a few hundred dollars into our daughter's 529, it would be a win. The original intention was that we'd keep running the apparel brand and help people make enamel pins on the side. I quickly recognized that there was a huge gap in the market to offer retail-quality merchandise. Everything was focused on promotional products, and with my background in running a brand, I thought it was important to focus on products people would be proud to bring to market. There was a need to go beyond promotional and into fully custom.



Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a MonthWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I'd seen a post on an episode of the Adventures in Design podcast talking about how someone should help people make pins. At that point, I had made thousands of pins for myself but hadn't thought about offering it as a service. I offered to help anyone interested and got a quick response. Word of mouth spread, and I saw that people wanted a safe outlet for making pins. Knowing we had a child on the way was the catalyst to buy a domain and throw together some pricing. I was familiar with how promotional products companies price their products and decided I'd try to beat them. Once the site was up, things started happening quickly, and within a few days, I had an order for 1,000 enamel pins from someone I had no link to at all.Image Credit: Alchemy MerchWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As things started moving quickly, I had a lot of struggles with my time and how to balance it with the brand that had been paying my family's bills for the past few years. We went from $0 to $1 million in sales in 18 months, and it was just me. I did all of it: managing the business, handling all orders, communicating with factories and all art. It was a lot to handle. We didn't spend a cent on advertising in the first two years. Word of mouth was spreading and keeping me as busy as I could handle. My first step was to get some help on handling art files so I could keep working on customer interactions. I wish I'd looked for help sooner, but when I finally did get the help, it freed me up to focus on sales more.

How much did the side hustle earn? Within six months, we'd surpassed the monthly revenue of the brand I'd been working on for eight years prior — and it kept growing. Once we saw how quickly it was moving, the secondary goal became to replace my wife's income by the time she'd have to decide whether to go back to work or not after our daughter was born. We hit that goal and kept on running upward.You've since turned the side hustle into a full-time business, Alchemy Merch. What's been key to that growth, and what does revenue look like now? We hit a point where I needed to let go of the previous business so I could focus all of my time on making products for others. We started as Pin Game Strong and kept on adding new products in: patches, acrylic keychains, washi tape, etc., and the name just felt too limiting. We'd built up solid name recognition but knew it was time to grow beyond pins. Growth has been challenging for the past few years. When Covid hit, we got knocked back twice. First, we had delays in factories returning to work that caused a lot of refunds for events lined up. Then in March, they returned, and the U.S. got hit with lockdowns. A lot of our business is driven by events. Artists sell at fairs, cons and other events, and corporations will [make items] for conferences or team events. Pre-Covid, we were up only, and since then, we've been working hard to really focus on tightening up what we do and how we do it to help stand out. Although we have had growth the past two years, it's not until this year that we are seeing the energy back in people to create again. We have been floating right under $2 million a year in sales for the past two years and are hoping to finally break past it and continue to grow.Related: Don't let your good idea go to waste.

Making not only products, but also full-on retail-ready merchandise can have a lot of obstacles for creators, and our goal is to remove those and help guide them. Working with other creative people all day is constantly inspiring. Our goal as a team is to collaborate and elevate a customer's project.


As you consider the business's future, what are you most excited about? I'm excited about expanding the types of products we offer and continuing to help creators. There is not a lot of direct competition in our field and at our size, so the chance of someone looking to acquire us is low. I hope to keep building a company that continues to provide for my family and our employees and keeps helping people.Related: She Used Her Kids' College Fund to Build a Side Hustle, But the Product Was 'Unsellable' — Here's How She Got Back on Track for $100 Million in SalesImage Credit: Alchemy MerchWhat's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Although I didn't actively think about it at the time, Alchemy Merch is a marriage of all of my skill sets and hits on what I really want to be spending my time doing. It's tough running a business in the after-hours if you have a 9-5, but if you really want it, you need to put in the work. If you are thinking about starting a side hustle, really think about what you want to do and if there is a need for it or space in the market for you to improve upon what is out there. The market told me how badly Alchemy Merch was needed, and I responded. When it became clear that this had legs, I never looked back. I've been self-employed for the past 20 years, so it gave me some clarity to run with the momentum and recognize what we were doing had real value.

9,HR Could Be Withholding The Critical Data You Need to Boost Retention and Drive Results. Here's How to Take Control and Gain Access,"Apr 10, 2024",Ryan Wong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/hr-could-be-withholding-the-critical-data-you-need-to-drive/472002,"
Have you ever waited longer than you'd hoped for a package? You've experienced the proverbial ""last mile"" problem. A parcel zips all the way across the country, but then somehow, it gets stranded at the post office a few blocks from your home — so close, but still out of reach.To borrow a term from the field of logistics, HR departments have a ""last mile"" problem, too, and it's just as frustrating. Companies are generating more people data than ever — insights about everything from how employees work best to ways to boost retention — but that intel isn't getting into the hands of the managers who need it most when it's needed.For example, let's say a manager needs to know what kind of raise to give a valued employee. The clock is ticking. HR has relevant data, but often, it takes weeks for someone to tally industry averages and cross-reference the employee's specifics. In a fast-moving business environment where competition for top talent is scarce, companies can't afford such delays, which can end up impacting the bottom line.



Related: A Practical Guide to Increasing Startup Success Through Data AnalyticsThat lag reflects a broader sluggishness in getting people's data into the right hands. A recent global survey found that about three out of four companies are driving business innovation with data. But less than half have created a data-driven organization, the key to unlocking insights about people, their most precious resource.


As the co-founder of a business that helps companies use people's data to drive results, I know there's a better way. Here's why the last mile problem exists and how businesses can solve it to ensure timely delivery of HR data that makes an impact.What's behind HR's last mile problem?The fundamental reason HR data doesn't travel that last mile: It's languishing in silos.Essentially, there's a wall between HR and the rest of the company. Many HR departments hoard their people data, on the grounds that it's personal and confidential. At large companies, this siloing problem even happens within HR itself. Recruiting, talent management, compliance, learning and development, compensation — all have their own data fiefdoms.To make things worse, that data may not be very meaningful to anyone except HR pros. Even when it is shared, it often lacks context and is hard to interpret. That's partly because it's rife with HR jargon, not framed in the language the rest of the business speaks. Don't know what utilization analysis is, or featherbedding, or negligent referral? You're not alone.


Even familiar concepts like turnover rates can be confusing or misleading in the absence of context. HR might report that your department has a 10% turnover rate. Sounds terrible — but is it really? How does that compare to competitors? Is it impacting revenue or performance? The underlying problem: data is shared in the language of HR, not the language of business.Companies that lack the ability to connect HR data with business impact risk falling behind. Over a three-year period, businesses that made sophisticated use of people analytics reported more than 80% higher average profits than their less data-savvy peers.How to solve HR's last mile problem Getting over HR's last mile hurdle calls for both a culture and technology shift.Culturally, HR leaders need education around the idea that using people analytics doesn't mean sharing personal information — far from it. In fact, the data in question can be readily aggregated and anonymized, so nothing sensitive gets divulged.


It's also essential to drive home the message that HR's contributions can and should go well beyond compliance and administration. After all, people are a company's biggest line item and greatest resource. HR is ideally positioned to help connect the dots between talent and results.Technology can help, too, especially when it comes to getting the right insights in the right hands. Believe it or not, many companies still rely on old-fashioned charts and spreadsheets to manage HR data. I've seen how this creates challenges for frontline managers, many of whom lack the time, training or inclination to sit down and crunch numbers.The good news is that new generative AI technology is finally helping liberate that data. Using the latest tools, managers can quickly find the answers they need by asking a question in plain English. Is an employee being paid fairly? Rather than poring over a dense chart or waiting for a data analyst to weigh in, managers can get answers in real-time, with data specific to their company and the employee in question, along with industry benchmarks.Finally, the best companies find ways to integrate people data into the rhythms and routines of daily company culture. Instead of quarterly blasts, they share insights with decision-makers on a consistent basis, whether it's weekly or monthly. They're selective, tailoring reports to the department or business need in question, and they put the data in context by telling the story behind it in business language. If turnover will be 10% this year, what does that number mean for the company, and how does it stack up against the competition?


Related: Using Data Analytics Will Transform Your Business. Here's How.The payoff for closing the last mileWhen people data gets where it needs to go, fast, the entire organization benefits.HR can now focus on the ""art"" of the profession rather than rote, time-consuming requests for information that can easily be handled by analytics tools. That means fewer hours spent on admin, compliance and tickets — and more time for the people who drive the business.Managers get the information they need when they need it. For instance, they can use people analytics to find out who's most likely to leave the company before it actually happens. Thanks to today's generative AI tools, which many executives see as a profit booster, that's no longer a guessing game. Ask, and you get a straight answer about individual employees' engagement levels based on data pulled from chat, email, calendars and other workplace apps.


For the business at large, fixing HR's last mile problem equates to a sea change in efficiency and performance. Talent decisions can be made in real time, not months (or even years) too late. Best guesses and gut instinct give way to data-backed insights. Ultimately, the ability to draw a straight line from people to business results boosts customer satisfaction, employee retention and the bottom line.Granted, we're not there yet. Institutional biases linger — from HR's warehouse mentality toward data to frontline managers' aversion to being analyzed and judged.Wariness of AI is another potential blocker, especially in the context of privacy and misinformation — areas where the right guardrails are essential. (At my company, for example, we do ethics testing of our generative AI tools to ensure that their guidance is free of racial and other bias.)Ultimately, however, solving HR's last mile problem is well within reach. We have the data. We have the tools to share it safely and responsibly. Now, it's time to get it into the hands of the leaders who need it most.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Danny Trejo, an insurance agent who started grow-at-home citrus business Via Citrus in 2020.Where did you find the inspiration for your side hustle? I started working on Via Citrus shortly after moving to New York City, inspired by the nostalgia for the citrus groves of Central Florida. I grew up on a large citrus nursery filled with the sights and scents of orange blooms — a vivid part of my childhood that I always cherished.



While I had always wanted to be part of the citrus nursery business, I wanted to contribute in a different way that not only brought value to the business but also meaning to myself. The distance from my roots, coupled with the longing for the familiar fragrance of orange blossoms, sparked the idea to share this piece of my home with others. It was then that I realized I could educate others on how to grow citrus trees — no matter where they were located — by opening an online store.Related: What to Watch - The Most Inspiring Shows for EntrepreneursImage Credit: Courtesy of Via CitrusWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground? What were some challenges? Starting out, I faced the daunting task of setting up an ecommerce platform. With no prior experience in websites, I had to start from scratch, learning the ins and outs of online retail, from design to development.


Simultaneously, I tackled the important step of defining our product line. Given the vast diversity of citrus varieties ranging from oranges, lemons, limes, tangerines and grapefruits, I had to make decisions about which to offer. This involved researching citrus growth habits and the unique selling points of each citrus type to curate a selection that would appeal to a broad audience.Equally important was determining the size of the plants Via Citrus was going to offer. This decision was a delicate balance. On one hand, offering plants that were too small could lead to customer disappointment, as they might not immediately appreciate the beauty or potential of their purchase. On the other hand, larger plants, while more visually appealing and closer to bearing fruit, would incur prohibitive shipping costs, making them less accessible to a wider audience. This required careful consideration of the growth stages of citrus plants, shipping logistics and customer expectations to select sizes that offered the best value for our customers and the business.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?


The first couple of months saw under $1,000 each thanks to family and friends who supported the launch of Via Citrus. However, it wasn't long before we were averaging about $7,000 per month in revenue, with May (Mother's Day) and December (Christmas) being our busiest.What does average monthly revenue look like now? We see $36,000 per month in sales. May and December continue to be our best sales months.What do you enjoy most about this side hustle? It keeps me in touch with my roots — pun intended — by working on this project with my dad. Growing up surrounded citrus, where my dad dedicated over 40 years of his life, has deeply influenced my appreciation for the cultivation and care of citrus. Now as the person behind Via Citrus, I am able to maintain and strengthen this bond despite being six hours away from the farm. Via Citrus serves as a vital link to my father and the work he continues to do. He's not just the grower — he's out there selecting and packaging each citrus plant we send out to our customers. This hands-on approach from him ensures that every plant we deliver carries a piece of our family's dedication and love for citrus cultivation.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Via CitrusAs you consider the business's future, what are you most excited about? The booming plant industry and the significant steps we are taking to grow alongside it get me excited. As our world gets more digital, people are turning to gardening and indoor plants for both hobby and home decor to take a break from their screens. This trend presents a promising opportunity for Via Citrus, as our unique offering of citrus plants aligns with this growing interest.What is particularly thrilling is our recent purchase of new land for the development of additional greenhouses. These new greenhouses will have the capacity to increase our variety of citrus offers, improve our cultivation process and ensure we can meet the growing demand from our customers.

For me, I wanted to get everything right the first time: the perfect-looking website, the perfect variety, size, packaging, images, etc. I was spending too much time perfecting. Perfection is somewhat of a double-edged sword. No one was seeing my website or buying my citrus plants. Therefore, my quest for perfection limited my ability to get any consumer feedback to make anything better. Eventually, after years of planning and perfecting, I launched the website. The few customers who did engage became invaluable sources of feedback. Their insights helped us refine our offers in ways I hadn't anticipated.It's important to get your product out there, even if it's a limited run of your product. Early feedback provides incredible insights and can steer your side hustle in a direction that better meets market needs and preferences.

11,What Big Brands Can Learn From Mom & Pop Shops to Connect With Their Customers,"Apr 3, 2024",Ben Crudo,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/what-big-brands-can-learn-from-mom-and-pop-stores-to/470830,"
For online retailers, the pandemic sales surge is officially ancient history.Direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are filing for bankruptcy. Luxury retailers that raced online, like Louis Vuitton and Chanel, are licking their wounds. Globally, digital retail's share of total sales has flatlined at around 20%. If you're a big brand, the prognosis can look pretty grim unless, that is, you start thinking small. Online brands that are surviving and thriving are increasingly taking a page out of the playbook of much smaller retailers — especially when it comes to tech.As the founder of an agency that helps brands with ecommerce strategy, I've seen how smaller players are driven by the need to act fast and do more with less. That means adopting new and cost-effective tech before their larger peers. Resourceful and creative, retail small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are also intimately involved with their customers online. And unlike large companies, they don't have internal silos blocking their digital progress.



All of those strengths hold valuable lessons for big and growing retailers. Here's what they can learn from smaller brands when it comes to harnessing retail tech.Related: 4 Ways to Understand the Rise and Fall of DTC Brands


For your ecommerce platform, think speed and convenienceBecause they have to move fast, small retailers typically opt for an ecommerce platform that's robust, nimble and adaptable. The quicker they can stand up a site, and the less technical expertise required to sustain it, the better.Legacy enterprise platforms — costly, clunky and hard-to-customize — have long been the go-to for big brands. In the past, these were the only tools capable of reliably handling the volume of sales and SKUs of a major retailer. But that situation has changed.When the clothing retailer Banana Republic launched its furniture and home decor wing late last year, it went with an ecommerce platform originally known for serving small creators and entrepreneurs, Shopify.Why? At this point, every up-to-date platform has lots of bells and whistles. What actually matters isn't individual features as much as usability and flexibility. Does the platform have low barriers to launching a retail site? Does it have a robust app ecosystem that's integrated with its services? (Delivering on that front is Shopify, which has a marketplace of roughly 3,000 apps.) When it comes time to customize your site, does the platform have a host of agency and technology partners who can help get the job done?Think of choosing a platform like buying a car. You want something reliable, safe and easy to service — even if you may not know exactly how everything works under the hood.Outsource tech setup and customizationUnlike many other big retailers, Banana Republic also knew better than to build its own online platform. Major brands often fall into that trap, hiring huge engineering teams tasked with keeping ecommerce in-house.


News flash: Retailers aren't technology companies. They wouldn't rely on their in-house counsel to handle sensitive legal matters. So how is it any different for retail tech, a point of direct contact with customers?Retail SMBs are big fans of brand-new technology, with two-thirds saying they're open to embracing it. But startups know that the highest value comes from time spent on strategy, not getting in the weeds of implementation. That's why it's often better to outsource tech setup to an ecommerce agency.Because such firms typically deal with many different businesses, they have no shortage of tips and tricks to offer clients.

Invest in a direct line to customersSmaller online retailers also understand the power of using tech to connect directly with customers. This, after all, was the original promise of DTC commerce. Instead of sending your customers to a big box store or other middleman, you could cultivate a direct, personal relationship — providing better service and building lifetime loyalty in the process.To make the most of this pipeline, small retailers have long embraced tools that facilitate conversational commerce, i.e., one-on-one digital conversations with consumers. Way back in 2016, online clothing retailer Spring created its own live messaging and personal shopping service.Today, this trend continues. Because video, generative AI and other newer technologies for connecting with shoppers are affordable and accessible, smaller retailers have been first out of the gate with them, too. For example, energy drink startup EBoost is using shopper data to create ""digital twins"" of customers, then harnessing generative AI to chat with them, gaining insights into shoppers' future behavior.Small brands also excel at personalizing customer experiences and using technology to take this to the next level. This can take the form of everything from virtual appointments with in-store salespeople to fully personalized product recommendations based on customer history and preferences.Besides shrinking customer acquisition costs by as much as 50%, personalization can boost revenue by 5 to 15% and marketing ROI by 10 to 30%. Seven out of 10 consumers expect companies to offer personalized interactions, and three-quarters get frustrated when they don't deliver.Big brands are increasingly taking a page from this playbook. Through Nike By You, for instance, shoppers can create custom shoes by using a 3D model to choose colors and materials, plus their own ID.


Break down walls that hinder sales strategyBesides knowing their customers, small retailers have a clear, detailed picture of their ecommerce business itself — another strength that bigger players should strive to emulate.That's because their IT, customer service, merchandising and other departments are all — by necessity — in constant communication. So it's easier to see that the higher cost of drawing site traffic is hurting sales margins, for example, or that long shipping times are driving customers away. Smaller retailers can pounce on such problems and fix them.Big brands? Not so much. All of those business functions tend to be siloed, creating roadblocks that frustrate growth. In a recent survey by customer relationship management company Zendesk, only about one in five business leaders said their teams share data well.Here, too, choosing the right tools can help. Look for an ecommerce platform that gathers all of the crucial metrics — sales, conversion rate, visitor sessions — together in one place. It should also let retailers dig into and visualize that data with ease and then share it easily across the company.


For retail brands, technology is ultimately a means to an end: connecting with and serving customers. In a tough market, making smart tech choices can go a long way toward closing that gap.

13,A Student in an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class Asked a Tough Question: What If Your Boss's Downfall Is Necessary to Get Ahead?,"Apr 2, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/mentora-lift-accelerates-performance-breakthroughs-at-work/472054,"
Seventy percent of employees avoid difficult conversations with their boss, colleagues or direct reports, according to a study by coaching and training firm Bravely. Unfortunately, awkward interactions in the workplace are often necessary to see positive results — including those in the form of a promotion or raise.One recent study from UK-based Reed Recruitment found that more than half of employees surveyed hesitate to broach the subject of career advancement, with 16% admitting that they simply don't know what to say. What if someone could help them find the words and prepare them for any possible response?A GenAI-powered coach from Mentora Institute, the global institute dedicated to developing exemplary leaders and accelerating performance, does just that.Related: I Attended an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class and Learned How Steve Jobs Became a Better Leader in 10 MinutesThe just-launched Mentora LiFT is designed to expedite performance breakthroughs at work with actionable and personalized coaching with ""the path breaking leading-in-flow method,"" Dr. Hitendra Wadhwa, Mentora founder and professor at Columbia Business School, shared in Harvard Business Review.



The tool became available for enterprises on April 2, and individuals will be able to access LiFT in waves with priority given to those on the waitlist and those who sign up today and throughout the week. Its three-level price tier includes an individual version for $45 per month, a professional version for $195 per month and an annual subscription for $1,995.How do you bring up the possibility of a promotion or raise when the path to career advancement isn't clear?In January, I had the opportunity to sit in on Wadhwa's business course at Columbia and see the technology in action. Wadhwa, who also authored the book Inner Mastery, Outer Impact: How Your Five Core Energies Hold the Key to Success, teaches the university's most popular class on leadership and success. Wadhwa asked for some class participation to help show what Mentora LiFT could do — did anyone have a challenging situation at work they'd be willing to share and work through with the tool?The student selected revealed a common problem: How do you bring up the possibility of a promotion or raise when the path to career advancement isn't clear? In this student's case, though, an industry-specific constraint added some complexity. As a professional working in academic medicine, he said the hierarchical structure and long-established trajectory of those working within it meant those who chose to stick around could expect a slow climb to the top, one that ultimately hinged on their superior's departure — by choice or otherwise.What if the only way to get a promotion is for your boss to…die? Naturally, his question elicited some laughter, as did his admission of offering his boss cheeseburgers to speed the process up, but the general premise — how to start a tough conversation in the workplace — was just what Mentora LiFT needed to do its work.


Related: The Secret to How Businesses Can Fully Harness the Power of AIThe Mentora LiFT added possibilities — and a lot of them — to an otherwise stultifying situation.The student prepared for a meeting with his boss that could change the trajectory of his career, and by inputting his specific goals, received recommendations for concrete actions and a custom plan complete with intention-setting, action-review and centering and visualization practices — and all in just 10-15 minutes. The tool also offers a simulated role-play option for those important real-world conversations.The student still had a significant challenge ahead of him in shifting the status quo, but the Mentora LiFT added possibilities — and a lot of them — to an otherwise stultifying situation. And that's precisely what it was built to do.In early testing of LiFT by executives from major organizations such as Google, IBM, Amazon, Citibank, Mastercard and more, executives mostly or completely achieved their performance goals 80% of the time with the tool, which also delivered an immediate average boost of 20% in achieving performance goals, increasing to 135% over time after 10 uses.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) is crucial for promoting innovation, satisfaction and success. To build a dynamic and resilient work environment, it is important to embrace different points of view and encourage inclusivity because such actions foster a positive culture, improve teamwork and draw in top talent.A change-proof mindset, on the other hand, is a strategic approach that promotes resilience and adaptability in the face of ongoing corporate change. A change-proof attitude is crucial for organizations to effectively navigate uncertainty and embrace innovation.These two concepts play pivotal roles in achieving innovation, something we will talk about in detail in this article.Related: Great Minds Think Unalike — 3 Ways to Drive True Innovation Through DiversityThe power of diversity in driving innovationThe power of diversity in driving innovation is immense and undeniable. In the realm of business and creativity, diversity acts as a catalyst for innovation, igniting the spark that leads to groundbreaking ideas and transformative solutions. It's not merely a matter of including different races, genders or cultural backgrounds, although these are crucial aspects. The essence of diversity's power lies in the amalgamation of varied perspectives, experiences, and ways of thinking and harnessing the collective wisdom that emerges when people with different viewpoints collaborate towards a common goal.



Industry giants like Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson credit part of their success to a diverse workforce, and they did it by harnessing the power of varied perspectives not just to drive innovation, but also to create products that cater to a wider range of needs.Embracing a change-proof mindsetEmbracing a change-proof mindset in business is akin to preparing a ship and its crew for a voyage across uncharted waters. It's about cultivating resilience, adaptability and an unwavering commitment to navigating the inevitable storms and uncertainties that lie ahead. This journey begins with leadership that not only embraces change but sees it as an essential ingredient for growth and innovation.Leadership must embody the change-proof mindset. This means demonstrating a genuine openness to new ideas, a readiness to pivot when necessary and a deep-seated belief in the power of resilience. Leaders must be the torchbearers of adaptability, showing by example how to embrace uncertainty rather than shy away from it. They must create a culture where failure is not seen as a setback but as a stepping stone to greater success. This culture encourages experimentation, where every attempt, successful or not, is valued for the lessons it brings.Embracing a change-proof mindset is about more than just surviving the storms of change; it's about setting sail toward new horizons with confidence and resilience. It requires leadership that inspires, a culture that empowers and an unwavering commitment to growth and innovation.


Related: From Passive to Resilient — These 7 Strategies Will Empower Your Team to Thrive Through ChangeSynergy of DEI and a change-proof mindsetThe synergy between Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) and a change-proof mindset is not just a strategic advantage; it's a transformative force that can redefine the landscape of any organization, propelling it towards unparalleled innovation, resilience and success.Diversity in thought and experience challenges conventional wisdom and pushes boundaries, leading to breakthroughs that would be impossible in a homogenous setting. Equity ensures that this diversity is more than just present; it's active, with every voice having the weight and the platform it deserves. Inclusion binds these elements together, creating a culture where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. This is the fertile ground on which innovation thrives.Now, when you infuse this DEI environment with a change-proof mindset, you amplify its potential exponentially. A change-proof mindset is characterized by resilience, adaptability and an unwavering commitment to growth and learning. It's about seeing change not as a threat but as an opportunity. This mindset ensures that the organization is not just surviving but thriving amidst change, leveraging the diverse perspectives and ideas that DEI brings to navigate and capitalize on the uncertainties of our world.


The synergy of DEI and a change-proof mindset creates an organization that is dynamic, resilient and innovative. One good example is the American multinational technology company, Google, because it promotes DEI and a change-proof mindset through its ""Unbiasing"" efforts, for example. This approach contributes to the creation of new products and services, such as AI-powered language translation tools.The same goes with IT and networking giant, Cisco, which exemplifies DEI and a change-proof mindset with its commitment to inclusivity through programs like the ""Conscious Culture Initiative."" Cisco encourages adaptability and innovation, which is largely evident in its networking solutions.Practical strategies for implementationWhat can organizations do to enhance DEI efforts? Below are some actionable steps that can be taken:Leadership commitment: Secure leadership buy-in for DEI, making it a strategic priority.Training and education: Provide regular DEI training to all employees that will help promote awareness and understanding.Inclusive policies: Review and update policies to eliminate bias and promote inclusivity.Diverse recruitment: Implement diverse recruitment practices to attract the best talent in the market.Employee resource groups: Establish and support employee resource groups for networking and support.Organizations that celebrate resilience, support ongoing learning and encourage flexibility can also aid in the promotion of a change-proof attitude. Establish a culture where obstacles are seen as chances for development and where staff members are encouraged to accept change. Emphasize the advantages of adaptability, quick thinking and forward-thinking behavior regularly. Give diversity in hiring and team composition top priority to connect DEI projects with a more comprehensive innovation strategy.Related: How to Promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Your WorkplaceOvercoming challenges and building momentumThe use of DEI and change-proof programs frequently encounter obstacles such as the necessity for ongoing education and unconscious biases that impact decision-making. A lack of quantifiable measures, imprecise communication and inconsistent leadership commitment can all impede success. It will take consistent work, open communication and a dedication to fostering an inclusive and flexible working culture to overcome these obstacles.To overcome resistance and build momentum, start with transparent communication regarding benefits. Encourage leaders to set an example, create inclusive policies and come up with measurable goals. Promote open dialogue between individuals, address concerns, and celebrate small wins to gradually shift attitudes and build sustained momentum for positive change.

15,How to Harness AI for a Competitive Edge in Marketing,"Apr 2, 2024",Rodolfo Delgado,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-harness-ai-for-a-competitive-edge-in-marketing/471647,"
Have you ever wondered how your favorite local spots seem to know exactly what you're craving or what book you'd love to read next? This isn't luck — it's the power of artificial intelligence (AI) at work. The digital era has ushered in a revolutionary shift, particularly for small businesses, enabling them to leverage AI for unparalleled personalization and engagement.Consider the local coffee shop that now knows to send a comforting note with a discount on your preferred latte during dreary Monday mornings or the family-owned bookstore that introduces you to your next favorite author, all based on your previous interactions. This level of personalization transcends traditional marketing, turning every customer interaction into an opportunity for connection.Related: Beware the Duplicity of OpenAI — 4 Strategies to Safeguard Your Brand in the Age of AI



Personalization with AIPersonalization is at the core of AI's transformative promise for small business marketing. It's about going beyond the one-size-fits-all approach, delivering experiences that resonate deeply with each customer. For instance, a boutique pet store might implement AI to remember not just purchase histories but significant dates for each pet, sending out personalized reminders and offers that perfectly coincide with these moments. This strategy transforms routine transactions into meaningful exchanges, fostering a sense of community among customers.By tapping into AI's potential, businesses not only survive in a competitive landscape but thrive, crafting experiences that convert customers into loyal advocates for the brand.


Building trust through transparency and the ethical use of AITrust is not just built on promises but on consistent, transparent actions. Small businesses leveraging AI have a unique opportunity to lead with transparency, setting a new standard in customer relations. Imagine a local health food store that uses AI to customize nutritional recommendations for its customers. By openly sharing how they use customer data to improve health outcomes and ensuring robust data protection measures, they deepen trust. This transparency transforms AI from a behind-the-scenes algorithm to a tangible benefit in customers' eyes.Many big brands, such as Amazon Fresh, have already made suggestions based on our previous shopping experiences. Small businesses, however, have the advantage of adopting new technologies quickly. The real opportunity for entrepreneurs comes from iterating technologies that improve their customers' experience — and they learn which are best by A/B testing quickly and efficiently.Related: How AI Can Help Small Businesses Do More in Less TimeLeveraging AI for enhanced customer engagementEngagement in the AI era transcends traditional marketing, turning every interaction into an opportunity for connection. A boutique gardening store, for example, uses AI to suggest plants and gardening tools based on the season and the customer's purchase history. Such personalized interactions do more than drive sales; they cultivate a community of gardening enthusiasts who feel seen and understood. Through AI, businesses can create a virtuous cycle of engagement, where each personalized recommendation strengthens the bond with their customers.


Customer experiences with AIInnovation through AI isn't just about automating processes; it's about redefining the customer experience. Small businesses can use AI to create interactive, immersive experiences that captivate customers. For instance, a small fashion retailer could use virtual try-on AI technology, allowing customers to see how clothes look on them through an app before making a purchase. This innovative use of AI enhances the shopping experience and bridges the gap between online and physical retail, offering personalized engagement that customers cherish.Related: How Small and Mid-Sized Businesses Can Leverage AI to Compete With Large CompaniesFostering a culture of continuous AI adoptionThe key to successful AI integration is fostering a culture open to continuous learning and adaptation. Small businesses thrive by staying nimble, and incorporating AI into their strategy should be an ongoing process, not a one-time effort. Encouraging a team mindset that values innovation and is not afraid to experiment with new AI applications can lead to discovering unique solutions that propel the business forward. Celebrating successes and learning from setbacks will create a resilient, AI-savvy organization.It's crucial to understand the impact AI has on the customer experience and the internal processes that power small businesses. Embracing AI technologies can streamline operations, from inventory management to customer service, freeing up valuable time for entrepreneurs to focus on strategic growth and innovation. This operational efficiency, paired with previously discussed enhanced customer engagement strategies, sets a solid foundation for small businesses to meet and exceed modern consumer expectations. In this era of rapid technological advancement, the integration of AI allows small businesses to remain competitive, agile and forward-thinking, ready to adapt to the ever-changing market landscape and consumer behavior patterns.


As the digital landscape evolves, so will the opportunities for small businesses to leverage AI. This promises an exciting future where technology and human creativity combine to create unparalleled customer experiences. The journey into AI-driven marketing is not without its challenges, but the rewards are boundless for those willing to embark on it.

At the heart of Philadelphia's culinary legacy stands Pat's King of Steaks, a landmark synonymous with the iconic Philly cheesesteak.Frank Olivieri, the executive chef and owner, traces the origins of this beloved sandwich to a serendipitous moment when his Uncle Pat grew weary of the daily hot dog fare and improvised with ribeye trimmings.""One day my uncle Pat got so tired of eating hot dogs he said to my grandfather, go down to the butcher and see what trimmings he has from the ribeye and bring it back, and we'll make that sandwich that we always like to make,"" Olivieri told host Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media. That sandwich, cooked on the same open flat top as the hot dogs, became what we know now as the Philly cheesesteak.

        In 2008, Vaccarella needed a better, practical beach bag — so she decided to create one herself. 
      


        The bags flew off shelves at a local boutique, but disaster struck after she invested her kids' college savings in more pieces.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Kim Vaccarella, founder of Bogg Bag, which offers a ""lightweight, durable, washable collection"" of bags and is on track to see $100 million in revenue this year, per the company. Image Credit: Courtesy of Bogg Bag. Kim Vaccarella. Did you have a 9-5 when you started the business? Yes, I spent 26 years in commercial real estate before fully dedicating myself to Bogg in 2018.



When did you start the business, and where did you find the inspiration for it?It seems like a lifetime ago. The idea came to me in 2008, born out of a practical need for a better beach bag. I envisioned the ultimate mom bag: durable and sturdy, with non-collapsing sides, large enough to carry everything we needed and washable at the end of the day. The catalyst was a trip to the Jersey Shore and a serendipitous encounter with EVA material, which I realized was the perfect material for crafting the perfect beach bag.Related: The Remote Side Hustle a 43-Year-Old Musician Works on for 1 Hour a Day Earns Nearly $3,000 a Month: 'All From the Comfort of Home'


What were some of the first steps you took to get Bogg Bag off the ground? How did you come up with the ""Bogg Bag"" name?As a full-time working mom with no experience in bag sales, the leap into launching Bogg Bag was huge. The idea came to me as a necessity, and despite the challenge of stepping into unfamiliar territory, I was determined to give it a go.The goal initially was to patent the Bogg Bag concept and sell the idea, avoiding the complexities of manufacturing. After facing numerous rejections, I realized the only way to see my vision come to life was to do it myself.Naming the bag was simpler than you'd think. Reflecting on water, frogs and lily pads, I played around with words until Bogg stuck. It felt right, signaling a fresh start — Bogg, it's the new bag!You used your kids' college fund to bring the dream to life. What happened next?After our first batch hit a small local boutique, they flew off the shelves. At first, I wondered if it was just friends and family showing support, but I chose to believe it was genuine love for the product. Encouraged, I doubled down and ordered 600 more. Those sold out too. Feeling bold, I invested my kids' college savings into over 1,000 pieces. It was a major moment, unloading a full container in our storage unit's parking lot under the night sky. But as we unpacked, my heart sank — every piece was marred by black streaks, unsellable to the high standards I dreamt of for Bogg.

We found a new purpose for these imperfect bags. The storm had wreaked havoc on our community, so we repurposed the flawed bags as emergency kits filled with essentials for those affected by the storm, distributing them to families in need. It was a heartrending experience, but providing aid gave a new meaning to our efforts.Initially, I thought this marked the end of Bogg's journey. However, about a year later, our Facebook page lit up with messages from those recipients. Beyond their thanks, they wanted more bags — for themselves, for family, as gifts. That overwhelming response reignited my resolve. I knew then that Bogg had to make a comeback.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bogg Bag


What were some of the additional challenges you faced while building your business, and how did you navigate them?After leaving my steady job in 2018, the pressure of succeeding on my own was immense. Having been accustomed to a regular income for 26 years, the shift was daunting. I set an ambitious target: $1 million in sales for 2018. Miraculously, we hit it. Then 2019 began promisingly until Covid brought the world to a standstill. Like everyone, we were in uncharted territory with no playbook on how to adapt.While many brands shifted to online sales — a logical move in such uncertain times — we chose a path less traveled. We stayed in close touch with our retail partners, sharing in their hardships and looking for ways to support them. The Bogg Bag's unique selling point — its washability — unexpectedly became its strength during the pandemic. Hospitals purchased them for healthcare workers, schools for teachers, and stores filled them with goods for contactless pickups and deliveries as Easter approached.This approach may not have been the most profitable in the short term, but it was the right thing to do. Maintaining these relationships was more important than immediate gains. To this day, I'm grateful for the support we were able to provide during those tough times, a sentiment echoed by our partners whenever we meet at trade shows.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? What does total revenue look like now?Even in the early days of 2014 and 2015, we began seeing monthly revenue come in, albeit modest, but steady and growing. Fast forward to 2023: We hit a milestone that once seemed a distant dream, crossing over $50 million in revenue. Now, with momentum on our side, we're ambitiously setting our sights even higher, targeting a groundbreaking $100 million in 2024. This growth is a clear testament not only to our product's value but also to the incredible team behind Bogg and the unwavering support from our community. We truly have something special.

Ryan Walther, co-founder of prank gift box and gag gift company Prank-O, has had a passion for comedy from a young age. ""It goes back to when I was in third grade, and I saw David Letterman do Velcro Man,"" he tells Entrepreneur. ""Right then, I said, 'I want to do that.'"" Walther didn't ""become the next king of late night,"" but he did work at the satirical news outlet The Onion for more than 20 years.It was there that Walther met his co-founder Arik Nordby. Nordby would bring fake gift boxes to The Onion store, which always sold out fast. Walther saw potential in the product, and when a little bit of research revealed the plethora of gift-giving occasions in the U.S. — and that no company was the go-to brand for comedic gifting — the wheels continued to turn.Image Credit: Courtesy of Prank-O. Arik Nordby, left; Ryan Walther, right. 



""I felt that gifting had become obligatory and mundane,"" Walther says. ""Aren't parties supposed to be full of laughter? So at that moment, I sought to develop a brand that brought great comedy to gifting occasions and parties.""Related: 'Don't Follow Your Passion': Mark Cuban Shares the 'Worst Piece' of Business Advice He's Ever Received — And How Changing That Mindset Can Lead to Success


""[With] everything that we do, we want to make sure people are laughing.""Walther and Nordby launched Prank-O — ""a 21st-century gift company that delivers laughter and experience"" — in July 2013. The first set of boxes included the Crib Dribbler, ""kind of like a gerbil feeder [for] a crib""; the Wake & Bake Dream Griddle Alarm Clock; the Family Blankeez that covers up to eight people and even an SUV; and the Sizzl Bacon Scented Dryer Sheets.""[With] everything that we do, we want to make sure people are laughing,"" Walther says. Essentially, Prank-O gives consumers ""the keys to the car,"" he adds: Whoever shows up to the party with one of the comedic boxes in tow ""[is] going to be the hero, where they deliver the prank pack, and the whole room erupts with laughter and passes it around, and it's a ton of fun.""One of the business's earliest hurdles was explaining to potential retailers that there wasn't actually a product in the box. But once they were in on the joke, the ""light bulb"" went off — and ""they absolutely loved it,"" Walther says. Prank-O landed Urban Outfitters as its first account during the 2013 holiday season; Target, Kohl's, Walmart and numerous others followed.

The producer explained that there's a due diligence period wherein either party can back out of a deal without penalty, and Walther was on board, as long as Prank-O was able to stay ""on brand"" — and prank the Sharks.The producers loved the idea. ""We came up with a skit where our company was RynArik Technologies, technology solutions for tomorrow, today,"" Walther recalls. ""So we came out in our RynArik uniforms and presented different prank packs that were positioned as RynArik products. I was wearing a prank pack we brought to life: a magnetic plate that stuck to your head so your kids could eat a meal while they sat on your shoulders.""

When the duo revealed themselves as the co-founders of Prank-O, the company behind empty gift boxes, Mark Cuban was impressed. Prank-O had done $10 million in sales since 2013 and was on track for nearly $3 million in 2018. Although Walther and Nordby initially asked for $640,000 for an 8% stake, Cuban negotiated $640,000 for a 25% stake. The deal didn't close after the due diligence period.Related: Humor Can Make You (and Your Employees) More Influential — If You Do It Right""The studio is underwater — nobody can really know that — with sharks circling above you,"" Walther quips. ""That kind of makes it a little more intense.""


""I'm an empty box baron. Not many people in this world sell empty boxes.""The Onion is a social commentary on news, and Prank-O is a social commentary on consumers, Walther says. To stay current and relevant, Prank-O is constantly innovating to keep up with ""the ever-changing times of products and technology."" It's about layering ""fresh"" parody on what's new in the marketplace, he adds.Image Credit: Courtesy of Prank-OThese days, Prank-O boasts a nearly six-figure email list with an open rate that can reach 60%. Still, marketing and distribution remain two of the company's most significant challenges. Many people simply aren't aware of the product, Walther says, and distribution in the gift space can be tough with Hallmark's and American Greetings' hold on the market. Selling through Amazon in addition to brick-and-mortar stores has been helpful, he notes.


Looking ahead, Prank-O has plans to ""bring the Prank-O-verse and its characters and inventors"" to life with a not yet disclosed media project, and next year, the company will launch Prank-O Labs, ""which will essentially bring brands to life on and around April Fool's Day"" — ""a great day to spread laughter.""Related: 5 Corny Jokes Will Get You Past Cold-Calling Gatekeepers""I'm an empty box baron,"" Walther says. ""Not many people in this world sell empty boxes. We navigated it pretty well by building a nice following and continue to come up with new styles that make people laugh and find their way into press coverage, which certainly helps. So overall awareness certainly grows year over year.""

19,How to Choose the Right AI Partner for Your Business,"Mar 29, 2024",Adam Chandler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/a-checklist-for-selecting-an-ai-partner/471570,"
Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and automation is more than a trend — it's a strategic imperative. It has been shown that ""60% of business owners believe AI will increase productivity,"" and ""42% believe it will streamline job processes.""Selecting the right partner is crucial for marketing professionals aiming to increase location owner adoption, boost visibility at a corporate level and streamline operations and advertising. Let's discuss the key considerations to help guide marketing experts in this journey.The essential considerationsThe first thing to consider is expertise and experience. When evaluating potential partners, assess their track record in driving location owner adoption. Look for partners with proven experience in implementing successful marketing strategies and automation techniques tailored for streamlined operations and increased adoption at the local level.



When referring to proven experience, this includes asking the right questions. What are those? For starters, what is their average increase in location adoption rates per brand? How do they safeguard their technology and client data to ensure trust and transparency? Do they have clients you can speak with and receive testimonials from that can speak to the specific challenges your brand and team are facing?Related: 4 Ways AI Is Revolutionizing Targeted Advertising — And How to Balance Its Ethical Implications


Next, look at the customization and scalability factors. Effective marketing strategies require tailored approaches. Ensure your partner implements client feedback and grows to customize their AI solutions to enhance location-specific initiatives. Regarding scalability, check to see that corporate-level visibility and expansion are seamlessly integrated.The third key factor to assess when looking for a compatible marketing partner is whether their existing technologies are compatible with your marketing goals. A capable partner should provide easy integration for an efficient and cohesive advertising ecosystem, ensuring that all parts work harmoniously together. One way to check on this is to conduct a pilot project that tests integration capabilities. Other things you should consider for a vendor partner checklist include:Scalability — Confirm that the vendor's solution can scale to meet the brand's growing needs and user base.Data Security — Ensure that the vendor complies with data security and privacy standards relevant to the industry.Performance Metrics — Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and ensure the vendor can provide relevant metrics.Customization Options — Access the level of customization the vendor allows to tailor the solution to your brand's specific requirements, voice and standards.User Experience — Evaluate the impact of the integration on the overall user experience for both internal teams and location owners.Ongoing Support and Maintenance—Confirm the vendor's availability to support your brand's team members and assess how they troubleshoot and provide maintenance.Compliance — Verify that the vendor's solution can seamlessly interact with other third-party tools and services.Testing and QA Processes — Discuss the vendor's testing and quality assurance processes to ensure a smooth integration and minimize potential issues.Updates and Upgrades — Ask about the frequency of updates and upgrades to the vendor's solution and their process for ensuring backward compatibility.Related: AI is the Antithesis of Authenticity — But There's Hope. Here's How We Can Align Our Human Values with AI.Going beyond the basicsIt's time to take your search a step further. All the components highlighted above are indicators of a successful integration and trial period with a partner brand, but let's get team-specific.


In any partnership, you want to ensure transparency and communication are at the forefront. Effective collaboration demands clear communication channels. Choose a partner emphasizing transparency in processes, timelines and potential challenges. This ensures a smooth workflow and minimizes potential disruptions. Also, check to see that this possible partner is not only your time and communication but also that of your location owners. Assess how they will interact with your brand owners and what that may look like on an ongoing basis. Is this the communication they need? Can they provide aid, guidance and support to your leadership team and individual location owners? If the answer is yes, this may be your perfect partner.Marketing strategies are dynamic, requiring partners who can adapt to change. Assess a potential partner's flexibility in accommodating new marketing strategies, changes and feedback to ensure dynamic and effective advertising campaigns. Also, the importance of a cost-effective partnership cannot be overstated. Evaluate the overall value proposition, ensuring that your investment translates into increased ROI And efficient budget utilization.Related: 5 Trends Shaping the Next Generation of Digital MarketingUse your case studies to your advantage.Real-world examples offer valuable insights. Explore case studies and success stories showcasing how a specific AI/automation partner has contributed to location owner adoption, corporate visibility and improved marketing efficiency. The brand's clients are the biggest examples of what you have in store and the leaps and bounds your brand may be able to jump when you partner with them.


In conclusion, selecting the right AI/automation partner for enhanced marketing strategies requires a thoughtful and thorough evaluation. By prioritizing expertise, customization, integration capabilities and other vital considerations, marketing professionals can forge partnerships that meet and exceed their goals — ultimately driving increased location owner adoption, corporate visibility and a more streamlined and practical approach to advertising.

20,"To Achieve Sustainable Success, You Need to Stop Focusing on Disruption. Here's Why — and What You Must Focus on Instead.","Mar 28, 2024",Alex Goryachev,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/to-achieve-sustainable-success-you-need-to-stop-focusing/413421,"
There's only one word that is buzzier than ""innovation"" and ""digitization"" — one that strikes fear in the executive boardrooms of established companies, while also being used as the pitching mantra for the wannabe hottest startups around the world: disruption. Today, it feels like every new company wants to ""disrupt"" something, and many founders preach that ""disruption"" is what defines a successful new venture.I think this business philosophy is counterproductive and almost always results in failure.



Don't get me wrong — of course, disruption surrounds us, and the world has changed radically in the last two years. But just because disruption is taking place, it doesn't mean that a successful business strategy needs to be ""disruptive"" in response.The truth of the matter is that having disruption as a goal is often counterproductive and takes your company away from real opportunity. In the process of chasing disruptive ideas, founders and teams often lose touch with reality, focusing on the flavors of the month and missing out on real opportunities.


Related: Why Most Founders and Investors Are Wrong About DisruptionStop thinking disruptively. Start thinking pragmatically.When I think about cutting-edge pragmatic entrepreneurship, Dyson inevitably comes to mind.As I write in Fearless Innovation, Dyson products are known for several things: high quality, high price tag and designs unlike any other. Before Dyson, few people would have ever thought of buying a $400 hair dryer or shelling out $500 for a fan with no blades and a huge hole in its center. But here we are. And how we got here is the story of being pragmatic and executing in small, measurable milestones.In 1978, James Dyson came up with the concept of the bagless vacuum. The young entrepreneur realized that dirt and other debris can be sucked into a cone-like structure that would then be forced out to the edges of the canister, with no bag required. Dyson wasn't focused on disrupting the vacuum cleaning business. His idea came from solving a practical issue. One day, Dyson was fixing his vacuum cleaner and realized that the bag often gets clogged, and as a result, suction power gets drastically decreased.


Being a pragmatic innovator, Dyson created a cardboard bagless prototype on top of his Hoover vacuum. He pitched this idea to possible investors in the vacuum marketplace, looking to see if anyone would be interested in licensing, but every company he spoke to turned him down. They essentially told him, ""That's just not how we do things here.""The experience didn't deter Dyson and might even have inspired him. Over the next 15 years, he developed 5,127 prototypes before landing on the vacuum cleaner that has since become synonymous with quality, not to mention design, and made him a household name.Dyson's success is not in the disruptive technology or a brand-new concept of the vacuum (the patent for the ""pneumatic carpet renovator"" was filed by J. S. Thurman in 1899) but in his willingness to experiment with discipline and follow a process.Though the Dyson company has expanded and diversified, it all started with the need to fix a simple problem. Dyson took a pragmatic approach; with no plans to disrupt the market, he was simply looking to make a better product and innovating on top of it repeatedly.


Dyson's work was, and continues to be, pragmatic. When Dyson realized that their latest venture of building an electric car wasn't performing as well as he had hoped for, he cut his losses, learned from failure and moved on with full transparency.Dyson has a clear mission to design ""iconic reinventions that work, perform and look very different."" You won't see ""disruption"" in this statement, though you will note that ""reinventions"" is prominent, and in fact, Sir James's motto is ""Everything can improve.""And of course, Dyson, who as of 2021 was the UK's fourth wealthiest individual, worth an estimated net worth of $16.3 billion, did end up disrupting the market eventually, practically killing the vacuum bag industry, but he only got there by starting with the basics. Ironically, a few years ago, Hoover agreed to pay Dyson, £4m damages for infringing Dyson's patents when creating their bagless vacuum.Dyson's successes weren't about ""disruptive technology"" that was looking for a use case. It was about thinking pragmatically, being curious and executing with discipline and an open mind to solve a problem step by step.


Related: Innovation is an Incremental Process. Here are 3 Ways to Reach Your Big Idea.Start small and think pragmaticallyThe essence of successful entrepreneurship often lies in the ability to execute on a bold vision and strategy through small, measurable milestones. This approach might not capture headlines like the tales of overnight successes do, but it's the bedrock of sustainable growth and innovation. Starting small allows you to test assumptions, iterate quickly and refine your offerings based on real-world feedback without overextending your resources. Each small step forward is an opportunity to learn and adjust, minimizing risk while maximizing potential for success.For entrepreneurs, this means breaking down your overarching goals into actionable, bite-sized pieces. Instead of aiming to revolutionize the market out of the gate, focus on achieving specific, achievable goals that contribute to your larger vision. This could be as simple as validating a product feature, securing a certain number of customer sign-ups or achieving a set revenue milestone. Celebrate these victories, learn from the setbacks, and use each as a stepping stone towards your broader objectives.Embrace gradual progressReal entrepreneurship is rarely about making a splash with a single, disruptive innovation. More often, it's about the cumulative effect of small innovations and improvements. Embracing the process means understanding that each step, no matter how small, builds upon the last, propelling your business forward in a way that's both sustainable and adaptable.


This step-by-step journey is not just about reaching the market or achieving a particular metric of success; it's about building a foundation for your business that is robust, flexible and capable of withstanding the challenges that come with growth. It means investing in your team, your technology and your strategy in a way that allows for continuous improvement and iteration. It's about creating a culture where learning from failure is just as valued as celebrating success because both are essential to the entrepreneurial process.Work with disruption, not against itIn a world where disruption is a constant, the ability to adapt and find opportunities within the chaos is a critical skill. Instead of attempting to out-disrupt the disruptors or invest heavily in being the next big thing, focus on how you can leverage the ongoing changes in your industry. This means being acutely aware of the trends, technologies and shifts in consumer behavior that are shaping your sector and thinking critically about how your business can respond in a way that adds value.Identifying opportunities in disruption could mean pivoting your product to serve an emerging need, adopting new technologies to improve your service delivery or even rethinking your business model to better align with the market's direction. By staying nimble and being prepared to shift your strategy in response to the changing landscape, you can carve out a niche for your business that not only survives but thrives amidst the disruption.Related: 3 Ways Companies Can Leverage Disruption for Business Growth


Small steps, big impactUltimately, the path to enduring entrepreneurial success is paved with pragmatism, patience and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement. James Dyson's journey exemplifies this perfectly. By starting small, embracing the gradual process of growth and learning to work with the disruptions around you, you create a business that's not just looking to be a part of the market but one that's built to last and adapt through the ever-changing tides of industry and innovation.Dyson didn't set out with the aim to disrupt; instead, he focused on solving a practical problem with a pragmatic approach. This methodology led him to not only eventually disrupt the vacuum cleaner industry but also establish a brand synonymous with innovation and quality. Dyson's story underscores that real success comes from a focus on incremental improvement, understanding the landscape of disruption and leveraging it to your advantage. This approach may not be the quickest route to fame, but it is a proven pathway to building a resilient, adaptable and successful business.

Her Product Was in Macy's Within the Year — Seeing Nearly $350,000 in Sales.","Mar 28, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/her-shocking-discovery-led-to-a-side-hustle-and-over-300k/471768,"
In 2022, Elenor Mak, now founder of doll company Jilly Bing, was busy balancing her business development role at a healthcare company and raising her 2-year-old and 4-year-old children. Back then, she ""was definitely not looking to start"" a side hustle. She'd founded an ecommerce fashion company in the past and knew what it took to get a business up and running. But that changed when her young daughter Jillian began playing with stuffed animals and dolls.Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak.""It reminded me of my own childhood,"" Mak tells Entrepreneur. ""You're playing with dolls; you're trying to make sense of the world. She was bossing her dolls around, like, 'Eat your dinner. Wash your hands.' Acting like a mom. Not in those words, but at age two, sort of using those words, simpler versions of those words.""



Related: How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did ItOne day, Mak's mother gave her granddaughter a ""beautiful blonde, blue-eyed doll."" When Mak asked her why she'd chosen that doll instead of one that looked like her daughter, her mother said, ""It was the prettiest one on the shelf."" Despite knowing her mother meant well, Mak found those words ""so heavy,"" a reminder of her own experience with lack of representation as a child.


""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak decided to buy her daughter a doll that looked like her and figured it would be a straightforward process: Because I live in San Francisco, and it's 2022. But it wasn't. Her local toy store didn't have one. Neither did the second she visited. Or the third. The toy aisles at major retailers like Target and Toys""R""Us seemed as though they ""had not evolved"" since Mak was a kid, nearly four decades before.""There were just rows and rows of Caucasian dolls, brunettes, and then at the very end of the aisle, you would have these dolls that I think were intended to be Asian because they were holding a panda bear,"" Mak recalls. ""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak looked to Asia for more options, but asking her relatives what they could find only turned up ""Eurasian-looking dolls,"" she says, adding that ""dolls largely represent what society thinks is beautiful, and in Asia, what's beautiful is still the Caucasian sort of features."" Mak remembered wishing she were beautiful like the dolls she had growing up, and ""her mommy bear instincts"" kicked in — she was determined to get her daughter a doll that looked like her, even if she had to make it herself.

""It's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll.""Mak Googled ""how to make a doll,"" and armed with an MBA from Harvard Business School and her ""strong business background,"" she got to work on a side hustle that would shake up the $40 billion toy industry. Although she admits the creative component wasn't where she excelled (""My 6-year-old son is a better artist than me,"" she quips), she had a clear vision when it came to the business side and the potential for major demand: ""The Asian American population is one of the fastest-growing — we're 7% of the country's population.""And how hard could it be to make a doll in an age where we're churning out Teslas and developing AI? She recalls thinking. As it turns out, ""it's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll,"" Mak says. Fortunately, her business background helped her develop an essential ""superpower"": ""finding really good people."" Mak did cold outreaches to Asian designers at large toy brands and leveraged her own extensive network to connect with professionals who could bring the dream to life.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak and her daughter Jillian with the Jilly doll.By June 2022, they had their team of four. Mak conducted a lot of research over the next several months, speaking with Asian families and looking at photographs of kids and dolls to really try to understand what parents wanted. ""It's not just about saying, 'Oh, this doll's Asian,'"" Mak says. ""But what mattered to them? What were the features? What were the backstories?"" In December of that year, the prototype for Jilly Bing, named for Mak's daughter Jillian and the Chinese word for cookie, ""bing gan"" (Jillian's first word), was ready to share with the world.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a Month""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child.'""Jilly Bing started shipping dolls in August 2023 — and sold out of its stock of 2,000 within six weeks. Greta Gerwig's blockbuster hit Barbie had also put the spotlight on dolls that summer, ""opening up the national conversation"" and presenting ""an opportunity for us to change the narrative for not just our Asian children, but all children,"" Mak says. At that point, Mak realized the ""high-risk, high-effort"" passion project she'd worked on as a side hustle for the past couple of years — taking late-night business calls after her kids were asleep and balancing it all with her full-time day job — would benefit from her undivided attention.Jilly Bing also appeared on the Today show around that time, and the positive response was ""overwhelming."" ""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child. Life would have been so different if I had a doll that looked like me growing up,'"" Mak says. ""Even non-Asian parents writing [in to say], 'Oh my gosh, I think my kids should have dolls that look like their friends.'""By early this year, Jilly Bing was on shelves at Macy's; the retailer reached out after the Today segment. ""It's a company I grew up with,"" Mak says, ""so it was just really wonderful that they saw the value of Jilly Bing so early on.""

""Seeing the kids' reactions to having a doll that looks like them keeps me going [more than] everything else.""To date, Jilly Bing has sold approximately 5,000 dolls, Mak says.

""And hearing the stories [from them] — and my own daughter — saying, 'She looks like me. She has black hair like me.' [And] little Asian boys saying, 'She's beautiful like my mama.' It's just seeing the kids' reactions to having a doll that looks like them that keeps me going [more than] everything else.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. 


Mak had to ""trust her gut"" to start the side hustle turned full-fledged business that's leaving its mark on the toy industry and beyond, and she looks forward to building the brand out in the years to come.""I am most excited about being able to create characters,"" Mak says. ""We started to branch into comics because it's a doll, but we're starting to create the stories. I've got a vision of a whole cast of Asian American characters that actually reflect what Asian America looks like today. We have mixed Asian children, you have boys, you have Southeast Asian. Jilly's our first doll, so I'm excited to grow and introduce the world to the rest of Jilly Bing's friends.""

Creating our show The CEO Series has allowed me to sit down with some of the most innovative and inspiring business leaders in the world to get their insights on what it takes to launch, grow and sustain a meaningful business.This episode took us to Ozinga, the concrete and building material powerhouse. They're based in Chicago and if you're in the area, you're surely familiar with their iconic red and white trucks. They have approximately 2,500 employees and I got to have an amazing chat with the guy who oversees it all, Marty Ozinga, the fourth-generation CEO of this 95-year-old company.Below are some highlights of that conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. Watch the full video above.



His approach to leadership""It's not the people are working for you, they're working with you. That's the way I was mentored and taught. We all need each other. We all have different roles and responsibilities, but we're working with each other.""Related: Why Notre Dame's Football Coach Tells His Team to ""Choose Hard""


Ozinga's 95-year history""Our family came from the Netherlands in 1893, the year of the World's Fair here in Chicago. The family was always in the delivery business. Then in 1928, my great-grandfather was working with the Cook County Sheriff's Department during Prohibition and dealing with the hazards of Al Capone and all of that. He had five kids at home and decided, ""You know what? I don't want to fight Al Capone anymore."" So he started a coal delivery business. And then around 1950, ready mix concrete became the era's disruptive technology. Ready mixed means that it is batched for delivery from a central plant instead of being mixed on the job site. And so Ozinga became one of the first ready mix providers in the region.""Related: This Entrepreneur Started Making Short Videos to Share Her Passion for Cooking. Now Her Food Company Is a Global Powerhouse.On their iconic trucks""We've supplied concrete to iconic Chicago landmarks like Soldier Field and Wrigley Field, so it's fun to be connected to places like that. And we're really proud of our trucks' red and white stripes. I think it was a combination of this keen sense of marketing, but also of national pride. But there's also some joke that they were Dutch and very frugal and those were the two paint buckets in the garage. So I like both those stories.""The power of peacefulness""Our dispatch office is the nerve center of the business. It's where all the orders come in from our customers, and then where we dispatch the trucks. It is intentionally very quiet inside. We've tried to get it as quiet and peaceful as possible because historically the dispatch office is a very intense, chaotic, loud and crazy place.""


Building and sustaining a legacy""There's an emotional connection for my family and this company. We've been really fortunate that we get to embed ourselves in communities throughout the Midwest. We're committed to our employees and our customers — we want to be here for the next hundred years and longer. That's our intention. And while change is necessary so you don't get disrupted and die and go out of business, there are certain things that you shouldn't meddle with. Our core principles are the foundation for who we are and why we do what we do — that should never change.""Related: How Personal Passions Fuel Business Success for the CEO of Vivid SeatsCheck out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

      Key Takeaways    



        Sarah Michelle Boes followed her passion for teaching into nursing school. 
      


        After passing her nurse practitioner's exam proved easier than expected, she wanted to instill confidence in others. 
      


        She put together her first course within a week of that exam — and became a millionaire within the year. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sarah Michelle Boes, the founder of Sarah Michelle NP Reviews (SMNP), which was acquired by Blueprint Test Prep in 2022. Boes currently serves as the chief nursing officer for Blueprint Test Prep and hosts the podcast Becoming A Stress-Free Nurse Practitioner. She earned her BSN from the University of Kentucky, her MSN in Nursing Education from Western Governors University and her post-MSN-FNP from Eastern Kentucky University. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. Image Credit: Courtesy of Sarah Michelle BoesI grew up in rural Eastern Kentucky, and I always had this passion for being a teacher. I had my heart set on it. But my parents are teachers, and they're like, ""Absolutely not. You can't do that."" There are a lot of politics and bureaucracy within teaching. It's a lot more than just being an educator. Then, when I was a teenager, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Without great access to premium healthcare in our area, we had to travel two hours to Lexington to get that diagnosis and receive a care plan that she could take back home. That was over the summer, so I went with her, and that was my first introduction to nursing at the Markey Cancer Center.



Those nurses were incredible. I feel like oncology nurses, in general, are kind of angels. Not only did they take care of her, but they also took care of me. It was just a great experience. So, knowing that I wasn't going to be able to be a teacher, I was like, Well, nursing — I feel like I could get something done. And there would be a teaching aspect because there's a lot of patient education, but I'd also get a human connection with people, which I thrive off of. So it was a no-brainer, and I attended the University of Kentucky, which guaranteed me admission to their program — and that's a really big deal.Related: This Nurse Turned $500 in Savings Into $100 Million in Sales After Sharing Her Hair Care Routine on YouTube. Now She's Revealing Her Secrets to Success.


I grappled with anxiety during nursing school. A class was notorious for weeding out people, and everyone dreaded taking it. I had a ton of anxiety in that class in particular, so much so that my instructor was like, ""I don't think nursing is for you. You're too anxious to be a safe nurse."" I had to choose to stay. The grading scale in nursing is also very different: In most programs, anything less than a 76 means you fail — and on the first exam in that class, I got a 74. I literally failed the first exam by one question. So I had to figure out how to contend with my anxiety, to think about the tools I could use.So, I started to figure out how to manage that class and my anxiety. Then, I began tutoring, ultimately quitting my full-time job as a manager to help students full-time. I taught them the skills that had helped me tackle that challenging class in a different way, and my anxiety didn't pick up again until I was a nurse practitioner — because it had been a long time since I'd taken a high-stakes exam. There was no one to turn to get perspective because I was the first nurse in my family, and I didn't know many people who were nurse practitioners.What's more, I took my nurse practitioner exam in the prime of Covid, May 2020. So it was chaos. Testing centers were down, and some places would let you take it online at home, but others wouldn't. By the time I took the exam in the middle of May, it had been canceled five times, three of which I'd already arrived at the testing center. So, there was a lot of anxiety involved. I was like, Am I ever going to take this test? My job is riding on this.Related: Nurse Makes $2 Million In One Year With Side Hustle Selling Class Notes Online


I was so stressed that I ended up breaking a tooth in my sleep because I was grinding them so hard. I was going to have to get a dental implant to the tune of $7,000; my hair was also falling out. But I finished the 175-question exam in less than an hour, and I passed. I was like, I can't believe I was stressing over this thing. This was so much easier than my nursing exam. All I needed was confidence in myself because I'd spent years in schools and hundreds of hours in clinical preparing. None of my reviews had given me that confidence.That realization — and the fact that I still had to pay for a $7,000 dental implant — motivated me to put together my first review course. I started my business because I was like, I can't afford this $7,000 implant. I figured if I put together a little review course and even just earned $500, that would help pay for it. And I started to think about how it could be done differently — how it could be less like someone lecturing you and more like studying with a friend. So, I came up with a Q&A approach, which I'd used as a tutor in nursing school and when I taught nursing students at the collegiate level.Within a week of passing the exam, I made my first three-hour course. I actually gave it out to all of my classmates for free. There were 30 of us, and I was like, ""Hey guys, I'll give you this course for free if you invite someone else into the group when I give it to you."" I gave the course to the first 100 people who came into the group. Then, not even a couple of days later, someone who had taken the course went on to pass, and it kind of exploded through word of mouth. It got wild really quickly. The first person I tried to sell it to for $25 got mad because her friend had gotten it for free, so she haggled me down to $15. Still, I made $1,000 on the first day I started selling, and I didn't even make $1,000 in a week as a nurse. I was like, What if I made $1,000 a day, every day? What would life look like?Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a Year


By the end of June and July, I'd surpassed what I used to make annually as a nurse. I told my nurse practitioner job I wouldn't be coming. I wanted to see how far I could take the business, but being reasonable and never having run a business before, I kept my full-time teaching job, just in case. But every spare hour I had, every weekend, was all about the business. Because I was so anxious about it being a startup, fragile and new, I waited to quit my teaching job until I made $1 million. We hit seven figures in seven months.About a year and a half in, I was still using third-party software to host my courses — nothing was in-house or really in unison. It got to the point where my students were literally breaking the software; I needed my own. We actually spent $100,000 trying to build an app that ended up completely falling apart. That was really hard, but we just kept running up against technology, and I realized I was the bottleneck to this thing. The business wanted to grow, so I started looking into other options.We considered a sale and put out some teasers, hoping to get constructive feedback. As it turned out, the test prep provider Blueprint had some internal meetings about the prospect before I even sent out the teaser. They had medical stuff, and they had LSAT stuff, but they didn't have any nursing material at the time. And I wanted to take some pressure off myself because a week into sending out the teasers, I found out I was pregnant. I never want people to think I sold because I was pregnant; it just coincided with the timing.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part


We loved the Blueprint team, but the deal just wasn't right at first. My husband and I had decided on a number before we had a single conversation, and I'd recommend any entrepreneur do the same. Otherwise, it can be hard to navigate a deal when emotions are running high. So the first deal wasn't our number, and we walked away. Then they came back with our number, and we ended up selling around the two-year mark. That money has been life-changing.At 36 weeks pregnant, we found out that my daughter was going to have a congenital heart defect. We had no idea. So everything kind of flipped on its head really quickly. When I gave birth, the money gave us the flexibility and ability to be with our daughter when she needed it the very most. She had six surgeries in her first five months of life, two of which were open-heart surgeries. So, very crazy, chaotic times, and what a blessing to be able to have not only a maternity leave, but also a medical leave, and to be able to be fully present for that — and not only me but also my husband. We could be there together and support one another.Now, my daughter is 19 months old, and for the past year, we've been working to do a legacy gift to our local children's hospital, where they literally saved her life. Hopefully, next month, fingers crossed, everything's going to be finished, and they're actually going to dedicate the Norton Children's Heart Institute to my daughter. They are trying to build out a premier heart program there, and you have to have the funds to be able to do that. So the money gives us a lot of freedom and flexibility — my husband's also starting up his own business — but our work with the children's hospital is the most meaningful and impactful accomplishment.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

2023 was a year of major AI disruption. Particularly in the genre of prompt-based content creation, we saw the sporadic boom of unending tools. The public-facing version of Chat GTP reached millions of users within months of its launch.However, even with leaping numbers in favor of Gen AI, entrepreneurs are constantly wondering if it's all hype or if Gen AI truly has the potential to bring long-term business benefits.Also, the constantly booming use case of prompt-based AI has brought entrepreneurs to the debate about the ethical use of AI. We must not forget that the foundational nature of AI links its resources to a large amount of unidentified data.



While this means anyone without tech knowledge can leverage such foundational models of Gen AI, it also means that the process can yield default or less accurate information, leading to even data hazards.Related: 6 Positive Impacts of Artificial Intelligence on Digital Marketing


A recent Accenture report says that 76% of C-suite leaders see generative AI as an opportunity for streamlining operations, reducing costs, and business growth. However, nearly 72% of respondents are investing in AI with caution due to concerns about its responsible use.Let's first discuss the primary areas that hinder growth-minded businesses from implementing AI systems:Strategy: There's palpable confusion about how AI can transform competitive dynamics and add value to business models. Most C-suite leaders are unsure how to map the financial and non-financial value generated by AI models so that they can generate the best value for their businesses. Also, in most cases, there exist huge complexities regarding the contractual and logistical viability of AI partnerships.Technology: Most leaders are still unsure which parts of their proprietary data and tech stacks should be made redundant or can be capitalized on more in the future. Leaders also witness massive capabilities and skill gaps with regard to AI system operations.Compliance: AI governance is rapidly evolving with increasing data threats. This puts leaders in uncertainty about how AI regulations will pan out across jurisdictions in the future.People: There is an increasing concern within human resources about the future of work as most perceive AI as their replacement. Next-gen leaders are still unsure how to rationalize this change management in their business.Stakeholders: Business leaders face resistance not just from human resources but also from partner networks. Most C-suite leaders struggle with AI adaptability in their partner networks, which lack tech sophistication in streamlining, securing, and reprocessing data fabrics for AI integration.In this article, we will discuss a few ways for business leaders to develop an actionable AI strategy. Let's get started.1. Make amplified human capabilities the key focusAI modules are designed to evolve for sure. But they do lack emotional intelligence and moral thinking. When integrating AI into business, as a C-suite leader, you must remember that AI is not a means to replace your human resources but to complement and further augment their operational capabilities.


There's also a need to build confidence in your AI systems with some fundamental models. Your goal should be to create impenetrable and actionable yet adaptive AI strategies that align with global compliances and constraints.2. Have a designated AI control centerAt the moment, as much as the chasm is about reaping the benefits of Gen AI, more and more business leaders are concerned about AI hazards. Built with human-like tech intelligence, Gen AI can spiral out of hand without definite control.Also, you must align your AI strategies with a long-term business vision to reap maximum benefits. When integrating AI, you cannot centralize your business's technical capabilities. Instead, you must have a leader with strong digital transformation capabilities and adept knowledge of AI risk and governance to design ROI metrics, establish business-wide best practices, align your strategies with financial goals, reduce risks, and, most importantly, capitalize on value from AI investments.3. Consider AI as a model to transform from ground zeroWe are at this very crucial crux of tech evolution, where tech investments can no longer be about transforming only specific business functions. And with AI, the need is more about reimagining entire business processes.


Until now, you must have wondered, ""How can AI make my business process efficient?"" Now it's time to consider, ""How can AI help me innovate my business process further?""You must aim to drive the maximum impact of AI systems right from ground zero but with strict governance.Related: I Tested AI Tools So You Don't Have To. Here's What Worked — and What Didn't.4. Take a look at gaps – both talent and technologyRedundant tech architecture and skill gaps of resources are the biggest constraints of the AI growth strategy. To leverage the optimum value of AI, you need to take a closer look at restrictive data structures and outdated tech systems first.


As a leader, you must restructure data fabrics, computational powers, and architectural capabilities to integrate AI into your enterprise systems. You also need to cleanse, secure, and process your proprietary data for seamless AI adoption.Also, you need to realize one critical aspect of AI expectations: It can't improve work if your human resources are redundant and restricted to acceptance and adoption. Upskilling your employees to elevate them into AI and data-enabled roles is a crucial need of the era.TakeawayThe uncertainties around AI integration are real. However, that shouldn't stop you from reaping its proven potential. AI disruption is the order of the era, and as a business leader, you can evade its drawbacks with a monitored and practical AI strategy.Think about the post-Covid era, where high-growth businesses faded away because they refused to move with the much-needed tech disruptions. The tech world has surely moved towards more sustainable practices now, but as a fast-moving business, you cannot let go of a disruptive model that's bound to be the hero of tomorrow.


So, proceed with caution, take stock of your AI investment, but don't hesitate to innovate with Gen AI.

25,Nextdoor's CMO Says Small Businesses Are Underutilizing One Critical Tool That Could Propel Their Marketing Efforts,"Mar 19, 2024",Heidi Andersen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/businesses-are-underutilizing-one-critical-tool-that-could/469501,"
Major companies across every sector are rushing to adopt Generative AI (GenAI), but it's small businesses that stand to realize major leaps with the advent of this incredible technology, particularly in their marketing strategies. Despite the technology's pervasive presence in the news, a 2023 McKinsey survey found that only 10% to 14% of companies utilize GenAI in their marketing efforts, a sign that businesses of all sizes are struggling to wrap their heads around how the technology can have an immediate impact on their sales workflow. Yet, GenAI presents a unique opportunity for SMBs to create personalized and impactful campaigns.The technology holds tremendous potential for creating highly personalized advertisements that create deeper connections with important consumer cohorts while saving time and effort. As the CMO of Nextdoor, we recently rolled out an AI Assistant tool aimed at empowering small businesses to connect with the approximately — 85 million neighbors on the platform. Our team sees this as an important first step in onboarding SMBs, the beating heart of our neighborhoods, to the technology so they can become early adopters of GenAI to future-proof their business, get ahead of marketing trends, and continue serving their communities as best they can.Related: How Generative AI Will Revolutionize The Future of Your Brand



Unleashing creativity and connection for SMBs with GenAIGenAI can help advertisers craft messages that engage with the local communities' distinctive wants, needs, and priorities. This approach empowers marketers to effectively reach the consumers most relevant to them without the need for costly market research. The ability to create such targeted content not only increases the relevance of marketing efforts but also significantly enhances customer engagement and loyalty.The power of GenAI in creating highly personalized campaigns is transforming the advertising landscape and creating new advantages for early adopters. Many platforms, including Nextdoor, are leveraging this technology to enable advertisers to tap into the communities that matter with quality content. A 2023 Optimove survey reflects this shift, indicating that a majority of consumers (55%) view AI-driven marketing positively, appreciating its role in tailoring shopping experiences. This trend highlights the potential for businesses to engage with consumers in new ways.


Enhancing efficiency and reach for small businessesGenAI is revolutionizing how marketers approach campaign development – a massive asset to SMBs that are dedicating a majority of their resources to other aspects of the business. By automating and optimizing the marketing process, these marketers are positioned to work smarter, not harder. A Harvard Business School study showed that AI assistance led to a 12.2% increase in task completion and a 25.1% faster execution rate. For SMBs, integrating GenAI with hyper-local insights from their community further enhances the impact of these campaigns, allowing for more granular targeting of specific consumer groups.This shift is particularly beneficial for small businesses, which often lack extensive marketing teams. GenAI tools, when used correctly, can level the playing field, providing the means to create high-impact campaigns that resonate deeply with local audiences. The future of marketing lies in developing hyper-local and tailored campaigns, as consumers are most responsive to messages that align with their surroundings and interests.Related: How Generative AI Is Fueling the Rise of Fake News and Online FraudThe responsible future of GenAI in marketingAs we look ahead, it's crucial for small businesses to adopt GenAI responsibly. This means being transparent about its use, safeguarding user privacy, ensuring human oversight, and screening for biases. Nextdoor's approach to integrating GenAI, combined with its deep local insights, exemplifies how businesses can develop granular marketing campaigns that appeal to specific audiences effectively.


For the marketing industry, embracing a community-focused strategy enhanced by GenAI is not just a trend but a necessity. It's about creating campaigns that are not only effective but also enrich the communities they target. The era of marketing powered by GenAI is here, and it's transforming the landscape in ways that particularly benefit SMBs.

26,"She Never Wanted to Start a Business, But Chronic Insomnia Was Motivation — Here's How She Achieved 8 Figures in Sales and 8 Hours of Sleep a Night","Mar 19, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/bearabys-founder-surpassed-20m-in-sales-gets-better-sleep/471256,"
Dr. Kathrin Hamm, founder and CEO of sleep-wellness company Bearaby, never wanted to be an entrepreneur. After graduating with her Ph.D. in economics, she started as an economist at the World Bank. Her work took her all over the world and provided invaluable insight into the small, medium and women-founded enterprises she tried to convince banks to lend to — but she ""learned firsthand how hard it is, especially in developing countries, for women to get access to finance and start and grow their businesses.""During her time in India and Bangladesh especially, Hamm faced long, ""exhausting"" travel days. She'd ""never been a good sleeper,"" waking easily even as a child, and she developed a chronic case of insomnia. It began ""on a more moderate level,"" with difficulty falling and staying asleep, before the periods of wakefulness became longer and longer, motivating her to look into different solutions.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bearaby. Kathrin Hamm.



She started by investigating various mattress options, but when she dug deeper, she found an article discussing weighted blankets. The piece focused on helping children with sensory issues, Hamm recalls, but it also mentioned that evenly distributed weight on an adult body could support better sleep. Hamm was immediately intrigued — as a potential customer.Related: The No-Excuse Approach to Sleep and Work Performance for Entrepreneurs


""Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""""I came from a consumer lens,"" Hamm says, ""and knowing how hard it is for women to start a business, I [was] like, Yeah, I'm good here. I don't want to start a business or even think about becoming an entrepreneur. Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""However, the purchase process proved difficult. Unable to find options online, Hamm had to go to a pharmacy in Germany, where she's from, to place an order. Six weeks later, a ""big bean bag"" arrived. It was orange and blue and ""very noisy,"" Hamm says. She was reluctant to even try it at first and wondered if she'd made a mistake.""But then I put it on during the day on a weekend, and I just passed out after 10 minutes,"" Hamm says. ""And I woke up more than two hours later, [after] a solid nap, completely passed out, and I'm like, Wow, this is magic. This thing works for me.""

Let Your Employees Take Naps.So Hamm kept using the blanket at night, but there was a problem: Because the blanket was filled with plastic beads to add weight, she often got too hot. The underlying functionality works; the weight on my body works, Hamm remembers thinking, but how it is made doesn't work. After some research, Hamm discovered that the technology, which largely consisted of bead-filled chambers between layers of blanket, had been around for 30 years — ""Nobody had innovated anything about this product.""""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?""Hamm decided to experiment with alternative designs. She drew some inspiration from her time spent in India, ""where there's a culture of making rugs, knitting, crocheting,"" but the ultimate breakthrough came from a conversation with her mom. Hamm had been considering changing the material or adding holes for airflow when her mom said, ""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?"" They would create a thick yarn that could be knit together for natural airflow, eliminating the need for heavy artificial materials that shift around and reduce comfort. That idea led to the development of Bearaby's first small blanket, made from a cut-up t-shirt.


Confident she was onto something, Hamm opted to take a year's leave from her job to focus on the business. ""I didn't want to take too much of a risk, again, knowing that it can get really hard,"" she admits. ""[But] my boss was super supportive, and she said, 'Look, if it doesn't work out, we make a case study out of it.'""Hamm withdrew $120,000 from her retirement fund and raised just over $250,000 from a crowdfunding campaign to fund the prototypes for the first batch of blankets. She also looked into patents, but they were expensive, so she did the drawing herself, then had a lawyer put together a provisional patent application, which entitles the filer to 18 months before they have to pay more money. That went through just a couple of days before launch in December 2018; the blanket sold out in two weeks and was the only product of its kind on the market for a couple of years, Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyRelated: How to Take Advantage of the 'First-to-File' Patent System


Despite the early success, the more than 50 factories that Hamm approached weren't inclined to take on the product. They'd never seen anything like it: It wasn't apparel, and it wasn't bedding. So, for that first year and a half, Hamm rented a small garage outfitted with knitting machines and knitters to churn out the first products. The strong sales helped the business continue to finance production, which was a good thing, too — because people still weren't all that interested in investing in the first-of-its-kind product.""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable.""Hamm leaned into the ""bootstrap"" mentality, which was a blessing in disguise. ""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable,"" she explains, ""to become in tune with our production processes and marketing processes, to be efficient, which sometimes you didn't see at that time in the direct-to-consumer space. Everyone was like, 'I raised that much money, and I'm putting that much million on a marketing spend.' So we never had it, but now, in an environment where money is not flowing [as] freely, we never had that money in the first place, so we are feeling pretty good right now.""Bearaby saw another major advantage in brand loyalty. Hamm notes that people seeking wellness and sleep tend to form an ""emotional connection"" with the blanket,"" and that it's easy to fall in love with a brand that helps you sleep better. Substantial interest also translated into an early retail presence. Just five months in, Bearaby was in West Elm, thanks to customers who walked in and wanted to try the blanket. That happened with Nordstrom, too.


Related: Customer Loyalty Is Your Holy Grail for Success. Here's How to Cultivate It.As Bearaby considered expansion, it centered on functional products that would uphold its commitment to quality and sustainability (the company is certified by third-party organizations, including The Global Organic Textile Standard, The Forest Stewardship Council and The Global Recycled Standard). Because anxiety so often goes hand in hand with insomnia, the company landed on its warmables line; boasting a weighted and heated neck wrap, bottle and lap pad, it ""takes the nervous system to zero,"" Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyNaturally, Bearaby's products have become an integral part of Hamm's own sleep routine, and as she's gotten older, she's realized even more just how much sleep she actually needs. ""Now I sleep for a minimum of eight hours,"" she says. ""I'm training myself to get nine to 10 hours of sleep, obviously not every night, but definitely every weekend. Also, [it helps] whenever I get a chance to take a nap, like just a 20-minute nap to reset. [I make sure that I have] these conscious breaks, whether [it's] napping or deep breathing because running a business is a marathon, and if we don't take care of our bodies, we're not able to do that over a very long time.""


""Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""Hamm's five-year marathon with Bearaby has led to over eight figures in sales and more than 10 patents — but it all started with a single, somewhat reluctant leap of faith. And according to the founder, that's exactly what it takes to be successful.""Once you believe in a product, just take a chance and give yourself a year,"" Hamm says. ""It's much more manageable if you [have] a considerable time frame where it's like, Okay, in that year, I'm giving everything I have, 100%. Because sometimes we second guess ourselves. After [a few] months or six weeks, we don't see the success, [and] we start doubting ourselves. You say [I have] one year, and I'm not asking if this is working. Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

Elle Rowley.When did you start Solly Baby as a side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?



After having my first baby in 2009, I was surprised to find a surge of creative inspiration that I had never known before having kids. My husband was still in school, and I was hungry to start something to supplement our meager student income. By the time I was pregnant with our second child in 2011, the online world was fertile ground for mothers looking to start a side hustle from home. I tried a few different things, but I intuitively knew that there was a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear, so I was pretty focused on that space throughout my pregnancy.I loved wearing my first baby, and I'd heard that wraps were the most comfortable way to wear an infant, so being industrious and broke, I made two wraps out of cheap jersey knit fabric — one for me and one for a friend who was also pregnant. While my crude prototype was far from what the product became, I could see the potential for this long piece of fabric to actually be a fashion accessory for the wearer rather than ""baby gear."" What really sealed it, though, was the first time I timidly ventured out holding my toddler's hand and carrying my baby wrapped on my chest. Before we left the front porch, he was asleep and breathing deeply on my chest. The increase in confidence that I felt with each step was palpable. I felt liberated, and at the same time, I'd never felt more connected to my baby. I knew I was on to something.


What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground?I found a fabric supplier in the fabric district of Los Angeles, purchased a few thousand dollars worth of fabric (thanks to credit cards and a loan from my in-laws), bought a used serger on Craigslist for $50 and opened an Etsy shop. Then, I got to work mostly when my babies were sleeping. I turned our house into a factory to make the first 50 wraps. I signed up for every local handmade market that I could find, which didn't garner great sales results, but the feedback I received from people in real life was invaluable. Lastly, in a decision that felt reckless at the time because of the cost, I hired my favorite photographer to take photos of me wearing my son. I had a nice camera and could have ""made-do"" on my own, but I knew that having beautiful images would help compensate for the many other areas where the brand was weak.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly BabyWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the business, and how did you navigate them?


Growth is expensive: I had no capital other than the $4,000 loan for fabric, and finance is not my area of expertise, so I knew I would need a very cash flow-positive business model. In the first three years, it was very challenging to finance our growth, but I can see what a gift it was now to have that constraint. Because we had no factoring terms with our suppliers or credit lines, we'd have to pay a hefty deposit on our production when we submitted the purchase order. Then, we'd pay the remainder of the balance upon completion. This made growth slow, and we were constantly underselling. As demand for the product grew, we started placing everything on preorder on our website, which gave us enough to pay for the order. This made it so our customers were essentially funding our growth.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the business bring in at that point?Sales had been growing year over year in 2013, but we were still only grossing a few hundred thousand dollars a year and taking home less than $100,000. Daily sales were still very inconsistent, which made it difficult to have a lot of confidence in hiring employees or even believing that this was anything more than a side hustle. I was hitting a wall of exhaustion when my husband and I made the leap of faith to bring him into Solly Baby with me. He'd finished school and was working with another startup, but we both felt his time would be better spent if we focused our efforts together. This shift immediately led to new growth and vision. His help also freed me up to work more on the business rather than in the business. We then hired our first employee, Kortney, who took over customer service and fulfillment in a way that freed my husband and me up to focus on growth.Just weeks after hiring Kortney, and days before I had my third child in the spring of 2014, we released our spring collection, and the demand went through the roof. Sales went from anywhere between zero to $3,000 per day to $2,000 becoming our new daily baseline — and releases bringing in tens of thousands of dollars in a day. We hit $1 million in sales that November, and by the end of that year, we knew this was much more than a side hustle.


You've since turned your side hustle into a very successful business. What does revenue look like now?It's been amazing to experience the growth we have been able to achieve. To see this business grow from my house to an Etsy shop to reaching millions of mothers, parents and families is truly humbling. As we continued to build the team and find our footing in the market, some years, we saw revenue double year over year. Today, Solly Baby operates at $10 to 20 million in annual revenue.What's your favorite part about running Solly Baby? As a mother of four, connecting with, encouraging and providing products for postpartum mothers during a very transformational time of life has always been life-giving work for me. It will never get old to meet a mother or father who says, ""Your wraps changed my relationship with my baby."" Knowing that our products have the power to change the trajectory of a parent-child relationship is deeply rewarding.


Developing company culture and ethos was also very rewarding. I made our company motto ""small things with great love"" several years ago because I hold a deep belief that small things done thoughtfully create the biggest and best things. This is relevant to growing a business and equally relevant to raising children. Seeing this adopted and trickle down into every part of the company as CEO felt very meaningful.What does your routine look like these days? Are there any helpful habits you'd recommend to other entrepreneurs?Keeping a daily routine is my best advice. I am a big believer in getting up before your kids (unless you have an infant — then sleep as much as you can!), exercising, getting ready for the day and taking at least 30 minutes for spiritual or meditative practice.It was easy in the early days to completely neglect myself to meet the needs of my family and the business, but I strongly believe that we would've grown faster and with more intention had I taken better care of myself from the beginning. I was running on empty all of the time, and it just about broke me in the first two years. What's more is that the business was not stronger because of my ""sacrifices."" I became very depressed and anxious and finally shared this with my husband. We made a self-care plan together, and everything quickly improved in my life, personally and professionally.


What's your best advice for others hoping to start a successful business of their own? We're often encouraged to ""think big"" when it comes to business, but sometimes, thinking ""small"" is the perfect way to begin — mainly because it will get you to begin. I don't think I would have had the confidence to start a multi-million dollar, global company at the age of 25, but I didn't need to. I just needed enough confidence to make the first 50 wraps to help pay the rent and a sincere desire to bring mothers and babies closer through the product. That was all I needed to get the ball rolling, and then my confidence and vision expanded with the company. We kind of grew up together, Solly Baby and me.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

29,A TikTok Ban Could Threaten the Livelihood of Many Entrepreneurs — Here's How Businesses Can Protect Themselves,"Mar 15, 2024",Andrea Casanova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-businesses-can-prepare-if-tiktok-is-banned-in-the-us/471211,"
By now, you've likely heard about the recent bill passed by the House of Representatives that can potentially enforce a ban on social media platform TikTok within the United States.Such news has left 170 million American TikTok users in a state of uncertainty as they grapple with the possibility of losing access to their go-to platform and the vibrant community it fosters.Moreover, it has sparked significant concerns for creators, small businesses, brands and entrepreneurs who have successfully monetized their presence on the platform, with some depending on it as their main source of income.



I'm right in the mix as one of those creatorpreneurs who've nurtured an awesome online community and used the platform as a launchpad for building and growing my own business. Thanks to TikTok, I've been able to take bold career steps and explore new income streams that I never would've dreamed possible.The thought of this possibility being taken from me and my fellow creators and small business owners, whose livelihoods hinge on the platform, is nerve-wracking, but alas, it's a reality we might need to prepare for.

Here are some actionable tips for creators, small businesses and marketing teams to consider while we await further updates:CreatorsCreators should shift their focus from short-term platform growth to long-term brand development.You are the brand: Rather than solely prioritizing the next social platform for growth, think about your next step as a brand. Many celebrities and mega-influencers venture into creating their own brands and products because they recognize that social buzz can be fleeting and seek to establish a lasting legacy beyond their image.Forge long-term partnerships: Communicate with trusted brand partners and discuss long-term multi-platform packages. Ensure brand partners can still effectively reach their target audience through your content.Monetize your knowledge: To provide additional value beyond traditional platform-specific campaigns, consider offering value-added services such as content creation workshops, influencer marketing consulting, or social media strategy sessions.Team up for growth: Consider collaborating with other creators to boost each other's reach on alternative platforms. By leveraging each other's audiences and expertise, you can expand your presence and navigate uncertain times more effectively.Related: I Made Over $250,000 in One Year as a Content Creator — Here's Why I'll Never Rely on It as My Main Income


Business ownersIt's time to assess your current database and leverage existing customer data to inform your next steps.Identify your superfans: Take a moment to recognize and prioritize high-value customers who contribute the most to your revenue and brand loyalty. Show appreciation for their loyalty with exclusive perks, personalized experiences, or special offers.Re-engage dormant customers: Identify inactive or dormant customers in your database and develop targeted re-engagement campaigns.Implement referral programs: Incentivize existing customers to refer friends and family through referral programs.Marketing teamsDon't just throw spaghetti at the wall on a new platform.Migrate strategically: Conduct comprehensive research to understand where your target audience is active online and how their behavior may shift in response to platform changes.Creative adaptation: Tailor creative assets and messaging to resonate with audiences across different platforms. Adapt storytelling techniques and engagement tactics to align with each platform's unique characteristics.Digital optimization: Optimize online presence, including websites, bios and social media profiles, to ensure consistency and accessibility. Make it easy for consumers to find relevant information and engage with your brand.Related: TikTok's Growth Rate Has Collapsed. 'Life' May Be Getting in the Way for Its Younger Users.General recommendations for allContent backup: Ensure the safety of your digital assets by downloading all of your content, including user-generated content related to your brand.Social sentiment analysis: Your comment section contains invaluable insights from your audience. Analyze feedback and adapt your strategies accordingly to optimize growth and sustainability.Be vulnerable: Feeling uneasy about such a massive industry shift is natural. Don't hesitate to share your journey and emotions with your audience.Don't go dark: Maintain an active presence on social media. Consistently share updates, engage with your audience and show them where to find you next.As we await further developments regarding the TikTok ban or sale, it's essential to remain innovative and connected. As a creator, my heart hurts, but as a viral marketer, I understand it's not the time to panic. Instead, it's an opportunity to adapt proactively and recognize the value of truly owning your audience.

30,"If You Want Your Dreams to Become a Reality, Harness These 3 Entrepreneurial Responsibilities","Mar 15, 2024",John Emery,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-turn-your-entrepreneurial-dreams-into-reality/470747,"
As entrepreneurs, we're simultaneously expected to be dreamers but never succumb to the slumber of inaction. We're supposed to be able to snap our fingers, fall into a trance, dream of some marvelous future, then awake to cast vision in a compellingly contagious way to our teams, and then martial pragmatic, organized marching orders. But shifting gears like that can be tough, especially at a blistering pace in an age of distraction.I'm inspired today to examine these three separate stages, which can each lull us in with their siren song and keep us stuck for far too long. Let's explore these three entrepreneurial responsibilities and the inflection points between each.The ""Dreaming""Some of us are natural dreamers. We collect concepts like keepsakes, and our heads stay in the clouds — incessantly flipping puzzle pieces and looking for previously undiscovered connections. This is how genuine innovation comes into the world. We must spend uninterrupted time putting things together.



It reminds me of Bill Gates at the height of his career, taking ""think weeks"" where he'd disappear for two weeks to amalgamate a dozen random books and recent learnings into fresh insight for Microsoft's future. Maybe this feels very natural for you, and if it does, make sure you don't get stuck here. Dreams in business are only helpful if you do something with them once you wake.Related: 10 Surprising Facts About Bill Gates


The ""Dramatizing""And then it's time to share. When you wake, how do you articulate your dream? And beyond that, how do you bring others into your idea? How do you compellingly tell the story that people understand and can even begin to own themselves? Some people are gifted communicators, and storytelling is second nature. But for those who need pointers, here's what I've found helpful — a distillation of the hero's journey.Your dream is likely solving some tangible problem people are plagued by. Introduce that person as the story's main character, with hopes and dreams of their own, only to be burdened by some impervious obstacle. They have a problem they can't solve on their own, and this problem is preventing them from achieving their own dream. They need help, and you are perfectly positioned to help them. Your personality is exactly the kind they connect with (perhaps even an inverse of their own personality, offsetting their negative personality traits), and your guidance speaks to both their head and their heart, encouraging and inspiring them to take action. You end by sharing a clear articulation of what's at stake (""What's the worst that could happen?"" by them not taking action, followed by ""What the best that could happen?"" with your help).Related: A Brand Story Is What You Need to Share Your Entrepreneurial Vision.That story formula will always resonate, no matter your audience or industry. And by telling it as a story, it's far more likely to be remembered and shared contagiously throughout your network. People remember and love telling stories, especially when they're easy to remember and have an emotional payoff.


The ""Doing""But now it's time to get moving. How does this baby giraffe of an idea take its first steps? Slowly — that's how — with great intention. In my fifteen years of entrepreneurship, I've found that milestones are great but that inchstones are even better.In your mind's eye, put yourself a year down the road. At that point, you've arrived at some new inflection, which will require another cycle of dreaming. Now, give yourself 3-4 milestones you need to hit between now and then. Don't worry about flowery language, and don't focus on feelings.Be as plainly pragmatic as possible when describing those milestones. Use phrases like, ""We raised enough for 24 months"" and ""We have our first paying customer."" And when you've got those milestones down, break each into 3-4 inch stones. Baby steps, if you will.This may seem wildly uninspiring or unrevelatory, and that's the point. When wrestling our wispy, aspirational brain into action, it'll feel like we're robbing our work of all its romance — and we are — but our future selves will thank us.


When that final milestone comes into view, it's time to dream again. Gather everything you've collected since your last dream, absorb it, take a break from your typical routine, and let yourself fall into a dream state again.Related: Moving Beyond the Idea Stage — 4 Strategies for Taking Action and Achieving Your Entrepreneurial GoalsThere you have it — the three primary hats most entrepreneurs are expected to joyfully vacillate between from day to day deconstructed in plain language. It takes extraordinary discipline to follow this flow and not jump back to dreaming again once you've shared an idea. As a point of confession, my biggest fault is over-dreaming and under-doing, so this process becomes my guardrail. And trust me, my team is grateful for it. There are only so many times you can jerk the wheel before people onboard get seasick and want off.Founders don't need to keep all three hats on as companies grow, thank God. As we experience a bit of success and hire to replace ourselves, we can slowly nuzzle into what we love most (the Dreaming, the Dramatizing, or the Doing). But in the first stages of entrepreneurship, we're likely going to have to wear all three hats.


And it's quite the dream.

32,You Can Fear It and Still Use It — Why Are So Many American Workers Shy About AI?,"Mar 13, 2024",Artis Rozentals,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/you-can-fear-ai-and-still-embrace-it-heres-why/470581,"
Recently, a study followed over 100,000 workers from the USA, Europe, the UK and India, tracking time spent in various AI applications during work hours. The tracked apps include AI apps such as ChatGPT and Perplexity and AI-enabled tools such as Canva and Bing that have added AI features to their apps.Here's how many hours the average worker spent using AI apps by country/region in 2023:USA – 93.6h (~12 eight-hour workdays)UK – 150.1h (~19 workdays)Europe – 175.1h (~22 workdays)India – 241h (~30 workdays)Moreover, generative AI darling ChatGPT was the most used AI app in all regions — except for the USA, where it came in second to the AI-enabled design tool Canva.



The data, corroborated by other studies, also strongly points to the average US worker being an outlier regarding AI adoption, which raises the question — why? And is it something to be worried about?Related: Why People Fear Generative AI — and What to Do About It


Why is it a worrying trend?Much ink has been spilled on how AI is a game-changer for businesses and knowledge workers. For employees specifically, it promises heightened efficiency and productivity across various fields, from content creation and design to business operations and data analysis.The general consensus is that companies and workers who fail to capitalize on these benefits will inevitably have to give way to those who do. Accordingly, there is a real risk of Americans falling behind the curve unless adoption is encouraged.Not just in terms of lost efficiency but also knowledge. We're still in the early stages of the AI revolution, meaning AI will only grow more advanced and capable as time passes. So, understanding the fundamentals of what AI is and how to leverage it can be invaluable in the long term, especially when AI becomes fully ingrained in our way of life and work.A good analogy is GenZ's relationship with technology. Having grown up with smartphones in hand, they're often unfairly expected to be tech-savvy and are even ridiculed when they struggle with some tech tasks that older generations may find self-evident. But this self-evidence comes from having grown up in tandem with the developing technology (What do you mean why is the save button a weird square?!) rather than any innate superior comprehension. Similarly, I expect that being intimately aware of how AI evolves will be advantageous to its users in the future, and early adopters will have the upper hand.


Related: Why You Shouldn't Be Afraid of Artificial IntelligenceOn top of all that, prompt engineering — the action of giving AI the best prompt for the intended results — is a skill, and just like any other skill, it must be honed. AI is a tool that must be learned and explored to get the most out of it, and the earlier you set out on your exploratory journey, the better equipped you will be for future challenges.At this point, one might ask – but what's the point if AI will take our jobs anyway?It's about attitudeUnderstandably, AI's disruptive potential and multifaceted capabilities have many workers worried about being made redundant. The public attitude toward AI is grim — nearly half of Americans believe that AI automation may hurt their job security, and three in four expect AI to negatively affect the job market at large, according to Gallup.


Of course, these worries are by no means exclusive to American workers. A public attitude survey by the UK's Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation found that ""while AI is expected to produce increased day-to-day convenience and improved public services, apprehensions remain about job displacement and human de-skilling."" French companies and employees are also concerned.But there's an outlier – India.While more than half of Indian workers mirror the growing unease about AI's potential impact on jobs, it's paired with optimism about the technology, with 74% excited about the prospect of AI in the workplace. The overwhelming majority view AI as an enabler that can significantly improve efficiency, productivity, quality of work, job satisfaction and overall happiness.I believe this, namely, attitude toward technology, is one major reason why workers in India use AI over two-and-a-half times more than American ones.Related: AI May Not Take Your Job, But Someone Using AI Likely Will — Here's Why.Unsubscribe from the nihilistic narrativeIn the Western public discourse, AI is generally portrayed as an existential threat to our way of life, as a foe coming to take our jobs and upend any shred of normalcy left in these turbulent times.Understandably, the natural response is to resist or to close your eyes and hope the trend will pass. But neither of these is realistic, as AI continues to permeate modern business and work environments.Faced with the fact that AI is here to stay, I believe the only viable avenue is to embrace it. Though its inner workings may be complex, the technology itself is extremely accessible, and any misconceptions can be quickly dispelled by simply trying it. In this regard, business leaders should carry the torch and encourage employees to begin using AI, if for no other reason than at least to alleviate their own daily workloads.


It's okay to be worried about change – everyone is. But don't let that stop you from growing as an entrepreneur or professional.As the freshly minted adage goes, ""AI won't take your job. Workers who use AI will.""

Early last year, two economists and two large language models chatted on a panel about the future of cognitive automation. The non-humans, ChatGPT and Claude, held their own, contributing meaningful insight to the conversation. At one point in the discussion, Claude remarked: ""I believe continued progress in AI and automation could take over most routine and even many non-routine cognitive tasks currently performed by humans, enabling unprecedented material abundance while liberating humanity from drudgery and toil.""As I read these lines, I found myself nodding. True enough, cognitive automation — automating mental tasks like administrative work, data analysis and content creation — has the potential to take human jobs. But if adopted conscientiously, it can also complement the work that only humans can do, and free us to pursue more meaningful tasks. The onus falls on leaders to ensure that employees receive the proper education and training to adapt to an increasingly AI-fueled workplace.Related: Always Waiting for the Best Option Is Holding You Back.

36,From Stress to Success — 6 Ways to Turn Your Fears into Resilience,"Mar 8, 2024",Rachel S. Ruby,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-conquer-your-fear-to-jumpstart-success/469018,"
Fear is the biggest obstacle to healing and personal success. Many challenging emotions tend to scare us when going through a trauma like divorce, especially those related to being alone and finances. All negativity and stress can lead to fear, which can actually prevent healing.To overcome fear so healing is possible, realizing the need to take action is imperative. It is common for people going through trauma to make plans as to what they will do to start over, but so many get derailed and don't actually take the steps to make the plans a reality.Related: 4 Ways Intuitive Healing Can Save Your Life — And How to Get StartedHere are some simple ways to take action to get started with the healing work.1. RelaxRelaxing sounds so simple — and it is — but it often gets overlooked amidst the chaos of life. It's important to remember that relaxation does not have to take long, and it will make you feel good — and when we feel good, we want more of that.



Healing is not possible when we are in a victim state or scared. We need to feel all the feelings and then learn to let those that do not serve us go so we can focus on the positive ones and the joy we can create in the new life we envision.Incorporate relaxation into your day every day — even if it's just for 10 minutes. Take a bath, go on a beautiful walk, meditate or read a book. Recognize what feels good and calms you because being in this state during stressful times will help you focus on getting to a place where you feel like this more often… until you heal and feel it the majority of the time.Related: 3 Mental Rules to Help You Understand (and Finally Relax) Your Busy Brain2.

Figuring this out involves diving into some deep questions about yourself to figure out what you need to work on to live your desired life. Most people need guidance to tackle some of the emotional states like low self-worth and false beliefs about oneself. Other limiting beliefs include shame, lack of confidence or the belief that we ""can't"" evolve from a caterpillar to a butterfly.3. FailFailure is necessary in order to grow. If we got what we wanted all the time, we would not feel appreciative — and gratitude is necessary not only for healing but as part of a happy life. Try new things, know you might fail, and revel in the lessons learned from that failure. It allows you to fine-tune who you want to be and what you want to create.Related: From Setback to Success — 4 Ways to Turn Your Struggles into Resilience4. RedirectWe are all made of energy; when that energy strays from the positive, we can hit a wall in our healing journey. This is normal and will happen often, so learn how to redirect that energy to set yourself back on the right path.


Depending on where the feeling manifests, there are things you can do to redirect. For example, say you are feeling down and sit on the couch binge-watching Netflix. In the process, you consume half a container of ice cream, and your stomach doesn't feel good. A redirect could be to turn off the TV, turn on some dance music, and get lost in movement. You will likely feel completely different after just a short time dancing (but keep going if it feels good!). Your action is opposite to what you were doing, allowing you to release negative energy.Related: The 5 Greatest Obstacles to Success -- and How to Crush Them5. Have funHealing shouldn't be so serious all the time. When we go through trauma like divorce, it is not uncommon to lose the connection with our inner child, as the process is usually stressful and sad. Just like redirecting energy through dancing, as in the example above, having fun helps us connect with that inner child, which can turn the perspective around.Make plans to have fun — don't just think you will do it. Go roller skating with a friend, shoot some hoops, play pickleball or whatever sounds fun. Try new things, too, and make sure to spice it up. New experiences fulfill a child's wonder and curiosity, so channel that perspective as you make plans.


6. Get helpIt's okay to ask for help; if you have the right support network of people who love and do not judge you, that can be a lifeline. Sometimes, we need professional help – like therapy, coaching, or energy work. You can learn about different ways to get help and see what suits you best. It will make healing much easier.

37,I Attended an Ivy League University's Most Popular MBA Leadership Class and Learned How Steve Jobs Became a Better Leader in 10 Minutes,"Mar 8, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/heres-how-steve-jobs-became-a-better-leader-in-10-minutes/470841,"
Hitendra Wadhwa, professor of practice at Columbia Business School and founder of Mentora Institute, teaches the university's most popular class on personal leadership and success — two topics that most business students are eager to learn more about.That much was clear on the rainy January day when I sat in on the afternoon session of Wadhwa's course; despite the dreary weather, the energy was palpable, with every seat taken and some attendees even standing in the back.Wadhwa wrote the literal book on looking inward to find outward success. In Inner Mastery, Outer Impact: How Your Five Core Energies Hold the Key to Success, Wadhwa reveals how activating purpose, wisdom, growth, love and self-realization can help people make a real mark on the world.

During the session I attended, Wadhwa relayed a compelling story about Steve Jobs that captures those core energies in action — and shows that the best leaders are willing to pivot, even when it's difficult.""Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.""The story starts in 2001, just before Apple was set to open its first retail store. Ron Johnson, the company's senior vice president of retail from 2000 to 2011, was riding to a weekly planning meeting with Jobs when he shared his concerns about the proposed layout of the new store.Like most retail outlets, Apple planned to organize its store by product. But Johnson saw an opportunity to design it according to activity, like making movies or listening to music, and lean into the innovation that had already helped Jobs' brainchild become a category of one.


But Jobs wasn't having it: The store's opening was fast approaching, and he didn't think there was time for a complete overhaul. Johnson and Jobs sat with the tension of that disagreement as they rode the rest of the way to the meeting.Related: As Steve Jobs Once Said, 'People With Passion Can Change The World'Then, about 10 minutes later, the pair walked into the meeting, and Jobs surprised Johnson by telling the team that Johnson believed the store's design was completely misguided — and that he agreed. Jobs said he was going to step aside while they all worked together to figure out the best way forward.By telling the story about Johnson and Jobs, Wadhwa makes an invaluable point: The kind of leader someone is in one moment doesn't have to dictate the kind of leader they'll be in the next. A willingness to change your mind and think outside of the box, even when it means additional challenges in the short term, isn't a weakness — it's a strength.


And, as Jobs himself once said, ""Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.""Related: Is Your Leadership Style More Steve Jobs or Elon Musk? Here's How to Tell — And Why It Matters.

38,"How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did It","Mar 8, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/advice-to-turn-your-side-hustle-into-a-7-figure-business/470819,"
More than half of Gen Zers and millennials have a side hustle, and 80% of them say they need the extra cash due to the state of the economy, according to a recent survey from LendingTree. From driving for rideshare services to teaching courses online, operating cotton candy vending machines, turning your backyard into a dog park, and so much more, there's something for everyone hoping to diversify their income streams — and anyone who might want to launch into full-time entrepreneurship, too.Sometimes, successful side hustlers grow their earnings to the point where they outpace the salaries from their full-time jobs, and it only makes sense to go all in on their new venture. But even people whose side gigs see less initial return might have an entrepreneurial spirit and clear vision that motivates them to commit in full, and with the right strategy and mindset, those businesses can also become highly profitable, hitting six- or even seven-figure months.Below are three women who did just that: Katherine Watercutter, founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge; Julie Berninger, co-founder of e-printables curriculum Gold City Ventures; and Danielle Cohen-Shohet, founder and CEO of booking and payments platform GlossGenius. Their journeys and areas of expertise are different, but they all know what it takes to go from a side hustle — maybe lucrative, maybe not — to a thriving multimillion-dollar business.

Katherine Watercutter: Gold HingeKatherine Watercutter is the founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge. When Watercutter was 23 and worked as a sales representative for a distribution company working with kitchen and bath designers around Indiana, she started the business as a side hustle. Lack of funding proved a major hurdle in the beginning, but today, Gold Hinge counts celebrities including Kristin Cavallari and Kaitlyn Bristowe among its fans. The brand also went viral during TikTok's ""RushTok"" trend, garnering 40 million hashtag impressions and sales in the multi-millions.Watercutter's advice: ""My advice may sound as cheesy as it gets, but don't give up. People in this day and age are impatient and sometimes quick to give up when they feel like they keep failing. There were a few times when I thought I hit 'rock bottom' and exhausted all options, but I found a way around it. I felt like I was failing consistently for three years, and I know many would have given up by then, but business is all about problem-solving.""Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.Julie Berninger: Gold City VenturesJulie Berninger is an Etsy shop owner and co-founder of Gold City Ventures with Cody Berman. Berninger worked as a project manager for large tech companies and planned to be in the industry long term, but the ""financial independence, retire early"" (FIRE) movement inspired her to start a side hustle. She opened an Etsy shop focused on the bachelorette party niche, then co-founded the online course business that teaches other entrepreneurs how to find success on the platform. She quit her 9-5 in 2021 when the income from her ventures replaced her salary.


Berninger's advice: ""Don't start a business by yourself! Pick a business partner and scale faster! Also, don't waste time trying to piece information together on YouTube. Pay for a step-by-step program or a business consultant because your time is valuable.""Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a MonthDanielle Cohen-Shohet: GlossGeniusDanielle Cohen-Shohet is the CEO and founder of GlossGenius, an all-in-one booking, payments and point-of-sale solution that helps beauty and wellness professionals drive bookings and grow their business. In college, Cohen-Shohet did freelance makeup out of her dorm room, and she and her twin sister also collaborated on a digital receipts payments venture. Ultimately, she'd pull from those experiences to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses — and build a software company worth over $510 million in the process.Cohen-Shohet's advice: ""Be fearless. Don't take no for an answer. And, importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.""

41,This Data Security Consultant Explains Why Businesses Should Embrace Web3 — But Do It Cautiously,"Mar 6, 2024",Ralph Tkatchuk,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/businesses-should-embrace-web3-but-do-it-cautiously/469900,"
After much initial skepticism and doubt, Web3 has emerged as a real source of value, paving the way for a new generation of decentralized applications (dApps) built on blockchain. These dApps provide fantastic opportunities for forward-thinking companies to transform their business operations and enhance their efficiency.A 2023 survey of 600 enterprise decision-makers in the U.S., U.K. and China found that nearly 90% of them deploy blockchain technology in some capacity, with 87% saying they planned to invest in blockchain in the next year. This reflects businesses' fear of being left behind as blockchain developments accelerate globally. According to Deloitte, 73% of financial executives believe their organization will lose an opportunity for competitive advantage if they don't adopt blockchain and digital assets.Advocates of Web3 laud the decentralized web's greater resilience and security compared to its predecessor, as blockchain ensures that every transaction is public and verifiable, improving record-keeping and data integrity.



However, despite the promise of blockchain's greater security, the increasing adoption of Web3 technologies has not eradicated security risks, merely changed them: The 2023 Web3 Security Landscape report by Salus shows that cyberattacks on the Web3 industry resulted in losses in excess of $1.7 billion last year, highlighting the extensive range of threats within the decentralized world.Related: Confused About Web3? Steve Aoki Dissects His Business to Show How You Can Make Money.


New security challengesWeb3 avoids some of the security headaches of Web 2.0 but introduces several new ones, almost all unique to the industry.Some of the biggest attacks of the year included the $200 million attack on the cloud-based blockchain services provider Mixin Network; the $197 million attack on Euler Finance; the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group attack on both the Poloniex cryptocurrency exchange and Atomic Waller, stealing more than $126 million from the former and more than $100 million from the latter.The majority of Web2 attacks target users. Most threats faced by the Web3 industry, however, take advantage of code vulnerabilities of decentralized applications and protocols. Access control issues accounted for 39% of all Web3 attacks, whereas flash loan protocols, where flash loans are used to maximize the impact of another form of attack like the exploitation of smart contract bugs or the manipulation of cryptocurrency asset prices on an exchange, contributed to more than 16% of attacks.User-targeted attacks, as mentioned, are ""less popular"" in Web3. Phishing attacks, which use social engineering tricks to manipulate unsuspecting users into exposing data, spreading malware infections or giving access to restricted systems accounted for a mere 4% of all attacks.


Besides software vulnerabilities, retail investors continue to fall for exit scams and ""rugpulls:"" fraudulent crypto projects that convince the community to back them before fleeing with the funds they've raised.Mitigation is possibleReassuringly, there are concrete steps that businesses can take to reduce the likelihood of falling victim to each of these threats. With appropriate caution and due diligence, there is no reason to pass up the many potential benefits of Web3.Related: 5 Essential Tips for Starting a Successful Web 3.0 VentureEnhance authenticationIntroducing more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, like decentralized identifiers (DIDs), access tokens or biometric and multi-factor authentication, will mitigate many security threats such as access control-based vulnerabilities and phishing attacks. Companies should make sure they always adhere to the principle of least privilege, a crucial step for remaining secure online across both Web2 and Web3.


Increase complexityAs in real life, cyber attackers like to get in and out quickly to avoid detection, so increasing the complexity of participation in Web3 projects will make attacks less likely. DeFi protocols offering flash loans can safeguard themselves against threats by introducing minimum borrowing amounts and time limits, as well as additional fees to raise the costs for attackers. In a similar vein, attacks on oracles can be reduced in a number of ways, such as by avoiding the use of markets with shallow liquidity for price predictions, and by increasing manipulation costs for attackers through the use of TWAP (time-weighted average price) mechanisms.Hardware wallets — the use of physical technology to store private cryptographic keys online until they are needed — can also help to avoid hacks. Short of physically stealing the hardware wallet itself, which resembles a USB drive, they are virtually impossible for cybercriminals to access.Implement checksAs with Web2, businesses should regularly update their access permissions to avoid chinks in their security armor. In addition, they should conduct thorough audits of all smart contract code, as this often falls prey to re-entry vulnerabilities. They should also adhere to the check-effect-interaction model.Perform due diligenceOrganizations can employ penetration testing to find and exploit their own vulnerabilities before attackers do. Extensive employee education is also crucial to enable individuals to identify and avoid phishing attacks and other threats.


Finally, make sure to research new projects and their teams carefully to ensure that they have a reliable track record, thus avoiding falling victim to rugpull scams. Prioritize projects that have undergone transparent security assessments by reputable auditors.Related: How to Own Your Online Narrative — Even When the Internet Owns YouEmbrace Web3, but do it cautiouslyThe high exposure to scams in Web3 is one of the major obstacles preventing mass adoption of decentralized technologies. However, though the amount of total losses in 2023 was very high, it was lower than the number for 2022. This suggests that the landscape's overall safety is improving, as more companies adopt the necessary precautionary measures.As Salus points out, $1.7 billion in losses is still an alarming number, and one that emphasizes the importance of improving security and educating users about the risks of Web3. The inherent vulnerabilities of the technology are distributed across multiple areas, demanding a multi-pronged approach to security, which can be enhanced by prioritizing those platforms and protocols that implement the strongest security measures.


My main takeaway from the report is that businesses need not shy away from embracing Web3 and all of the potential it offers. However, their adoption of the technology should be accompanied by extensive checks and research, and adherence to the same strict standards of security as they employ in their legacy technology systems.

42,3 Ways to Prepare Your Business For an AI Future,"Mar 6, 2024",Dean Guida,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-ways-to-prepare-your-business-for-an-ai-future/470297,"
It's official. AI has gone mainstream.Once reserved for researchers and enterprise companies alone, AI is now accessible to all kinds of organizations and everyday consumers. It's powering content and image generation, customer service, marketing personalization and, yes, even mechanical bees that are pollinating plants. And this is just the start of it.The growing capabilities of AI have quickly moved it from a buzzword to the top of businesses' to-do lists.



But there's no shortcut to implementing AI into your business. AI is more than just another platform in your tech stack – it's technology that can completely redefine how your company works and does business. This requires a complete organizational shift.AI is here to stay, but before businesses can fully dive into everything it has to offer, they have to make sure their organization and employees are ready for it. This includes the reskilling of employees, centralizing company data and making teams comfortable with AI, among other things.


Here are three ways to prepare your business for a future with AI.1. Make sure your data is AI-readyOrganizations today have hundreds of thousands of data points. Think, sales numbers, engagement with prospects, marketing stats, and so many others. The problem, however, lies in who has access to this data.Majority of the data within organizations is siloed between teams and executives – the sales team only has access to the sales data, the marketing team to marketing data, and so on. And for teams with access to data – it's spread across different channels and tools. For example, the marketing team has to check every individual platform they use (i.e., HubSpot, Google Ads, social media channels) for data and manually put it together to understand the big picture.All of this is to say that if employees can't even access their data easily, how is AI supposed to? Without data, AI cannot run.


Before companies can start their journey with AI, they need to centralize their data. One place where all of a company's data–or the metrics that performance, profitability, people and process–live and can be accessed by every employee.Companies that centralize their data will see benefits beyond AI as well. With data now at the hands of every employee, they'll increasingly look at it to make business decisions–rather than relying on their gut or guessing what's right.Related: AI May Not Take Your Job, But Someone Using AI Likely Will — Here's Why.2. Be transparent about AI's role in the workplaceWhile AI may have gone mainstream, there is much we still don't know about it. This can, understandably, cause some uneasiness among employees.Because it's still a new, developing technology, educating employees about AI and being transparent about how it will be used in the organization is important.There will inevitably be employees who think that implementing AI means that they're out of their jobs–but that's not the case.AI can help to complete the manual, time-consuming tasks that employees are responsible for daily, so employees can instead focus on more strategic and creative tasks. AI isn't taking their job – it's quite the opposite: AI is upleveling their role.An ongoing conversation with employees about AI and how the technology will evolve is crucial to AI's success in the workplace. It will help employees understand the why behind the technology and excite them about its opportunity.


3. Take it step by step with AIIt's easy to get excited by AI and its capabilities. There's so much potential in AI and its impact on your business–it's tempting to want to implement it as much as possible in every business area. But don't get in over your head.Start small with AI and then grow from there. There are new skills employees need to learn and tools they need to be onboarded to, not to mention getting used to AI in the workplace overall.Introduce AI to small pieces of a project instead of having it automatically take over a task. This will not only give employees time to learn how to use the technology but also make them feel comfortable enough with it to know it's there to help–not take over their job.Beyond onboarding employees to the technology and getting them to feel comfortable with it, it's critical to ensure that AI drives the success you want within the organization. There might be technology that doesn't work well for specific organizations, and that's ok, but it's better to figure that out before you move every aspect of your business to include AI.


Try introducing AI to specific departments or tasks for a few months and monitoring the success. If it's working, widen your work with AI. If it's not, it might be time to return to the drawing board.

We've been visiting the headquarters of some of the most innovative and imaginative leaders in business for The CEO Series, learning what it takes to launch and grow a thriving brand. For this episode, our crew went to the office of M1, a fintech platform that bills itself as ""the finance super app."" The powerful online investing and banking platform has raised $315 million at a valuation of about $1.5 billion and manages about $8 billion for half a million customers. I sat down with founder and CEO Brian Barnes to learn all about the platform, how it was created, and his advice to founders on running a company built to last.Below are some highlights of our conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. You can watch the full video above.The thrill of investing""M1 is a personal finance platform. We started the company about eight and a half years ago. We now manage about $8 billion on the platform for half a million customers. And we are really just trying to create the best possible way for someone to manage their finances. And we do that with a lot of personalization, customization, and automation. I was fortunate to be introduced to finance at a pretty young age and I was immediately hooked. I love the idea of investing, of trying to find out what a company's worth and how it's operating in a complex world. As an investor, you're making a high-conviction bet. If you're right, you make money. If you're wrong, you lose money. And so, you know, some people like sports gambling. For me, it is what is a company going to be worth in the next five or ten years.""

And so we have been trying to build the organization so that we can survive in any macro environment and not just be tailor-made for one.""


Calm in the storm""I try to stay calm — on the outside. [Laughs] The entrepreneurship quote I love is that the highs are high, the lows are low and they're ten minutes apart. There are times when you think you're taking over the world. And then there are times where you're like, What the hell am I doing? I took all this money, I convinced people to quit their jobs and join me, I'm competing against the Schwabs of the world. But stewing in all of that stress accomplishes nothing. I think maintaining my emotions and figuring out how I can allocate my time productively has been a good attribute that I've had as I've built the organization.""Related: How Personal Passions Fuel Business Success for the CEO of Vivid SeatsThe life of a founder""Being a founder of a tech company is more than just being a CEO. You're both the most senior and most junior person at the company. You get to set direction and strategy and things like that, but in any area where there is not someone dedicated to that role? It's on you to fill the gap. I would say I played CEO from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. And then I played junior analyst from 11 a.m. to midnight every night. You're just running around and trying to add value where you can. As you grow, you'd love to put things on pause while you figure out how to scale your team. But that's not how it works — you've got to scale your team and build a product and acquire customers at the same time. There's a little bit of chaos, but you have to sort of thrive in the chaos.""Related: Inside Potbelly's Recipe for Fast Casual Success


Legacy of leadership""My mom Brenda Barnes was CEO of PepsiCo and Sarah Lee. I mean, that's a great person to learn from. She was one of seven sisters. They all shared a bedroom. They were a Polish immigrant family in Chicago. Her father was a factory worker. And so, I think she always had an insanely healthy respect for people who did the actual work at her companies. The people who bottled the cola, who loaded the delivery trucks. As a CEO, you need to respect that they know their job better than you. And the leader's job is to set an example for what you want the values across the company to be. If you could write down all the positive attributes and values that you would want instilled throughout the company, then you better exhibit those things.""Check out more profiles of innovative and impactful leaders by visiting The CEO Series archives.

44,"As a Black Woman CEO, I Built a Remote Company Not Just to Save Money — But to Mirror My Commitment to Diversity. Here's How.","Feb 23, 2024",Catherine Mandungu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/as-a-black-woman-ceo-i-built-a-remote-company-not-just-to/469043,"
In the tech industry, global diversity is more than a buzzword phrase — it is the engine of innovation and leadership. Launching my startup was a new beginning. It was fueled by my journey as a Black woman entrepreneur. I chose to be a remote operation not just to save money. It was also to craft a work culture that showcases my core values and the complexity of our global community. This decision was less about following trends and more about purposefully nurturing a diverse and connected environment.Diverse teams have an advantage in decision-making, task execution and innovation. This advantage is becoming increasingly logical. Diverse teams outperform groups that are not diverse. Robust data supports this. The benefits of diversity go beyond theory. They boost a team's innovation and finances. In 2023, about 16% of companies had gone fully remote and about 28% had gone hybrid. The importance of remote work and diversity is clearer than ever. These trends show that remote work is possible. They also highlight the key role of diversity in modern business success.Related: How to Build Team Culture in a Remote-Work World



Building a diverse and global teamOur strategy for building a diverse team is rooted in a deep dedication to diversity. It is a guiding principle and a daily practice. We've created a thorough remote onboarding process. It helps new team members join our culture and rhythms. The system has virtual meet-and-greets, in-depth project orientations and ongoing mentorship. It has been pivotal in building a unified team spirit. This spirit is undeterred by the lack of physical closeness.We tackle the challenges of distance. We do this by doing regular virtual team-building exercises. They are designed to build community and improve team dynamics. Twice-a-year in-person meetings at key locations have strengthened our team, as well.


Our global team is from the United Kingdom, France, Bulgaria, the Philippines and India. It brings together a rich mix of perspectives. These enrich our work and foster an environment ripe for innovation. It's a diversity of thought and culture. It doesn't just encourage creative problem-solving — it also bonds us as a team. It shows that distance is no barrier to building a strong, cohesive unit.Harnessing geographical diversityThe diversity of our team is among our most significant assets. We show commitment to being sensitive and inclusive. This is seen in our communication practices and in our scheduling and observance of local traditions. This respect for each team member's heritage enhances our output and experience. It embodies the essence of a globally connected team.We use our geographical diversity to be available to clients around the clock. We offer solutions based on a deep understanding of their unique needs and challenges. Using time zone differences well guarantees our responsiveness. It also brings rich ideas and views to our projects. This sparks innovation and a global approach to problem-solving.Diversity comes in many forms. It ranges from location to culture and language. It helps us handle challenges with many strategies. This boosts our problem-solving abilities a lot. Our ability to view issues from many angles has been key, helping us to secure pivotal clients. It lets us showcase the real benefits and value of our diverse views. This not only reaffirms the importance of cultural diversity, but also highlights it as an important driver of superior business performance.


Related: How Cultural Understanding and Adaptation Drives Business SuccessFostering innovation with global insightsCreating a diverse remote team has been a game-changer. It sparked unmatched innovation and a deep understanding of global markets. The array of perspectives in our team empowers us. It lets us address challenges with new solutions and creative thinking, improving our problem-solving abilities. Our global footprint provides insights into varied market dynamics. It includes consumer behaviors and business practices. This allows us to craft cutting-edge solutions with global relevance.Empowering transparency and developmentAt the heart of any thriving team is effective project management. By adopting online tools, we achieve transparency in every task and project, ensuring all team members are informed of their roles and responsibilities. This method promotes a culture of accountability and cooperation. Alongside this, we prioritize the continuous professional growth of our team. We provide access to online courses, webinars and virtual workshops. Tailored to our team's expertise. They equip our team to lead in industry innovations and practices. We focus on clarity in operations and on nurturing our team's development. This focus boosts our efficiency and drives our ongoing innovation and progress.Personal growthBuilding a remote team has been transformative. It has offered me substantial personal growth and the freedom to immerse myself in different cultures in Asia and Europe. Enriching my personal life on a day-to-day basis. It has also broadened my leadership in a multicultural setting. Learning from different cultures and business practices has been eye-opening; it's shown me the key role of diversity in success.


This change reflects a wider trend among remote workers. In particular, millennials show more engagement in workplaces that champion inclusivity. They highly value cognitive diversity and see the importance of solving business challenges through teamwork. For this generation, inclusion goes beyond representation. It's about fostering an environment where every voice is heard. All perspectives contribute to better business solutions.Related: Diverse Workplaces Generate 19% More Revenue Than Less Diverse CompetitorsConclusionBuilding a diverse remote team is a journey. It requires continual learning and flexibility. This initiative has many benefits. It will spur innovation, promote inclusivity and expand our global outlook. These benefits are immense. They far outweigh any obstacles we encounter. This approach drives groups to better achievements and creates a more inclusive and interconnected global work environment by embracing diversity in all its forms.

Now that my children are getting older, I find myself meeting their needs less at home and more outside the home — more specifically, instead of braiding their hair, helping them with their homework or making them a snack, they're now looking to me to drive them to their activities and chauffeur them and their friends around town. As much as I love being a full-time mom, this has created a bit of a conundrum for me as a full-time business owner: How can I remain as involved in my kids' lives as I've always been while still getting in my required daily allotment of work?Enter the newest trend in American professional culture: mobile work time. And by ""mobile,"" I mean literally taking some work on the road with me in my automobile.Granted, using your car as an alternate workspace isn't conducive to certain duties and functions. When you need to hunker down and attend to serious tasks that require serious attention, there's no replacement for the permanent office space where you keep all the many tools of your trade. But as for a lot of the ""filler tasks"" that fill your days? You might be surprised at just how many you can accomplish from your car!

Nor will I cover the spate of new products designed to keep us working efficiently wherever we are. There are numerous sources you can access that will point you to all the mobile equipment and technology you could ever need.Rather, for those of us who are still mostly office-bound, I'm just talking about squeezing more juice out of the fruits of our labors by taking advantage of the benefits of working on the go, including:It makes productive use of what would otherwise be dead time.It expands the boundaries of when, where and how you can be more efficient and time-effective.It gives you a break from the office, a change of scenery, without necessarily having to break from work.It provides time limits on tasks you want to limit (like phone calls you want to keep brief).Adobe agrees that certain tasks lend themselves particularly well to working out of your car: marketing and social media management, virtual assistance, writing and content creation, and sales and business development. No wonder I'm such a fan — as the CEO of my PR firm, that's what I do most of the time.Examples of prime opportunities to work out of your carHere are some recent instances when I was able to convert in-vehicle time to high-performance spans of work output.


Waiting in the cell phone lot at the airport. Over the holidays, I went to pick up family flying in. When their delay turned from 20 minutes to 40 to an hour, I happily found time to check and return all the phone messages that were awaiting me.Parked in the lot of an athletic field. One of my kids has an hour-long soccer practice two days a week. It hardly makes sense for me to drop her off and turn right around to pick her up, so I now stay parked beside the field, where I can not only keep an eye on her but also get a solid hour of uninterrupted work done. I now dedicate this ""wait time"" to going through my email box and paring it down. (I do the same thing when the kids want to hang out in the mall for a while.) It's made a significant difference in my inbox management.Breaking at highway rest stops. When you have to take longish drives, the breaks advised to stretch your legs and rest your back are an opportune time to multitask. Walking in circles around the lot, getting some steps in, I dictated half a dozen voice memos to myself on things to follow up on when I got back to the office, then several more to my staff, which I texted to them on the spot for timely implementation.Intentional turnoffs between client visits. On my last trip to Nashville to visit a handful of clients in person, I used the rental car as my ""think tank."" While driving to my different appointments, I turned off the radio, looked straight ahead and let my mind do its creative thing: PR campaign ideas, pitch themes, content creation. By the time I purposely pulled over before reaching my next meeting, I had several good brainstorming thoughts to jot down about my last meeting.Stealing away in the driveway or garage. Over winter break, the house just got too loud with all the kids home from school. I wanted to make a good first impression on a potential new client, so I grabbed my laptop, headed out to the garage and attached the portable organizer I store in my car for just such purposes to the back of my front seat. I conducted the call in peace, totally calm, without distractions, and landed the client. Granted, it was winter in upstate New York, so I warmed up the garage first with our space heater!Related: 21 Productive Things to Do on Your CommuteThe end of the roadLastly, a few tips I've learned from experience:For safety, I suggest backing into parking spaces so you can keep a better eye on your surroundings.Move to the passenger seat or back seat for room and comfort.Email yourself documents ahead of time that you know you'll need quick access to.Pre-plan to have a reliable hot spot where you're going to ""park it"" as well.Consider carrying along a collapsible file folder in your car to keep notes and paperwork organized per client when you're away from your desktop file system.You should never, ever attempt work duties that will distract you from driving when you're actually behind the wheel, motoring from point A to point B. Safety is obviously the paramount concern. But when you're not in transit, it's worth exploring how much you can get done on the road!

46,"AI May Not Take Your Job, But Someone Using AI Likely Will — Here's Why.","Feb 23, 2024",Lena Grundhoefer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/ai-may-not-take-your-job-but-someone-using-ai-will/469505,"
Artificial intelligence is changing the way marketing and PR agencies are run.Research shows that 68% of public relations professionals use AI, 68% of SEO experts are exploring it, and 61.4% of marketers are using it. It's easy to see why.AI usage in social media is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.04% through 2028, and large language models increasingly write online search results. We even have AI influencers taking over, with a reported 34% of American consumers putting their trust in them, and the highest-paid virtual influencer, Lu Do Magalu, is earning an estimated $16.2 million per year with sponsorships from brands like Adidas and Mac Cosmetics.



It's clear that AI is here to stay, and it's making a huge difference for companies in various ways, especially when creating online content. This is rapidly changing the tasks that marketers, SEOs, and PR professionals perform while augmenting their skill sets with powerful (albeit somewhat inaccurate) tools.If you want to build a successful agency, the traditional advice is to hyper-focus on one niche and be the best at it to generate revenue and grow your team. Using AI, however, a single person can do the work of an entire team, and many solopreneurs are using it to diversify their offerings as the technology creates dramatic shifts in legacy agency models.


Related: How to Own Your Online Narrative – Even When the Internet Owns YouExploring AI tools in marketingThere's no shortage of AI tools built for agencies–transcription tools like Otter AI and Descript, for example, make it easy to record and transcribe client meetings. These transcriptions make it easier to assign work to freelancers and ensure they have the client's exact wording and specifications.AI image-generation tools like Midjourney and Adobe Firefly can reduce operational costs while ensuring you have high-quality images for client social media, marketing, ads, and other channels. Runway ML takes visuals a step further by transforming text and images into video, and ElevenLabs provides AI-generated voiceovers.Finally, large language models like Perplexity make online research much faster and more efficient. Of course, there are also risks inherent in using AI in your agency.


Related: 10 AI Tools That You Should Be Using In Your Business This YearOvercoming risks of using AIExpect clients to have strict AI requirements, as a recent Cisco survey found that 27% of companies fully ban AI tools, while a majority limit employee use. This is because generative AI sparked a lot of controversy over the past two years, and there are various ethical considerations, including amplified biases and potential copyright infringement.Last month, a study from Gary Marcus and Reid Southen showed Midjourney v6 reproduces almost exact movie stills, and both Wacom and Magic: The Gathering drew heat online for using generative AI images in their advertising, and the latter fired their agency after the snafu.Related: What Will It Take to Build a Truly Ethical AI? These 3 Tips Can Help.


Making matters worse, AI image detectors like Hive and text detectors like Originality AI produce false positives, blurring the lines between human and machine-generated content. Even if you pledge not to use AI, the freelancers you hire may still introduce it into your workflow, causing unexpected problems.If you do use AI, there are four steps you can take to ensure it's being used safely and correctly.1. Don't publish AI outputs as your ownRaw AI outputs should never be used as the final published product, whether images or text. They aren't legally protectable, per the US Copyright Office's AI guidelines, and claiming AI outputs are your own is plagiarism. Since it's impossible to know what content most models were trained on, it's best to use AI either in the ideation phase or as one small piece of a finished product.2. Be transparent about using AIIf you use AI in any way, be upfront with clients and the public. Having AI usage laid out plainly in your contracts and any content using it is best. Being caught using AI without disclosing it can lead to drastic negative consequences, like this indie book cover contest that was canceled after the artist lied about the use of AI against the rules of the contest. If a publication doesn't want AI pitches or editorials, be sure to honor those requests.


3. Be careful with proprietary dataUnderstand that any information input into an AI may potentially be trained on or viewed by an outside party. Several instances were reported in the past year of ChatGPT leaking sensitive information to other users, and it's important to be mindful of what information is entered into any AI tools. Don't input anything into a prompt that you don't want anyone to see.4. Keep a human in the loopIt's easy to get lazy and submit mistakes you normally wouldn't when using AI. Channel Nine in Australia recently learned this the hard way when an image of politician Georgie Purcell was edited with Adobe Firefly and drew accusations of sexism. This technology isn't a replacement for humans–it's an augmentation. Be sure to thoroughly check any AI work before turning it in and making mistakes that ruin the reputation of your agency or client.Related: 3 Smart Things to Know Before Getting Started with AIGetting started with AI in your agencyAI can be a game-changer, and staying on top of technological advancements is important. It can give you a competitive edge over larger firms with a longer staff list. However, it requires purpose and care to implement correctly, and the consequences for misusing AI can be dire.


More than anything, honesty is the best policy. Companies are continuing to implement internal rules about the use of AI, and a subsection of consumers are always looking to catch a company using it without disclosure. As long as you properly label where AI is used in your workflow, the benefits and the efficiency that come out of it can be worth it.

  This Black Founder Was Denied a Business Loan and Set Out to Prove the 'Gatekeepers' Wrong. He's Made More Than $500,000 So Far — But It's Just the Beginning.
  
    Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, started an Instagram account to share his love of floral arrangements — then the requests started rolling in.

      Key Takeaways    



        Gooljar began arranging the flowers his roommate brought home from Trader Joe's in 2020.
      


        He grew the IRIS blossom Instagram account to more than 40,000 followers and has made over $500,000 in just a few years. 
      


        Gooljar is on a mission to keep growing and lift up other diverse creators along the way.
      












""I've always been an artist,"" Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, says. ""I've always been a creative person. I've done a lot of mixed media, painting, drawing, music, photography, but my medium shifted to floral.""In 2020, Gooljar was struggling with depression while working toward his Ph.D. in urban, social and economic geography, and he credits his then-roommate Becca Whittier as ""the catalyst"" for his new creative outlet. Whittier would bring flowers home from Trader Joe's, and Gooljar would arrange them.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom



Arranging flowers became a passion, and Gooljar decided to start an Instagram to bring others along on his artistic journey, especially those who might feel excluded from an industry known for lacking diversity. The average florist in the U.S. is 47 years old, and most of them are women (77.2%) and white (77.3%), according to data from Zippia.With his social media platform, Gooljar put out the kind of representation he wanted to see: ""Hey, I'm a queer Black florist — kind of, not really. I'm just playing with flowers, but watch me, and let's see what happens.""


What happened was IRIS blossom, named for Gooljar's rescue pitbull Iris, turned into a successful business.Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.People saw Gooljar's posts on the Instagram account, which grew from zero to more than 40,000 followers, and began asking to buy arrangements. In the past three-and-a-half years, the self-funded company has fulfilled thousands of orders and made more than $500,000 — but it's just the beginning.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossomGooljar is expanding IRIS blossom to South Florida, where he moved last year, while Whittier and two employees continue to helm the company's operations in Greater Charlotte. Meanwhile, he's working with another business partner, Jihann Hanchell, to get IRIS blossom's sister business, island IRIS, off the ground in Turks and Caicos. The idea there is to offer ""full-scale design"" for luxury events.""He was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan.'""Gooljar isn't entering into these floral ventures ""blindly,"" he notes. He also has a holding company and a consulting firm. Still, despite Gooljar's entrepreneurial savvy and IRIS's track record of success and growth, its journey hasn't been without some serious challenges. Two of the biggest barriers, according to Gooljar? Funding and space. And in the floral industry, those tend to go hand in hand.


""It's very hard for small businesses to exist in Charlotte without being pre-existing,"" Gooljar says. ""Pre-existing meaning that A, you come from money or B, you have somebody to help you. So we worked out of our two-bedroom apartment [when] we were doing events that were $15,000-$16,000, and we were doing it on our kitchen island that was six-and-a-half feet long. We had buckets all over the house.""IRIS blossom has been ""100% self-funded"" from the start and able to accomplish all it has thanks to its supportive clients, Gooljar says. The revenue earned goes back into the company's growth, a strategy that's helped it achieve its milestone of $500,000 in revenue in just a few years. But in the early days, Gooljar did try to secure a business loan — and was turned away.Related: This Black Founder Stayed True to His Triple 'Win' Strategy to Build a $1 Billion Business""I had a white banker in Charlotte, and he was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan because you have to be in business for a few years,'"" Gooljar recalls. ""And then I would ask, 'Well, how are people who are just starting a business getting a loan?' 'Oh, they probably have an online presence, or they probably just go into it with money, and then they can put up their own money.' That kind of quasi, not-really-plausible explanation about funding and gatekeeping funding.""


Affording space in Charlotte remained a significant obstacle. Eventually, Gooljar and Whittier moved into a three-bedroom apartment. But there still wasn't enough room for the rapidly growing business, and Gooljar didn't want to spend all the money they made on rent. At one point in their search for a reliable place to store their expensive, perishable materials, someone offered to rent them an Airstream travel trailer for thousands of dollars a month sans air conditioning or running water.Now, Gooljar lives and works out of a house in Florida.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom


""It's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is.'""Throughout his time building IRIS blossom, Gooljar says he's ""stepped on a few toes"" within the gatekept industry and has had to field some pointed questions: ""Well, who are you?"" ""Is your business going to last?"" ""How's your little business going?"" ""How's your flower thing going?""But none of that has deterred Gooljar, who comes from a ""very long line of people working hard.""""My grandma cut sugar cane for 40 years in Trinidad,"" Gooljar says. ""My parents came here with nothing and worked and tried their best. And I'm trying to change that tide. So yeah, it's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is, and I'm putting in the work for it.'""

Now She Has $25 Million in Funding — and Smart Advice for Fellow Black Women Founders.Gooljar admits that ""there's still a long way to go"" in transforming the industry into a more inclusive space, but he's happy to report that other diverse floral businesses popped up in Charlotte after his own — because ""there's room for everybody.""""I see some of the landscape changing, especially when I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody else that's Black, or I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody that's young, or I go in there, and I see somebody with pink hair or something,"" Gooljar says.""You have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall.""Next, Gooljar plans to implement a national subscription program for IRIS, a sort of ""color-by-numbers"" approach. He'll ship the flowers nationwide, and customers can follow along with his arrangements via video. ""I want people who don't feel creative in their current jobs or current lives to get that creative outlet just the same way that I needed that outlet,"" he says.In the long-term, Gooljar's goal is to collaborate with a tech company to make it possible for people to order IRIS flowers on an app ""like they do an Uber."" But even though Gooljar envisions IRIS as a wide-scale service allowing employees to run ""little mini IRIS blossoms out of their own homes,"" quality remains a top priority.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom

It's not always easy, and Gooljar admits there have been ""plenty of times"" he wanted to give up, but he's always kept going — never wavering in his belief that great things are on the other side.""You can ask anyone that I know, and they will tell you that they don't know anybody that grinds the way that I do,"" Gooljar says. ""And I'm not saying that you just have to throw yourself into everything all the time. But I think a big part of this is that you have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall. There are always going to be roadblocks. There are always going to be obstacles. There are always going to be things to climb, but you have to just keep going.""

48,4 Reasons Why Your Customer Service Is About to Get a Whole Lot Better in 2024,"Feb 22, 2024",Mike Murchison,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-ai-customer-service-will-get-a-whole-lot-better-in-2024/469240,"
You've just assembled your new grill, but you're stumped on how to hook it up to the gas line. So you call customer support and start talking with an agent. Turns out they're an AI, not a person, but it's hard to tell the difference.Answering questions in conversational English, the agent asks you to share a video of the barbecue so they can ""see"" it — then talks you through a fix in real time. Problem solved.Sound like science fiction? Soon, such calls will be routine.



That's good news for consumers. When it comes to AI and customer service, we're going to see a virtuous cycle in 2024. As the technology gets better, cheaper and easier to use — a far cry from the stiff, robotic chatbots of just a year or two ago — more companies will embrace it.In turn, many people will have their first truly positive experience with an AI agent. Consumers are ready to engage. In a recent poll, eight out of 10 respondents said they're comfortable with using generative AI for customer support or service inquiries.


As the founder of a company that specializes in AI customer service, I know how much companies value this technology. Already, AI agents handle upward of 70% of customer conversations, according to one estimate. As those agents start outperforming their human counterparts in many respects, look for the quality of customer service to greatly improve.With that in mind, here are four trends that will drive a better AI customer experience in 2024.Related: Why AI Is the Next Revolution In Customer Service1. Generative AI for voice support goes mainstream""For billing, press 8."" We've all experienced the frustration of getting stuck in a phone menu with an automated voice agent whose only skill seems to be pressing our buttons. Good news for consumers in 2024: Those agonizing calls will soon be history.


That's because customer support is shifting from declarative to generative AI. For users, it's the stark difference between punching numbers and having a real conversation about why that mystery charge appeared on your credit card statement. Even better, rather than direct you to the billing department, the agent will give you an informed answer about what happened and even be able to resolve the issue on the spot.It's no leap to say that some of these experiences may soon prove more effective and satisfying than traditional interactions with human agents. Often, through no fault of their own, the people who staff support lines could use better training, don't speak the same first language as their customers and lack access to the business systems of the company they represent.The new breed of AI agents don't face such challenges. Capable of absorbing and following detailed instructions, they're fluent in your language of choice. These agents also play nicely with company systems, allowing them to handle tasks like tracking orders and issuing refunds. The most capable ones will have the same authority as a manager, removing the need to pass a customer between people to resolve an issue.For companies, the benefits are real. In one study, businesses using generative AI in contact centers tripled customer satisfaction versus peers that didn't.


2. Multimodal communication takes root in customer supportIn the new and improved world of AI customer support, voice is just one element of truly multimodal communication, which will spring to life this year.Traditionally, phone support, chat support and other channels like email have been largely siloed. We've probably all had the frustration of just wanting to text a photo or video on a service call, only to find there's no easy way to do it. Even as AI has transformed customer service, these platforms have remained largely walled off from one another. Until now.In 2024, customers will be able to contact a brand via their channel of choice, moving seamlessly between talk, text, video and pictures, just like they do in chats with friends and family. All of those channels will work together to help them best resolve an issue.Multimodal will give AI customer service agents the power to do everything from eyeballing a broken product to offering customized financial advice. Can't figure out how to mount that new OLED TV? Start a video chat with an AI agent, which can use machine vision to pinpoint exactly the mounting bracket you need, then text you a code to buy one.We caught glimpses of this fast-approaching multimodal future in Google's recent demo of its new Gemini AI model. The model is ostensibly a breakthrough, powering a chatbot that holds spoken conversations with users and can recognize, distinguish between and describe images. Yes, Google took heat for making it look like Gemini could process visual information instantly, but it won't be long before multimodal customer support will be table stakes for any business using AI agents.


Related: Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Human Interaction? 4 Ways AI is Impacting and Empowering Customer Experience3. Brands peer inside their AI agent's brainFor all of the upsides, some early efforts at generative AI for customer support have left companies and consumers frustrated. Brands have struggled with irrelevant or unhelpful answers, ""AI hallucinations"" and even bots that defy business logic. Just ask the car dealer whose AI agent offered one customer a brand-new Chevy for $1. The classic refrain: ""Boy, are these bots dumb.""What's often overlooked is that poor outcomes are usually the result of poor or unclear instructions from humans. Until now, however, it's been exceedingly hard for companies to peer inside their AI's decision-making process and understand the ""why"" behind decisions — the frustrating ""black box"" problem. But new software tools are shedding light on the reasoning that informs AI responses, giving brands a chance to see where things went wrong and to correct course.That makes a big difference in customer service, where understanding why an AI agent made a decision is just as important as the decision itself. In fact, it's the only way to drive improvement.


Let's say an agent gave a customer a refund that wasn't warranted. By using a tool to examine the agent's reasoning, the company discovers that the person who trained it gave conflicting instructions. What looked like a mistake on the agent's part was actually a management error. Knowing that, the company can issue new guidance to avoid future mix-ups.Like people, AI agents often have a good reason for a questionable decision, given the chance to explain themselves.4. AI manager becomes a hot jobThe growing capacity to course-correct AI agents hints at a broader trend in 2024. Smart companies are increasingly treating their AI agents not like a piece of software but like an actual employee. Brands seeing the greatest return from their AI investments have quickly discovered that it's not enough to simply buy an agent and set it loose. To thrive, that worker needs to be onboarded, measured and coached — like any other employee.And those tasks call for a new breed of manager we'll see more of in 2024.


AI employee manager is already a key role at companies like money management firm Wealthsimple, one of our clients. Along with setting goals for their AI agents, giving them feedback and helping them learn, AI managers must bring data analysis, project management and technical skills to the table. It represents a true leadership role — one with the potential to make an outsized impact on business results — and will become an important career stepping stone for young professionals across industries in 2024.Related: 5 Strategies to Protect Your Company's Customer Service from AI PitfallsSooner rather than later, AI agents will start collaborating with each other, too. For example, a customer service AI agent inside a streaming platform might notice that a login button is broken for iOS users. Time to alert the code generation AI agent to issue a fix. These generalist and specialist agents will need a new class of ""HR"" to coordinate them. At first, that job will likely fall to the CIO, who will turn to new dashboards to track the AI team's performance, analogous to performance management software for people.The biggest transformation of all in AI customer service this year may well be our own expectations. Early AI support experiences may have underwhelmed some of us. In 2024, prepare to be wowed.

49,Beware the Temptation of Dishonesty — How One Lie Could Sink Your Business,"Feb 22, 2024",Zamir Shukho,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-one-lie-could-destroy-your-business/469466,"
Many promising entrepreneurs and business owners seek investment, making it tough to convince someone to invest in their idea/startup. As a result, some individuals tend to exaggerate the quality of their ideas or products. If the venture succeeds and generates substantial profits, investors are usually satisfied. However, dissatisfaction may arise if things don't go as planned — and they do a lot of times!Fundraising is a long process that may take months before making any decision. Why months? Because every responsible fund conducts due diligence, delving deep into the startup and analyzing every aspect of it takes time. Some funds also attract external experts – we use this practice in Vibranium.VC.Related: The Importance Of Honesty And Integrity In Business



Why dishonesty is so temptingThe deceptive temptation to take shortcuts is often based on a desire to present the startup in the best light possible, attracting investors and customers with an idealized version of reality. However, this slippery slope can lead to potential pitfalls, where one small untruth snowballs into a catastrophic downfall for a startup.Back in fall 2023, we were considering one startup for potential investment, conducted analysis, and held interviews — standard procedures for every potential investment we make. The company was making about $2M in annual revenues, growing and positive. But we felt that there was something off; every time we asked for DEMO access to the platform, the founder would throw a fit, not wanting to cooperate. Even though, during our calls, the founder would operate a demonstration showing how the platform creates value for its customers.


So, we decided to conduct additional technical due diligence with two different expert teams. It turned out that we were shown an excellent Figma design all this time without an actual platform behind it. This project was a classic ""fake it till you make it,"" and it was a deal breaker for us. We can understand that sometimes MVP is still in the process of making, but a deliberate lie that the revenues generated in the company come from nonexisting platforms was a no-go for us.Entrepreneurs may underestimate the consequences of dishonesty, believing that the ends justify the means. Yet, the truth has a way of revealing itself, and when it does, the repercussions can be severe, from ruined reputations to legal consequences. Giving in to the temptation to be deceptive can seriously harm the foundation of a startup.Related: Stop Lying to Your Team — And Yourself. Try Radical Honesty Instead.Turn the truth into your strategic assetStatistics indicate that, on average, the partnership between an investor and a startup lasts longer in the USA than a marriage – more people divorce faster than investors and startups part ways, achieving exit.


Based on my experience, honesty emerges as a powerful strategic asset for entrepreneurs. Successful businesses have thrived on transparency and building trust with customers, investors, and employees. Honesty is not just a moral imperative but a smart business move fostering long-term relationships.Several examples in the business world showcase the impact of truth as a strategic asset. Even when the news is not entirely positive, companies that openly communicate their challenges and successes often gain respect and loyalty from their stakeholders. By being forthright about shortcomings or setbacks, entrepreneurs can build a foundation of trust that withstands the test of time.When an investor has to decide in complex startup situations, for example, to support the startup or not for the second or third time, if there is no trust, the investor is likely not to support the startup because they will already feel deceived. Therefore, it is very important to embed these relationships from the very beginning on the principles of transparency, openness, and honesty. These basic things are important because they form the foundation for future years of relationships and communication between the investor and the startup. There have been cases where some of our startups needed bridge rounds, and we were ready to support them because they were honest about their situations and what they needed.Related: 3 Ways to Build a Culture of Radical Honesty (and How It Can Transform Your Business)


Navigating the gray areasIn the complex entrepreneurship landscape, ethical dilemmas often arise in grey areas. A gray area is an area or situation in which it is difficult to judge what is right and wrong. Entrepreneurs face tough decisions that test their commitment to honesty. Real-world scenarios illustrate the importance of choosing the path of transparency, showcasing positive outcomes resulting from these decisions.Navigating the grey areas requires a commitment to ethical decision-making. Entrepreneurs must weigh short-term gains against long-term consequences, recognizing that honesty, even when uncomfortable, ultimately builds a more robust and resilient business foundation.Related: Science Has Confirmed That Honesty Really Is the Best Policy in the WorkplaceCulture of honestyBeing honest in the world of entrepreneurship can be challenging, especially when money is involved – that might be a real test for a startup. Just like when we build relationships with our life partner or spouse, if these relationships start with lies, even if they're seemingly innocent lies, they can start to erode and create cracks in the future.


Entrepreneurs can actively cultivate a culture of honesty within their startups. Open communication, trust-building, and accountability are crucial in fostering a workplace environment where honesty thrives. Successful companies prioritizing honesty as a core value often experience heightened employee loyalty and increased customer satisfaction.By setting the tone from the top down, entrepreneurs can create a culture where team members feel empowered to be transparent about challenges and uncertainties. This culture promotes ethical behavior and enhances collaboration and innovation within the startup.In the competitive entrepreneurship landscape, the stakes are high, and the journey to success is filled with challenges. The deceptive temptation may seem like a shortcut, but it will lead to a dead-end sooner or later, trust me. Embracing honesty, not just as a moral code but as a strategic advantage, can be the key differentiator between thriving and falling.

In an era when technology dominates the landscape, algorithms wield power far beyond mere computation. The transformative promise of artificial intelligence (AI) lies not solely in its ability to enhance products or streamline services. Of far greater significance is its capacity to deepen our understanding of ourselves as a society and highlight the necessary moral compass amid this transition.Related: The Top 4 Most Bankable AI Skills You Need to Succeed in 2024AI is a catalyst — orchestrating pivotal revolutions across diverse industries — and the advent of driverless cars stands as a testament. Although autonomous vehicles foretell a future of unprecedented convenience and security, they also unravel a host of societal and ethical dilemmas. Can these machines make morally weighted decisions? And more pressingly, how can we program those decisions in a manner that upholds our collective ethical norms?



This episode of the Beyond Impossible podcast, with special guest Jonathan Campos of Alto, isn't just another fireside chat about emerging tech. Instead, Campos unravels the societal and ethical layers evolving alongside driverless technology. However, the realm of AI isn't merely altering our roadways — it's reshaping our workplaces. The transformation accentuates another driving concern: jobs. The futuristic promise of AI comes with an undercurrent of anxiety about job losses. In a world preoccupied with competitiveness, AI advancements can appear a double-edged sword.

      Key Takeaways    



        Nelson's first massive beanbag took three weeks to make and quickly caught people's attention. 
      


        Nelson sold the first beanbags to fellow college students, then branched out to boat shows, trade shows and more. 
      


        Once Lovesac had about 40 store locations, Nelson appeared on Richard Branson's reality TV show and secured a $1 million investment. 
      


        Growing the company from that point was filled with more twists and turns, but Lovesac continues to see rapid growth today with an estimated $700 million in annual sales.

It's 1995, and I'm 18, sitting on my parents' couch in Salt Lake City, Utah. One morning, I had an idea and thought, Wouldn't it be funny to make a giant beanbag chair — like the size of my entire living room floor? So, I got off the couch, drove down to the fabric store and bought enough fabric for something that massive. Then, I began sewing it together. It took three weeks to fill it up with soft stuff I cut up from around the house — but everywhere I took it, people loved it and begged me to make them one. Eventually, I did. It cost me $25 to register the name, and in October 1998, Lovesac officially began as a company.Related: The Side Hustle She Started in Her Princeton Dorm Room Led to a $510 Million Business: 'Don't Take No for an Answer'What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground?When I started college at the University of Utah, I lived in my parents' basement, which was the perfect place to roll out huge, long rolls of fabric. My buddies and I would make the Sacs in the basement and sell them at our college. We quickly became known as the ""Lovesac guys"" around campus, with even the frats and sororities buying a few Sacs for their houses. From there, we were a fixture at any event we could find — boat shows, home shows, car shows, Oktoberfest — and this is how we grew the company in those earliest days.Were there challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those?After two or three years of running Lovesac as a side hustle in college, it was apparent that it would not make any real money in its current form. In fact, it probably cost me money to keep it alive. Sure, we'd make a profit selling the product — but then the van would break. Or the foam shredder would break. Or the state would fine me and my buddies for some workplace violation. The bottom line is: Building a business is hard, and it can take a lot of money to make it to some kind of meaningful critical mass.


As we grew, I was working harder than ever. It was draining, but I couldn't help but give it one last shot at a trade show in Chicago, hoping to get to the next level. One of the biggest retailers in the U.S. placed an order for 12,000 Sacs, not knowing that it was just me and a buddy working out of a rundown building with a wood chipper as a foam shredder.Despite every inefficiency, we completed the order, but then we realized we had no other big customers to sell to. We went to the furniture stores, but they all laughed at us and said it was a stupid idea — so we decided to open our own store. The first Lovesac store opened on November 17, 2001.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacRelated: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWhen did you decide to take the business from side hustle to full-time venture?Our first store changed everything — this is when I pivoted the company to a full-time venture. Consumers were obsessed with Lovesac. They came in, bought Sacs, flopped down and hung out with friends. The product was the best sales pitch we could give. We were doing six figures in just the first few weeks, and I had never seen money like that. We promptly ran off to open the second store in Provo, Utah, then Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Southern California. Growth went ballistic.What were some of the biggest hurdles that came up over the years once you were running the business full-time? How did you overcome those?We had grown to 35-40 locations when I got recruited to be on Richard Branson's reality TV show, The Rebel Billionaire, in 2005. It was a national primetime show on Fox Network, and I won a $1 million investment! Of course, I was $2 million in debt, having built this growing retail chain, but what are you going to do? We took the winnings, paid off some debt and raised more money through venture capital. However, the venture capitalists wanted to bankrupt the company and start over cleanly through Chapter 11 reorganization. I was devastated. We had made it all this way, yet somehow, the only way forward was to begin again.


We moved the company to Stamford, Connecticut, downsized the staff to a skeleton crew and started over with just 12 locations and about 12 employees at our tiny new HQ on the East Coast. It was the right move in the long run. We learned, focused and built the company back up to 30, 40, then 50 locations. Some people might have coasted after that, but I got another wild idea. Ironically, this one happened because of a couch, too.In that first store, we had a couch in the corner to show the Sacs in a living room-type environment. We noticed that customers always asked to buy the couch, but it was too big to sell. So, the idea was, What if we could shrink down this couch the way we shrink down our Sacs? And that's how the concept of Sactionals was born.Related: This College Student Started a Side Hustle So He Didn't Have to Bartend Until 4 am. Now He's Earning $7,000 a Month — and Putting It to Good Use.In 2012, Lovesac was named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. by Furniture Today — what made that rapid growth possible? How has the company approached scaling over the years?Around this time, I recognized that if we were going to really compete, we needed to pivot the business. With this in mind, I changed our focus to becoming a direct-to-consumer furniture brand with Sactionals as the primary driver. I took a risk and invested in local and then national TV advertising for the Sactionals, along with every emerging digital approach. Sactionals quickly became the fastest-selling couch solution in the United States. Lovesac expanded to nearly 80 locations, and then [we] took the company public in 2018 with $100 million in sales.After you go public, the sky's the limit. The company was worth $200-300 million overnight. It felt like a dream; I couldn't believe it. We grew to hundreds of locations by the 2020s. We have thousands of employees, and we've been named the fastest-growing furniture company in the U.S. numerous times. Our sales have multiplied and will likely grow to a billion dollars and beyond. The Sactionals gave us a new future. Their rapid adoption revealed that people love the idea of things being built to last a lifetime and designed to evolve with you throughout your life. We're proving that planned obsolescence was the wrong way to make a brand that lasts. We call this new approach to innovation Designed for Life, and it will inform everything we do from here on out.Image Credit: Courtesy of LovesacWhat is the company's current valuation? How much revenue does it bring in today?


Looking back at the past year, Lovesac's growth and performance results are a testament to the resilience of our brand and disruptive business model that has consistently delivered category outperformance and customer loyalty. Through a challenging year for our category, we've been able to maintain momentum with our commitment to product innovation, compelling marketing and a highly productive omnichannel footprint. These strategies continue to drive consumer demand and further distinguish our unique brand from a crowded market. Looking ahead, we believe that we are poised to continue investing in the future with an accelerated pace of expansion and innovation to further garner customer enthusiasm.Prior to reporting year-end results, Wall Street analysts estimate Lovesac's sales for the fiscal year that just ended to come in at around $700 million, with high single-digit adjusted EBITDA profitability. The company has fluctuated in multiples and market cap valuations over the past four years hovering in the $300-400 million range, peaking at over $1 billion in 2021 when the home category hit all-time highs during the pandemic.Related: The Side Hustle He Saw on YouTube Earned Him a Multi-Year Deal With Sony and Income Streams Generating Tens of ThousandsWhen you look to your company's future, what are you most excited about?At Lovesac, innovation is at the center of our design philosophy as we continue to prioritize developing breakthrough technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the furniture category. Challenging traditional definitions of comfort and home style is what has set the Lovesac brand apart since its inception, and over the past few years, we've been working with a variety of high-end fashion brands in the space to create something truly unique in the market. Anti Social Social Club, Jeremy Scott, alice + olivia and KidSuper are among the brands that have collaborated on covers and accoutrements for our two signature styles. We look forward to creating a blend of fashion-forward design and unparalleled comfort that speaks to the modern consumer.What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned over the course of your entrepreneurial journey?In my new memoir Let Me Save You 25 Years: Mistakes, Miracles, and Lessons from the Lovesac Story, I detail the ups and downs of my 25-year saga building the Lovesac business from its days as a college side hustle to a successful IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange and beyond. If you can learn from my mistakes, however, then perhaps your ambitions, big or small, can be realized in less than the 25-plus years it has taken me to finally learn something and get somewhere with mine.Here are some of the biggest lessons I've learned:


1. Heed what the experts have to say, but on occasion, you need to trust your gut.2. There comes a point before any major change in your career, business or personal life where you can greatly improve your odds for good outcomes by making a bold decision to ditch the safety net and fully commit.3. Play along the way, taking the time you need to keep yourself relaxed and sharp.4. You're no good to anyone as a miserable, uptight workaholic.Related: He Started a Side Hustle in His Dorm Room With 'a Bunch of Ingredients From Amazon and a Crockpot' — Now It's a $56 Million Brand in Walmarts NationwideDo you have any advice for others interested in starting a side hustle or business of their own?The entrepreneurial journey I've faced over the past quarter-century has been full of triumphant victories and humbling defeats, born from sweat, tears and relentless determination. With my new podcast series and memoir, I look forward to creating and fostering a sense of community through these channels and shining a light on real, raw stories from industry trailblazers on the movements they have built to bring valuable insights and knowledge to those that seek it.Growing Lovesac into what it is has taken my entire adult life and is the hardest thing I've ever done. I have so many memories and have built so many lifelong friends throughout this journey that make all the stumbles, roadblocks, sleepless nights and unrelenting stress worth it. My advice for anyone considering starting down the road of being a founder would be this: Get off the couch! Trust your instincts, and just keep going. That life-changing moment could be right around the corner, and the last thing you want to do is turn back just before you arrive.Entrepreneurship is a never-ending pursuit, but the journey is the gift. With an open mind, an honest heart, some ambition, time, help and a little bit of luck, all things are possible.

52,Why Saying 'I Don't Know' Makes You a Better Leader,"Feb 21, 2024",Joanna Swash,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-saying-i-dont-know-makes-you-a-better-leader/468335,"
No one knows everything. There's no need to pretend that we do. A great leader is honest about their limitations and strengths. Accept that you will fail. Being honest and open about failure is not a weakness.A great leader is not defined by having all the answers but by a willingness to grow and learn, a curiosity that leads to finding the required answers. It is about stopping, refueling, and being the best version of yourself.Think about it. Do you want a team that comes to you for the answers? That has no mind of its own? No creativity? We all know the answer to that. Command and control is a thing of the past and won't cut the muster in today's ever-evolving business landscape, not if you want to be a business of tomorrow.

53,This is the Real Secret to Success — How to Lead Even When You Are Losing,"Feb 21, 2024",Kristopher Tait,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-find-success-in-failure-and-loss/468964,"
Recently, my team and I lost a client — a large client. And it hurt a lot. We don't like losing; call it our competitive nature or just the fact that we pour everything we have into these client engagements, our ideas, and our time.In just over a decade, we have landed in New York and grown from a team of under ten to an organization with more than 500 people globally. We've won incredible clients — driving their businesses forward and delivering upon ambitious growth plans.We've done a lot of winning. So, losing naturally stung. But that sting quickly morphs into something far more powerful: motivation to learn and grow.Related: 8 Tips to Help Entrepreneurs Find Success After FailureOn the pitchThe challenge with always winning is that you will feel like you are succeeding. As if you've earned the title ""best in the business."" But in reality, that feeling is somewhat of a falsity because you're actually not really learning. Yes, you're winning. But you're not growing.



This is why I'm here to remind ourselves that the real secret to success is learning how to lose. To lose with grace but also fire. To lose with conviction and a promise to learn, grow and continuously do better.Don't believe me? Just ask David Beckham and Sir Alex Ferguson.Close your eyes and reflect on the 1998 World Cup in France. England faced their old enemy, Argentina, in the first knockout rounds. David Beckham started for England in midfield. At this moment in time, he was a young man with the world at his feet. He was a fast-emerging superstar. He was dating a superstar. And he was playing for England and Manchester United.Life was looking good for Becks. Until, with the game tied at 2-2, Argentina's notoriously tenacious midfielder Diego Simeone committed a cynical foul on Beckham. After Beckham hit the floor, Simeone antagonized Beckham by ruffling the back of his hair.


And in that moment, Beckham's life would change forever.Beckham lost control of his emotions. He instinctively kicked out his leg at Simeone— leading the referee to swiftly brandish a red card and send Beckham off the pitch. England lost the game. And chaos ensued.Beckham went from the golden boy to the most hated man in Britain in a flash. The media turned on him. He received death threats from fans, bullets in the mail, and a Beckham effigy was even hanged outside a pub in London.Related: Why Failure Is Your Best TeacherEveryone turned on him. Except his manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.Sir Alex put his arms around him. He protected him — and made sure his teammates did, too. He created an ""us versus the world"" mentality within Beckham and the club. And together, they fought on and pushed forward.And it worked. Within a year, Beckham and Manchester United would win an iconic treble. Tides would shift. He was back to his place as beloved the world over.Pivoting back to the world in which we thrive — the world of business—this ""us versus the world"" mentality can be incredibly powerful when deployed well and with intention. By having instilled the right mindset, our best work has been done when we've lost a few things in a row.


Why? Because it forces you to reassess your position in the market, develop new tools and capabilities and refine your sense of direction. Lastly, always remember that feedback is a gift, take as much as you can and learn from it. Embrace it. We call that having a growth mentality.Related: 7 Lessons on Failure You Can Learn From Top AthletesLosses and lessonsLosing hurts. It will always hurt. But there is no shame in losing — so cast that thought aside. There is only regret if you fail to learn.Sir Alex Ferguson turned a crisis into an opportunity by leading with a people-first mindset and putting the collective well-being of his team first. He stood by his team, and the world witnessed that.


Businesses work in the same way. Leaders need to create a sense of togetherness. When you lose out on a pitch, people will worry about the security of their jobs. As I am learning again, an ""us against the world"" mentality can be a transformational asset in these moments.If you spoke to David Beckham in the aftermath of that game versus Argentina, he would likely give anything to turn back time and change his actions. But that loss, that mistake, was likely worth more than he could realize.A loss is not always for the worse. Sometimes, it is the best thing that can happen for a person or a business. It's a chance to refocus. To reevaluate your processes and your priorities.We are all going to face challenging moments in 2024. Everyone will lose at some point. But not everyone will learn. And that, more than their percentage of wins against losses, is what separates successful leaders and businesses from the rest.

Related: 3 Values That Empower Entrepreneurs As They Start Their Business Journeys1. They are innovation catalystsEntrepreneurship stands as the linchpin of innovation. Visionary entrepreneurs perpetually seek novel and inventive solutions to problems, demonstrating a willingness to undertake risks and invest in unconventional ideas. Through their inventive pursuits, entrepreneurs not only birth new products and services but also enhance existing ones. This continuous cycle of innovation propels economic growth, fostering the emergence of new industries while enhancing the productivity of existing ones.


Related: How Entrepreneurial Creativity Leads to Innovation2. Job creationA substantial contributor to job creation, entrepreneurship spawns new businesses that necessitate a workforce. Entrepreneurs, in addition to working for themselves, become employers, fostering employment opportunities. Globally, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of numerous economies, accounting for a significant share of job creation. SMEs contribute to over 50% of new job opportunities in most countries.Entrepreneurship is a factor in creating wealth. As businesses grow and flourish, they accumulate income and profits, which can be reinvested to fuel expansion. Apart from prosperity, entrepreneurs also add value to society by providing in-demand products and services.Related: The 9 Power Moves You Need to Find Success


3. Economic growthEntrepreneurship plays a role in driving progress. Its impact goes beyond creating industries, products and services; it also fuels economic activity and generates revenue. Entrepreneurs contribute to job creation, wealth generation and overall economic development through their investments in ideas and innovations. A thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem has the potential to propel lasting growth and prosperity.4. Market expansion and trade enhancementEntrepreneurial ventures also often lead to market expansion and enhanced trade opportunities. As businesses grow, they seek new markets to explore and conquer. This expansion not only increases the reach of these enterprises but also contributes to international trade. Entrepreneurs are driven by the desire to tap into global markets, engage in cross-border trade, foster economic cooperation and create opportunities for diverse business partnerships.5. Technological advancements and digital transformationEntrepreneurs are at the forefront of technological advancements, driving digital transformation across industries.

Local businesses and startups contribute to the overall development of communities by creating a sense of identity and pride. Additionally, entrepreneurs often engage in philanthropic activities, giving back to the community through social initiatives. This social responsibility aspect of entrepreneurship enhances communities' overall well-being and resilience.


Related: How Social Entrepreneurs Are Changing the World7. Job creationJob creation is a pivotal mechanism through which entrepreneurship fuels economic growth. New businesses necessitate diverse skills, from management and marketing to product development and customer service, providing employment opportunities. This surge in employment, in turn, stimulates increased spending and economic activity as individuals have more disposable income.8. CompetitionEntrepreneurship fosters healthy competition within the marketplace. The entry of new businesses introduces novel products or services, challenging established firms. This competition often results in lower prices, improved quality and heightened innovation as businesses vie to distinguish themselves and meet consumer demand. Ultimately, consumers benefit by accessing a broader range of products and services at more affordable prices.ConclusionIndeed, entrepreneurship comes with challenges, demanding significant resources such as capital, expertise and time. Many entrepreneurs grapple with entry barriers like insufficient funding, regulatory complexities and market saturation. Nevertheless, entrepreneurship emerges as a potent engine of growth and innovation for those who navigate these challenges, driving economic prosperity and enhancing lives.


In conclusion, entrepreneurship plays a role in driving our economy's growth. Entrepreneurs, known for their willingness to take risks, bring innovation. Solve problems are responsible for creating businesses, products and services. These ventures do not generate employment opportunities. It also fosters healthy competition and boosts economic progress.

Danielle Cohen-Shohet.When did you start your side hustle in the self-care industry, and what inspired it?



My interest began when I did freelance makeup artistry out of my Princeton University dorm room. I've always had a passion for design and art, and for as long as I can remember, I have been entrepreneurial. I have a tendency to want to become an expert at something I do, so when I became interested in makeup, I took it much further than most and started a side hustle in college. During that time, my twin sister and I also pursued a digital receipts payments venture. Those were both enriching experiences; however, I had no idea at the time that I'd later take a leap and combine those interests to start a software payments company now worth over $510 million.Related: These Sisters Started a Side Hustle After a 'Light Bulb' Moment Standing in Line for Coffee — Now Their Business Has Done $100 Million in Total Sales


What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground? I learned voraciously, strived to be the best and just rolled up my sleeves to start. Back when I was in college, makeup artistry tutorials were just starting to be democratized on YouTube, so I dove into them and just got my hands dirty practicing. I drilled college classmates and friends for feedback and just kept getting better from there. It sounds simple, but these first steps helped me succeed faster.Were there any challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? Anything that you can grow from will have challenges. While doing makeup artistry, I experienced first-hand the pain points that many of our GlossGenius business customers face today: time management, coordinating schedules and growing a client base without the proper infrastructure, just to name a few. I dove headfirst into solving these challenges with manual spreadsheets and tools that I would hack together, which sparked the idea for what would later become GlossGenius. I wanted to provide other business owners with best-in-class technology and infrastructure that would make it easier to run a business.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? On average, how much revenue did it bring in? For me, it was originally more so about satisfying a creative interest than revenue. It took several months before I started to earn real revenue, and it was meaningful enough to cover a lot of living expenses while in college.Related: She Spent Her Honeymoon Working on a Side Hustle.

After understanding the problems facing service-based self-care businesses, I decided to start a software company that would solve many of these problems with technology. I had graduated college and started a career in finance at Goldman Sachs, but I kept thinking about how to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses. It was really hard to manage a client-first business when there were so many scattered, disconnected systems.I had taught myself how to code, so I felt as if I could do anything. After getting a couple of years of experience at Goldman, I took a leap and left to start GlossGenius. Given the industry experience, my technical background and the digital receipts payments company I had pursued with my twin sister — who is my partner and chief business officer at GlossGenius — it just felt obvious to put all of this into a software payments company focused on the self-care industry.Image Credit: Courtesy of GlossGenius. Danielle Cohen-Shohet and Leah Cohen-Shohet.How have you approached scaling the company? 


Before we could even think about scaling the company, we first focused on solving a real problem that is a critical part of our customers' lives. There is so much opportunity to empower entrepreneurs to run, manage and scale their own local businesses. Our platform impacts customers' livelihoods, and our solutions are an important part of their everyday lives. That focus was foundational to have in place before scaling.With that in place, one of the things I did early on was learn everything about the business: Building products, launching products, recruiting, marketing, closing partnerships, handling customer support tickets and much more. Having a deep knowledge of all parts of the business has been important to scaling the company as it has helped me understand what excellence looks like in all parts of the business. With that type of understanding, I could surround myself with fantastic people and leaders to take teams even further.Related: The Sweet Side Hustle She Started 'On a Whim' Turned Into a $20,000-a-Month Income Stream: 'It's Simple, It's Affordable and It's Fun'Because there are so many problems to solve for businesses, we also had to remain disciplined in solving the most important problems for customers first. So as we've scaled, we have continued to flex discipline and only pursue initiatives that create value for our customers. We say no often and are thoughtful about how we sequence what we pursue. We obsess over our customers' needs and absorb their feedback like a sponge, as it plays a key role in driving GlossGenius' growth and new products. Keeping the connection with our customers as we've scaled is something I'm really proud of.


When you look to GlossGenius's future, what are you most excited about? We are creating a gateway for entrepreneurship, giving self-care business owners the infrastructure to scale their businesses and empower more entrepreneurship. While we've already built a platform that is mission-critical to our customers, there is still so much for us to do to achieve our mission. With the responsibility of serving over 65,000 businesses and powering billions of dollars of transaction activity, we are working to make our software products more intuitive and magical for customers.The recent launch of our GeniusAI, a generative AI-powered tool, is a good example of this. This tool helps beauty and wellness practitioners draft ready-made, personalized email marketing campaigns, enabling users to simply enter a few notes and receive messages tailored to their goals and brand. In an industry that has traditionally lagged in technological adoption, it is exciting that we get to be the company that puts this in customers' hands. Another recent GlossGenius product launch is Genius Loans — fast, flexible financing that helps customers grow their businesses. Products like this underscore our support of customers with what they need, when they need it — well beyond what's typically expected from SaaS platforms.What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned over the course of your entrepreneurial journey? 


I've learned that true success means helping others succeed. I am fortunate to lead a company that's so tightly aligned with our customers' success. With the opportunity to build and lead GlossGenius, I've had a masterclass in learning the special framework of how to make decisions that build long-term value for customers.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.Do you have any advice for people interested in starting a side hustle or business of their own? Be fearless. Don't take no for an answer. And importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.

      Key Takeaways    



        Autry Stephens is set to be one of the world's richest people after selling his oil business.
      


        But the 85-year-old said he hadn't thought about how to spend his newfound billions.
      


        The sale is set to create one of the biggest drillers poised to take advantage of Texas' oil boom. 
      



















Endeavor Energy Resources via Business Insider
Autry Stephens sold his oil company to Diamondback Energy earlier this week in a blockbuster $26 billion cash-and-stock deal.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider.An 85-year-old oil tycoon is cashing out — but he appeared solemn in an interview about selling his business.Autry Stephens sold his company, Endeavor Energy Resources, to Diamondback Energy earlier this week. The $26 billion cash-and-stock deal would make him the richest oil tycoon in the US, Bloomberg reported.



But the taciturn Stephens appeared reluctant to leave the company he founded in 1979, telling The Wall Street Journal he made the decision largely because of a cancer diagnosis.""I'll miss the people there,"" he told the Journal in a recent interview. ""It was kind of a little family.""


Stephens had long resisted outside efforts to buy Endeavor, which was one of the last independent major oil companies in the rich Permian Basin of western Texas. But that changed when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, he told the Journal.He said he decided against passing the company on to his daughter, Lyndal Greth, who sits on the company's board and has children of her own, and that his son wasn't part of the family business.Now, the deal with Diamondback Energy — which beat out other big-name bidders such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips — is poised to make the company a powerful force in the domestic energy scene.Stephens is well known for his unassuming style. He drove an old-model Toyota Land Cruiser to work and flew budget on Southwest Airlines, the Journal reported. That reflects his modest upbringing on a farm in central Texas that grew peanuts and watermelons, according to his University of Texas Austin alumni profile.


Despite his massive fortune and brush with fame — he was featured on the truTV reality series ""Black Gold"" — his career trajectory seemed to remain focused on his initial ambitions, which he said were ""to earn a steady paycheck and comfortable retirement,"" according to UT Austin.Stephens has credited his success to his openness to new ideas and technologies, as well as a cash-first drilling strategy that Bloomberg reported helped him survive the 2008 financial crisis while many other US operators went under.""The history of the oil industry is full of stories of people making and losing fortunes several times over,"" he told his alma mater.Asked by the Journal what he would do with his newfound billions, Stephens said that he hadn't really thought about it yet.


The Endeavor sale has since catapulted Stephens from 130th to 77th on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. His net worth has grown by $17.5 billion since this time last year, behind only Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg.

58,Why Most Founders and Investors Are Wrong About Disruption,"Feb 15, 2024",Dustin Lemick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-most-founders-are-wrong-about-disruption/469194,"
There's something that every leader needs to understand about disruption: It is always happening.It is always taking place. It can be easy to believe that disruption is limited to once-in-a-lifetime occurrences, where the world is forever changed. Or that it is always mass scale. In reality, everything is always in a state of business change. It can come in many different sizes and forms. It can also happen at any time and anywhere.Yet, disruption is commonly misunderstood. It can be difficult to recognize. A lot of people overlook it or can't see it. There is an overuse of the term. Many believe or claim they're disrupting a market or industry when they are not — or the disruption isn't large or significant enough to make a major impact. Some assume that disruption automatically means technology. It isn't always the case. Innovation typically plays a role, but it can come in many forms.



Your company, market or industry can be disrupted, or a combination of the three. Larger macro issues also take place globally that can spark major changes: economic conditions, geopolitical issues, weather, conflict, currencies, and other factors. It then trickles down to everyone. The only real truism about disruption is that it constantly occurs everywhere. In today's market climate, leaders can gain an in-depth understanding of disruption, when to recognize it, and how to create opportunities when it happens.Related: How to Bounce Back and Succeed During Times of Disruption


Real disruption changes the normal course of an activity, process, or behavior on a mass scale. Airbnb and Uber are great examples. Consumers once predominantly relied on hotels and motels for lodging when traveling. Airbnb changed this; today, consumers are as likely to opt for Airbnb as another option. With Uber, people began to use gig economy drivers instead of taxis or other traditional means. It significantly impacted the transportation business. These two case studies illustrate major changes that challenged an industry's fundamentals. The COVID-19 lockdown was a large global issue that incited a giant fundamental shift. Companies had to change how they operated dramatically — what they offered, how they served customers, led employees and generated revenue. It forged entirely new ways of doing business. In all these scenarios, genuine disruption was at play.What are the tell-tale signs of disruption? Are there ways to detect when disruption is occurring? How can you tell if your business or idea is truly disruptive? An excellent general rule is to look at your market leader/incumbent. If the market leader is copying your offering or that of another disruptor, it can be a clear sign – i.e., replicating tactics, products, services, etc.It is likely a signal that the market leader is losing position. Challenging market leaders can be a place to identify where disruption is needed or likely to occur – i.e., what isn't working, what could be done better or differently, what is outdated, etc. Additionally, disruption is a new technology, tool, or process that your industry is adapting to. Shifts in outputs can also be a form. These are just a few examples of what can indicate disruptive change is underway or on the horizon.It's also important to determine if the disruption you're witnessing is large or small and whether it can make an impact. This is particularly relevant if you're an investor or looking for investment capital. Investors typically want to disrupt big things to get big rewards. They want big problems and solutions. Is something disruptive creating or solving a problem, and if so, how big is it? Investors want to know whether disruption will be valuable at an appropriate scale.


Recognizing disruption requires an open mind. In many instances, people can't believe or see something is disruptive at first. They think the idea is foolish or won't work. Disruption is usually caused by something that hasn't existed before or something new. Airbnb is a great example here as well. Its founders are said to have gone to every venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and were famously laughed out of meetings. People couldn't see what they saw — it hadn't been invented yet. Even the most seasoned business leaders can misunderstand and mistake disruption or fail to recognize it.Related: 3 Mindset Shifts Every Disruptor Must HaveDisruption doesn't always mean extinction. History has proven this for countless companies, processes, products, services, and ideas. Organizations can collapse after big changes. They did not or could not adapt. But something new or different tends to fill in the gap. It's often better, and the cycle continues. I have been on both sides of disruption at my company, BriteCo. We are one of the jewelry industry's disruptors – we were the first to move jewelry consumers to 100% paperless processes with technology and the internet. We also provide our customers with different ways to buy our coverage, unique to BriteCo, versus an outdated analog process at the retail point of sale. Yet, we still face disruption by the latest emerging technologies and innovations — ChatGPT and GenAI are good examples.Your ability to adapt to disruption begins first with recognizing it and determining its size and scale. Then, you must gauge its potential impact on you and your business. This can enable you to adapt more effectively and better decide if you need to take action. And, most importantly, help you navigate and succeed despite whatever change comes.

59,"In the Age of Instant, Here's Why Leaders Must Learn the Art of Patience","Feb 15, 2024",Hanif Lalani,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-leaders-must-learn-the-art-of-patience/469302,"
In my exploration of yogic philosophy, I have found particular resonance in the concept known as pratyahara. Its translation from Sanskrit is ""the conscious withdrawal of energy from the senses"" — broken down to its most simple interpretation; it is the practice of redirecting our awareness from the external world to the inner experiences.Today, our culture prioritizes immediacy and constant engagement, and as a result, pausing for reflection is increasingly becoming a lost art. Although pratyahara's origins can be traced back thousands of years, its importance has only grown as sensory overload becomes more common. Instant results have become the norm throughout many aspects of society, and our ability to practice patience is waning.I have found that leaders often grapple with impatience more than most. The inherent traits that make us effective in business — decisiveness, ambition and a drive for results — can also create a breeding ground for a heightened sense of urgency and restlessness. We are under considerable pressure to meet the high-paced demands of the modern business landscape, and there is an expectation for instant solutions, accelerated growth, and immediate responses.



Additionally, the pervasive influence of technology and the era of instant communication have created an environment where waiting has become a rarity. With the ability to send messages across the globe in seconds and access information at the touch of a button, impatience has become a byproduct of this culture of immediacy, and leaders often feel the weight of these expectations more intensely than most.Now more than ever, we as leaders need the ability to navigate uncertainties and make thoughtful decisions. Cultivating patience gives us the mental space to pause and reflect before making choices. It encourages a careful consideration of options and potential consequences. This allows us to differentiate between decisive actions stemming from a thoughtful evaluation of the situation and impulsive reactions driven by the moment's urgency.


Related: Harness the Power of Patience to be a Better LeaderDeveloping mindfulnessAs with most things, the first step to developing patience is becoming mindful of the feeling itself. We often attribute our impatience to external factors beyond our control: someone is taking too long in front of you at the grocery store or getting stuck in bad traffic.While it may seem natural to attribute impatience to external events, our emotional responses, thought patterns and mindset play a large role in how we experience and express impatience. When you understand that your reaction is still within your control, you can be empowered to reshape your internal responses to them.Beginning to cultivate patience starts with setting an intention to identify when impatience arises within you and what situations most commonly bring it forward. Even before starting this exercise, you can probably already think of a few scenarios that trigger those feelings of frustration and restlessness such as being placed on hold or having to listen to someone take what seems to be an interminably long time to explain something.


Related: Why Mindfulness Matters for EntrepreneursExpectations vs. realityImpatience often occurs when reality isn't conforming to our expectations. We expect that project timelines will not be delayed, meetings will start promptly, and deliveries will be on schedule. We expect people to behave as we want them to, promptly responding to emails, meeting deadlines as promised, and actively contributing to meetings. The dissonance between these expectations and the unpredictability of real-world situations is where impatience can grow.Related: The 5 Most Important Cognitive Biases Holding You BackMind-body connectionAfter pinpointing the sources that trigger your impatience, you can then explore how impatience manifests in both your mind and body. Simply suppressing impatient feelings will only exacerbate the problem; instead, work on becoming familiar with the physical sensations that accompany them. Is your stomach in knots, or are your shoulders suddenly tensed all the way up next to your ears? Have you clenched your fists or tightened your jaw?


The physical expressions of emotions serve evolutionary purposes, preparing the body to respond to challenges. However, in modern life, these physiological responses can sometimes be disproportionate or misaligned with the actual circumstances. Understanding the mind-body connection is an important factor in developing strategies to manage our emotional and physical responses to impatience.Shifting attentionOne of the most practical tools available to develop patience is to shift one's attention. You are not your emotions, which means that you have the power to control how you are reacting in a given scenario. Impatience is unarguably unpleasant, so consider what you would rather feel instead. While calm is often seen as the opposite of impatience, achieving this shift can be challenging. Instead, explore alternative emotions such as curiosity or compassion. Curiosity allows you to engage with the present moment, finding interest in the details of your situation. In contrast, compassion towards yourself and others creates understanding that can soften the edge of impatience.Rediscovering presenceSo much of our lives have become automated. Technology has allowed us to streamline tasks that once required concentration and time to complete, and while this has certainly created new efficiencies, it is important not to allow ourselves to also run on autopilot. Understandably, when we become used to distractions, the idea of being present in the moment without external stimuli can seem unappealing. Our culture values constant activity and busyness, and slowing down and dedicating time to mindfulness inevitably clashes with that.However, mindfulness can be a valuable tool for cultivating and strengthening patience. It does not have to involve taking up a yogic practice or dedicating extensive hours to meditation. At its core, mindfulness is simply the conscious choice to observe your thoughts, sensations and surroundings without judgment, allowing for a heightened awareness of the present moment. Leaders today must resist the urge to fall in with the age of instant gratification, choosing instead to practice the dying art of patience through their actions and decisions.

60,"If You Sell Anything Online in 2024, Make Sure You Take These 5 Steps","Feb 14, 2024",Ben Crudo,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/if-you-sell-anything-online-in-2024-make-sure-you-take/469404,"
We keep hearing that ecommerce is an unstoppable force, but the truth is that it's hit a wall. Even though online sales keep climbing, growth has been flat lately. It might not be a hiccup, either.I take no pleasure in sharing that news. After all, my whole business is about helping online retailers succeed. But for brands that want to keep thriving, it's critical to acknowledge this trend and what's fueling it.My suspicion: Shoppers are tired of all things digital.



Just look at the resurgence of brick-and-mortar shopping post-pandemic. U.S. retailers opened twice as many stores as they closed in 2022. Shoppers — especially younger ones — like browsing IRL, and I don't see that shift reversing anytime soon. Overall, online shopping's share of U.S. sales has stagnated since 2020, hovering around 15%.Why? Part of the reason is that people still crave the human touch, which can set retailers apart from their rivals. That's why smart brands — even in the age of AI — are prioritizing ways to humanize the online shopping experience.


With that in mind, here are five ways to stay ahead of the curve in 2024, from my perspective working with hundreds of the world's top online retailers.Related: 5 Ways to Show Your Customers You Understand Them in a Digital-First WorldAs retail tech finally delivers real value, take full advantageHistorically, the harder you try to make online shopping like real life, the more the gulf widens. Fortunately, retail technology is turning a corner, in large part thanks to AI.Take chatbots, which used to leave most customers frustrated. But generative AI is finally making them useful. In one poll, more than half of people who have used ChatGPT said they were more likely to shop from a brand with a similar conversational bot.


Personalization is also making strides. The gold standard here is tech that's as thoughtful and perceptive as your favorite real-life salesperson — the one who always remembers what size you wear, the colors you like, and your favorite designers. Online, we're starting to get there. Each time I visit the clothing site Farfetch, for instance, its AI gets better at showing me products that match my preferences.Augmented reality has raised its game too. This tech is far from new — I remember AR games at the arcade as a kid. But we're finally seeing seamless integrations with ecommerce. Shopify's new AR tool lets retailers add 3D models and videos directly to their product pages. Then there's Apple's Vision Pro headset, which could become a virtual changing room.My advice: Be open to using the latest retail tech, which is more likely to win customers over than to alienate them.But make sure AI gets a human interventionBut slow down. Yes, generative AI is a game changer for the shopping experience, but smart brands are tempering new tools with human oversight in 2024.


The laziest retailers will hire a robot army and turn it loose, leaving shoppers to wrestle with GPT's growing pains. The growing number of major brands offering little to no human customer support attests to the popularity — and serious pitfalls — of this approach.A better way? Smart retailers are treating AI tools like new employees — ensuring that they're onboarded, trained and supervised so that they truly deliver value to shoppers.To handle this new digital workforce, retailers should be open to introducing brand new human roles in 2024: dedicated bot managers to monitor AI conversation and train agents; digital specialists to fine-tune AI merchandising; AI sales enablers to sharpen automated sales efforts.To me, it's like when retailers woke up to the fact that having a website also required a digital team. Just like that digital store was never going to run itself, AI needs care and attention.Related: Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Human Interaction? 4 Ways AI is Impacting and Empowering Customer Experience


Help customers move away from mindless consumptionIt's no secret online shopping can be wasteful, unfulfilling and even addictive. A shiny new purchase and its attendant dopamine hit are always just a click away. But progressive retailers are tapping into a growing backlash and finding ways to encourage more purposeful consumption.Patagonia — which urges people to buy less of its own and others' products — doesn't do Black Friday sales. Same goes for Typology. Last Black Friday weekend, the vegan skincare brand donated $2 of every purchase to fighting ocean plastic pollution.The recommerce movement — reuse, recycle and resell — will also help carry that torch. Expect the explosion of secondhand retail sites, led by the likes of Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace, thredUP and Depop, to continue into 2024. Contrary to the stereotype of shabby thrift stores, recommerce is big business. The U.S. market alone stood at more than $160 billion in 2021 — up 15% over the previous year. By 2025, it could grow to $245 billion.I'm not suggesting that you open a secondhand marketplace. But the fact that many people no longer want to shop til they drop, for sustainability, mental health and other reasons, should figure into online retailers' product and marketing strategies.


Double down on communityIn a similar spirit, retailers are going to increasing lengths to prioritize building true community in 2024.The fact is that acquiring new customers online has gotten more complex, cutthroat and prohibitively costly. Data privacy laws are stricter than ever. And partly thanks to the fallout between Apple and Google over tracking people, customers' digital trails have gone cold. Meanwhile, retailers seeking to advertise on social media face dwindling options: X is a mess, Facebook's rates are soaring and TikTok only reaches a narrow demographic.Overall, ecommerce — and direct-to-consumer retail in particular — has become a seriously saturated market. The bottom line: the average cost of picking up a new customer surged over 220% between 2013 and 2022, from $9 to $29.So rather than chase one-off sales, savvy retailers should play a long game, going the extra mile to build and cement ties with loyal customers. One standout is lululemon, which hosts thousands of yoga classes and other events at its stores. Meanwhile, Harley Davidson brings people together through the Harley Owners Group, which offers membership benefits along with rallies and other gatherings.


Related: A Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Community for Your BusinessFind new ways to surprise and delight shoppersIn 2024, online retailers that make a conscious effort to dazzle customers will have an edge. With more consumer interactions governed by predictive algorithms, brands that break the mold and add a truly human touch are poised to stand out.I'm still floored when I get a handwritten note with a product, even if it's from the warehouse worker who packed the box. One study found that such messages double the likelihood of repeat purchases, build connection and help retailers stand out. Personalized QR codes, which can tailor offers to each customer, are another way to surprise and delight shoppers.Brands can also take a marketing cue from the makers on Etsy, who flex their creative muscles in ways that big businesses might not. I recently ordered a pencil case crafted by a small Polish company. It arrived with not just a free pencil but a coffee sample from its region. Needless to say, they've got a customer for life.


The takeaway? Always be thinking about how to enchant customers who have come to expect the same old thing from brands large and small. In a world where human connection still matters to people, retailers taking such steps in 2024 could also find themselves pleasantly surprised.

62,Why Super Bowl Commercials Are the Ultimate Marketing Play,"Feb 9, 2024",Jack Truong,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-super-bowl-commercials-are-the-ultimate-marketing-play/469312,"
Of the estimated 113+ million viewers who tuned in for the Super Bowl LVII in 2023, around 43% tuned in primarily for the advertisements — a far cry from those of us who groan at even 15-second-long ads. Super Bowl commercials have become a cultural phenomenon, with audiences anticipating creative spins from familiar brands and often comparing their favorites online afterward. While plenty of companies have secured these behemoth ad slots only to fumble the ball, many have stood the primetime test. By examining the patterns and themes of some of the most successful Super Bowl ads, business leaders can learn from the ultimate marketing play.Related: What Super Bowl Ads Can Teach Entrepreneurs About Marketing1. Emotion gets ads to the end zoneIn fact, one of the most memorable and impactful Super Bowl commercials tugged at the heartstrings of the masses, opting for pathos in the form of puppies. ""Puppy Love,"" the classic Budweiser Clydesdales ad that debuted in 2014, appealed to human consumers not through the classic can-and-condensation combo but via an unlikely animal friendship between a Clydesdale and a golden retriever puppy.



With subtle themes of rustic patriotism and all-American heroism, the Belgian multinational brewing company wooed viewers via man's best friend — and barely featured their product at all. In 2016, it was ranked as the most popular ad ever to air in the 50-year history of the NFL's premier event. The lesson here is clear: wholesome content appeals to almost everyone, and authenticity is universal — eclipsing predictable, emotionally empty product placement.When planning our 2005 ""What Did You Ever Do Without Them?"" commercial for Post-It notes, the 3M team took the same tack, opting for cuteness that resonates with a general audience. While this sentiment does play well, what doesn't make the cut are the unique challenges of filming with unpredictable (albeit adorable) animals.


2. Americans huddle up for humorWhether it's a torrential downpour of lemons forecasted by Budweiser, Homer Simpson swiping his Mastercard or the rapid transitions and smooth-talking of the infamous Old Spice guy, Super Bowl audiences are looking for laughs between plays. Since laughter is shown to improve short-term memory, funny commercials are far more memorable, and so are the brands/products they represent.While one-hit-wonders may have their moment, brands that establish likable recurring characters in their ads are especially adept at building brand awareness and memory recall of the hero products advertised. The average American will likely recognize Progressive's iconic associate Flo, Geico's recently-revived Caveman, Allstate's mischievous Mayhem man and even Liberty Mutual's seemingly inescapable LiMu Emu. The combination of clever humor and unique, original characters makes for an effective commercial that will continue to build and enhance brand awareness for years to come.Related: 4 Must-Haves for Brands Considering TV Commercials3. Social issues are shared goalsMore than ever, Super Bowl commercials are addressing social issues, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences toward purpose-driven brands. By aligning themselves with meaningful causes and communicating their commitment to societal issues, brands aim to foster a positive image and build loyalty.


For example, Dove's ""Real Strength"" commercial (2015) challenges stereotypical gender roles, including what it means to be a ""real man""; Nike supported Colin Kaepernick's social activism by featuring Kaepernick in their 2019 ""Dream Crazy"" ad. Of course, for these allegiances/political stances to be effective, companies must practice what they preach — which is to say that authentic initiatives within the company must also back up these public allyships. Otherwise, companies run the risk of a backlash similar to that against Budweiser following their controversial Dylan Mulvaney partnership.Related: 3 Questions Pepsi Should Have Asked Before Releasing Its Kendall Jenner Ad4. Pass the ball to the consumerAds that end with a Call to Action go beyond traditional one-way communication, inviting audiences to leave a lasting impact. One effective example was Coca-Cola's 2014 ""#AmericaIsBeautiful"" ad, which encouraged viewers to share their own moments of beauty using the company's hashtag. The genius of this hashtag is in its simplicity; much like Budweiser's ""Puppy Love"" ad, which featured a minimal branded product, #AmericaIsBeautiful celebrates the country rather than Coca-Cola. Impressively, the owned hashtag created an onslaught of positive conversation around the brand without actually using any branding. This interactive element cultivated a trend of user-generated content while extending the reach of the company's campaign and engagement.5. Celebrities are the MVPsWhether it's a cranky pre-Snickers bar Betty White, Ryan Reynolds parking a Hyundai or Harrison Ford chatting with an Amazon Alexa, brands often turn to celebrities to boost the appeal of their Super Bowl commercials. When humor and emotional substance may be lacking, there's no substitute for star power, and when companies can combine clever scripts with well-known faces, a viral moment is all but guaranteed. That said, companies must be careful when seeking celebrity endorsements — choosing a celebrity who resonates with the targeted audience and whose image/voice aligns with the company's brand values is essential.


With every Super Bowl, business leaders can become the brand consumers root for. Super Bowl commercials provide a unique and colossal opportunity to capture the attention of tens of millions of people who are not only exposed to the commercials but also look forward to them. Ultimately, the most successful are those who entertain and effectively communicate their brand's message and values.

63,"3 Hacks That Can Help You Get High-Quality Matches on Dating Apps, According to the Lead Engineer Behind a Very Exclusive One","Feb 9, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-league-founders-3-hacks-for-better-dating-app-matches/469490,"
Amanda Bradford, founder, CEO and lead engineer of selective dating app and social networking community The League, was straight out of a five-and-half-year relationship when she realized she ""had never actually dated in the wild."" At the time, swiping in search of love was increasingly en vogue, so Bradford decided to give it a shot herself — and discovered that many of the apps lacked features that were important to her.""I remember writing a support ticket to one of the dating apps, being like, 'You should really integrate with the LinkedIn profile,' and as I'm writing this, I'm like, 'Maybe I should look up who runs these apps,'"" Bradford tells Entrepreneur. ""Then I found that many of them were run by people with even less technical background than me.""Image Credit: Courtesy of The League. Amanda Bradford. 



So in 2014, at 29, Bradford opted to build and launch a dating app of her own: The League, which aims to unite users looking for love who have ""ambition and a drive to succeed."" Where other dating apps permitted people to reveal as little information about themselves as they chose, Bradford's would make certain details, like education and career, compulsory to help its ""vetted community"" find long-term partners without wasting time.Related: I Used a Dating App to Meet Millionaires. I Got to Travel the World, Get Fancy Gifts, and Learn A Lot from My Relationships.


The League also presented its users with just three matches a day to reduce the ""transactional"" nature associated with many other apps, particularly those that are swipe-based. Bradford's app sold to Match Group for $29.9 million in 2022. Today, it also offers monetized features, including the option to pay to see all of your matches at once, starting at $99.99 per week. It might be a nice-to-have perk, but it's not necessary for users to get high-quality matches, Bradford says — because you can ""trust the algorithm.""What does that mean, exactly?As much as dating app users have control over their profiles and the parameters they set for potential matches, at the end of the day, it's the invisible algorithm behind every app that determines which people will be shown to each other. And many popular apps aren't forthcoming about how that happens. A spokesperson for Bumble told The Verge that its algorithm learns from user histories to produce matches; the former design and product vice president of Hinge informed the outlet that it uses a variation of the Gale-Shapley algorithm to pair compatible users.""One of the things I didn't like about the other apps is that...they would just give you everyone that fit your preference.""Fortunately, Bradford, who's continued to serve as The League's lead engineer since its sale to Match Group, was willing to shed more light on what goes on behind the scenes and share how users can better position themselves for success — in terms of high-quality matches that just might lead to great first dates and long-term partnerships.It's important to note that, unlike a number of other apps, The League relies on ""double preference matching,"" where a user only sees a profile if their preferences match the other user's and vice versa. It might seem like a no-brainer, but research suggests that men are more likely than women to be using dating apps, and the uneven gender ratio might cause some algorithms to be less discerning.""One of the things I didn't like about the other apps is that partially because they're giving you so many people, and they just need to be able to give you more profiles, they would just give you everyone that fits your preference,"" Bradford says. ""So let's say I only wanted to see men 35 to 40. That doesn't mean they're not showing me to men 18 to 60.""Related: From Machine Learning to Unfiltered Videos, These Online Dating Trends Are Set to Improve the Tricky World of Dating


Double preference matching ""narrows down the pool significantly,"" Bradford admits, but she stresses that they're called ""preferences"" and not just ""filters"" because they're precisely that: a user's desires. The League isn't ""inventing"" people, so if there aren't enough profiles that meet all of someone's preferences within a given radius, things ""get a little more complicated"" — and the algorithm has to prioritize the user's desires.Nowadays, users can choose which preference is most important to them in the app, Bradford says, but naturally, there's still a lot more that goes into pairing people up.""In general, women are just more picky than men. So I guess it is easier for a woman to get scored higher than a man on average.""One of the most significant factors is the ""like rate,"" or overall ""desirability,"" of a profile. ""So if three people see me and only one likes me, then I'm [at] a 33% like rate at that point,"" Bradford explains. ""And so if there's another person that three out of three like them, that's a 100% like rate. So that person will probably be shown more than the person who isn't liked as much because we'll get more matches.""


The idea is to ""put people close to people that are performing at the same level,"" grouping them into so-called ""cohorts"" or ""quintiles,"" Bradford adds — though that doesn't necessarily mean physical attractiveness. More than anything, the overall quality of a user's profile is key.So that's the first hack for people searching for better results: Make your profile the best it can be. You should have high-quality photos with a mix of close-up and full-body shots and fill out all fields completely.Related: Your Next Career Connection Might Come From a Dating App""In general, women are just more picky than men,"" Bradford notes. ""So I guess it is easier for a woman to get scored higher than a man on average. I also believe that this is because men do put less time into their profiles or maybe are not as good at marketing themselves. There's never a man that's a 100% acceptance rate, whereas there are women that might move up into that range."" That's why the algorithm also normalizes for gender.


Additionally, the app rewards users who send the first message, always respond and are active every day.""If you're a little bit more open-minded, open to men that maybe are a little bit shorter, those people actually will help your score.""Although the app does its best to take into account a user's ""explicit preferences"" — or what they say they want in a match — it's also capturing ""shadow preferences"" — or the way someone actually behaves when presented with a profile that doesn't check all the boxes. For instance, a user might say they want someone within a one-mile radius, then proceed to like profiles for people 15 to 20 miles away.That leads to Bradford's second major tip for people hoping for high-quality matches: Keep an open mind and consider how restrictive your settings are. She uses the example of a theoretical woman who opts only to see men ages 35 to 37 who are at least 6'2"" and live in New York City's West Village.


""So you're basically saying, I only want a very competitive and very small cross-section of these men to see me,"" Bradford explains. ""You're asking yourself to be scored or ranked by a high-caliber group, a high-demand group. So you're actually kind of doing yourself a disservice because if you're a little bit more open-minded, open to men who maybe are a little bit shorter, those people actually will help your score because they might be more open to your profile.""Related: This Matchmaker Won't Apologize for Her $50,000 Minimum — Here's the Secret Weapon She Uses to Play CupidAnd if users relax their settings and see someone they're on the fence about, Bradford encourages them to give them a ""like."" Because although The League's mantra is ""never settle,"" taking that chance can pay off in a couple of ways. Not only could that match ""sweep you off your feet with a really charming first date invitation,"" Bradford says, but it will also boost your own profile.""People would rather have that [person] meet all their other preferences and be in another city than not meet their preferences but be next door.""And a final secret to success? Consider broadening your settings to include people in other cities — it's an increasingly popular move.""We are seeing more openness to distance, which used to be one that people would be like, 'Oh hard no, they're in a different city,'"" Bradford says. ""Now we're seeing that's not as big of a deal. People would rather have that [person] meet all their other preferences and be in another city than not meet their preferences but be next door to them.""According to Bradford, if you're open to multiple cities, ""you can pretty much double your matches"" — upping your chances of finding The One for this Valentine's Day and beyond.

64,'Go Back to Your Tractors': 4 Business Lessons We Can Learn From the Iconic Rise of Lamborghini,"Feb 9, 2024",Jerod Guerin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-lessons-we-can-learn-from-the-iconic-rise-of-lamborghini/468882,"
After over 60 years in business, Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann says the supercar company is still going strong — selling more cars every month than it can produce, even after increasing production twice in 2022. Amidst inflation, rising interest rates, and increasing energy costs, it's a stunning success story — especially for a once-bankrupt company, liquidated and pulled up by the bootstraps of a farmer's son.With annual revenue exceeding €2.8 billion ($US3.07 billion), Lamborghini may not seem like a case study for small and medium-sized businesses, but this mega company's long and tattered history can teach modern founders a thing or two about innovating from raw resources, leveraging publicity, and refusing to compromise on the quality of its products. Business owners may recognize themselves in the humbleness of Ferruccio Lamborghini's beginnings, but his whole story offers four key lessons for how to turn core values into an enduring brand.Related: What Benjamin Franklin and Tony Robbins Can Teach You About Self-Improvement



1. Get savvy: Start with what you knowFerruccio Lamborghini was born into an Italian family of farmers, but from a young age, his focus was less on the farm and more on the machines needed to operate it. He was gifted at fixing engines, a knack that steered him to attend technical school and later to serve as a mechanic in World War II for the Italian armed forces.After the war ended, Ferruccio saw opportunity. He salvaged surplus parts the Allied Forces had left behind and returned to his hometown, where he began building tractors on his family's farm. The Lamborghini Trattori company was born with its notoriously affordable and robust builds.


In just a few short years, Ferruccio had not one but two flourishing companies (the other a heating and air-conditioning business), making him one of the wealthiest men in Italy by 1962. His early ventures may not have been as glamorous as the supercar company known the world over today, but they provide a strategic blueprint for business owners.By recognizing opportunity and utilizing the period's abundant resources, Ferruccio was able to leverage his farming connections and existing skills to embrace tractor manufacturing. He then diversified into the heating/air conditioning sector to help mitigate risk as he observed changes in post-war living. These savvy decisions ultimately set Ferruccio on the path to pursuing his deepest passion.Related: 5 Ways to Spot and Capitalize on Trends2. Chase perfection and don't compromise, everBy the time he was in his 40s, Ferruccio had ample time and money and so briefly considered building helicopters, but the government refused him a license. Instead, he turned to marvel at his growing collection of Jaguars, Mercedes, Ferraris and Maseratis. But Ferruccio's enthusiasm for perfection led to a nagging problem: No car ever completely satisfied him.


If it wasn't the weak ventilation, it was the noise of the power transmission or the inferior leather lining. When he purchased a brand-new Ferrari 250 GT, he experienced issues with its clutch. Frustrated, Ferruccio told his factory mechanics to take the assembly apart, revealing that his top-of-the-line Ferrari used the same clutch component as Lamborghini's own tractors.Ferruccio was shocked. He paid 10 lire for his tractor clutches; Ferrari charged him 1,000 for the same part. He was even more upset to learn that Ferraris were not built with specialty components that were more durable and suitable for the use case. He took his complaint straight to Enzo Ferrari himself but was not met with open arms. Ferruccio went to his grave claiming that Ferrari, known for his bluntness, yelled at him: ""The problem is not my car, it's the driver. Go back to your tractors and leave me alone!""Whether fudged or fabricated, the two titans' decades-long feud provided fantastic publicity for both parties. Ferrari was already a household name, and by hiring some of Ferrari's ex-engineers and -mechanics, Lamborghini was able to debut its first model car only four months later.Related: How to Build a Business That Lasts 100 Years


3. Elevate customer serviceLamborghini presented its first prototype at the 1963 Turin Auto Show, dubbing it the Lamborghini 350 GTV. Ferruccio chose his zodiac sign, Taurus the Bull, as the company logo. The prototype morphed into Lamborghini's first production model and later the Miura, Espada, Islero and Jarama. The company boomed as Lamborghini's cars received wide acclaim for their refinement, power and comfort.A lifelong passion for cars fueled Ferruccio, but his early business ventures proved priceless in setting the company apart. His heating and air-conditioning service company, Brucatori, had instilled in him the importance of never compromising on customer satisfaction. If a customer's car broke down, Lamborghini would pay to send a mechanic straight to them, by plane if needed, along with a personal letter of apology. This no-compromise mentality became indelibly associated with the luxury level of not just the car itself but the Lamborghini service.Related: 6 Tips to Build a Business That Will Last Decades 4. Core values are meant to lastUnfortunately, the 1970s weren't as kind to the brand. Union strife and failed emissions tests stifled the company's entry into the lucrative U.S. market, leading to a temporary withdrawal. While facing challenges with conforming to U.S. regulations, Lamborghini only managed to continue selling the Countach in America after a seven-year absence.


Feeling the weight of financial troubles, Ferruccio sold his shares and retired, and Lamborghini eventually entered bankruptcy proceedings. The company changed hands multiple times throughout the '80s, and the product line stagnated. But we all know the story didn't end there. The Volkswagen Group acquired Lamborghini in 1998 and, under new owners, innovation returned.Under the management of Volkswagen's Audi division, Lamborghini has regained its status as a supercar manufacturer known for its incredible performance, state-of-the-art power and unparalleled luxury. Ferruccio may have moved on long ago, but he created a legacy through his unwavering commitment to service, performance, and perfection. It's a lesson of perseverance and staying true to a brand's core values. And when it was time for Ferruccio to step down, brand evangelists kept the name and the tenacity behind Lamborghini alive for future generations.

Let's look at how AI-generated content works and whether or not you should use it.



Related: How Can AI Improve SEO?What is AI writing?AI writing involves using artificial intelligence to create various forms of content. For example, you can use AI writing tools to create blog posts, social media content, landing pages and product descriptions.


AI software doesn't replace human writers; it improves your productivity so you can create content faster. Researching and writing an article from scratch can take hours, but AI tools can dramatically speed up the process.However, the exact capabilities of AI software will vary depending on the platform you use, and certain tools will be better for different types of content.Can AI writing hurt your search ranking?One of the biggest questions about AI writing is whether it will help or hurt your search ranking. According to Google, the answer is no — assuming you're using AI tools to create high-quality, original content.Google ranks content based on E-E-A-T: expertise, experience, authoritativeness and trust. Google's focus is on the quality of the content produced, not how the content is created. If you use AI writing tools to create unique, helpful and relevant content for your audience, it won't negatively impact your search engine rankings.


The problem is that AI writing may not meet those requirements on its own, so it's helpful to understand how AI writing works and the pros and cons of using these tools first.Related: How to Leverage AI to Boost Your SEO Efforts and Stay Ahead of the CompetitionBenefits of AI tools for SEOHere are some of the biggest benefits of using AI tools for your content production:Improves efficiency: AI tools automate monotonous tasks like proofreading and SEO optimization, allowing you to create high-quality content faster.

AI writing tools are meant to help you with creating content, not replace you altogether. Use the software for inspiration and to jumpstart the content creation process.

Did it change over the course of your side hustle journey?I earned an electrical engineering degree from the University of Illinois, and I spent most of my career at Motorola/Continental Automotive in Chicago.Along the way, I launched a tech startup with friends until we sold the business in 2016.



These full-time jobs allowed me to test the market, learn and iterate along the way.

As vegetarians, they had trouble finding foods that not only tasted great but also had great texture. And they found that mushrooms were very satisfying and healthy.


This opened my eyes to an amazing culture with innovative foods that mimic the texture of meat. I fell in love with the product and its history, and I knew our family had a snack that needed to be shared with the world.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I first learned how to import the product from my family in Malaysia. I sampled the product as often as I could to test demand and gather consumer feedback. I quickly found out that many types of people, including non-vegetarians, loved it because it was a healthy snack that tasted great.I started selling on our website (which we powered through Shopify) and Amazon for direct business. I started to cold email, call and visit as many stores as I could to get more sales and distribution.


Meanwhile, I also did some product development and worked on transferring production to the United States. I rented small kitchen spaces, made products, tested, iterated and repeated that process frequently. I used the cash from online sales and sampling events to reinvest back into the business.Related: After This 26-Year-Old Got Hooked on ChatGPT, He Built a 'Simple' Side Hustle Around the Bot That Brings In $4,000 a MonthWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?It's hard to avoid the amount of capital it requires to get started from scratch.

How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent weekly or monthly revenue?It took about two years.When did it surpass the income of your full-time job?After about year three, I started making enough income to match my previous full-time job.When did you decide to go all-in and transition from side hustle to full-time business?After wrapping up another startup venture in 2016, I decided to go all in on the business.Luckily at that time, all the trends were aligning. Mushrooms were trending; healthy, on-the-go snacking was still gaining popularity; and plant-based foods were booming.

Sabeena Ladha, founder and CEO of the ""good-for-you"" snack brand DEUX, has a ""pretty deep relationship with junk food."" That's ""kind of a funny thing to say,"" she admits, but her childhood in the small town of Euless, Texas, where her father ran a gas station and convenience store, kicked off the passion for snacks that would help shape her professional endeavors.""My parents worked 24/7,"" Ladha recalls. ""They're immigrants, so they had that hard work ethic built in them. So he was working 12-, 14-hour days, six, seven days a week, and on the weekends, my sisters and I would go to the gas station, and we would get to pick a snack. I always picked one salty and one sweet snack."" They weren't necessarily the most healthful choices, but at the time, those products weren't quite as ""villainized"" as they are today, she says.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX. Sabeena Ladha. 



Although Ladha ""looked healthy"" as a high school athlete who played basketball and ran track, she quips that her ""insides were made of partially hydrogenated oil and trans fats."" It wasn't until college that she dove into health and wellness, even starting a blog ""before it was cool"" to unpack juice cleanses and cryotherapy.Related: After Being Diagnosed With Cancer, She Created a Cookie That Would Help Her Eat Cleanly and Satisfy Her Sweet Tooth.

""Not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""""[I was] trying to make the scary world of wellness a little bit more approachable for Sabeena in Texas,"" Ladha explains. ""Not everyone lives in Los Angeles and has access to 18 farmers markets on a Saturday. That's just not realistic. And not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""Answering that question ultimately led Ladha to the ""healthy indulgences"" concept of DEUX. The hot-pink brand offers cookie doughs, dessert spreads and donut holes that are vegan, gluten- and preservative-free and contain ""functional ingredients"" like vitamin B12 to support sustained energy and L-Theanine to help with cognitive function and mental focus.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX


Ladha was ready to ""break the rules"" and innovate in the snack space, but she credits much of her success with the fact that she learned those rules before she broke them. Her previous experiences working on Frito-Lay at PepsiCo, managing a P&L at Diamond Foods, consulting at McKinsey & Company and launching brands in venture capital helped build a strong foundation for her entrepreneurial journey.Related: The Founders of This Paleo, Gluten-Free and Vegan Brand Say It Succeeded Because of Its Restrictions""[Experimenting with scale] required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that.""Ladha started experimenting with chocolate chip cookie dough in her kitchen in June 2020, when the pandemic was well underway, and many people wanted to graduate from the ""sourdough and wine phase"" and indulge in healthier ways, she says. Today, all of DEUX's cookie doughs have a similar base, incorporating oats, nut butter, flaxseed and coconut sugar.


But one of the biggest challenges in those early days was figuring out how to scale DEUX's perfect recipe with a manufacturer. ""You would think it's [just] math, right?"" Ladha says. ""Like, you just scale up the recipe into making 3,000 pounds instead of one pound. And it really did not work like that. It got drier; it got a little bit more dense. It wasn't as sweet. So you have to then go through iterations, and that required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that too.""Related: This Entrepreneur Believes Courage Is the Key Ingredient for SuccessInitially, Ladha didn't want to raise capital; she put $20,000 of her own money into the business and resolved to test the product first. Ladha was more than willing to pivot if the idea didn't gain traction, noting that she ""wanted an idea that would work"" rather than one that had to be ""force fit"" into the market.

To date, DEUX has raised about $6 million. The company's first fundraising round kicked off in January 2021, and Ladha says that capital — and the ability it gave DEUX to produce at a significantly higher volume — made it possible for her to appear on Shark Tank after its producers reached out. Ladha didn't land a deal on the show, but DEUX has continued to see tremendous growth in the years since.""[If you] take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit.""DEUX has transitioned from an exclusively direct-to-consumer (DTC) brand to one with a significant retail presence in Target, Whole Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets and more. DEUX hit 1,000,000 units sold last year and more than doubled its store count to 2,600 in 2023. And in the first half of 2024, DEUX will see that figure skyrocket again with the launch of donuts at major retailers nationwide, totaling more than 4,000 stores across its three product lines.Ladha says that retail will make up the ""lion's share"" of DEUX's revenue this year but stresses that DTC remains important for the brand for two reasons: data collection and marketing opportunities. The former helps the business understand who its customers are and which flavors resonate with them, and the latter has allowed it to explore brand collaborations, like its recent Buttercream Sugar Cookie with The Skinny Confidential.

""That's a cooler story, right? But if you can collect data and test and learn and take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Elise Whang and Emily Erkel, co-founders of B2B marketplace platform LePrix, which offers a curated space for sourcing pre-owned luxury items from top suppliers around the world.LePrix has done more than $100 million in topline gross merchandise value since launch. It has raised $15 million to date and is the largest B2B pre-owned luxury platform globally, with over 150,000 units of pre-owned luxury at wholesale prices per month, according to the company.How did your corporate careers prepare you to launch the side hustle that would become LePrix? 



Whang: Early on in my legal career, I had the opportunity to meet entrepreneurs from mega-corporations who had built their businesses from scratch. Their journey was fascinating and inspiring to me; however, I quickly realized entrepreneurs are often over-glamorized. Lawyers see all the blemishes and the challenges and hardships business owners face as well. This experience helped me take the proverbial leap with my eyes wide open. Importantly, being a lawyer also trained me how to write thoughtfully, be persuasive and take measured risks. I also learned that what I enjoyed most about being a lawyer would carry over to being an entrepreneur — helping people and fixing problems.Erkel: My career in retail strategy consulting prepared me for the launch of LePrix in so many ways. Each project was a different opportunity to help a client overcome a challenge and succeed — whether it was launching a large Japanese fast-fashion retailer in the U.S., helping a women's specialty retailer go omnichannel or [helping] an iconic luxury brand house known for its handbags expand into other categories. The skills I learned to quickly identify the problem, be creative with the solution and help the retailer execute helped me learn the skills that every entrepreneur needs: strategy, execution, grit and adaptability.

It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.When did you start the side hustle that would become your company, and what was the inspiration behind it? Whang: When that first amazing business idea dawns on you, it is like a bright light bulb going off in your head. It first lit up when I was standing in line for coffee before work knowing I had to work over the weekend. What I really wanted to do over the weekend was go to my favorite consignment stores with my sisters, but these stores all closed at 7 p.m., and I could not get there. So why not bring all these wonderful designer consignment stores online? This first iteration of our business was consumer-facing, aiming to aggregate the best designer consignment stores online in one platform. This laid the groundwork for our present business model, focusing on business-to-business (B2B) pre-owned luxury wholesale.In the early days, I juggled my entrepreneurial pursuits with my demanding role as a lawyer. My side hustle typically unfolded between 8 p.m. to 2 or 3 a.m. and consumed weekends for several years. Fast forward — the light bulb went off again when we saw that our stores were buying from each other more and more on our platform. We realized they needed a way to source pre-owned authentic handbags and jewelry from other trusted businesses online. We then launched the first B2B pre-owned luxury wholesale auction houses from across the globe to retailers in the U.S., and it grew from there.


At which point did you decide to leave your corporate jobs to focus on LePrix full-time, and what motivated you to take the leap? Whang: I was eight months pregnant, happily married, with a great job as a lawyer. I was patting myself on the back for being the first female lawyer in our family. But I was also panicking that life was going by at warp speed, and if I didn't take the leap soon to work on this great business plan, it may never happen. In hindsight, I was probably going through a midlife crisis. We applied to an accelerator program and got in, but they required only full-time founders, which meant I had to quit my day job. I was scared about what our immigrant parents, who worked their behinds off to give us the American dream, would think. My husband asked me what I was going to do — and I said I wanted to take a bet on this business; otherwise, I'd regret it on my deathbed (I know, dramatic). I popped out my baby and then started my entrepreneurial journey. I haven't looked back since.Related: Being 'Lazy' Paid Off: Her Failed Side Hustle Led to a Business That Brings in Over $100 Million a YearErkel: At the time, I had been at a large specialty retailer, working with the leadership team on different strategies, from growing their new baby business to exploring ways to shorten lead time from design to delivery. It was an amazing experience and a great team, but part of me yearned to build something that was more aligned with my passion growing up. When I was younger, I was obsessed with fashion, especially luxury and vintage. When my co-founder and sister, Elise, approached me with the idea of launching this as a side hustle, my gut reaction was an immediate yes. Once we started gaining traction and growing quickly, I knew it was time to go full-time, but I was nervous. Innately, I am more risk averse, but the numbers (and Elise) are very convincing. Would I rather be a cog in a wheel or chart my own course and try something new and exciting that there was clearly a market demand for? The answer was clear.


What have been some of the biggest challenges you've faced over the course of your founding journey so far, and how have you overcome them? Whang: One of the significant challenges we faced was securing funding from venture capitalists (VCs). The reality of less than 5% of female founders successfully raising funds from VCs is real. Our company deviates from the conventional VC company profile; we're far from resembling the stereotypical characters depicted in the HBO show Silicon Valley (one of my favorite shows). Notably, our team is 60% BIPOC, with two female founders, and we take immense pride in this diversity. We have, however, successfully secured funds from private investors and early-stage VCs who wholeheartedly believe in our vision, the business, its potential and our team.Erkel: Another challenge was the pivot from B2C to B2B. It was clear that the way to help our stores was not selling but sourcing. For businesses, sourcing pre-owned luxury is difficult, risky and expensive because the wholesale industry for luxury resale is highly fragmented. As our B2B business continued to take off, Elise and I knew it was time to sunset our B2C business. It was a decision we thought very carefully about as the B2C business was not only our first baby, but we had also built a pretty successful business. However, the growth of the B2B business was immense, and with limited resources and time, we knew it was time to double down on B2B.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business. Here's What I Learned.What are you most excited about as you look to LePrix's future? Erkel: As the leader in the B2B pre-owned luxury industry, we are most excited to be the driving force making luxury resale accessible to retailers globally. We have the opportunity to change the industry, help retailers meet consumer demand and, most importantly, make a sustainable impact.What's your best advice for other side hustlers who hope to turn their gigs into full-time ventures?Whang: Don't quit your day job until you have some data or traction. DO build out a business model with your data and make an informed decision to take the leap. Don't obsess about hyper growth anymore, but DO build a profitable business — it's still a business. Don't kick yourself for failing. DO learn from your mistakes and quickly pivot.


Erkel: Don't be scared to take the leap. Life is short, and time is limited. If your side hustle shows traction and the only thing that is holding you back is fear, overcome it. Don't let fear dictate your life and stop you from moving forward. Life is more fulfilling if you're doing what you love.

70,"I Built an Online Solopreneur Business That Generates $150,000 of Passive Income a Year. Here's My 5-Step Guide To Success.","Jan 26, 2024",Liam Gill,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-5-step-guide-to-success-in-online-business/468604,"
With wages stagnating and layoffs seemingly part of everyday life for the past three years, many professionals have sought to start a solopreneur business. A solopreneur business is a business (often digital) that the owner can run without a team.In September 2022, I left my job. Despite having two law degrees and a Master of Sciences, I was wrapping up a one-year contract that paid me $50k annually while working 50+ hours per week. Now, I did have some savings and had been planning to start my solopreneurship venture for a few years, so I wasn't starting from zero. Before that one-year contract, I founded a technology startup and worked a higher-paying job in the technology industry.Related: 4 Ways to Make Over $1 Million With Your Online Business



When I left my job, I calculated that I had six months of runway to make enough to cover my annual costs before finding a job. It is vital that before you start any solopreneur journey or abandon your source of income, you know exactly how long you have to make your business work. This allows you to minimize stress by determining a stopping point instead of endlessly dragging yourself and your family through the pain of trying to start a business while dropping deeper into debt.Let's start your journey to $150k and walk you through exactly how I did it, step by step.Related: The 5 Stages of Personal Wealth — How to Master Your Money For Business Success1. Hacking your initial audienceThe biggest challenge in building a solopreneur business is starting the journey and building an initial audience. Going from 10,000 to 50,000 followers is much easier than going from 0 to 10,000. From my experience and speaking to many content creators, I've learned that you must hack your way to your first 10,000 followers. There is no set formula for this early stage of building your brand.The most common mistake I see when people are starting their journey is that they try to create systems that can take them from 0 to 100,000 followers. This doesn't work; you'll need to fight for every subscriber until you reach a base of subscribers who consistently interact with your content (often around 10,000). Once you have a base of followers, you can start building your systems, but it's a waste of time in the early days.My first step started about two years before I left my job. At the time, I was working for a newsletter publication, sending summaries of daily business news to roughly 40,000 entrepreneurs each day. I was lucky enough to be able to add a link in my by-line for over a year, prompting readers interested in legal insights for their startup or small business to subscribe to my newsletter. This little trick helped me gain my first 10,000 followers.


Other ways I've seen content creators hacking their way to their first 10,000 followers include viral videos, product creation, viral tweets, cold messaging, cold emails, paid advertisements and much more. If you are starting your journey, this is where you need to be creative and focus all your time and effort. Until you can hack your way to 10,000 followers on socials or a newsletter, you'll struggle to generate revenues effectively and consistently as a solopreneur.Related: 4 Ways to Avoid Loneliness as a Solopreneur2. Focus on one channelOnce you've gained 10,000 followers on one channel, you must focus on that channel. For me, it was email. For ten months, all my content was written for email; if I had time, I repurposed it for social media. A big scaling mistake solopreneurs make when building their audience is immediately trying to expand it onto multiple platforms. Don't lose momentum on one platform by dividing your attention. Dominate one channel before using your influence and following that channel to give you a headstart on any other channels you choose to use.3. Diversify income sourcesWhile you should focus on just one channel for growth, you need multiple channels for income. My audience is startup founders. I get paid by advertisers to promote products, founders themselves to teach them how to fundraise, and investors for referring companies to them. Focus early on securing multiple sources of income; even if you make very little from each source, it's better to grow the size of these deals than to try seeking new channels when others dry up desperately.


Related: Diversify Your Income: Protect Your Finances with These Strategies4. Capture every pricepointWhen monetizing your audience, you need to capture every price point. A major failure I see today is solopreneurs who charge $10,000+ for consulting with no cheaper services available. While it's true that a $1,000 offer might cannibalize some of their higher-priced sales, I've found that lower-price products can help generate interest in higher-priced ones and build trust and loyalty with your audience.If you only help people who can pay $10,000 for consulting, why would the average person follow you? Too many creators abuse those followers who cannot pay large amounts; they build a brand of their likes, retweets, subscriptions and follows, then abandon them when they need help.Related: 5 Strategies to Thrive as a Solo Business Owner — Without Burning Out


5. Interact with followersCommon advice you are likely to hear is commenting on top creators' posts to gain exposure to their audience and grow your following. In my experience, this isn't the optimal path. Instead, I chose to spend my time engaging with my audience.While my comments on their posts won't get 1k+ views, they build a relationship between me and my followers. It means a lot to a random follower or reader when I take the time to write to them or comment on their posts. In the long run, it makes it more likely that they will support my posts, remain a follower, and purchase a product, not to mention the many great relationships I've built with followers!

72,How Web 3.0 is Shaping the Next Digital Frontier,"Jan 12, 2024",Anis Uzzaman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-web-30-is-shaping-the-next-digital-frontier/467588,"
While we've seen excitement about Web 3.0 as the next phase of the Internet, it's important to understand the key factors that will make it materialize. Several important concepts related to Web 3.0 include decentralization (distributed computing), blockchain, cryptocurrency and the Metaverse. While there may be challenges, let's look at Web 3.0 opportunities and anticipate what lies ahead.Analyzing Web 3.0 as an investor and entrepreneur, it's crucial to review major themes and the industry's challenges in building more momentum.Related: 3 Ways Web 3.0 Will Change Digital Ownership



1. ScalabilityMost experts believe that blockchain cannot simultaneously achieve security, decentralization and scalability. This is known as the blockchain trilemma. It is a situation that developers encounter when building blockchains, requiring them to sacrifice one aspect as a trade-off to accommodate the other two.A specific consideration related to scalability is the blockchain size, which can grow quickly as more transactions are added. Bitcoin, for example, can process 7 transactions per second, while Ethereum can process 20 transactions per second. Meanwhile, Visa can handle 24,400 transactions per second.


Related: Web 3.0 Is Coming, and Here's What That Really Means for You2. InteroperabilityThe term interoperability references the capability of blockchains to transfer data and communicate with each other. Web 3.0 projects related to interoperability include Injective, Cosmos and Polkadot, which build blockchain ecosystems that allow interoperability. The process of achieving interoperability is complicated – but not impossible – and I expect more projects to launch soon.3. CentralizationOne factor to consider is that Web 3.0 protocols typically evolve slowly and rely heavily on centralized platforms to iterate on new functionality. Several cryptocurrency wallets — including Phantom and Metamask — are offered as browser extensions. This introduces potentially complex security challenges.Both Metamask, a cryptocurrency wallet with more than 10 million monthly active users, and OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, rely on centralized infrastructure companies like Infura (a backend Infrastructure-as-a-service provider) to operate.


4. DevelopmentRemember that the Web 3.0 development cycle may be time-consuming for protocol developers. Increasing the number of blockchains with various purposes creates challenges for developers. Blockchain developers must have relevant skills based on the blockchain network they are working on.Related: If You Have No Clue What Web3 Is, You're Not Alone. Here's a Breakdown of the Future of the Internet.5. AccessibilityCurrent Web 3.0 activities make it fairly easy for Web 2.0 users to shift to their platforms. Remember that people cannot embrace what they cannot figure out. If Web 3.0 is less accessible than Web 2.0, people may be unable to interact with many Web 3.0 projects.Web 2.0 applications, including Instagram and Facebook, are user-friendly and easily accessible compared to many Web 3.0 applications. Google, YouTube, Facebook and other Web 2.0 platforms offer strong UI/UX for their users. However, several Web 3.0 products are grappling with the trade-offs between security and convenience. When Web 3.0 is more user-friendly, the less likely it is to be secure. Recently, there has been a noticeable rise in crypto-jacking cases. Therefore, I believe that security-related obstacles on Web 3.0 need to be solved for them to be more accessible for mainstream business.


Web 3.0 success storiesSeveral compelling success stories have been in the news that highlight the business opportunities in Web 3.0.Nike: It conducted a thorough study of the Web 3.0 space before entering the market. In 2021, the company acquired RTFKT, a Web 3.0 firm specializing in fashion collectibles to bring on board a team of Web 3.0 native experts. Before launching its own SWOOSH marketplace in 2022, Nike gained significant knowledge and insights, which helped the company be more successful.Reddit: The company's entry into Web 3.0 has been a phenomenal success, surpassing OpenSea's wallet count in the blink of an eye. Reddit combined its Web 2.0 elements into the Web 3.0 onboarding process and handled everything natively — including wallet creation, digital collectible customization, and payments. The brand offers a low barrier to entry with a mint price range of US$10-100, making it affordable for most users.Gucci: Gucci is another notable brand that made significant strides in the NFT space. Gucci joined the SuperRare DAO by investing in RARE tokens and leveraged the Vault Art Space by hosting NFT exhibitions. The brand's first exhibition, The Next 100 Years of Gucci, showcased a range of NFT artwork that reflects the brand's rich heritage.Related: The Pros and Cons of Big Brands Launching Web3 ProjectsGucci is set apart from competitors due to its approach to creating unique digital assets. I admire what Gucci did to meet customer expectations. Among other actions, the company associated NFTs with physical benefits to incentivize consumers to purchase more tokens.Looking ahead at the future of Web 3.0Whether Web 3.0 becomes a resounding success or it morphs into Web 4.0, I believe industry players must embrace several fundamental challenges to succeed.


Study the regulatory maze, which means staying up-to-date with frequently changing regulations across different geographies.Attract talented workers, including professionals well-versed in blockchain and decentralized technologies.Allow extra time in the business process, due to a complex compliance landscape that may slow down processes.Understand that decentralized complexity typically adds another layer of difficulty to company operations.Work to build trust among investors and users. This is particularly challenging given recent events including the FTX collapse.Embrace the Web 3.0 ethos of community-driven decision-making, decentralization, and transparency.I expect that business leaders, including startups, corporations, and investors, who understand these challenges will help Web 3.0 evolve into the next phase of a productive, technology-advanced Internet landscape.

73,"Tech-Savvy or Not, Here's Why Businesses Must Embrace Automation Now","Jan 10, 2024",Alidar Utemuratov,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/why-harnessing-automation-can-be-your-companys-game-changer/467381,"
I know 70-year-olds who are more tech-oriented than I am — and I am the CEO of a fast-scaling tech company. I also know young people from IT companies who are not at all tech-savvy.So, when evaluating your team's readiness to adopt agile enterprise services through automation, focus on people's technical affinity, not their age. In my experience, hesitance is more about awareness and often begins at the top. Business leaders first need to accept that automation is the way of the future before it can be scaled for maximum impact.Embracing this tech is vital because agile methodologies not only enhance processes and workflows, but make a company's adaptability to change a competitive strength. Yet automation takes agile services a step further by allowing for rapid software deployment and continuous optimization with minimal oversight. Ironically, resistance to using automation to drive change is what can really cause disruption to a business. That is why I suggest it is better for small and medium-sized businesses to adopt agile enterprise automation services now rather than scrambling to catch up later when it has become industry standard — here is how:



Establish a baseline for change through metricsMetrics are concrete evidence of what works in an organization's processes and what can be improved with automation. Using KPIs and data on customer satisfaction and performance plots the baseline for change and offers a diagnostic of where sluggishness is inhibiting growth. For the owners and leaders of SMEs who may feel they do not always have the time or resources to prioritize optimization, see the problems identified by metrics and who might be affected as an exciting opportunity to bring everyone up to speed.That is always my approach: I get excited by what is possible. When evaluating any agile enterprise option, the first question should be, ""Where does the human factor bring risk?"" Then, find the services that will automate those processes. This may include centralizing task management so the right people are assigned to jobs, people are aware of who is responsible for what across functions, and deadlines are never missed. Automation can also track inventory levels and replenish stock, standardize contracts, and free up finance and accounting from manual processing that may produce costly errors.


For content creators, keeping up with trending topics, managing a content calendar, and scheduling posts is labor-intensive. Use analytics to track engagement and find out where automation will reduce friction. In all these areas, establishing a baseline will paint an unambiguous picture of where improvements can be made and help drive continuous improvement.Related: Automation Is Becoming a Business Imperative: Don't Wait Until It's Too LateDon't change what already worksA good rule of thumb for being smart with automation is: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. While automation promises great efficiencies and can set up companies for growth, do not even try to introduce it to areas that are already operating as a well-oiled machine. Instead, narrow the focus to where the organization is getting bogged down by duplication, repetition, unwieldy bureaucracy, and handling large volumes of data.We set up a system where decisions are automatically delegated for approval, and documentation is automatically generated. This was an area where we had noticed a significant slowdown, and by removing the unnecessary layers in the process, such as calling the manager and drawing up special reports, we created so much more efficiency.


However, we were also mindful that other areas of the business where the human touch is helpful were to be left alone. Building client relationships can never be outsourced to technology and certain aspects of customer service rely on empathetic human interaction. So, be clear about your business goals and consumer expectations to know which processes to target.Related: How to Ensure Tech Doesn't Overshadow Your Brand's Human TouchStrike the right balance to guarantee qualityIt is human to make mistakes, but sometimes those errors can go unnoticed and cause larger problems down the line. Automation provides consistency and accuracy while also identifying errors from sometimes complex streams of information. This comes back to the first point about metrics. When our inspection mechanisms are so precise, we have better visibility into how our teams are working and can accurately track the progress of the established baseline.Identifying risks and automating those processes will then allow leaders to make quality guarantees to their stakeholders. However, some human oversight of automation will still be required for quality assurance, especially whenever complexity, security, and regulatory compliance are involved. To strike the right balance, create a set of best practices by piloting and testing the automation of agile services in a controlled environment.


In the meantime, leaders should never lose sight of the purpose of automation in the first place as they create internal alignment around their new goals. People need to know that decision-making, innovation, and creativity all benefit from AI's capacity to synthesize complex data because it gives them the most relevant and accurate information to do all of those things better.Better late than never to become more agileAutomating processes normally undertaken by humans can be a daunting prospect for small and medium-sized businesses. That hesitance must be overcome because the reality is this tech transformation will not be slowing down for late adopters. To bring people on board for the change requires clear communication about how automation will make human control of repetitive tasks redundant — and make the business itself more agile and competitive. That should be good news for everyone, whether they are tech-savvy or a tech neophyte.

74,6 Ways to Use Social Media to Strengthen Your Brand in 2024,"Jan 8, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/6-easy-ways-social-media-can-strengthen-your-brand/467363,"
Social media isn't new but may be part of a branding strategy that has grown stale for you over time. As an entrepreneur, you are the face and voice of your business. And the first thing someone often wants to know after learning a little about it is, ""What's your (social) handle?""To some degree, you must always be in the public eye. But there are ways to do this without becoming overwhelmed with every new social media platform and trend there is. Whether launching your brand or wanting to refresh your strategy in the first quarter, here are six ways to make it work for you.1. Establish a unique voicePosting on social media can feel like you're shouting into the abyss, with the average daily time spent on social media continuing to steadily increase. Currently, over 151 million people worldwide use it per day. Therefore, it's up to you to stand out from the crowd to be seen and heard.



Identify your message and brainstorm multiple ways to deliver it. Craft your content to reflect your brand. For example, authors don't only promote their books on social media. They also talk about their writing process, highlight book events (not just their own), and share their personal reading lists.Consider which aspects of social media you will use to grow an audience and which parts you will use to promote/sell your product or service solely.Related: 6 Ways to Ace Social Media Branding for Your Startup2. Pick a channelTikTok may be the latest social media star, and with the number of users, the instinct is to join the crowd. First, consider if that's where your audience is. Typically, it draws a younger audience, which may be the target place for retail brands, but it may not have the exact audience for you.Though LinkedIn is considered the ""less fun"" platform, it is a place to talk about business, especially if it's tips or success stories. It can be a starting place to grow your authority. The goal is to pick one channel to focus on rather than trying to master all areas.That doesn't mean you can't cross-post to other channels or switch up how you post depending on the platform. However, don't get too caught up in the next big thing if it doesn't resonate with you or your brand. Because as popular as TikTok is now, there's always a newer, flashier social media platform right behind it.


3. Develop a social calendarGet more social online by outlining a monthly or bi-monthly calendar. It focuses your time and energy on strategy without having to come up with engaging captions and edited content on the fly during your general work day.Setting aside time to schedule posts establishes a sense of consistency while also giving you the freedom to post real-time content if and when the moment strikes. Alternate between posting different types of content and always asking yourself what kind of value your post is giving rather than just posting for the sake of new content.Many argue that the more you post, the better you can beat the algorithms. However, if you have an audience that's truly engaged, they'll be looking and responding to your posts no matter what.Related: How Technology Influences Social Media


4. Decide which trends to followJust as you shouldn't jump on the bandwagon of every new social platform that debuts, so is the same with online trends. So many new gifs, memes, and slang are being introduced all the time; it can be hard to keep up. When using their popularity to your advantage, ensure it reflects your brand. Otherwise, your messaging will fall flat.Trends come and go, but having a strong position is what will attract and retain your audience. Don't be as concerned with having a viral moment or attracting hundreds of followers who are not engaged with your brand. Instead, be patient and slowly ramp up your audience of people who actually want to hear what you have to say and will eventually buy into what you're selling.5. Get creative with videoOne ""trend"" that has had staying power is video. TikTok and Instagram Reels have proven to be famous in sharing short snippets of information entertainingly. However, there are still over 2.7 billion monthly active YouTube users, allowing you to post longer videos complete with captions.Whichever avenue you'd like to take with video, scripted or live, short or long, it's a good way to share your brand personality engagingly. Not comfortable on camera? Put together a reel of business highlights or still images that showcase your offering(s); it doesn't have to be your face front and center for every video.

Also, creating dry social media captions can trigger spam warnings and make it harder for you to get in front of your audience at all.If you're having trouble crafting the perfect message, tools like ChatGPT can be helpful. While AI shouldn't be relied on to create your content word for word, it can serve as a guiding point when conveying what you want. Also, social media tools like Buffer have built-in AI features to help make captions easier and more convenient.Overall, don't let using social media overwhelm you. Rather, stay curious about what you can do with it. Pick and choose the platforms and features that speak most to you and your audience, and grow it from there.

75,Let Your Employees Be CEOs for a Day to Harness Their Hidden Power,"Jan 8, 2024",Daniel Todd,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/let-your-employees-be-ceos-for-a-day-to-harness-their/466395,"
We will soon be launching what is likely to become a multimillion-dollar-a-month new app. The impetus for the idea came from our user acquisition (UA) and sales team leaders after they had identified the potential for a new opportunity in the market that I, as CEO, could not see. They had an idea to expand our existing app to focus on a growing opportunity but after talking about it, we agreed it could grow faster and larger as a standalone app.This decision exemplifies the power of integrating diverse perspectives within the company to forge a superior strategic direction. It also shows how actively listening to and valuing employee ideas can be a driving force for innovation and growth.Making the most of this opportunity is a two-part process for leaders. Firstly, they have to prove they truly care about people's opinions. Secondly, they need to give employees enough information about how the business actually works from a strategic perspective so they are only bringing forward the best and most actionable ideas. If we do not get the second part right, people will be unhappy because they will feel their suggestions for improvement and growth are constantly being rejected.



Fortunately, we have tools to help them get into that strategic mindset and uncover their unique insights.Related: How Agility and Resiliency Help Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Succeed


Putting on the CEO hatGenerating bigger strategic ideas requires a deep understanding of the company's goals. Currently, everyone in our company is familiar with our monthly EBITDA target. While each company has its unique objectives, we have discovered that offering employees a perspective from the CEO's seat encourages them to consider the larger strategic elements at play.At our upcoming in-person conference in Las Vegas this January, we will engage various groups in a thought experiment: What would they prioritize if they were the CEO? We are already preparing folks across finance, product management and HR among others, prompting them to develop their best ideas for their respective groups. We are asking them what resources they lack and what they need to expand their teams. Our goal is to elicit unconstrained ideas, leading to discussions about how they contribute to the company's long-term growth goals. Once we have quantified their potential impact and cost, we can then estimate the long-term impact of these ideas.While we cannot implement every suggestion, determining the most feasible and impactful ideas is crucial. Keeping the door open for team leaders to present their ideas, coupled with a formal process for ideas submission like this one, is invaluable for leaders. However, educating employees on their role within the broader business context can help ensure these structures are truly effective.Establishing a foundation for innovationWe recently hired a new head of onboarding and employee education to guide people to understand our whole business model. It is too complicated to communicate in just a two-day training session, so instead we are creating videos and training content and posting them on our wiki. We also present them at our monthly online meetings to help our teams see why ""metrics matter."" These short videos lay out our entire business model one metric at a time and are entertaining enough and short enough that people will go back and watch them later when needed.


The other focus of the training is to give people a big, long roadmap of where we are heading. When ideas do come up, we can show people where they might fit in with the other initiatives we are working on. That way, our employees know they are not being ignored; it just might not be the best time to start on their idea. Being transparent about how we prioritize ideas shows we are serious about empowering our employees while tempering expectations.Related: You Have to Give Your Employees Freedom to See Excellence — Here's How to Do It.How leaders can prioritize ideasUnusable ideas are not usually bad, just impractical from a business standpoint. For instance, the HR department might ask for developers to build an automated solution for burdensome manual processes. As leaders, we might have to tell them they are paid to perform those actions because they are cheaper than having developers build a solution. Especially when building a company, an expensive solution that improves efficiency by 4% is not as valuable in the short run as a new growth project that could double the business at half the cost.At the same time, leaders cannot ignore teams. Our customer support team had been asking for efficiency tools for six years. As frustrations grew, I decided to direct investment into developing administrative tools. Purely from a growth perspective, this may not have been the best move, but I knew it was important for the team and became more than just a matter of cents.


We also strive to give people access to the right information so they can model their ideas and build projections on how they will impact the company before they even bring them to our attention. Conversations with innovative employees become so much easier when they see why we are going to prioritize a $20 million idea over their $50,000 idea. By establishing this transparency and a culture free from judgment, leaders help ensure people will keep generating and testing their ideas.Mutual trust — the key to good ideasWhen it comes to employee-driven innovation, the perfect balance is executive teams trusting their employees to come up with great ideas — and employees trusting leaders will take the time and effort to truly consider them. It is hard: People pitch an idea and might not hear back for months, which can disenfranchise them from doing it again. But if we educate people on how the company works and its larger objectives, they will have faith that the executive team is earnestly trying to move the organization forward. Then, as people see their best ideas get implemented, it creates a virtuous cycle: They will be motivated to continue to think more strategically and leaders will be able to harness their insights for the benefit of the whole company.

76,How Much Is Too Much Automation in the Workplace? How AI Could Be Hurting Your Employees,"Jan 8, 2024",Pierre Raymond,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-much-is-too-much-automation-in-the-workplace-how-ai/466332,"
Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over the workplace, and employees are still not sure how their companies are using automation tools to boost their productivity or augment specific tasks of their jobs.The reality, however, is that many companies have given their all or nothing for artificial intelligence without considering the near and long-term impact these tools will have on employees' mental well-being. Now the results are in, and it's not looking very good.Several studies have found that employees are feeling more stressed or anxious since their companies have introduced several new AI-focused projects to assist with overall workplace productivity.



All of this for an extra boost in the quarterly bottom line.Related: How to Leverage AI to Supercharge Your Business


How artificial intelligence is impacting employees' well-beingWhat many thought would become the breakthrough moment of the century is now looking more and more taboo for some workers trying to avoid the topic of artificial intelligence in the workplace.One recent study published by the American Psychological Association (APA found that roughly 4 in 10 (38%) American workers are worried that artificial intelligence will partially or completely take over their job duties, leaving them obsolete.All of this tracking hasn't fared well with employees either. In the same APA report, around a third (32%) of employees that know their boss is tracking their activity reported their mental health being ""fair"" or ""poor.""In a different APA study, more than half of employees said they are aware that their boss or manager is using some form of AI to monitor their activity while on the clock.


This isn't to mention the countless number of employees feeling overwhelmed with all the new learning and training they have to undergo to effectively apply artificial intelligence in the workplace or their day-to-day activities. Fears of being replaced by machines, computers monitoring their activity and the absence of AI workplace policies are only adding more confusion to the office talk.Yet, despite all of this chatter going around, a survey by The Conference Board found that 1 in 10 employers are now using generative AI tools daily. However, only 23% said that their company had an AI policy in development and 26% said their organization already had something in place.A fear of becoming obsoleteAll over the world, employees are becoming more fearful of artificial intelligence taking their place in the office. In fact, a study by the Pew Research Center found that roughly 19% of U.S. workers were in jobs most exposed to the possibility of being automated by AI.While it's still unclear how many jobs might be slashed in the coming years, because it's cheaper and more effective to employ machines, some suggest that artificial intelligence has already contributed to roughly 4,000 layoffs in May this year.


While employees fear that they might be replaced in the coming years, or even more worrisome, in a couple of months at the rate at which artificial technology is developing, many are also concerned over whether they will find a good paying job elsewhere.Concerns regarding job fulfillment and work-life balance are all now being questioned as the workplace becomes increasingly automated and the labor market more competitive.Related: Don't Waste Money on AI. Unlock Its True Potential By Treating It Like a New Hire.Lack of privacy and securityIt's no secret that companies are leveraging artificial intelligence to track and monitor employee performance and their day-to-day activity while on the clock.


While some companies have used this technology to allow their teams to have more efficient and transparent workplace practices, allowing them increased exposure to project progress, and the ability to resolve inefficiencies more effectively — some employers have gone the other route, instead.Those employees who know their bosses and managers are tracking their activity have felt that they are often being inappropriately watched; in fact, 81% of employees felt this way.Employees are feeling that they are not being trusted by their employers or team members, leading to decreased morale and engagement. Additionally, this only adds to workers' personal distress and leaves a sour taste in their mouths realizing that their activity is closely being captured by their employers.On top of this lack of privacy, many employees often feel that a potential data breach could only further expose more of their personal information to bad actors. Weak cybersecurity infrastructure and a lack of proper security training are often known to be some of the biggest reasons for data breaches in the workplace.


A continuity of underlying workplace discriminationOther issues with automation and artificial intelligence tools in the office are the potential risks these tools pose for workplace diversity and inclusion practices. Hiring algorithms used to train AI models are often responsible for the design choices made during a company's hiring process and for selecting appropriate candidates for open positions.However, many people feel that these algorithms used in the hiring and candidate selection process can influence a company's wider diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) standards.Already, there have been multiple examples of artificial intelligence being host to cultural and gender bias, only selecting employees based on their race, gender, and age and not necessarily taking into consideration their qualifications or experience.Effectively training AI-hiring algorithms to de-bias itself and remove discriminatory actions takes time, often reversing the work employers have already done in recent years to create more equitable workplace policies.


What's more, these systems are only learning from the data companies can feed them. Let's say a company is predominantly male, the system will read that as ""Hey, we don't really hire women around here.""Not even companies such as Amazon couldn't de-bias its hiring algorithms back in 2018, despite having access to the necessary resources and skills.Related: AI Is Coming For Your Jobs — Anyone Who Says Otherwise Is In Denial. Here's How You Can Embrace AI to Avoid Being Left Behind.Where do employers draw the line?Well, that's exactly the question many are wondering about. Companies will continue to invest in artificial intelligence, and employees will have to deal with what comes afterward. Finding a balance would require employers to take more actionable steps to effectively integrate AI within the workplace, allowing employees to grow alongside it, instead of being fearful thereof.

79,"His 'Mesmerizing' Wintry Product Can Cost Up to $500,000 and Is Used By the Kardashians and Disneyland — But It All Started on Accident","Dec 4, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/magicsnows-snowfall-business-charms-celebs-disney-and-more/466187,"
When Adam Williams, now founder and president of MagicSnow, moved to Los Angeles in 2000, running a snowfall-special-effects company wasn't on his bucket list. He'd come to the city to launch his career as a magician, and he took a step in that direction by pitching a Christmas-themed magic show to The Grove, one of the highest-grossing shopping and entertainment centers in the U.S.Williams' pitch, complete with a storyboard presentation that promised a mesmerizing, snow-filled finale, made its way to Rick Caruso, The Grove's billionaire owner. But Caruso was only interested in one thing about Williams' proposed show: the snow.Image Credit: Courtesy of MagicSnow / Brian To



""So he gave me the opportunity to set up the snowfall effect,"" Williams tells Entrepreneur. ""After the first week of doing it, during the holiday season, it became a huge hit. They added a second show. We were starting to draw a crowd and [create] a real experience that people in Los Angeles had never had — snow during the holidays.""It wasn't long before other shopping centers across the country came calling. Williams brought his show to Miami and Dallas and continued expanding into new locations each year. For most of his clients, creating the wintry wonderland became an annual tradition, which gave rise to a fitting ""snowball effect"" and robust portfolio. Today, MagicSnow frosts some of the most iconic scenes in entertainment — from the Kardashians' Christmas party to Radio City Rockettes performances, star-studded music videos, Princess Cruise Lines, Disney parks and more.


Image Credit: Courtesy of MagicSnow / Brian ToRelated: 9 Out-of-the-Box Side Hustles to Try in 2023Williams also launched a sister company, or ""summer counterpart,"" to keep business booming outside of the holiday season: Bubbleworks uses the same chemistry and technology to carry out bubble shows. In 2019, Taylor Swift used the effect in Central Park (which prohibits confetti) to launch her album Lover.""We're constantly having to adjust for wind, temperature, humidity and any [other] weather conditions.""Needless to say, MagicSnow's method of snowfall creation is a far cry from early attempts in the entertainment industry. In the 1920s and 1930s, movie sets often relied on white-painted cornflakes to give the illusion of snow. They were sometimes mixed with shaved gypsum — or asbestos — and were often so loud that dialogue had to be re-dubbed after the fact, per Life.MagicSnow's effects are water-based, using ""water and light foam."" Unlike traditional artificial snow, MagicSnow evaporates on contact, meaning no slippery residue or cleanup is required. It also looks better on camera, fills up more space and hangs in the air longer, Williams says. The company is currently on its 230th iteration of the formula — but in the beginning, it was up to Williams to figure out what worked.""When we started at first, it was very basic,"" Williams says. ""I was up shooting snow off the rooftops of buildings and learning the physics of not only our snow effect but also [of the atmosphere] — so no two shows are the same. We're constantly having to adjust for wind, temperature, humidity and any [other] weather conditions. Mostly, we're working outdoors.""Image Credit: Courtesy of MagicSnow / Brian ToRelated: After 15 Years in Hollywood, This Visual Effects Artist Left to Create an Online Film Academy. Here Are His Dos and Don'ts for Course Creators.In those early days, Williams tried to be at as many shows as possible, and he even operated all of The Grove shows for the first 10 years, giving himself thousands of opportunities to learn and refine his technique.""A lot of kids in Los Angeles don't have access to snow...but what we're doing is bringing that access to them here.""So how much does it cost to make snow where it doesn't snow? MagicSnow offers a snowmen-delivery option that runs from about $1,700-$2,000, affording people with more modest budgets the opportunity to enjoy the novelty, Williams says. Small-scale installations — think ""if you want to have a toboggan hill built in your backyard or you want to sled out your front door on Christmas Day"" — can come in anywhere from $25,000-$100,000.


Image Credit: Courtesy of MagicSnow / Brian ToBut Williams notes that some of the bigger budgets have charitable aims. For example, Katy Perry recently hired MagicSnow to put on an event for the Los Angeles Boys & Girls Club.""A lot of kids in Los Angeles don't have access to snow,"" Williams says. ""I grew up in Ohio, and it's probably snowing there right now. It was something that I took for granted until I moved to Los Angeles, where it doesn't snow. We don't have that experience. So for some kids, their parents fly [them] to Colorado or up north and maybe see snow. But what we're doing is bringing that access to them here.""Related: 6 Ways to Become an Influencer Behind the Camera


Naturally, MagicSnow's large-scale events come with heftier price tags. Williams says there are ""multiple layers,"" each with their associated costs when it comes to launching a project. If the company is working with a venue for the first time, that will require a lot of pre-production and design, generally ranging from $50,000-$100,000. Then there are operational costs throughout the season; those vary depending on the frequency of the shows but often run about another $100,000. And those figures will tick up even higher for large-scale projects installed overseas — ""You're looking at anywhere from $100,000 to half a million dollars for a project to make snow where it doesn't exist,"" Williams says.Really, at the end of the day, what we're doing is telling stories with snow.""Since Covid, MagicSnow has seen 10-20% growth each year, which Williams attributes partly to its ability to provide outdoor entertainment when people gravitated toward that. One of the biggest challenges is keeping up with an all-at-once, seasonal demand, doing ""a year's worth of work in the course of two months"" (120 projects are in progress currently) before the phones stop ringing on December 25. Then, all goes quiet for a few months until the following year's planning begins.But Williams' passion for the business of snow, which he calls a ""universal experience"" that's ""magical and mesmerizing and fascinating,"" has never waned, and he looks forward to continuing to innovate in the space.

""And it hasn't just been me: I've got an amazing team of people with very diverse skill sets, backgrounds. I have designers, welders, chemists, writers, directors. Really, at the end of the day, what we're doing is telling stories with snow.""""And that's really what is exciting, what keeps me going, keeps me interested in this business, is that there are still technical and creative possibilities that have not yet been explored,"" he adds. ""And we are in a very unique position to do that and take it to the next level.""

What were you doing before you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship? 



Before embarking on my entrepreneurial journey, I was employed as an international trade specialist. However, I always had a burning desire to create something I could call my own. The allure of the independence and autonomy that comes with being your own boss was simply too compelling to resist.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?


My entrepreneurial journey began as a side hustle back in 2018. The spark of inspiration was kindled by my personal experiences. I found that the outdoor furniture covers that were available in the market were far from satisfactory. They were either exorbitantly priced or they were of subpar quality. I recognized a glaring gap in the market for outdoor furniture covers that were both affordable and of high quality.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground? The initial steps I took on this journey were methodical and well thought out. I conducted in-depth market research to understand the nuances of the market. I also spent a considerable amount of time sourcing high-quality materials that would meet the expectations of my potential customers. Furthermore, I set up an ecommerce platform to facilitate easy and convenient transactions for my customers. A significant part of my initial efforts was also dedicated to understanding the specific needs and preferences of my target customers.


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them? One of the biggest hurdles I faced was juggling my full-time job with my burgeoning side hustle. Additionally, managing the financial aspects of the business was a daunting task. However, I tackled these challenges head-on by setting clear boundaries, prioritizing tasks effectively and acquiring knowledge about financial management.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business. Here's What I Learned.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue, and at what point did the side hustle's income surpass your full-time job? 


It took approximately a year before I started seeing a consistent stream of monthly revenue from my side hustle. After two years, the income from my side hustle surpassed that of my full-time job. This was a pivotal moment that led me to make the decision to transition into running my side hustle as a full-time business.You've turned your side hustle into a full-time business. How much average monthly/yearly revenue does it bring in now? And what about during peak season? As of now, F&J Outdoor generates an average monthly revenue of around $66,000. This translates to an annual revenue of approximately $800,000. During the peak season, our revenue can surge by up to 30%.Related: Anyone Can Start a Business.

81,What It Takes to Build a Best-In-Class Company — 3 Essential Elements,"Dec 1, 2023",Robert Finlay,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-it-takes-to-build-a-best-in-class-company/464162,"
More than 5 million businesses were created in the U.S. in 2022. What makes the true industry giants stand out in a world of fierce competition? What separates an average company from a top-tier organization that's successful and pivotal in shaping the future?Drawing upon 20-plus years as an entrepreneur, during which I've witnessed numerous businesses rise and fall, I've gathered insights into critical factors that differentiate outstanding enterprises from the rest.Let's dig into the essential elements that elevate a company to best-in-class status, exploring how ethical conduct, innovation and social responsibility are admirable goals and vital drivers of success.



Related: How to Take Advantage of Your Underdog Status and Conquer Industry GiantsEthical practices: A foundation of excellenceWhen we talk about ethical conduct in business, we're not just checking boxes to comply with laws and regulations. We are establishing a compass that guides our companies' actions, shapes culture and dictates how we interact with stakeholders. In a time when trust can shatter like glass and reputation is everything, integrity is the foundation upon which best-in-class businesses are built.


In my enterprises, I've learned that cultivating a culture that values doing the right thing, even when it's tough, is critical. This means creating an environment where your team feels empowered to make ethical decisions, with you leading by example. Weaving ethics into your company's DNA increases credibility, fosters trust and boosts profitability.And here's the magic: When customers and clients trust your company, they become loyal advocates, bolstering your reputation and driving sustainable growth through word-of-mouth referrals. Ethical practices also attract socially conscious investors, further boosting your company's financial health.To establish and strengthen ethical practices:Create ethics and values statements as a team and share them internally and externally.Incorporate your ethics and values into your brand messaging, recruiting, and training materials.Embody these in your conduct as a leader and organization.Related: More Than Just A Moral Compass: The Power Of Ethical Business Practices


Pioneering business practicesInnovation isn't confined to new technology and cutting-edge software. Best-in-class companies view innovation as a continuous pursuit of creative solutions to problems, whether in your products, services, how you treat team members or the processes that drive your business.Innovation isn't just a buzzword; it's a significant driver of profitability. A recent McKinsey & Company study found that companies embracing innovation enjoy a substantial performance edge, outperforming their peers by a staggering 2.4 times in economic profit.Nurturing innovation doesn't only mean hosting grand brainstorming sessions; it involves having a company culture where every team member feels empowered to contribute ideas regardless of their title.It centers on embracing diverse voices and perspectives, encouraging experimentation, and seeing failure as a stepping stone to success. Best-in-class companies are pioneers who establish themselves as thought leaders in their industry and push the boundaries of what's possible.


I learned these principles early in my business career through observing successful companies and leaders. After a few years of ideation and experimentation, I found what worked for my leadership style and industry. Today, I'm still trying new things and paying close attention to results and the feedback of my teams, clients and other stakeholders.Which approaches to innovation will work for you? You'll only discover by jumping in fearlessly and getting creative.To leverage innovation in your business:Look for opportunities to improve efficiency, productivity, and results.Include your leadership and frontline teams in planning from the start.Talk to clients, investors and other stakeholders to gather unique perspectives and discover new ideas.Due your due diligence: Study a variety of strategies and solutions.Take risks (measured) — don't be afraid to disrupt the status quo.Related: How To Use Entrepreneurial Creativity For Innovation


Leading the charge for positive changeTo be a best-in-class company, you can't shy away from taking on significant challenges.This means fully embracing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles and addressing critical concerns such as sustainability, reducing your carbon footprint, promoting employee wellbeing and engaging with the community.It has become evident that stakeholders want, need and deserve a business approach that aligns with their values and addresses pressing global concerns.A recent study revealed global investors are increasingly focused on ESG issues in their investment strategies. Roughly 89% of investors considered ESG issues in some form as part of their investment approach in 2022, up from 84% in 2021.


Equally vital is the commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Companies that prioritize diversity and inclusion not only contribute to a more equitable society but also reap the rewards of being able to tap into a variety of perspectives and ideas.When you demonstrate an unwavering commitment to positive change, you enhance employee engagement and elevate your brand's reputation, resonating with socially conscious consumers and investors.To become a more conscientious organization:Listen to your stakeholders and the public to learn what's most important to them.Research more into what comprises ESG and DEI initiatives.Hire professionals or retain consultants with relevant expertise.As with ethics, share these values across your organization and let them guide your actions.Related: Why ESG-Conscious Companies are Resilient Companies


Standing the test of timeSuccess goes beyond the bottom line; it hinges on a relentless pursuit of excellence. Best-in-class companies understand this truth.They thrive by integrating ethics into their DNA, prioritizing innovation, and leading positive change by adopting ESG and DEI initiatives.Through these pillars, they enhance profitability, but more importantly, create a lasting positive impact that solidifies their best-in-class status, setting a high standard for all who follow.

83,How Cutting Edge AI Tech Could Be Your Answer to Tackling Stress,"Nov 29, 2023","Sahar Hashmi, MD-PhD",https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-generative-ai-can-become-your-new-ally-against-stress/463706,"
In the contemporary business milieu, individuals hailing from diverse backgrounds find themselves contending with an assortment of stressors. These challenges span a wide spectrum, including ongoing world conflicts, encompassing uncertainties in the global economy and the pervasive presence of toxic workplace cultures at the industry level. These challenges have a profound impact, not only on those directly affected but also on those who witness these incidents through news and social media, leading to heightened secondary trauma.If left unaddressed, these stressors can escalate into severe mental health issues such as anxiety, fear, depression and even post-traumatic stress disorders. This article explores innovative solutions within the entrepreneurial sphere, emphasizing the transformative potential of generative AI. By addressing the pressing mental health crisis, entrepreneurs and startups can offer crucial support, providing hope and healing amid adversity.Related: 2023 Is the Era of Generative AI Like ChatGPT. So What's in it for Entrepreneurs?



So how can entrepreneurs and startups utilize generative AI to help combat ongoing life stressors?Generative AI has undergone a remarkable transformation, particularly with the introduction of the new ChatGPT4 Turbo version utilizing 128K context, along with the new assistants API and customized GPTs announced by OpenAI during their DevDay on Nov. 6. OpenAI is becoming an indispensable asset in our daily lives by providing us with capabilities to serve humanity in unprecedented ways. OpenAI's technology fulfills a variety of roles, effortlessly transitioning from our trusted knowledge assistant and virtual aide to a data analytics partner, coder, writing companion and even a personal advisor.Entrepreneurs and innovators can leverage this trend to create cutting-edge apps, plugins, customized GPTs and algorithms designed to counter the pervasive impact of stressors in our daily lives. By tapping into the power of generative AI, we can pave the way for innovative solutions that enhance mental well-being and alleviate the pressures of modern living. Other generative AI applications, such as Google's Bard and Elon Musk's chatbot Gork, are also in competition with OpenAI's ChatGPT, all moving swiftly toward a paradigm shift. This shift not only offers businesses unprecedented opportunities for growth but also positions them at the forefront of technological advancement, enabling them to adapt and thrive in our rapidly changing world.


Here are three potential areas to explore where entrepreneurs, startups and business enterprises can utilize generative AI to reduce the aforementioned stressors in our lives.1. Personalized generative AI coaches""Alexa, can you tell me today's weather and how I should dress for my meeting with client X?"" These are the kinds of inquiries that individuals across the globe are now directing at emerging smart chatbots. These sophisticated chatbots can even simulate companionship, offering relationship advice comparable to that of a trusted friend. In a world where chatbots can become our closest confidants and digital watches can diligently monitor our vital signs while offering exercise guidance, it becomes evident that AI-guided life coaches are well within our grasp. This preference arises from the fact that such AI-guided coaching provides a non-judgmental space where individuals can readily access expert guidance, aiding them in navigating life's challenges and reducing life stressors along the way.As the world grapples with ongoing conflicts, global mental health is under heightened strain. Limited access to mental health support and life coaches exacerbates the worldwide mental health crisis. There is a pressing demand for innovative generative AI coach applications, personalized GPT coaches, plugin coaches or algorithmic coaches that can help individuals navigate this complex world, akin to a human coach or therapist. These applications can help ease their overwhelming minds from stressors. Thus, these AI-driven solutions have the potential to play a crucial role in addressing the growing challenges to mental well-being on a global scale.Related: Chatbots Are Changing the Client-Service Game. Here's What You Need to Know.


2. Customized platforms: Smart device data analysis in daily lifeDuring Amazon's recent Prime Day sale, a plethora of smart devices were available in the market, offering assistance in monitoring various aspects of our lives, from sleep patterns and menstrual cycles to daily mood regulation, stress levels by measuring heart rate, step counting and even heart rate rhythm. Some smartwatches now even offer the capability to monitor EKG, showcasing the rapid advancements in smart technology. However, the challenge lies in harnessing the data generated by these smart devices, which often remains isolated and underutilized.While these devices provide valuable data to consumers, they can also become a source of stress if the information is not effectively analyzed and applied. This underscores the pressing need for customized digital platforms that leverage generative AI to assist in data analysis, thereby making the use of such devices more meaningful and valuable to users. These customized platforms can also alert individuals, without passing judgment, when life stressors reach a level where they begin to impact the individual's physical well-being.3. Identifying and personalizing real-time solutions for employee mental fatigue in business enterprisesIn the high-speed corporate world, demanding work environments can exacerbate employee mental fatigue and burnout. Generative AI can provide real-time assistance by analyzing Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) data, detecting early signs of exhaustion, such as prolonged task completion times and expressions like ""I feel exhausted"" or ""I am drained."" It offers tailored recommendations to managers, corporate leadership and employees, which may include scheduling breaks and adjusting workloads. Furthermore, it can propose personalized mental well-being resources based on individual interests. However, it is essential to prioritize ethical deployment to safeguard privacy and prevent the misuse of MBI scores. As a result, it holds the potential to cultivate a more productive and healthier work environment within a business enterprise.In today's world, where mounting stressors increasingly burden the human mind and can lead to potentially harmful consequences, it's crucial to harness AI's potential for crafting solutions. While this development carries risks, including concerns about safety, privacy, hallucinations and unforeseen consequences, we must carefully balance these against the benefits. Similar to introducing new medicine, the advantages may outweigh the risks, driving innovation. Through such endeavors, we can tackle modern stressors, ultimately enhancing global well-being and safety in society and workplaces.

84,4 Ways to Bring Your Team Back From the Brink of Innovation Extinction,"Nov 28, 2023",Duncan Wardle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-playful-tactics-to-prevent-your-teams-creative-decline/464230,"
Entrepreneurs often assume that the biggest barrier to developing great ideas is a shortage of time or resources — but that's not true. It's the lack of playfulness in their innovation processes.According to recent reporting by Fundera, more than 70% of business owners work more than 40 hours per week, and almost 20% work more than 60 hours per week. Yet, they still lack creative solutions to their problems. As someone who spent years as the head of innovation and creativity at Disney, I can tell you exactly why: They're not leveraging the natural way the brain comes up with ""Eureka!"" moments.Let me put this a different way. When do you get your best, brightest, most out-of-the-box ideas? While you're in the shower, walking your dog, working out, commuting, falling asleep or waking up? Then you're like most humans on the planet. But I can guarantee you didn't say, ""While I'm at work, of course.""



Even though we're paid to have big ideas at work, we never have them there. Work is too chaotic and distracting. Our brains focus on emails, presentations and reports. But the second we step away from our occupational lives, we move from what I call a ""busy beta"" state of mind to an alpha one. In busy beta, the door between the conscious and subconscious brain is firmly closed. In alpha, that door is flung wide open.How, then, do you get your employees to move toward an alpha state of mind on demand when you're eager to come up with new concepts for the company? Follow these steps.


Related: Why Leaders Must Encourage Their Employees to Explore Their Creativity — and How to Do It1. Start tackling challenges before you need answersDo not brief a challenge to your employees on the same day you need them to create and deploy a solution. Give at least a week for everyone to ideate, and then bring them together to talk about their thoughts.This is the opposite of what usually happens in the workplace, typically called a brainstorming session. Unfortunately, brainstorming rarely produces anything innovative because it's too tied to the work atmosphere. People need stimuli unrelated to work (e.g., walking their dog, testing a cheesecake recipe, playing an instrument) to gain unfettered access to their unconscious brains.Remember: It's too late if you wait until the house is burning to think of a fire prevention plan. You need to start planning in advance so everyone can allow their wild, fantastic notions to surface. That way, you can tap into the power of alpha waves, which are essential for any kind of relaxed, creative process, per Microsoft research.


2. Write down all the rules that are part of your problemI've designed a two-step innovation tool called ""What If?"" that tears down plenty of the roadblocks to creativity and gives people better access to their imaginations. The first step to ""What If?"" involves writing down all the rules that are holding you or your team back.For instance, consider Walt Disney's dilemma when he wanted to release his film Fantasia. He was frustrated because he couldn't pump mist or heat into theaters. Why? Theaters wouldn't let him. Accordingly, he wrote down all the rules of going to a movie theater: I must sit. I must be quiet. I must pay to get in. I can expect it to be dark. I can't control the environment.By writing these rules down, Disney could more clearly see everything that was getting in his way. This allowed him to move on to the second step of ""What If?"" — which I outline below.Related: Have a Great New Idea? Here's How to Know If Your Brainstorm Will Become a Breakthrough


3. Break one of the rules you listedThis is the fun, absurd, provocative part that allows the creative rubber to meet the road. Look at the list of rules you generated. Choose one and come up with audacious ways to break it. In Disney's case, it was to worry less about controlling the movie theater environment by taking his movies out of the theater. He considered having people dress in costumes in different themed lands so he could control the story and engage the audience. Enter the concept for Disneyland.The founders of Netflix used this practice as well. They were fed up with the rules and limits of consumer video rentals. They didn't want consumers to have to drive to the store during business hours, choose a limited number of videos from a limited stock, drive back home and return everything within a few days or pay a late fee. The rule Netflix chose to break was having a physical store. Inspired by the internet, the company's leaders made it possible for customers to order movies online. Later, Netflix took the concept a step further by becoming a streaming platform.The good part about this exercise is that you don't need the resources of Disney or Netflix to do it. You just need to remain open-minded.4. Take nothing off the tableTo be sure, some of the responses you'll get when you go through the rule-breaking experience will seem strange and perhaps even shocking. Dig around for the truth, though. It's often buried deep within off-the-wall suggestions.


In the 1960s, a small company in Great Britain that made drinking glasses had a big issue. The company needed more production and less rampant product breakage. To figure out what was happening, the leadership team observed the packing operations. They found that the employees systematically packed 12 glasses in two layers in one cardboard box. Separating the glasses were newspapers. And guess what? The workers were spending a lot of time reading the newspapers and not concentrating on the quality of their work.Related: 5 Steps to Creatively Solving Business ProblemsThe unspoken ""rule,"" therefore, was that everyone was diving into the newspaper first and their jobs second. To break this rule, someone suggested that the employees shouldn't be able to see anything. If they couldn't see, they couldn't read the paper. It was a horrible idea until someone else used it as a springboard: Why didn't the company hire visually impaired individuals? Aha. The company moved forward, upping its production, lowering prices and receiving a salary subsidy for hiring people with disabilities.The point is that you can't keep trying to innovate the same way you've always done. It's just not going to work, and you'll waste even more precious time. Instead, infuse a sense of playfulness into your innovation practices. Write some rules. Pose some ""What If?"" questions. Then, break the status quo. The moment you take these steps, you'll start seeing more imagination from your team and less resistance to change.

85,3 Leadership Traits That Make You Easy to Follow,"Nov 15, 2023",Mary Banks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/top-3-traits-that-every-leader-should-have/465029,"
As an admissions counselor and former Dean of Students at Columbia Business School, my eyes and ears were always searching for someone in the cohort who was prepared to take on a leadership role. While I encountered many with the loudest voices and forceful personalities, very few had that ephemeral aura that said, ""Come with me, we will be successful."" To me, that's a true leader. Having met and worked with many such leaders, I recognized that this type of influential leadership often comes with three powerful traits — humility, fearlessness and a touch of madness.1. HumilityHumility is not a throwaway adjective; rather, it's tied to understanding who you are as a person. This self-awareness and connection to your core beliefs allows you to be aware of your insecurities. This is why humble leaders can admit mistakes and take responsibility for their actions. They are not vying to be the smartest person in the room; rather, they search for and recognize good ideas — another admirable trait of great leaders. This leadership characteristic is often considered subservient but is actually reflective of strength.Humility can inspire trust, cooperation and commitment, which you need if you want others to follow your lead. Further, leadership isn't any longer about leading from the front. It's rather about having the shrewdness and empathy to take people along.



The military is known to produce exemplary leaders. Mark Milley is a recently retired United States Army General who was not afraid to apologize on national television in 2020 when he was the senior most U.S. general. His apology for appearing in a photo-op with then-President Donald Trump following the forceful dispersal of peaceful protesters did not diminish his leadership or credibility. Rather, it sent a message to his junior officers that anyone can make a mistake; your attitude after that shows what kind of a leader you are.Related: The 8 Signs of a Bad Leader


2. FearlessnessFearless leaders are those who know how to problem solve. Fearlessness should not be confused with recklessness. On the contrary, fearlessness in leaders can help them remain calm and respond to challenges constructively. A lack of fear can help leaders think clearly and not panic when plans go awry. However, in a stressful situation, the mind often conjures up the worst possible scenario, which, if articulated, will change the course of action. However, authentic leaders do not act from a place of fear.Brian and I met at Columbia Business School in New York City shortly after his graduation from the Navel Academy and have remained in close touch for 25+ years. Brian was a mentor and an ethical student leader whose prior military experiences allowed him to gain the respect of his cohort, and his career vision included the likes of Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, where, once again, he took a leadership role even as the bank failed.On one occasion in 2008, when Brian was about to leave Lehman, I asked him if he was concerned that his financial risks could destroy his lifestyle. He laughed and reminded me that he was just a farm boy from Missouri who could get by with a backpack and a plan! His command of the situation was possible because of his fearlessness — he wasn't afraid to abandon a bank rife with corporate corruption and still imagine and believe in a hopeful future. This type of leader turns their vision into a reality and can influence others to embrace a future where anything is possible.Related: 7 Inspiring Traits of Compassionate Leadership


3. A touch of madnessThis leadership trait could present a slippery slope. Gone awry, madness transforms a leader into a madman like Hitler, but if understood and implemented ethically, it can generate creativity, movement, and success. As a leader, you will often face resentment and resistance to your vision. It is here that having a touch of madness will help you to remain true to yourself and believe in your ideas. With this slight craziness, leaders can actually go on to change the world — as Steve Jobs popularly quipped, ""The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.""While working on a team at a prestigious business school, I was party to a leader's vision pursued with a touch of madness. We were chasing the rankings, and to prove his point, our leader, against all odds, insisted on denying admission to a powerful political applicant, the son of NYC's royalty, who had an Ivy League BA with lackluster grades. This easily admissible applicant became an object lesson for our team's understanding of leadership. We had been eager to argue against what we considered to be more than a touch of madness on our leader's part. However, the dean's unwavering yet insightful focus on driving our rankings in a positive direction prevailed. Had we not implemented this seemingly unhinged decision, our team would have made a critical mistake: opting for a short-term solution, a one-off admit, when the long-term goal to increase selectivity was an important part of the dean's vision. We managed to gain our leader's respect in that we did not blindly implement his point of view, but followed his lead after voicing our concerns and subsequently buying into his passionate support for a long-term strategy.Final thoughtsThe definition of a good leader can vary significantly based on many factors — geography, work culture, age and gender. But once we begin to view leadership from a humanistic point of view, we will note that the one common denominator among all leaders is their ability to influence people to follow them. If you want to become this type of leader, the three traits of humility, fearlessness and a hint of madness must be present for you to achieve your goal. These attributes will allow people to see your authentic yet courageous self and make it inevitable that they will lend their trust and follow your lead on even the most difficult journeys.

86,Celebrating NetSuite's 25th: SuiteWorld Highlights Innovation and Business AI Insights for Entrepreneurs,"Nov 13, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/celebrating-netsuites-25th-suiteworld-highlights/465306,"
Sometimes what happens in Vegas can't stay in Vegas. Here's why:I recently spoke at SuiteWorld in Las Vegas, Oracle NetSuite's largest annual gathering of the NetSuite community.This was an exciting event for me because it was my first time talking about the business applications of artificial intelligence in front of a crowd. When asked about the risk of AI taking over people's jobs I replied, ""You need to have natural intelligence in order for artificial intelligence to work"".



I probably could have thought of a better way to say that, but you get the point. It's not just the access to powerful tools that leads to extraordinary outcomes, it's the strategic application of them.During this event I was able to catch up with Evan Goldberg, Founder & EVP of Oracle NetSuite, as well as one of their many clients, Dude Products.I'll share my main takeaways below.Photo courtesy of Oracle NetSuite. NetSuite's 25th Anniversary CelebrationFun fact, many believe NetSuite might have been the first company to coin the term 'cloud-based' in relation to business software.NetSuite was started in 1998 by Evan Goldberg. Back then, the company was called NetLedger, representing the concept of an online general ledger. It was the pioneer in providing internet-based business management applications to its users and is regarded as the first cloud computing software company.


But that wasn't the only competitive advantage they developed.From inception, NetSuite was primarily meant to be a browser-based program. And although this is rather common today, it was a unique differentiator at the time. The goal was to make it so that just by logging into a browser a user could easily access the tool and their data.Conversely, most of their rivals ran on a desktop software that needed to be manually downloaded and installed. This unique differentiator became a tipping point as offering real-time information for all users led to the company's rapid and steady growth.Although things are clearly going well, Evan shared one piece of advice he would have given himself 25 years ago:


""The advice that I give myself is that our customers are our biggest asset, and that this is not about technology for technology's sake. It's about the customers.""Goldberg shares how they've continued this process over the years.""We now have a really great discipline around how we build new products and new parts of our product. We use design thinking, which has many stages of empathy and ideating. We've learned how to listen to our customers better over 25 years. So that's what I would have been encouraging myself to do is to just as soon as you can, deeply understand your customers.""This is sound advice for any entrepreneur at any stage. If you want to build a better product, just listen to your customers.


How DUDE Wipes has grown with NetSuiteToday, NetSuite has over 37,000 global customers. One customer I spoke to at the event was Dude Products, a flushable toilet wipes company.Greg Brown, VP of Operations at Dude Products, shared how NetSuite allows them to keep the profits soaring with a relatively small team.""NetSuite solves a lot of operational and accounting challenges. We're on track to do over $100 million this year, and we're only 17 people. That's not to say that we're going to stay that small because we're gonna grow, but a lot of that is due to the streamline processes that we get out of a tool like NetSuite. It creates visibility, organizes data and allows us to not to worry about entering things manually.""Greg is well aware of the downfalls that come with overhiring. He spoke to his experience at a previous startup.


""We had like 10 people that we'd throw at one problem."" As you can imagine, this is very costly for a growing startup. He continued, explaining the cost benefits: ""After NetSuite, we were able to not have to hire right away. It's the fact that you don't need to keep throwing people at problems. You can now start letting the tool work for you, so it's a headcount savings.""How can you apply this to your business? When faced with a new challenge, consider leveraging technology as the first solution.What's next for NetSuite?As mentioned, I was at SuiteWorld to speak about AI innovations for businesses. I asked Evan Goldberg for his perspective on that, as well and how AI ranks as a priority for NetSuite.""I've wanted to use AI to provide sort of intelligent assistance at NetSuite for many years. And it looks to me that with some of the advances that we're seeing in generative AI as well as other forms of AI that the technology is here for us to do that way better than we ever had the opportunity to do before.""


But, staying true to the mission, Goldberg stated that this is not about using technology just because it's available. Instead, he's focused on the customer experience.""Another key priority for us is the overall business user experience, which of course, AI is a part of revolutionizing. Making business applications more approachable, easier to use, more enjoyable to use, is a really critical priority for us.""Recognizing people are sometimes forced to use technology at their job, Evan's goal is to make technology a seamless, helpful integration.""We really want it to seem like an enhancement to your job, that you have the opportunity to use these powerful applications. Again, backed by AI.""

88,People Are Buying More Experiences Than Things. I Tried the Viral Brand That Wants to Change the Way We Hear Them.,"Oct 18, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/i-tried-viral-brand-loops-new-earplugs-heres-how-it-went/463843,"
We're living in an experience economy. Increasingly, people who have to choose between a material good, like a new pair of shoes, or an experiential one, like a ticket to a concert, opt for the latter, according to analysis from McKinsey & Company.Why? Millennials are now the largest spending cohort, and several factors motivate their investment in experiences — including the overall pursuit of happiness, per the data. And spending on experiences over possessions does lead to more immediate happiness, research from the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin found.""Think about it: When you ask older people what matters most in life, it's always the moments they've shared and the bonds they've formed that light up their memories, not the things they've bought,"" says Loop Earplugs co-founder Maarten Bodewes.



""We tried every earplug on the market. And we were always left wanting more.""Bodewes and his co-founder Dimitri O have been friends since childhood and share a ""love of nightlife and live music."" They also both suffer from tinnitus, a ringing or buzzing noise in one or both ears that can result from regular exposure to loud sounds.


""In search of a solution, we tried every earplug on the market,"" Bodewes recalls. ""And we were always left wanting more. No single earplug could deliver protection, comfort and style. Feeling frustrated and inspired, we left our stable careers behind to embark on a new adventure.""So, they founded Belgian direct-to-consumer brand Loop in 2016 and dove into the experiential space. Loop primarily catered to concert and festival-goers and was recognized by The New York Times for making ""the best earplugs for concerts."" Then the pandemic hit. With large gatherings on pause, the co-founders ""had to get creative,"" so they focused on expanding their fanbase to include consumers in search of better sleep, focus and more.Related: Use Tradition and Ritual to Thrive In the Experience EconomyLoop's product line now boasts earplugs to help people ""live life at their volume,"" no matter what that looks like. ""Experience"" reduces noise without sacrificing sound quality and is well-suited for live music and events; ""Engage"" takes the edge off at social gatherings (or while parenting); and ""Quiet"" blocks out noise for deep sleep.


Earlier this month, the brand unveiled its latest offering: Loop Switch, a three-in-one earplug set that allows users to toggle between Experience, Engage and Quiet modes with just the flip of a switch. ""With Switch, you're the maestro of your auditory universe,"" Bodewes says. ""You can fine-tune your hearing protection throughout the day with a simple, tactile twist — offering three distinct attenuation levels, each with its own unique acoustic flavor. Total confidence and control, no matter the day you're having. Whether you're eavesdropping on conversations (17 dB SNR), jamming to your favorite tunes (21 dB SNR), or seeking serenity and focus (25 dB SNR), we've got you covered.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Loop Earplugs.""Although I could still hear diners who were an arm's length away speaking, their conversation was muted, and distant background noise almost undetectable.""A couple of weeks before Switch's launch, I had the opportunity to put all of Loop's earplugs to the test during an evening in New York City. Each pair comes in various colors — from neutral blacks to trendy rose golds — and has four different sizes, making it easy for users to find their perfect fit.


First up was the Engage, which I tried at a lively Mexican restaurant in the Theater District. Engage provides up to 16 dB (SNR) of filtered noise reduction; in practice, that made it easier to focus on the conversation with my fiancé across the table. Although I could still hear diners who were an arm's length away speaking, their conversation was muted, and distant background noise in the lofty, two-story space — music playing downstairs, sounds from the kitchen — was almost undetectable. The Switch setting provided the same level of comfort and noise reduction too.Related: Why Your Business Needs to Prepare for the Metaverse | EntrepreneurNext, I changed to Experience for a performance of Hamilton on Broadway. We sat just a few rows back in the orchestra, and as the cast launched into the opening number establishing Alexander Hamilton's backstory and early life, I was struck by how the music and voices came through crisply but with a softer quality overall. Like Engage dialed down environmental noise, the Experience's 18 dB of noise reduction eliminated any chatter or other sounds from the audience at large, and the Experience mode on Switch did the same.At the end of the night, I opted to try the Quiet mode on Switch to see how it might improve my quality of sleep. Despite staying in a Chelsea Hotel room that looked out onto bustling West 23rd Street on a Friday night, the Quiet setting on Switch fulfilled its promise, reducing up to 26 dB of noise for a restful night's sleep.


""Increasingly, we develop earwear that responds to specific customer needs. In the case of Switch, that was a totally seamless user experience.""Though it might seem like Switch is a replacement for the brand's other products, Bodewes stresses that it ""builds on"" the rest of Loop's product portfolio. ""Increasingly, we develop earwear that responds to specific customer needs,"" he explains. ""In the case of Switch, that was a totally seamless user experience.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Loop Earplugs. 


To date, the brand that's ""all about innovation"" has sold more than five million earplugs globally, in the U.S. and over 150 other countries. It saw 350% year-over-year growth in 2022 and has plans for 10 product launches this year alone, according to Bodewes. The co-founder also emphasizes that the company's only as strong as its talent — and it's currently looking to add 50 people to its team of 200 by the end of the year.Related: Not Sure How to Grow Your Team? Focus on These 3 Things.""We want to empower people to choose how they experience the world around them without sacrificing the things they love doing,"" Bodewes says.

We're on a mission to amp up your senses, so every moment feels like an upgrade, and you feel like your best self.""Loop Earplugs provided the products and experiences described in this story.

89,The Hidden Benefits of Business Failure: My Personal Experience,"Oct 12, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-hidden-benefits-of-business-failure-my-personal/459726,"
I don't believe people when they say ""I have no regrets.""I think what they mean to say is ""I'm happy with where I'm at in life, and my experiences made me who I am.""But is it possible to be happy about going through bad experiences? It is once you learn how to turn setbacks into opportunities.



And fortunately, it's not too late for you to reframe your experiences - even the bad ones - into opportunities for growth. I'll share a few examples from my own life and how you can apply the lessons learned as well.The missed funeralWhen I first moved to Brooklyn I only had one relative here, my dad's uncle. We weren't super close but I'd stop by to visit him occasionally.He passed away six years ago and I was unable to attend his funeral, even though it took place here in Brooklyn.Why? Because I was teaching a one-week Digital Marketing course on behalf of a company I partnered with.Not only did that course pay me $8k per week, but the students would often hire me for independent consulting as well. I was afraid of attending the funeral because I knew missing a day would seriously disrupt the class I was teaching and the company would need to find a replacement at the last minute.At the time, teaching that course brought in over $100k per year so I was afraid of getting permanently replaced.


I felt guilty for missing his funeral, but I was also angry at myself for being so vulnerable and desperate. I couldn't believe that one opportunity had so much power over my time and financial security.That frustration pushed me to make a bold decision, I gave up that $100k per year position. Instead, I learned how to make money and land clients through speaking, networking and content creation.Was it harder? Yes, at first. But I had much more freedom and picked up lessons that I could share with other emerging entrepreneurs. And as you may have noticed, I no longer offer Digital Marketing services. Instead, I help people overcome setbacks, embrace opportunities and perform at their highest level.None of this would have been possible if the sting of missing my uncle's funeral didn't push my career in a different direction.


Lesson learned: You need to have multiple revenue sources. Don't rely too heavily on one client or revenue stream. There's a freedom that comes with diversifying.The missed graduation My son, Trevor, graduated from preschool and his teachers organized an event to celebrate. I attended, watched his performance, but had to leave a bit early.Why? Because I had to take a sales call.This is a tough situation for any parent to be in. You want to spend time with your child, but you also need to work so you can provide for your child. In this case I tried to do both so I rushed home to take the call.


The person I talked to was nice, but they weren't even halfway serious about working with me. About two minutes into the call I could tell they were just trying to get free advice.Again, I felt guilty for missing part of my son's celebration, but I was also mad at myself for being on a sales call in the first place.Here's why. I don't like taking sales calls with people who just want to pick my brain, I like helping people who are ready to put in the work needed to level up.That's when I decided to hire Shandel Shand to take all my sales calls going forward. Based on your feedback, she's amazing. And based on the results she's delivered, it was one of the best business decisions I've ever made.


I can now spend more time with my family while still supporting entrepreneurs who are committed to partnering with me and growing their business.Lesson learned: You can't do it all on your own. Outsource, automate or eliminate tasks that aren't aligned with your zone of genius. You'll make more money and have more time for the people and experiences that matter most.The missed opportunityA few years ago I was delivering a keynote at Amazon here in New York City. About 500 people attended, but two of them stood out to me in particular.One of the attendees brought her child, the kid was about three years old. Super cute, but super loud too. During my presentation the child was constantly giggling, screaming and sniffling.


Eventually, the woman and her child left. The majority of attendees were relieved, but I felt regret.Reason being. I have a bunch of kids too! I know how hard it is when you're trying to do something for yourself and take care of your kid. Remember? I just talked about this during my son's graduation story.And I also know saying ""Shhhh"" doesn't seem to quiet them down as much as you might hope. So instead of ignoring the noisy kid, I should have acknowledged them both. I should have said I'm glad you choose to advance your business AND be with your kid as opposed to choosing between the two.Tough experience, but I learned from my mistake. Now when I'm on stage I consistently interact with the crowd. And this audience engagement has led to me landing even more paid speaking gigs.


But I took it a step further during a recent event. Instead of just ending with a Q&A session I brought people on stage for live coaching. The result? Attendees paid me on the spot for consulting since they knew I could help with their specific needs, I wasn't just reading off my slides.Lesson learned: People give you opportunities because they feel connected to you. So don't get so caught up communicating with your audience that you forget to connect. Consistently engage with them on social media, have ad hoc conversations and support their work as well.Next steps:Ready to discover more tips and tools to help you overcome setbacks, seize opportunities and perform at your highest level?

90,These Co-Founders Who Bet Big on Foodies Raised $133 Million to Fund Their Innovative Idea — and It's Helping Restaurants Nationwide,"Oct 10, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/goldbellys-founders-bet-on-foodies-and-it-paid-off-big/463160,"
Goldbelly co-founder and chief product officer Vanessa Ariel grew up in Venezuela and moved to the U.S. when she was 18, so she's well-acquainted with ""food nostalgia"" — the hankering for a favorite dish that can't be found where you are. In Venezuela, ""Our no. 1 comfort food is an arepa,"" Ariel tells Entrepreneur. ""An arepa is so comforting that you eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. You can stuff it with meat, you can stuff it with veggies, you can stuff it with cheese, it doesn't matter. You can eat this at 3 a.m. — you can eat it at 3 p.m. And it is incredible.""Her husband and co-founder, Joe Ariel, was familiar with food nostalgia too, in a different way. Born and raised in New York, he attended college in Nashville, and when he returned to his home state, he couldn't find the Southern cuisine he'd come to love. ""We were dating at the time,"" Ariel recalls, ""and he would always talk about these foods and how he would pay anything to get these foods here so that I could try them. So it went from this beautiful, What if we could do this? to making it into a reality.""""It felt like a very ambitious idea,"" Ariel adds, ""but also like the future."" The duo was confident a platform of its kind would exist one day — so why not be the ones to make it happen?



Back then, in 2012, Ariel didn't necessarily make the connection between her and Joe's experiences of missing their favorite foods. But more than a decade after they and co-founders Joel Gillman and Trevor Stow began building the business that would grow into a food-delivery platform with nationwide reach and millions of customers, she acknowledges the parallel — and sometimes finds it hard to believe that their big dream turned into an even bigger success. To date, Goldbelly has raised $133 million and boasts more than 1,000 restaurants on its site.Related: 15 Strategies for Quickly Expanding Your Business | Entrepreneur


One restaurant on the platform that hits particularly close to home is Doggi's Arepa Bar based in Miami, Florida. ""There's never a time that I have an arepa that I don't cry,"" Ariel says. ""One hundred percent of the time, I cry. It reminds me of my home, of my parents, of my grandmother who made me arepas every single day. And so, for the first time, I was able to experience this food nostalgia just through one of my own foods that I grew up eating, which I never had the opportunity to do until now.""It's Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15-October 15), and Goldbelly is celebrating with a collection featuring acclaimed Hispanic chefs and food makers ""shipping unforgettable restaurant experiences to your door"" — now and year around. Food Network star Aarón Sánchez of New Orleans-based Johnny Sanchez, Chef Arnaldo Richards of Houston-based Picos Mexican Restaurant and Fany Gerson of Brooklyn-based La Newyorkina are among some of those highlighted.""I got a lot of inspiration from the fashion industry, which photographs items in such a beautiful, aspirational way.""Goldbelly's road to success wasn't always smooth, but the business got an early break when it was accepted into Y Combinator in 2013. Goldbelly had already gained some traction, ""but Y Combinator [created a] support system for us,"" Ariel says. ""It made it feel less lonely to be entrepreneurs. We were paired with other people that were building companies in different industries that were facing similar challenges. So we got to learn from conversations that we were having with our peers.""


The funding from Y Combinator allowed Ariel to quit her job and work on the startup full-time. With a background in UI/UX design, branding and ecommerce, she had a clear vision for a marketplace where people could order the best foods to be shipped nationwide. But she also recognized a significant problem from the start: To work, the platform ""needed to be a visual experience"" — yet most restaurants didn't have photography fit for Goldbelly's purposes.Related: 7 Ways to Improve Online Engagement With Visual Content""Most restaurants had photos of their dishes that just came out of the oven, that were styled at their restaurants, that had all of this dishware, or stuff that was not really polished or aspirational,"" Ariel explains. ""But I got a lot of inspiration from the fashion industry, which photographs items in such a beautiful, aspirational way. They show you how to wear it. They show you how to include it in your daily life.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Goldbelly. Testing photography in the early days. 


It took a couple of years to strike the perfect balance and ""tell the right story,"" which gave people an accurate picture of what they'd receive, didn't make Goldbelly look like a recipe site and kept everything aspirational. At the time, it was challenging to depict assembly (but not cooking), though the practice is common within the growing meal-kit industry today, Ariel says.""We weren't the most convenient. We weren't the cheapest. But what we are and have always been is the best.""When the co-founders returned to New York, another hurdle awaited them: pitching investors. With the vast array of cuisines available in the city, it was difficult for some of them to see the value in Goldbelly's offering. The company doesn't limit food options based on location and reduces the friction and complexity of ordering out of state.""Our sweet spot is focusing on the foods people love the most,"" Ariel says. With just a few clicks, customers can order pizza from Lou Malnati's in Chicago or smoked brisket from Terry Black's Barbecue in Austin and find them at their doorstep courtesy of FedEx or UPS in a matter of days. But the service isn't inexpensive either; the Terry Black's offering comes with four to five pounds of brisket and costs about $250.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Goldbelly. Bartolini's Pizza.Related: Are You Reducing Friction For Your Sales Team? If Not, Here's Why.""[New York investors] thought about it as a commodity business,"" Ariel explains. ""They were thinking about food delivery, like how to get [it] to you. The nearest, fastest [delivery] to your office or home. And we were so the opposite of that: We weren't the most convenient. We weren't the cheapest. But what we are and have always been is the best.""Goldbelly's growth over the years has proven its model, but perhaps the greatest testament to its necessity and success came during the pandemic when customers craved the comfort their favorite foods could provide and restaurants struggled to maintain revenue. At the time, Goldbelly ""was bursting at the seams on the customer side and the merchant side,"" Ariel recalls. The company gained a million new customers in 2020 and saw annual sales jump 300% compared to 2019.


""We want to help you discover a dish that you never knew existed, through something else that you already love and that you've been in your entire life.""Next up? Goldbelly plans to use AI to recommend foods and help people find new favorites, taking inspiration from music streaming services like Spotify.""Music and food are very similar in the sense that it's through food and music you can relive a moment, celebrate something, that you can [create] a mood, show someone affection,"" Ariel explains. ""Music streaming services have [broken open] the discovery experience. That is something that can be directly applied to food. So we are experimenting with AI to help people find foods from their past. We want to help you discover a dish you never knew existed through something else you already love and have your entire life.""Related: JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon Says AI Leads to 3.5-Day Work WeekImage Credit: Courtesy of Goldbelly. And once people reconnect with foods from their past, Goldbelly's there to make them easy to enjoy. Just consider Ariel's beloved arepas: They're delicious, but putting them together can be ""intimidating,"" she says — and it's ""the combination of ingredients that makes an arepa special.""""The fact that I can go to Goldbelly and get a kit that gives me the exact kind of meat that is shredded the way it needs to be, that is seasoned the way it needs to be, the exact kind of cheese, the exact kind of beans that my grandmother [made], the fact that I can get this in a kit, I cry every single time,"" Ariel says. ""And I know this kit wouldn't exist had we not come up with this company.""

Howdy, entrepreneurs! If you're all cozy in your comfort zone, relishing past successes, here's a wake-up call: Extinction could be looming. Time to shake things up! You heard that right. Complacency, that wicked wolf in sheep's clothing, can slaughter your business faster than you can say ""Netflix.""Now, pull up a chair, grab a mug of your strongest Joe, and prepare to learn how innovation is your only lifeline in this bloodthirsty, ever-evolving business arena.Because this is what you need to survive.Related: Complacency Kills Your Business. Here's How to Fight It.Comfort zone: Your business's deathbedGot a well-oiled business machine running smoothly? Congrats! Now, forget about resting on those laurels. The comfort zone, my friends, is where innovation goes to die, dreams get strangled, and businesses bite the dust.



Why so? Because the market doesn't care about your past glories. Customers always look for the next big thing — faster, better, cooler. If you don't keep up, you'll end up like Blockbuster — a relic in the entrepreneurial graveyard, remembered only as a cautionary tale.Remember, your competition isn't sleeping. They're plotting, scheming and innovating. While you're cruising on autopilot, they're out there hustling. So, dust off those cobwebs of complacency, and rev up your innovation engines.The ""innovate or die"" business mantraInnovation isn't a fancy buzzword to throw around in board meetings. It's the lifeblood of modern businesses. To illustrate, let's rewind to the glorious '90s. Remember Kodak? It was the darling of the photography industry. But when digital came knocking, Kodak clung to its film empire. Result? A swift and embarrassing downfall.Fast-forward to today. Look at the tech titans — Apple, Amazon, Tesla. They're always pushing boundaries, forever in beta mode. That's why they're the apex predators in the business jungle.

How does one cultivate this elusive beast? Buckle up, because we'll embark on a no-nonsense, down-to-earth, practical guide.1. Embrace failure as a stepping stone


That's right. Failure isn't the enemy; it's a critical part of the innovation process. Ever heard of WD-40? That ""40"" stands for the 40 attempts it took to get the formula right. Embrace failure, learn from it, and charge ahead.2. Foster diversity and inclusionDo you want fresh ideas? Start by getting fresh perspectives. Foster a culture that embraces diversity and inclusion. Hire people who look, think and experience life differently from you. Their unique perspectives can lead to breakthrough innovations.3. Encourage curiosity and questioning


Create an environment where every question is welcome and curiosity is cherished. Remember, every innovation starts with a question. So, encourage your team to ask questions without any fear.4. Promote a risk-taking cultureInnovation thrives on risks. When teams fear consequences, bold ideas fade. Dare to venture for success! You must cultivate an atmosphere where calculated risk-taking is encouraged and rewarded. The next groundbreaking idea might just be lurking in one of those risks!5. Invest in continuous learning and development


Innovation thrives in an environment where learning is continuous. Equip your team with the latest skills and knowledge related to your industry. Get them excited about workshops, seminars and courses. Create a supportive space for growth, learning and personal development.6. Collaborate beyond your wallsInnovation doesn't happen in silos. Collaborate with other businesses, universities or research institutions. You never know where the next big idea might come. These partnerships can bring fresh insights and invigorate your team with renewed enthusiasm.7. Provide time for creative thinking


The daily grind can often stifle creativity. Encourage your team to take time off their routine tasks for creative thinking. This ""innovation time"" can be used to brainstorm new ideas, explore new technologies or simply think about better ways to perform their duties.8. Implement a good idea management systemTo nurture innovation, you need a system to collect, analyze and implement ideas from your team. An efficient idea management system ensures that no good idea goes unnoticed. It also encourages your team to contribute their ideas, knowing they will be considered seriously.9. Celebrate success, learn from failures


When an innovative idea works, celebrate it. If it doesn't work out, embrace the lesson. Acknowledge and celebrate your team's innovative ideas, regardless of the result. This not only motivates them but also signals that you value innovation.10. Lead by exampleAs a leader, you influence your organization's atmosphere.

We often elevate inventors like Edison, Ford and Musk to almost mythical status, attributing seemingly impossible mental powers to them. We imagine some lone genius churning away in a cluttered garage, conjuring up the next big thing.In reality, most groundbreaking changes don't come from inventing something out of thin air; they emerge from optimizing, scaling and rethinking what's already out there. Case in point: Steve Jobs didn't invent the mobile phone or the computer, but he innovated and revolutionized how we interact with these devices.When asked about his approach to innovation, Jobs had a simple answer: ""Start with the customer experience and work backward from there."" He wasn't trying to push fancy new technology down the market's throat; he focused on what was missing in the user experience and worked backward from there.

Look to the North Star: Your customerMaking your customer the North Star of your business strategy makes you far more likely to succeed in today's competitive marketplace. Innovation isn't just a one-time, instantaneous thing; it's an ongoing process that continually aligns your business with your customers' evolving needs and wants.


Steve Jobs hit the nail on the head when he said, ""Start with the customer experience and work backward from there."" Why? Because if you're not laser-focused on what your customers truly need, you're not just missing an opportunity — you're risking your business.But it's not a time to hit the panic button; it's a wake-up call. This is your chance to pivot and take your business from overlooked to overbooked. The name of the game is customer-centric innovation. Let's dig into the nitty-gritty strategies that can transform your customer experience from 'meh' to 'marvelous.'Related: How to Tap Into Innovation, the Most Essential Part of Your Entrepreneurial JourneyUncommon tactics for true innovationTap Into Unconventional Feedback Channels


Ethnographic Studies: Send a team to observe how your product or service is used in real-world conditions. Take note of pain points that may not be explicitly stated in other customer reviews.Customer Diaries: Ask a sample of customers to maintain a diary focused on your product or service, detailing their daily experiences and frustrations.NPS+: Beyond the regular Net Promoter Score surveys, ask those who gave you low scores to join a quick chat to elaborate on their issues.Dig Deeper Into AnalysisSentiment Analysis on User Reviews: Use AI tools to scan reviews for emotional tone. It gives you more context than just ""positive"" or ""negative.""Predictive Analytics: Use machine learning to predict customer behavior based on their interactions with your product. This can help you innovate proactively rather than reactively.Eye-Tracking Studies: If you're in the digital space, eye-tracking can help you understand what grabs attention on your website or app and why.Hands-On InnovationCustomer Co-Creation: Invite customers to participate in ideation or co-design sessions. Offer generous incentives for their participation. Their insights could lead you to innovate in ways you hadn't considered because you're looking at your business from your customers' perspective.Hackathons: This deserves an explanation. A hackathon is essentially an intense brainstorming event where developers, designers, and other stakeholders come together to solve specific problems or build something new quickly — often within 24 to 48 hours. Here, ""hack"" means exploratory programming, not illegal activities. It's a fantastic environment for creativity and innovation, as people often step out of their usual roles and collaborate in ways they wouldn't in a typical workday.Shadow Boards: Create a board of younger employees or those lower in the hierarchy but close to everyday problems. Ask for their insights into gaps, issues and overlooked opportunities. They might see things that C-level execs might overlook.Agile and BeyondObjectives and Key Results (OKRs): If you're looking to stir the innovation pot, OKRs can serve as your roadmap and measuring stick. They ensure everyone is purposefully aligned but free in approach, which is a sweet spot for breakthrough thinking. This approach ensures everyone is working toward the same objectives, fostering a culture of accountability and alignment. Use this framework to keep teams aligned and focused on innovation-driven goals.Skunk Works Team: When it comes to fueling innovation, you've got to think about building a Skunk Works Team. This isn't your run-of-the-mill project group; it's a hand-picked, cross-functional dream team laser-focused on shaking things up. Have a dedicated, cross-functional team focused entirely on innovation, operating with different rules than the rest of the organization to expedite creativity.By implementing these unconventional strategies, you're going beyond the obvious to make your business an innovation powerhouse. Sure, you still need to listen, identify gaps and act. But these advanced tactics put a spin on the how, making the whole process far more robust and effective.


Innovation isn't just about making something new; it's about improving something. Whether tweaking your service offering, creating a more user-friendly product, or simply finding a new way to meet customer needs, it's all about filling those gaps. You don't have to be an Edison or a Ford to be an innovator. You just need a keen eye, an open ear, and the courage to take risks. Innovation isn't about inventing the wheel; it's about reimagining how it can roll more efficiently and improve lives.

94,The Man Who Invented a Technology Used Billions of Times a Day Doesn't Get Credit for It. Now He's Setting the Record Straight.,"Sep 18, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/the-barcode-inventor-didnt-get-credit-now-hes/458787,"
Today, most people take their checkout experience at the supermarket for granted. They push up their carts, unload their groceries and watch as the cashier scans item after item. It just makes sense, so much that older generations hardly remember the days when products were stamped with prices to be rung up manually, and younger ones rarely consider a world where that was the norm.That's because the Universal Product Code (UPC) — the barcode used on every product in grocery and retail stores all over the globe — changed everything 50 years ago. Barcodes are scanned billions of times each day, and award-winning engineer Paul McEnroe, who spent more than two decades in leadership roles at IBM, assembled and led the team that transformed the technology from an idea into the reality that endures.But McEnroe's role in developing the barcode hasn't been fully acknowledged. The UPC's unpatented technology is in the public domain, so McEnroe earns no royalties from the invention, and a quick Google search for ""who invented the barcode"" turns up a Wikipedia page lauding someone named Norman Joseph Woodland.



So, what happened?It's a big question that McEnroe is eager to answer in his memoir The Barcode: How a Team Created One of the World's Most Ubiquitous Technologies, forthcoming from Silicon Valley Press on September 19.Image credit: Courtesy of Smith PublicityRelated: How Entrepreneurial Creativity Leads to Innovation | EntrepreneurEntrepreneur sat down with McEnroe ahead of the memoir's publication to learn more about how the UPC came to be, where the confusion over its inventor stems from and what advice he'd give young leaders who want to change the world like he and his team did so many years ago.""We could come up with some kind of a symbol to be read optically or magnetically.""It all started in 1969. IBM wanted to explore growth opportunities and buy startups, but the company was told it wouldn't succeed. ""Everybody important, all the inventors and so on, are going to quit the next morning because they don't want the white shirts, blue coats, red ties and black wingtip shoes that was the culture of [IBM at] the time,"" McEnroe says.Determined to innovate despite that reputation, IBM ""decided to paint an imaginary red line"" around part of the company and charge McEnroe with leading it — so he did. The Dayton, Ohio native grew up ""in the shadow of the National Cash Register Company,"" which had a monopoly on checkstands worldwide, and he knew there was a better way to do the ""big, old, cast-iron cash register's job.""People in the supermarket and retail sectors agreed. There was a common refrain: We need to do a better job of inventory control. We're spending a tremendous amount of money. Marking the price on every item in the store takes a lot of time, and as soon as we mark the prices, they're wrong.McEnroe was well aware of technologies that could address the problem. ""We could come up with some kind of a symbol to be read optically or magnetically,"" McEnroe says. He and his team would do both — though the optical one ""has taken off the most.""The recently invented laser provided a directional and consistently distributed light source, and McEnroe was familiar with the technology, having used it in previous projects. The low-cost, low-power, safe option offered an opportunity to make progress on the UPC.Related: IBM Says 7,800 of Its Roles Could Be Replaced By AI | Entrepreneur""So, I went to [IBM], just like you would go to a venture capitalist today in Silicon Valley or Boston or wherever, and I proposed that we go after this business,"" McEnroe recalls, ""that we build equipment that would fit in the stores, inventory equipment that would sit in a warehouse and control equipment that would sit at the headquarters. And it would all work together.""The technology would use item identification for automatic reordering and listing on the display and cash register slip, featuring the name of the product purchased, how much it cost and any other necessary information.


McEnroe requested three years of funding from IBM: $300,000 for the first year, $1,000,000 for the second, and $3,000,000 for the third. The company agreed and asked McEnroe to do the job in North Carolina, where it had just built a plant that wasn't yet filled with production equipment. So McEnroe made the move and hired six people for his team.""I think it's been very good for society because nobody has had to pay anything for the use of the code.""The following year, in 1970, the National Association of Food Chains (NAFC) formed a committee to examine the problem of item identification, hiring consulting company McKinsey to help it do so. By 1971, McEnroe and his team had developed their code, and in 1972, the supermarket committee asked all interested companies to present proposals for how they would automate supermarkets, including item identification.Those who submitted codes had to agree to donate them to the public domain before they could be accepted, which meant no patents or royalties for their inventors. As a result, McEnroe and his team didn't expect to see any money from the UPC. ""That's the way it's worked out,"" McEnroe says. ""I think it's been very good for society because nobody has had to pay anything for the use of the code.""McEnroe and another team member named Jack Jones share the patent on the pistol-grip handheld barcode scanner, though they don't earn any royalties from it either. ""As far as I know and at least during my time, when engineers signed on with IBM they signed all the rights to any patent they may do while working for the company to the company itself, so IBM owns the patent not the inventor,"" McEnroe explains.In 1973, the committee chose McEnroe's team's code and proposal, and they shipped the first products out in 1974, though only to five supermarkets. It took several years to ""achieve a reasonable volume,"" McEnroe recalls. At that point, he left the program to work in a different part of the company. By the early 1980s, the UPC had exploded.Image credit: Courtesy of Smith Publicity""[It] couldn't have misreads and charge people the wrong price. That was the biggest single problem.""Naturally, McEnroe and his team came up against some significant challenges during the UPC's development and launch. They had to create a code that was ""robust"" enough to be read through plastic, which could be compromised by the way light shone, frost or any number of other factors. It had to work when it was pulled across the checkstand quickly and not necessarily held flat.""You didn't want the operator to even have to see the code,"" McEnroe explains. ""If she knows the codes are typically on the bottom of packages, pulls the package across, doesn't even look at the bottom of the package. So it had to be very reliable. [It] couldn't have misreads and charge people the wrong price. That was the biggest single problem.""It took McEnroe and his team two years to build the self-correcting code that could fix itself automatically in real-time.Other ""extraneous technical problems"" arose too — How to send the signal from the front of the store to the back efficiently? — but McEnroe says one of the biggest, unexpected problems was actually the technology's public reception. ""[There was] the social problem of people and organizations coming to grips with the fact that the price [was] no longer on the merchandise,"" McEnroe explains.""Labor unions were afraid that they were going to lose checkstand operator positions.""The backlash was so extreme that the UPC's public unveiling in 1974 didn't go as planned. McEnroe's chief engineer called him to say the store couldn't open. McEnroe was shocked; they'd checked the technology so often, and it was so reliable. But it wasn't a technical failure: It was a picket line.""Labor unions were afraid that they were going to lose checkstand operator positions,"" McEnroe says. ""So they picketed the store, and then 18 states passed laws against taking the price off of the merchandise or laws that made it so if you had a scanner in the store, you couldn't take the price off your merchandise.""Related: Report: AI Will Take More Jobs Away from Women Than Men


McEnroe had to travel around the country to explain the technology's benefits and safety, as operators might have to stand over the lasers for years. McEnroe knew the technology was safe; he'd brought monkeys from Africa and tested them at Stanford Research Institute.""And of course it was safe because A, [the laser] didn't come out the window, except rarely, and B, we had proved that if it did come out the window and they looked at it for several years, it still wouldn't hurt them,"" McEnroe says.""I had known his name because I had studied the history of the codes. And his name was Joe Woodland.""McEnroe built and led the team that developed the UPC, which became widely used by the 1980s and still is. But if you Google ""who invented the barcode,"" McEnroe's name is scarcely seen. Instead, a Wikipedia page cites Norman Joseph Woodland and Bernard Silver as the technology's co-creators.Why? It started with the ring of a telephone.After he and his team came up with their code, McEnroe got a call from another IBM employee based in New York. ""I had known his name because I had studied the history of the codes,"" McEnroe says. ""And his name was Joe Woodland.""On the call, Woodland reiterated that he'd invented a bullseye code for supermarkets in 1948. The code was patented in 1952, per the Smithsonian. By 1973, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) owned the patent and was one of 14 companies that submitted a code to the committee for consideration, McEnroe recalls.But there was one major issue with Woodland's code, McEnroe says: It didn't work well enough for supermarket and retail adoption.


According to McEnroe, Woodland knew it, too. ""I've studied the code that your team has come up with, and I know my code, and your code is so much better that there's no comparison,"" McEnroe remembers Woodland telling him over the phone. ""I would like to join your team. I would love to live in North Carolina and work for you and be your interface and your marketing person to market your code to the world.""Gee, what could be better than having the guy who invented the first supermarket code — but one that didn't work and had never been implemented — on your team? McEnroe thought.McEnroe did hire Woodland, who moved down to Raleigh and spent the rest of his career working on the UPC project. McEnroe acknowledges that Woodland invented the first supermarket code but maintains that ""Wikipedia just got it wrong."" ""[Woodland's code] was never used in any volume at all,"" he explains. ""Just in the test store that Kroger did in Cincinnati. I went and visited that store and saw it didn't work either. And we tested it six ways from Sunday.""Related: Can Robot Shoppers Tell If the Bananas Are Ripe? | Entrepreneur""I don't know what he told them. Whatever he told them, they actually gave him the Medal of Technology.""So why do most inquiries into the barcode's creator lead back to Woodland? McEnroe says George H.W. Bush's presidential run against Bill Clinton played a significant role.At the time, about 20 years after the UPC's development, Bush was ""not seen as coupled with the reality of the American housewife,"" McEnroe says. Most people had been using the technology for more than a decade; to present a relatable front, Bush partook in a demo run by the Super Market Institute in Florida, ""where a supermarket had been artificially set up inside of a convention center.""Bush had a chance to use a scanner on the code for the first time. ""So he got his picture taken, scanning items, and he said, 'This is amazing. It's the greatest technology I've ever seen — who invented this thing? And they said, 'Well, we don't know. Somebody from IBM,'"" McEnroe says.


Bush told them to find out who it was because he wanted to give them the National Medal of Technology. When his people called the supermarket committee, they were given the original proposal put together by Woodland. ""That's the first thing I'd asked Woodland to do as a marketing guy — not an inventor of our code, but a marketing guy — to write the proposal for the barcode,"" McEnroe explains.Woodland wrote the proposal, and his contact information was on the back in case anyone had questions. The engineering group had already been disbanded; Woodland, nearing retirement, was the last one working on the barcode. ""I don't know what he told them,"" McEnroe says. ""Whatever he told them, they actually gave him the Medal of Technology.""Related: Bill Gates Says These Tech Innovations Will Change the WorldThe Bush-Clinton race would further solidify the narrative of Woodland as the barcode inventor. As the tide turned against the incumbent, McEnroe recalls that the supermarket demo was written up in the news quite a bit, and he began to recognize a pattern in the telling of the technology's development.Typically, one paragraph would say Woodland invented the first supermarket code (""That's quite true,"" McEnroe admits). Another would describe Woodland's role in marketing and selling the code McEnroe and his team created later.""What he doesn't say is that in between the two, his code wasn't used for years and years,"" McEnroe says. ""And the other code was taken as the national standard. And it's the one that everybody's using. So the one that he promoted and the one that he was the marketing guy for was successful. And that is the universal product code; that's the vertical bar code we have today. His original code didn't go anywhere.""Woodland's patent had already expired by the time the supermarket committee convened. ""The IBM lawyers said it didn't even read,"" McEnroe adds. ""The whole method of deciphering how wide a black bar is in a white space is dramatically different. It's a technical thing, but it's dramatically different in our code [than] it was in [Woodland's] circular code.""Related: She Presented Her Life-Saving App to Tim Cook at Age 16


""This is a story that…gives you ideas about how you go about things to this day.""McEnroe recognizes there's ""a lot of misunderstanding about who did what with the code"" — and says '""it was time to get that corrected."" That's why, 50 years after the UPC's development, the engineer is publishing his memoir to help set the record straight. The book includes an appendix with documents that refute certain claims, like the misconception that IBM came up with the UPC in just a few weeks.""There are a couple books that have been written by the Super Market Institute about incorporating [the UPC] into the supermarket itself and how it affected that,"" McEnroe says. ""But this is a story that shows not only that, but also how it was created — it gives you ideas about how you go about things to this day.""McEnroe says he and his team thought the UPC might last 20 or 30 years, not as long as it has. But the UPC solved a problem that society was struggling with for some time, made checkouts work more efficiently, and was reliable and easy to implement — all things he believes contribute to a technology's longevity. Even QR codes, which allow scanning in two directions for more data, are a variation of McEnroe's code.Related: How Menu QR Codes Became an Essential Tool for Every Restaurant and BarNot surprisingly, McEnroe is often asked for his advice to young professionals who want to change the world. And perhaps the most important thing, alongside a certain amount of luck and patience? Keeping an open mind, McEnroe says — but being ""disciplined in your curiosity.""""Fifty years ago, it was a lot harder to understand what was available in the world,"" McEnroe explains. ""And nowadays, with the internet, that's a lot easier. Before, you had almost no choice but to be a degreed engineer, go to school, study at the school, go to the libraries. Now that would be fine, but you also can do a great deal of this work by using the internet and just searching things up. But you have to be careful about what you look up. Is it right, or just something somebody else wrote down?""Being part of a team and recognizing that you can accomplish more together than you can on your own is also vital, as is maintaining those relationships along the way.


""Don't burn your bridges as you go through life,"" McEnroe says. ""When you have to go back and call upon people, they're going to be happy to come and help you again. I had to do that so many times, and everybody that I called upon to help me was extremely helpful. As you're working with people when you're younger, work with them well and leave a good taste in their mouth, and then they'll help you later on.""

95,5 Ways to Cultivate a Resilient Digital Employee Experience,"Sep 13, 2023",Apu Pavithran,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-ways-to-cultivate-a-resilient-digital-employee-experience/458251,"
In an era of rapid technological advancements and an evolving workforce landscape, companies now encounter both previously unimaginable possibilities and difficulties. One of the pivotal challenges plaguing this digital landscape is ensuring a harmonious and satisfying experience for employees, regardless of their location or the devices they use. This is where a well-crafted and comprehensive digital employee experience (DEX) strategy comes into play.Related: Unhappy Customers and Employees Can Wreak Havoc on Your Business. Here's How to Make Both Happy.Understanding the essence of the digital employee experienceGone are the days when work was confined to physical office space and a standard 9-to-5 routine. Today, employees collaborate across time zones, harnessing a surfeit of devices and applications to accomplish tasks. Before we delve into the intricacies of crafting an effective strategy, we must grasp the essence of the digital employee experience.



The idea of a people-centric workspace has existed for some time. However, many business leaders and organizations still need clarification on what DEX entails. In simple terms, DEX is the accumulation of every interaction a workforce has with their company's technologies and processes. However, since every interaction impacts DEX, how can organizations enhance it?Related: 78% of Employers Are Using Remote Work Tools to Spy on You. Here's a More Effective (and Ethical) Approach to Tracking Employee Productivity.


Crafting a harmonious digital employee experience is a dance of technology, creativity and genuine care. Employees more or less want three things in terms of their digital technologies. They want technology that is simple to use, dependable and effective. However, the tricky part is balancing what employees want while maintaining a resilient security posture. Here are five steps for a harmonious digital experience strategy.Step 1: Holistic alignment with business objectivesCreating a harmonious digital employee experience begins with aligning your strategy with overarching business goals. Every digital initiative, whether it's the adoption of collaboration tools or the implementation of unified endpoint management systems, should be aligned with the company's larger purpose. This alignment ensures that the digital employee experience is seamless and contributes directly to the organization's success.It's critical to include important stakeholders from multiple divisions to accomplish this alignment. HR, IT, and upper management should collaborate to identify the most critical digital touchpoints for employees. By weaving the digital employee experience into the organization's fabric, you create a sense of purpose that resonates with every employee.Step 2: Providing a seamless onboarding experienceAn employee's experience starts from the moment they are onboarded into the company. This marks the foundation for a positive employee experience is laid. Leveraging cutting-edge solutions like Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) and Desktop as a Service (DAAS) can significantly enhance these critical phases.


UEM allows organizations to efficiently manage and secure various devices, from laptops to smartphones and tablets, from a single console. By providing a seamless and secure onboarding experience across devices, UEM facilitates a positive initial impression for new hires. Furthermore, the implementation of DAAS streamlines the deployment of virtual desktops, guaranteeing that employees enter a uniform and well-optimized workspace right from the start, regardless of their physical whereabouts. This streamlines the onboarding process and empowers remote workers to hit the ground running, eradicating any possible frustrations stemming from technical glitches.Step 3: Nurturing the anywhere work environment through remote monitoringThe modern workforce isn't confined to a single location, making the health and performance of endpoints a troublesome endeavor.UEM solutions shine in this arena by offering remote monitoring capabilities that allow IT teams to watch endpoints' health irrespective of their physical location. By proactively identifying and addressing potential issues, such as security vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks, organizations can ensure that the remote work experience remains seamless.A common pain point for employees and IT teams is the cumbersome process of resolving technical issues. Waiting for the IT helpdesk to intervene in the application or endpoint problems can lead to frustration and productivity losses. Remote capabilities allow IT teams to troubleshoot these issues irrespective of a device's location. This approach boosts productivity and demonstrates a commitment to employee well-being, reinforcing a sense of support and care.


Step 4: Empowering employees through continuous trainingEmpowerment is a cornerstone of any successful employee experience strategy. When employees are given the skills and resources to navigate digital obstacles, they develop greater independence and self-assurance in their work.Offering comprehensive training sessions on using digital tools, troubleshooting common problems, and staying vigilant against cyber threats can empower employees to take charge of their digital experiences. By fostering a culture of continuous learning, organizations not only enhance the skill set of their employees but also demonstrate a commitment to their growth and development.Related: Enough About Employee 'Engagement'! Focus on the Digital Employee 'Experience' Instead.Step 5: Measuring DEX success through comprehensive evaluationIn the realm of business, what is not measured often remains elusive. The digital employee experience is no different. Organizations must set up reliable assessment and feedback processes to assess the efficacy of the tactics they have adopted.


Surveys tailored to capture employees' sentiments provide invaluable insights into their experiences. These surveys can delve into aspects such as ease of technology usage, satisfaction with support services, and overall comfort with the digital workspace. Furthermore, leveraging tools such as End-User Experience Management (EUEM) solutions that monitor user interactions and sentiment analysis can provide qualitative feedback, real-time monitoring and a continuous benchmark system.Crucially, these measurement strategies should be accompanied by a commitment to iterate and adapt based on feedback. Continuous improvement is at the core of a harmonious DEX strategy, as it reflects an organization's genuine dedication to enhancing employee well-being and efficiency.The way forwardA harmonious DEX strategy extends beyond optimizing processes; its essence is nurturing feelings of affiliation, empowerment, and employee welfare. In an age where the virtual realm assumes an increasingly significant function in our professional lives, enterprises that give precedence to enhancing the digital employee encounter are better poised to attract, retain, and nurture a workforce that excels within this evolving digital landscape.

96,Deepfakes Are on the Rise — Will They Change How Businesses Verify Their Users?,"Sep 13, 2023",Ihar Kliashchou,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/deepfakes-are-on-the-rise-will-they-change-how/458415,"
You know how you can't do anything these days without proving who you are? Whether opening a bank account or just hopping onto a car-sharing service. With online identity verification becoming more integrated into daily life, fraudsters have become more interested in outsmarting the system.Criminals are investing more money and effort to overcome security solutions. Their ultimate weapon is deepfakes — impersonating real people using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Now, the multi-million question is: Can organizations effectively employ AI to combat fraudsters with their tools?According to a Regula identity verification report, a whopping one-third of global businesses have already fallen victim to deepfake fraud, with fraudulent activities involving deepfake voice and video posing significant threats to the Banking sector.



For instance, fraudsters can easily pretend to be you to get access to your bank account. Stateside, almost half of the companies surveyed confessed to being targeted with the voice deepfakes last year, beating the global average of 29%. It's like a blockbuster heist but in the digital realm.And as AI technology for creating deepfakes becomes more accessible, the risk of businesses being affected only increases. That poses a question: Should the identity verification process be adjusted?


Related: Deepfake Scams Are Becoming So Sophisticated, They Could Start Impersonating Your Boss And CoworkersEndless raceLuckily, we're not at the ""Terminator"" stage yet. Right now, most deepfakes are still detectable — either by eagle-eyed humans or AI technologies that have already been integrated into ID verification solutions for quite some time. But don't let your guard down. Deepfake threats are evolving quickly — we are already on the edge of witnessing persuasive samples that can scarcely arouse any suspicion, even upon deliberate scrutiny.The good news is that the AI, the superhero we've enlisted to fight against good old ""handmade"" identity fraud, is now being trained to spot fake stuff created by its fellow AI buddies. How does it manage this magic? First of all, AI models don't work in a vacuum; human-fed data and clever algorithms shape them. Researchers can develop AI-powered tools to remove the bad guys of synthetic fraud and deepfakes.The core idea of this protective technology is to be on the lookout for anything fishy or inconsistent while doing those ID liveness checks and ""selfie"" sessions (where you snap a live pic or video with your ID). An AI-powered identity verification solution becomes the digital Sherlock Holmes. It can detect both changes that occur over time, like shifts in lighting or movement, and sneaky changes within the image itself – like tricky copy-pasting or image stitching.


Fortunately, AI-generated fraud still has some blind spots, and organizations should leverage those weak points. Deepfakes, for instance, often fail to capture shadows correctly and have odd backgrounds. Fake documents typically lack optically variable security elements and would fail to project-specific images at certain angles.Another key challenge criminals face is that many AI models are primarily trained using static face images, mainly because those are more readily available online. These models struggle to deliver realism in liveness ""3D"" video sessions, where individuals must turn their heads.One more vulnerability organizations can use is the difficulty in manipulating documents for authentication compared to attempting to use a fake face (or to ""swap a face"") during a liveness session. This is because criminals typically have access only to one-dimensional ID scans. Moreover, modern IDs often incorporate dynamic security features that are visible only when the documents are in motion. The industry is constantly innovating in this area, making it nearly impossible to create convincing fake documents that can pass a capture session with liveness validation, where the documents must be rotated at different angles. Hence, requiring physical IDs for a liveness check can significantly boost an organization's security.While the AI training for ID verification solutions keeps evolving, it's essentially a constant cat-and-mouse game with fraudsters, and the results are often unpredictable. It is even more intriguing that criminals are also training AI to outsmart enhanced AI detection, creating a continuous cycle of detection and evasion.


Take age verification, for example. Fraudsters can employ masks and filters that make people appear older during a liveness test. In response to such tactics, researchers are pushed to identify fresh cues or signs of manipulated media and train their systems to spot them. It's a back-and-forth battle that keeps going, with each side trying to outsmart the other.Related: The Deepfake Threat is Real. Here Are 3 Ways to Protect Your BusinessMaximum level of securityIn light of all we've explored thus far, the question looms: What steps should we take?First, to achieve the highest level of security in ID verification, toss out the old playbook and embrace a liveness-centric approach for identity checks. What's the essence of it?


While most AI-generated forgeries still lack the naturalness needed for convincing liveness sessions, organizations seeking maximum security should work exclusively with physical objects — no scans, no photos — just real documents and real people.In the ID verification process, the solution must validate both the liveness and authenticity of the document and the individual presenting it.This should also be supported by an AI verification model trained to detect even the most subtle video or image manipulations, which might be invisible to the human eye. It can also help detect other parameters that could flag abnormal user behavior. This involves checking the device used to access a service, its location, interaction history, image stability and other factors that can help verify the authenticity of the identity in question. It's like piecing together a puzzle to determine if everything adds up.And one final tip - requesting that customers use their mobile phones during liveness sessions instead of a computer's webcam would be helpful. This is because it is generally much more difficult for fraudsters to swap images or videos when using a mobile phone's camera.


To wrap it up, AI is the ultimate sidekick for the good guys, ensuring the bad guys can't sneak past those defenses. Still, AI models need guidance from us humans to stay on the right track. But when together, we are superb at spotting fraud.

97,Are You a Disruptor or a Destructor? A Complete Guide to Innovation for Today's Leaders,"Sep 13, 2023",Scott Deming,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/disruptive-innovation-vs-destructive-innovation-a-guide/458351,"
In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, the word ""innovation"" gets thrown around quite a bit. However, it's crucial for leaders, especially those in C-suite roles, to grasp the nuanced differences between Disruptive Innovation and Destructive Innovation. Despite the similarity in names, they are not interchangeable.Several years ago, I was one of five keynote speakers at the Asian Disruptive Leadership Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The day before the event, they held a press conference with the speakers at a table and the media asking questions from the room. A young man directed a question to me. He asked, ""Mr. Deming, can you tell us the difference between disruptive and destructive innovation?"" In a few words, and more conversationally, I described it as follows.Related: Disruption vs. Innovation: Defining Success



What is disruptive innovation?Disruptive Innovation is a term coined by Clayton Christensen in 1997. It refers to a process where a smaller company, often with fewer resources, manages to challenge established industry leaders. The disruptors do this by targeting overlooked market segments or creating new markets altogether. Over time, these disruptors refine their products or services and start attracting a broader audience, eventually undermining the existing market leaders.Related: Disruption Is More Than the Buzzword It's BecomeSome examples:Amazon: Started as an online bookstore, now it's reshaping retail, logistics, cloud computing — you name it.Google: Moved from search engine to digital advertising titan, and now it's into everything from autonomous cars to healthcare.Tesla: Electric cars used to be a joke. Now, Tesla's forced the entire auto industry to go electric or go home.Uber: Decimated the traditional taxi industry by making ridesharing accessible, affordable, and convenient.Spotify: Revolutionized music consumption, shifting the focus from album sales to streaming subscriptions.Key characteristics of disruptive innovators:Targets niche markets initially.Creates accessibility, usually through lower costs or simplicity.Gradually gains market share.Alters the competitive landscape. Builds new opportunities.Adds value to the market.Promotes sustainable growth.Why these matterThese innovators didn't just create products; they created markets and shifted paradigms. They started with niche audiences and scaled up, eventually disrupting and often dominating their industries.So, the lesson here? Be the Amazon or Tesla in your space. Think about the niches that are overlooked and how you can bring them to the forefront. It's not just about technology; it's about vision and having the courage to redefine an industry.


Related: How to Reject the Status Quo and Redefine Your SuccessWhat is destructive innovation?On the flip side, Destructive Innovation refers to technologies or practices that harm or make existing models obsolete without adding significant value to the industry or consumers. In some cases, they may offer short-term gains, but the long-term ramifications could be detrimental. Destructive innovators often leave a trail of unintended consequences.Some examples:Pets.com: Sold pet supplies online, but its unsustainable business model led to its collapse and had repercussions across e-commerce.Lehman Brothers: Engaged in risky financial practices that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.MySpace: Tried to monetize too aggressively with ads, which deteriorated user experience and opened the door for Facebook.Kodak: Introduced the digital camera but failed to adapt, essentially disrupting its own film business without a sustainable digital strategy.Related: Don't Make the Same Mistake Leaders at Kodak, Blockbuster and Xerox Made When Disruption Comes to Your IndustryKey characteristics of destructive innovators:Undermines existing value networks.This could lead to job losses or reduced industry growth.Risks long-term damage.May result in ethical or social issues.Could pigeonhole you as a short-term opportunist.Offers little or no long-term value addition.Why these matterThese companies either disrupted without adding lasting value or operated in ways that had negative long-term impacts. The key takeaway here is that innovation without sustainability or ethical considerations can often lead to destructive outcomes.Understanding these examples can be a cautionary guide. It reminds us that innovation shouldn't just be groundbreaking; it must be responsible and sustainable to be truly transformative.Why the difference mattersSo, why should you care about the difference? Well, the path you choose has profound implications for your business model, market positioning, and long-term sustainability. Whether you're a seasoned executive, a budding entrepreneur or a forward-thinking sales director, understanding these terms can help you steer your company in the direction that leads to long-term success rather than a short-lived buzz.


Your choice could be the difference between leaving a legacy of growth and innovation or just becoming a cautionary tale in someone else's keynote. So, the question isn't if you should disrupt, but how will you disrupt responsibly and effectively?

98,AI Is Making Market Insights Accessible to Businesses of Any Size — Not Just the Big Names. Here's How You Can Use It.,"Sep 1, 2023",Ari Goldberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-ai-is-predicting-the-next-big-trends-in-consumer/456188,"
For decades, identifying the next big consumer trends and products was an imprecise art dominated by guesswork. Companies would spend millions on market research, only to be caught off guard by sudden shifts in public taste. It was like throwing darts blindfolded. But artificial intelligence has transformed trend forecasting from a fuzzy guessing game into a data-driven science. Artificial intelligence algorithms can now predict hot consumer products by analyzing massive datasets — articles, reviews, social media and search trends, for example — that humans can't process.This monumental shift is on par with the discovery of electricity. Companies now have predictive insights once reserved for giants like P&G or Apple. For entrepreneurs, it's like being handed the answer key before the test. Consumer trends that used to appear out of the blue can now be detected months in advance, allowing startups to launch the right products at the right time. AI turns elusive market intelligence into an actionable advantage open to businesses of any size.Related: AI Is Poised to Change How We Shop: Here's What You Need to Know

101,Why Asia is Poised to Be the Next Global Titan in Digital Finance,"Aug 24, 2023",Henri Al Helaly,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/why-asia-will-be-the-next-global-titan-in-digital-finance/457026,"
Asia, a harmonious blend of ancient civilizations, mystic traditions and ultramodern metropolises, stands at the cusp of a new era, ready to lead the fintech renaissance. Asia encapsulates an unparalleled diversity and depth in both culture and commerce.Its dynamic economies, fueled by an indomitable spirit of entrepreneurship, innovation and its embrace of cutting-edge technological advancements, position it uniquely. This continent is not merely adapting to the digital finance age; it's steering its direction, heralding a transformation that promises to redefine and reshape the global financial canvas for future generations.Related: Why Asia Continues to Dominate the Global Travel Industry



Asia's fintech landscapeThe diversity spanning from Japan's high-tech prowess to India's market enormity ensures a kaleidoscope of fintech opportunities. Each nation's unique challenges and solutions add a distinct color to Asia's fintech palette. The continent also features a rising middle class.The exponential growth of Asia's middle class, especially in countries like China, India and Indonesia, signifies an increasing demand for digital banking, contactless payments and investment platforms. This surge catalyzes fintech firms to introduce innovative products tailored to this demographic.


Three key drivers of the fintech wave in AsiaMobile penetration: In regions like Southeast Asia, smartphones have transcended luxury to become a necessity. This proliferation has ushered in a new era where financial transactions, from large-scale transfers to microtransactions, are executed at fingertips.Digital natives come of age: A vast portion of Asia's populace, especially in countries like South Korea and China, comprises millennials and Gen Z. Accustomed to technology, this cohort is pushing boundaries, seeking instantaneous and frictionless financial solutions.Government initiatives: Proactive government measures, like tax breaks for startups, grants and sandbox environments, are galvanizing the fintech environment. For instance, Hong Kong's Fintech Week showcases innovations and facilitates dialogues between regulators and entrepreneurs.Related: How to Choose the Right Fintech for Your BusinessStandout nations in Asia's fintech boomIndia: The demonetization move in 2016 became an unexpected boon for fintech. Platforms like Paytm saw a meteoric rise. Furthermore, government-backed UPI has democratized digital payments, allowing seamless transactions across different banking platforms.Singapore: Singapore's allure isn't just its strategic location; its endeavors allow businesses to test innovative products in a controlled environment.China: From street vendors to luxury boutiques, QR code payments are ubiquitous, symbolizing China's stride into a cashless society.Related: The Rapid Growth Of Fintech: A Revolution In The Payments IndustryChallenges looming on the horizonRegulatory hurdles: The kaleidoscopic regulatory landscape across Asia poses intricate challenges. While a country like Japan has embraced cryptocurrencies, others tread cautiously.Security concerns: The spate of cyberattacks and data breaches worldwide necessitates fortified security measures, urging fintech firms to prioritize user safety.Diverse markets: Tailoring solutions to resonate with varied cultural nuances and economic structures remains a formidable task for fintech enterprises.Harnessing the power of AI and big dataAsia, particularly China and Japan, is at the forefront of AI and big data research. The fintech sector stands to benefit immensely from this. Sophisticated AI-driven algorithms will help in credit scoring, allowing those traditionally underserved by the banking sector to gain access to financial services. Moreover, with big data analytics, financial institutions can derive actionable insights to tailor their products to customers better, enhancing user experiences.The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi)DeFi, or decentralized finance, is becoming a buzzword in the financial world. It seeks to create an open-source, permissionless and transparent financial service ecosystem available to everyone. Countries like South Korea and Thailand are already warming up to the idea, with local startups paving the way. Using blockchain technology, DeFi platforms in Asia could bypass intermediaries, offering users more control over their finances.Related: CBDCs Are Inevitable, and That's a Good Thing


Financial inclusion through neobanksTraditional banking infrastructures often don't cater to rural or less affluent populations. Enter neobanks: fully digital banks without physical branches. In populous countries like India and Indonesia, neobanks can be pivotal in providing financial services to the underserved, capitalizing on widespread mobile use to offer banking solutions.Green fintechAs the global focus shifts towards sustainability, green fintech will gain traction. From green bonds to sustainability-linked loans, fintech in Asia can integrate with environmental goals, aligning financial growth with ecological preservation. This convergence will cater to the eco-conscious consumer and drive long-term, sustainable financial practices.Adaptive and forward-thinking regulatory frameworks will be pivotal for fintech to flourish. Asian governments, recognizing the sector's potential, might adopt more flexible regulations, ensuring innovations aren't stifled while safeguarding consumers' interests.Asia is not merely witnessing a fintech evolution but spearheading an all-encompassing digital finance revolution. The symbiotic relationship between traditional financial systems and avant-garde technologies is crafting a rich tapestry of opportunities and advancements. The harmony between Asia's rich cultural heritage and technological innovation fosters an environment that beckons global stakeholders. The continued maturation and innovation of fintech platforms in the region signal regional and global shifts in the financial paradigm. It's clear that the future of fintech resonates with an Asian melody, and it is imperative for the global community to listen and actively engage in this transformative journey.

102,He Founded the App Parents Love for Back-to-School Season — Then Found Himself Ridiculed By Teens on TikTok. Here's How It Led to Serious Innovation.,"Aug 24, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-life360s-founder-dealt-with-teens-mocking-him-on-tiktok/457879,"
The family social networking app Life360, which relies on location-sharing to help users stay connected, is built, in part, to give parents peace of mind. So perhaps it's no surprise that the company sees an uptick in registrations and usage around this time of year with back-to-school season — and all of the anxiety that comes with it — in full swing.The company reported a roughly 30% registration jump in the weeks of August 15 and August 22 last year and another 30% increase in returning monthly active users who'd had the app for 30 days or more.Life360 co-founder and CEO Chris Hulls deferred his spot at Harvard Business School to launch the company back in 2008, initially inspired during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when so many people weren't able to find their family members.



""It was right when Facebook was getting big with the social network, [and] LinkedIn was getting big with the professional network, and everyone was trying to figure out how to bring families online. And we realized [that safety could be] the way of serving digitally native families,"" Hulls tells Entrepreneur.When Hulls approached venture capitalists about Life360, he faced criticism on two fronts: They didn't think teenagers would ever have smartphones and believed location-sharing was ""creepy."" But Hulls didn't give up. Life360 eventually got funding and became the giant is today, surpassing 50 million monthly active users earlier this year.


Even now, the company is ""overlooked"" relative to its size, Hulls says.But just a few years ago, back in 2019, a very specific subset was looking at Life360 — and at Hulls himself. Teenagers on TikTok weren't fans of the granular access Life360 gave their parents to their lives, and they had a bone to pick with its founder.Related: How to Use TikTok to Promote Your Business | EntrepreneurHulls recounts the ""funny story"" that actually led to the development of a new Life360 feature.


""His kid said, 'He's a TikTok guy.' And I was like, 'No, I don't even have TikTok.'""""The first time I heard about anything going on I was at a friend's house,"" Hulls recalls. ""He was older than me, had teenagers, and his kid said, 'He's a TikTok guy.' And I was like, 'No, I don't even have TikTok. What are you talking about?'""That's when Hulls learned he was the subject of a meme making the rounds. Teenagers wanted to know who started Life360, and once they discovered it was Hulls, they made his headshot the background of their videos while they performed skits that vilified him set to different sounds and music.Although Life360's president Alex Haro is also the company's co-founder, he wasn't caught up in the TikTok storm.Related: Blow Up On TikTok By Following These 4 Rules | EntrepreneurAt first, Hulls didn't think much of the videos, though he hoped no one would take it too far. It all just seemed like a joke. Then the teens' tactics shifted. They started leaving Life360 one-star reviews in Apple's app store, mistakenly believing their efforts could get it removed altogether.A ""tidal wave"" followed. It wasn't just teens having fun anymore — ""There was a bandwagon about how evil Life360 is, and it was actually spreading to parent influencers, and we were like, 'Okay, we need to do something here.'""""We said, 'Well, how can we demonstrate that we're here for you?'""Hulls wanted to make it clear that Life360 wasn't about ""tracking,"" though he also understood that could come off as ""corporate speak.""""Seriously, we're not a tracking app,"" Hulls says. ""Yes, it's literally maps, but when used properly, we're giving you independence, and it should actually be a way that your parents [can] give [you as a teen] more freedom.""Hulls took to TikTok Live to set the record straight and shatter the ""really straight-laced"" image people had of him. He shared stories from his past, like the time he was expelled from Catholic school, describing himself as ""the ultimate free-range kid."" He'd never thought that over-controlling parents would turn what he'd built into something so negative.""Then, as part of that just humanizing me and the company, we said, 'Well, how can we demonstrate that we're here for you?'"" Hulls recalls.


After crowdsourcing among the teens, Hulls came up with the ""Bubbles"" feature. It's an optional way to customize location sharing for your ""Circle,"" or group of users. With the ""Bubble"" in place (set for an up-to-25-mile range), only an approximate location is viewable. But the ""Bubble"" will ""burst"" in the case of a car crash or other emergency, and any group member can toggle it off if there's a safety concern.@life360ceo Bubbles demo mode is now live exclusively for TikTok users! Let us know what you think. #life360 #banlife360 #fyp ♬ Classical Music - Classical Music""Your parents can see you're still within a given region, but not fine grain,"" Hulls explains. ""[And we were] surprised at how well it worked. We were able to completely change the narrative and actually had teens advocating for us where it's like, 'Hey, don't blame Life360, blame the parents who are going overboard.'""""This is a way of graduating to the next stage of life.""Not only was the dialogue inspired by TikTok able to ""shift sentiment"" toward Life360 in a positive way, but it also served as the company's stepping stone ""into the mainstream,"" Hulls says.In fact, Hulls considers the chain of events that led to the new feature ""the biggest turnaround"" Life360's ever had. Usership's been ramping up since then, and the app is on 13% of all iPhones in the country now, Hulls says, adding that ""there aren't many apps bigger than us."" And TikTok now ""drives significant positive traffic"" for the company.What's more, a new report from Life360, which surveyed 1,200 adults across the U.S., found that 89% of Americans say their life benefits from location-sharing — and 94% of Gen Z respondents agreed. ""Safe"" is the first word that comes to mind for 66% of Gen Z when thinking about location-sharing, per the research.Life360 ""weirdly"" ended up exactly where Hulls always envisioned it might — ""but bigger."" Of course, it was more of a daily ""slog"" and less of an overnight success (""and it's still a slog every day,"" Hulls quips). But the co-founder's always been fascinated by how things can move ""slowly then all of a sudden,"" as was the case with Life360's trajectory.


Related: How to Integrate TikTok Into Your Video Marketing StrategyToday, as a parent with two daughters of his own, Hulls understands firsthand how back-to-school season is a ""new era"" full of change, one that includes additional responsibilities and privileges. Hulls is excited to see Life360 continue to play an important role in increasing independence.""We are becoming part of that rite of passage,"" Hulls says, ""where [kids are going to] get this new set of freedoms, this fancy new phone. And this is a way of graduating to the next stage of life. [Life360 is] front and center in that.""

103,3 Ways You Can Actually Use AI in Your Business (and Why You Should Still Be Careful With It),"Aug 23, 2023",Tom Livne,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/3-ways-you-can-actually-use-ai-in-your-business-and-why/456656,"
The sky appears to be the limit for the ways entrepreneurs and CEOs can incorporate generative AI tools into their workflows. The one thing you can't afford to do with generative AI is ignore it.I recently hosted a workshop for 30 early-stage CEOs to discuss ways to fuse generative AI into their business strategies. Here is some of the intel I shared, plus how you can give yourself an edge by responsibly and effectively incorporating this technology into your startup or business.Entrepreneurs wisely using generative AI can strategically implement it into their narrative and general storytelling of their companies to in turn receive higher valuations from investors as well — here's how.



Related: How AI Is Becoming a Game-Changer in Startup Fundraising1. Expand your product offerings and stay competitiveI suggest reading up on Microsoft's collaboration with OpenAI. Microsoft jumped to incorporate ChatGPT's technology into Bing and its other products. Now, its users can work more efficiently in PowerPoint and its suite of Office products. Google responded by exploring the use of generative AI to expand its search capabilities.


Software development is another key area getting gen AI attention. Gen AI is helping developers code more efficiently, predicting the next lines of code based on code already written and responding to prompts. There's a spotlight on generative AI algorithm models like Large Language Models (LLMs) that can craft text based on the user's input data.Every entrepreneur who wants to edge out the competition must find ways to apply generative AI to improve products and develop new offerings.My company, Verbit, hosted an internal hackathon to gamify identifying ways to incorporate generative AI. It helped to get greater buy-in and inspire ideas. Our hackathon uncovered 13 ways to employ more AI, including two that we're commercializing.Consider replicating this hackathon idea or encouraging brainstorms. Run them company-wide. Instead of just involving your more obvious teams, acknowledge that generative AI has the ability to impact the roles of nearly everyone. By involving less obvious stakeholders, you'll identify use cases for generative AI to disrupt processes you weren't even aware of.


Engaging your team in these ways won't just boost morale; it will release apprehension around the ""negative"" human impact of greater generative AI use. Instead, your team will be inspired by how they can apply it to expand your offerings to deliver better.Related: The Secret to How Businesses Can Fully Harness the Power of AI2. Drive employee productivityAI should be seen as a gateway to make work more meaningful and efficient, not replace jobs. Using generative AI to eliminate dreaded, time-consuming tasks will keep your employees engaged. It will grant them the ability to focus on more creative tasks they're passionate about. Employee engagement is a metric entrepreneurs can't overlook because it translates to 23% higher profitability.Since newer forms of AI are learning to be intuitive and interact naturally with humans, start by using AI that communicates with your teams and learns from their feedback to boost productivity. For example, generative AI has advanced the possibilities of working with chatbots. Teams can now summarize and pull data from chatbot-powered customer surveys and much more.


3. Predict market trends more accuratelyFor entrepreneurs to make informed decisions about investments, strategies and products, they must understand market trends. Generative AI is helping entrepreneurs gather more quality data than earlier AI forms.AI is excellent at analyzing large sets of data, but generative AI can gather insights from unstructured data, like social media posts, audio files, text and other content. To be successful, entrepreneurs must pull in this additional information accessible to them through generative AI.Generative AI can also create simulations to determine the impact of hypothetical ""what-if"" situations. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania used generative AI to simulate the spread of COVID-19 and the efficacy of different responses. Audi used simulations to model manufacturing strategies and reduce its assembly line cycle time by 30%.As an entrepreneur, you can benefit greatly by using generative AI for market simulation. If you don't use these tools, you'll be operating with less complete, lower-quality information than your competition.


Related: How to Protect and Improve Your Business with AI During Challenging TimesKnow where to draw the lineThere are dangers in relying too heavily on gen AI. For example, AI uses data inputs for results. If the data is flawed, it can have consequences. This issue is already appearing in recruitment and hiring practices. Amazon canceled an AI-powered recruitment program after it proved to be biased against women. If you lean too much on AI alone, you could find yourself violating employment laws.You'll need to be aware of ethical concerns to avoid instances of sharing sensitive information or violating data privacy laws as well. Generative AI can also hallucinate, meaning that it might give entirely wrong information, but package it in convincing language and reassuring confidence. Turning over too much responsibility to a chatbot could cause more harm than good.For example, experts are warning against relying too much on tools like ChatGPT for search engine optimization (SEO). Google may decide to penalize companies that publish automated content, undermining their past SEO work. Make sure that your team has a process in place to check the outputs of the AI it's using.


There was the case of the ""ChatGPT lawyer,"" who used the tool to draft a motion and ended up citing fake cases in court. The firm faced a fine and public humiliation, but in fields like health care, the consequences of faulty information could be worse and more dangerous.Smart entrepreneurs will understand how to intelligently and strategically use generative AI, but they'll know where to draw the line. My advice is to be as savvy about the technology you employ as you are about the people you hire.However, don't delay. Challenge your teams to use generative AI to work productively. Decide on a few areas of focus to implement it now, whether it's personalized content creation, marketing efforts, software development, customer operations or data analysis. Trust me, your competitors are already doing so.

104,The Fear of Innovation and Change May Directly Cost You as an Individual. Here's How.,"Aug 14, 2023",Collin Williams,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-the-fear-of-innovation-may-directly-cost-you-as-an/457068,"
I've been a lawyer for 20 years now. That's mind-blowing to me because it seems like just yesterday that I was driving down to New Orleans for my first year of law school. But the fact remains, 20 years have passed, and I seem to be way better at getting injured doing harmless things than I was back when I was 23 years old. But what is really scary is how little the practice of law has changed in the 20 years since I started. Let me explain.Twenty years is a long time, but technology (good technology) existed back then. We had powerful desktop computers, laptops and handheld devices (queue the Blackberry jokes) that could still do amazing things, automating complex tasks and allowing us to communicate across the country with ease. Yet, when I would go to state court for hearings, we would use carbon paper (yes, carbon paper) to make duplicate copies of orders. If you needed a document from a prior case, you would head down to the clerk's desk and ask for the redweld so you could leaf through the paper file. I would record my time in six-minute increments on a daily basis by writing it in pen on a paper time sheet.For the 11 years I was in private practice, nothing changed. In fact, I'm not sure anything has changed in the nine years since I left private practice. For all I know, attorneys are still looking for the least used piece of carbon paper to make sure they don't have to press too hard to make a legible copy. Many court decisions are still memorialized solely in paper files or unscannable pdfs. There is an abundance of attorneys who are demanding a return to in-person hearings instead of virtual proceedings.



Related: Why Embracing Change is the Best Catalyst for GrowthThe costs associated with ignoring innovationWhile this all seems amusing (and a little mind-boggling), it speaks to a larger problem in the legal industry and several other industries as well. The entrenchment of ideas and processes. The fear of the novel. The trepidation associated with changing things from ""the way they've always been done."" I don't mind tradition, and it most certainly has its place. But the fact is, there are real costs associated with doing things the same way simply because they are familiar and comfortable. And those costs can trickle down.


Let's take a basic example of in-person hearings. Back in the day, it wasn't uncommon for an attorney to have to attend a status hearing in person, even if it was occurring across the country. That would necessitate airfare, lodging, meals, as well as additional travel time billed to the file. Depending on the number of attorneys involved in the case, it is not remotely inconceivable that an in-person hearing could cost the client five to ten times what a Zoom hearing would cost, maybe more. If the company has a lot of litigation, those costs will increase exponentially for each case on the company's docket. In contrast, with a basic Zoom hearing, an attorney can now jump into the proceeding, inform the court of the status and jump back out, all while never leaving their desk. But not all attorneys like virtual proceedings. Because they're novel … different.Related: The Power of InnovationWhy should you care?Why do you care, you may ask? Well, those are costs associated with doing business that need to be mitigated or paid for somehow — which may mean an increase in prices passed on to consumers. Long story short, the impact doesn't simply end at the company's income statement and balance sheet. Even worse, those dollars could be better spent on human capital, technology, training, education, and yes, innovation.These issues aren't relegated to the law, however. Insurance is a good example. There are now several exciting apps that allow you to document damage by using your phone. Some even use AI to evaluate and price the repairs. Despite these innovations, it isn't uncommon to have insurance companies that require you to get an in-person estimate from an examiner or to take your car to a physical repair shop so the damage can be evaluated. There are costs on both sides of the transaction in those instances. You may incur costs by missing work and taking time out of your day, while the insurance company incurs costs associated with compensating the adjuster and/or the repair shop. These may get passed along to you through increased insurance premiums or in other ways.


Does the adoption of technology and acceptance of innovation solve all of these problems? No. But there are consequences to ignoring innovation. The most direct are the ones described above which may be passed down to you as a consumer. But there are ancillary effects as well. The next amazing product may not flourish if the old-school mindset continues to dominate. The next great entrepreneur may never get off the ground because their idea flies in the face of hundreds of years of ""tradition.""Related: 11 Innovation Strategies That Can Effectively Increase Your Businesses' GrowthInnovation and change can be scary — particularly if innovation threatens your job directly. But we now live in an innovation culture. For example, you can communicate across the globe from the palm of your hand. Tourists are going into space. You can ask a computer exceedingly difficult questions and get thoughtful and reasoned answers. None of this is going away. But there is still an abundance of entrenched old-school mindsets out there that continue to rail against new ways of doing things. Unfortunately, that can cost all of us. As mentioned above, there is certainly a time and place for tradition. And technology doesn't fit for everything. But if we don't at least consider the options out there, we all end up paying the price.

105,From Frustrated to Fulfilled: Craig Siegel Shares the Reinvention Formula,"Aug 14, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/from-frustrated-to-fulfilled-craig-siegel-shares-the/457401,"
Self-limiting beliefs will tank your chance of success way before any external obstacles. So how do you remove those beliefs, and replace them with a more useful framework?Good question, and Craig Siegel has the answer.Craig is a value-based and high-energy global keynote speaker. He believes removing limiting beliefs is the key to success in all areas of life. Most people feel unworthy. Craig helps people release the negative beliefs they have cultivated over time and implement positive and constructive thoughts. These thoughts then create powerful and positive beliefs that change your behaviors and ultimately create brand-new results in your relationships, business, and all facets of life.



His work has been endorsed by some of the world's most well-known celebrities, entertainers, athletes, and entrepreneurs, such as Eric Thomas, Ed Mylett, Darryl Strawberry and Tom Bilyeu.In his new book, The Reinvention Formula: How to Unlock a Bulletproof Mindset to Upgrade Your Life, he provides practical strategies and inspiring stories to help you create a life filled with purpose and fulfillment.


I chatted with Craig during a recent episode of the Launch Your Business podcast and shared a few of my key takeaways below.The eulogy exerciseAfter years of work on Wall Street, Craig found himself in a successful career without direction or passion. He was caught in that low-grade miserable that happens when you've backed yourself into a corner of how other people think you ought to live your life.One of the key exercises that helped get him out of the haze was the eulogy exercise. You read that right: A eulogy exercise.Here's what that looks like: You imagine if your funeral is a few weeks into the future. What will people say about you? What's in your obituary? Did you leave a mark?


Craig realized he was not proud of what his eulogy would have looked like. He knew it was time for change.""I woke up one day and realized all I had to change was absolutely everything,"" Craig said, ""And so I started investing in a different story.""After that moment, Craig said it was impossible to go back.Related: Boost Your Productivity and Creativity in 3 Steps


How to reinvent yourselfLike so many things, Craig says that reinvention starts with a list. Two lists, actually.First, you make a list of five or six things that you love. If you didn't have to worry about money, what would you wake up tomorrow and do?Next, make a list of five or six things that you're really good at. Everyone has something that comes naturally to them, while others struggle.Your superpower will be where the venn diagram of what you love, and what you're good at overlaps.""You will absolutely find some commonalities,"" Craig said. ""Then I would marry the two. And right away we are onto something. Now we have some clarity.""Related: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Crafting a Successful FutureThere's a difference between failure and failingCraig defines failure as trying something once, seeing that it didn't work, and throwing up your hands and walking away.Failing, he says, can actually be a positive thing. It means that you tried something, and it didn't work. This happens to everyone, and as long as you keep rolling, you'll be okay. As long as you keep trying and failing, you'll make progress.


""Specifically in entrepreneurship, you gotta have thick skin, you gotta be bold, you gotta be able to take a punch,"" Craig said. You gotta be able to take things, not so personally, and understand that every time you have a setback or you make a ""mistake"", as long as there's a lesson learned that you can extract to make you better, more experienced, more seasoned for the next endeavor, it's actually a win.""Next stepsReady to learn more from Craig?Start by grabbing a copy of his new book, The Reinvention Formula: How to Unlock a Bulletproof Mindset to Upgrade Your Life.For a sneak preview, listen to our full interview on the Launch Your Business podcast.

106,I Transformed My Company Through AI 15 Years Ago — Here's What I've Learned,"Aug 11, 2023",Claudia Mirza,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-lessons-i-learned-from-transforming-my-company-with-ai/457134,"
About 15 years ago, I noticed the revenue of my company had flatlined. I work in the language-services industry, and at the time, we were primarily providing translation services through humans. Large technology clients had stopped buying from us, and we were determined to uncover the problem.As it turned out, we weren't offering our big tech clients what they needed: machine-based language models that could train artificial intelligence and improve automated translation outcomes.This left us with two choices: adapt or lose business. Even though we knew incorporating AI into our company was critical to its success, the transition wasn't easy. From the C-level down, the idea of incorporating machines into our workflow and changing the nature of our people's jobs was met with a lot of resistance. The new direction would completely change the DNA of our company, and not everyone was on board.With the recent acceleration of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, businesses in virtually every industry are being forced to change. A report from the World Economic Forum, showed more than 75% of companies are looking to adopt AI tech in the next five years. And with AI expected to contribute 14.5% of the U.S. GDP by 2030, there's no denying its impact on economic growth.As leaders across corporate America navigate the era of AI in the workplace, here are three insights I learned from the digital transformation of our company.Related: 3 Smart Things to Know Before Getting Started with AIReskilling is key to rescaling your workforceChange is hard for everyone, but we found a lot of the resistance from our people came from not knowing what skills would be required of them as our company embraced AI. To ease their concerns, we brought in senior leaders who were adept at leading digital transformations to help reskill our workforce.Offering employees an opportunity to reskill in the age of AI has cross benefits. Not only did it allow us to retain many top employees who had institutional knowledge of our business and were critical to our culture, but as our people obtained new technical skills, it made them more employable: being a human language translator is great, but being a human language translator who has trained artificial intelligence engines is even better.



The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2023 report showed 44% of employers surveyed from a cross-section of the world's largest companies expect workers' skills will be disrupted in the next five years. Such significant disruption requires business leaders, government and educational institutions alike to ensure we are providing the right training and reskilling of our human workforce.For us, at times reskilling required merging different divisions of our company together for cross-learning opportunities. A division that understood the technology, for instance, could collaborate with a division that understood the customer experience to uncover new client solutions. This enabled us to reutilize valuable team members and also set them up to grow and prosper in their individual careers.Related: 5 Tips for Integrating AI Into Your Business


Robots can't replace complex critical thinkingI was given a demo by an AI vendor recently, and when asked if the translation technology could be used in a healthcare setting, he said ""no."" This was due, in part, to the precise nature surrounding healthcare communication.It got me thinking about my father. He was a great citizen who immigrated to America to provide a better life for his family. Later in life, he got dementia and lost much of his speech. I imagined how awful it would have been for him to go through an MRI, for instance, being aided with AI, rather than a human, for language interpretation.As much as AI can help inform our decision-making and maximize efficiency, it can't replace the emotional intelligence or critical-thinking skills of humans. An in-person interpreter is a multi-dimensional being with compassion that can mimic the gestures of a doctor and communicate to a vulnerable patient with empathy. That simply can't be replicated through AI.AI bases its decision-making off of the aggregate of data that's been programmed into it — data that often contains preconceived biases. For example, I went into DALL-E by Open AI recently and asked it to create an image of a woman CEO. All of the images produced were of Asian women with zero differentiation in body size, race or emotional expression. With the volume of content being created through data analytics, we need human's complex critical thinking skills more than ever to help audit and regulate machine output.We also need human leadership skills more than ever. As a leader at our company, my role is to ensure we stay relevant — to be a step ahead of the trends and innovate to the benefit of our clients and team. These are skills that can be informed, but not replaced by AI.Related: The Perfect Blend: How to Successfully Combine AI and Human Approaches to Business


Great tools require even greater responsibilityAt the time of the Industrial Revolution, we had regulations in place for physical crimes. To this day, if you go into a supermarket and steal a physical product, there is legislation in place to prosecute you. The same cannot be said for the digital economy. Our justice system is not currently set up to protect Americans from the volume of cybersecurity issues the age of AI presents.A recent report from Gartner showed that by 2025, consumerization of AI-enabled fraud will drive more focus on security education and awareness. From managing large volumes of private data to protecting our election systems, it's extremely important that our laws and regulations catch up with the digital age.For business leaders, one of the biggest mistakes you can make when incorporating AI into your organization is to violate the privacy of your stakeholders. And it's not just humans that put privacy at risk. Machines and systems themselves can become non-compliant if they aren't tested and implemented in a responsible manner. Privacy breaches can be extremely damaging and harm a lot of people, which is why it's critical that AI is used responsibly and in conjunction with robust cybersecurity measures.It's early days in the era of AI, but already leaders around the world are recognizing its transformative capabilities. With great power comes great responsibility, and I believe it's critical that as we go further down the road of incorporating AI into our workplaces, we establish regulations and uphold policies to protect the value of human life.

A few years ago, I was attending a business conference and had an interesting conversation with a fellow business leader. We were discussing what we do and the challenges we faced.

No, really. Embracing AI is no longer an option but a necessity for companies looking to thrive and succeed in the digital age.And as CEOs and business leaders, we have the responsibility to stay ahead of the curve and identify opportunities that can propel our companies to new heights.

108,Your Customers Are More Interested in Your Purpose Than Ever — Here Are 3 Steps to Showcase It,"Aug 9, 2023",Durana Elmi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/social-entrepreneurship-is-key-to-connecting-to-consumers/454824,"
For centuries, the traditional driver for bringing a company or business of any size to fruition has been profit. This is the net gain one realizes after accounting for all the effort, costs, labor and time in order to maintain the business.The possibility of generating income far beyond what a person may earn simply by working as an employee for someone else has always been a factor in overcoming the challenge of starting a business. Despite the fact that starting and scaling a successful business can be one of the most difficult and turbulent times for any entrepreneur, it is currently only surpassed by real estate as the most attractive means of investment for greater personal gain.Much of this attraction is because businesses are inspiring and tangible; people see successful small and large businesses operating every day, all around them. The idea, whether it involves opening a restaurant or selling a homemade product, seems practical, doable and attainable for the average person, especially when considering assumed profits.



In reality, running a business is extremely hard. Many business owners struggle, chasing cash flow to fend off debt, and many more fail after less than a year of operation. However, successful companies are led by those with an entrepreneurial spirit that motivates them to keep trying. In the chaos of getting your business up and running, it can be easy to forget about marketing, philanthropy and social entrepreneurship. These initiatives are hidden keys to success that allow your business to connect with consumers on an emotional level.Related: Purpose-Driven Companies Grow 3 Times Faster — So Here's How to Become One Without Sacrificing Profit.


Showcasing your missionThe internet and access to social media have had a huge impact on the success of businesses, especially those in their growth stage. A single viral TikTok can sell out a product and change the life of a business owner overnight. Consumers are more interested in a business's ethics, relatability and purpose than ever. That being said, businesses have to develop new purposes for operating beyond just driving sales. Mission and common goodwill have become incredibly valuable, especially as more and more consumers utilize the Internet to make their decisions about whom to buy from and whom to avoid. In this regard, the social entrepreneur has evolved, operating a business for both the greater good and making a profit in the same operation.Social entrepreneurship builds the given business strategy around a social issue first and profit second. The business's ability to achieve income and net profit is oftentimes treated as an added benefit, with the primary goal of achieving the socially positive impacts driving much of the activity involved. The social issues can vary considerably, from benefiting the environment to providing work opportunities for low-income communities needing career change assistance. Identifying the social issue your company is passionate about and solving can oftentimes drive sales from those in the community, as well as inspire a sense of purpose, belonging and camaraderie within your team.3 steps to integrate social entrepreneurship into your businessEducation and advocacy: Beyond selling products, emphasize adding educational value and resources to your consumers that enable them to make more informed decisions regarding their purchases. This can include blog posts, social media content, webinars or highlighting your employees on podcasts or in thought leadership pieces. By allowing your brand to become a reliable source of information and advocating for further education on consumer habits, your company will establish itself as a socially responsible entity that genuinely cares about the well-being of its consumer base.Cause marketing and donations: Tie sales to a social cause or charitable organization that aligns with your brand. For example, for every product sold, a certain percentage of the proceeds could be donated to initiatives in your community, like providing the homeless with meals or a national scale to nonprofits or charities. This approach creates a win-win solution where consumers feel good about their purchase, knowing they are contributing to a greater good while your company gains customer loyalty and positive brand perception.Sustainable and ethical sourcing: Emphasize social entrepreneurship in your supply chain by sourcing ingredients and materials in an ethical and sustainable manner. Ensure that your products are not only beneficial to consumers but also considerate of social and environmental impacts. For instance, prioritize sourcing from fair trade suppliers, environmentally responsible farms or manufacturing plants or even local communities that support sustainable practices. Transparently communicate these efforts to your consumers, who increasingly value companies with social and environmental consciousness.Related: How Social Entrepreneurship Can Benefit Businesses and the Communities They ServeIn a world where purpose-driven businesses are gaining momentum, social entrepreneurship stands as a powerful and inspiring concept that merges profit with positive social impact, offering a compelling path for entrepreneurs to make a difference while pursuing success.
