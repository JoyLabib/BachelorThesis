Tupperware says it delayed filing its annual report because of a lack of accountants.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. The accountant shortage is so bad that companies are delaying filing key mandatory reports.On Friday, Tupperware said it didn't have enough accountants to get its annual report out on time. The storage container manufacturer is the latest on a growing list of companies that have delayed their annual reports for a host of reasons. About 70 companies have postponed annual reports this year, up 40% from last year, research company Intelligize tallied last month.



In a regulatory filing, Orlando-based Tupperware blamed the delay on ""significant"" past and present accounting attrition, ""which has resulted in resource and skill set gaps, strained resources, and a loss of continuity of knowledge.""Tupperware added that previous delays in filing its 2022 annual report led to postponement of its quarterly reports, which subsequently pushed back work on its 2023 annual report.


On LinkedIn, the company is hiring for a single accountant, a job in Poland.Once an American kitchen icon, the manufacturer now faces a slew of business problems. In October, its external accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, dropped the company as a client. Almost a year ago, Tupperware warned investors of potential bankruptcy amid greater losses and operational costs.'Accountant staffing issues at Tupperware and other businesses are becoming an operational headache with no signs of abating.Seasoned accountants are retiring while the profession, which has a reputation for long hours and unfulfilling work, has struggled to attract younger talent. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants said that 75% of certified accountants reached retirement age in 2020. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects there will be 126,500 openings for accountants and auditors each year, on average, over the decade.


But many students say they are turned off by the fifth year of college needed for accounting courses. And accountants' average starting salary of about $62,000 looks less appealing than other higher-paying or lower-stress jobs in business.""Accountants and auditors are to business as those people in the black-and-white-striped shirts are to sports. We're the referees of business,"" Steven Kachelmeier, the chair of the accounting department at the University of Texas, told Business Insider last year.""We may not always like the referees, but sports is a free-for-all without them,"" he said, explaining that if shortages of these workers continue, accountability and integrity in business could suffer.This year has seen a slate of high-profile financial reporting errors, some of which caused stock prices to change. In February, ride-hailing app Lyft erroneously reported in its fourth-quarter earnings release that it expects profit margins to increase by 500, not 50 basis points — which led its stock to surge 60%. Electric vehicle maker Rivian and gym company Planet Fitness said they made earnings typos this year.


In a similar move to Tupperware, toy giant Mattel said in a February filing that it was unable to file its 2023 annual report due to ""certain deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting.""The Securities and Exchanges Commission can issue penalties for erroneous filings, including fines for delays and errors in financial reporting.

When it comes to bankruptcies in the U.S., there's good news and bad news.The good news is that 2023 was the third-lowest year for bankruptcy filings and 42% below the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. Excluding 2021 and 2022 — where many businesses received pandemic-related assistance — bankruptcies were at the lowest historic levels since 1997.But the bad news is that they're on the rise. According to data from the global legal consulting firm Epiq AACER and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, bankruptcy filings in the U.S. increased by about 17 to 18% in 2023 compared to the prior year, with January marking ""18 consecutive months that total, individual, and commercial bankruptcy filings have registered monthly year-over-year increases."" And the actual numbers could very well be higher when you consider the unreported number of small business owners who shutter their doors, settle their debts (or not) and walk away from their firms without making any formal filings.

2,You Might Spend Unnecessary Money If You Don't Stay on Top of Your Expenses. Here's How to Manage Them.,"Mar 25, 2024",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/dont-waste-money-on-unnecessary-spending-heres-how/470466,"
Whether you went into your business with open eyes or have been kicking and screaming about the parts you don't like, expense management is essential to keeping the lights on and creditors (and the tax man) away.Failing to manage your expenses could leave you continually spending on unneeded subscriptions that automatically renew. You could wind up short of funds at the end of the month and have to carry a credit card balance at a large interest rate. Or you could wind up with a tax debt you can't pay and the IRS knocking at your door.Reconciling your expenses is at the heart of managing them. Reconciling simply means comparing two things to make sure they match. For instance, comparing the receipt for the computer you bought and the credit card statement for the card you used in the transaction. Or your credit card statement and the bank statement for the account you used to pay off the card balance. When you do this, you have a sense of what's going on with your cash flow.



Avoid the bad. You can spot things that can really hurt you, such as fraud or identity theft, or catch small math errors before they become bad ones. Invoices are less likely to be lost. You're less likely to wind up paying late fees. You'll reimburse employees before they're hurt financially or harbor a grudge against you. You're less likely to find yourself facing an unexpected expense. And, since one of your key expenses is paying your estimated taxes to the IRS, you reduce your chance of penalties for underpayment or late payment of those estimated taxes.Embrace the good. With up-to-date and accurate expense records, you can make better decisions about a range of issues — everything from hiring to new products to taking time off. You may even discover money you didn't think you had, meaning you can pay down debt or set aside funds for future business growth. If you're going to borrow for growth or to cover expenses for your slow season, well-kept expense records will smooth the process.


Related: Don't File and Forget: Use Your Receipts to Gain Insight on Business SpendingEmbrace these five strategies to go from ""survive"" to ""thrive""Commanding expenses is especially important for a small business. Imagine a bakery that doesn't know what it spends on flour or a freelance web designer with more professional memberships than time to use them. Expense management is more challenging for a small business; they typically have a small staff, which means that everyone is stretched. Distractions are greater and space — real and cyber — can be limited, making it easier to lose things.These five expense management strategies will keep you on track and move you from struggling to overcoming:1. Budgeting


Budgeting is central to expense management. Budgeting sets guardrails for how your business should run. By comparing (reconciling) your spending goals for important categories against what you actually spend, you stay up-to-date on the financial state of your business. These will differ based on your business but will include things like rent, supplies, employee expenses and utilities. Compare your spending to your budgeted amounts for a specific period (say monthly or quarterly).The simplest way to do this is to list your budget items on the left side of a notebook page or spreadsheet, and then enter the actual expenses to the right. Add a third column showing the difference between your budget and your actual expense from your cash receipts, credit card statements and checking statements. Prioritize which categories are most important. Those that are essential — such as coffee and sugar for a coffee shop — will need more attention than those that are simply nice to have, like a television for customers.2. Identify cost centersExpenses may be important because they're big (say, rent) or because they're critical to performing your work (for instance, your internet bill for a programmer or a web developer). Marketing could be important because while it creates customers, it's easy to fly out of control if your strategy includes pay-per-click or pay-per-impression internet advertising. Cost centers can indicate a spending problem when there's too big of a variance from the usual expenditure, or they can indicate that your business is either growing or starting to decline. By tracking your spending and its return on investment (ROI), you can identify products or processes that aren't paying off internally. If your marketing ROI is too low, you may elect to back the trend to self-serve buyers and drive your sales through online experiences, using fewer sales reps.


3. OutsourcingAdministrative tasks you pay someone for may be better outsourced online. These could include payroll, data entry, bookkeeping, web design, marketing, call centers and even human relations (HR). Or you can try to handle them yourself with software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendors. Start with your biggest expense, but anything that improves profitability should be looked at.4. Establish office proceduresWhen you've determined your course of action, you need to routinize it. If you're a sole proprietor, write down what you need to do, then do it. It may even help to pretend you're reporting to someone else (even if you went into business to be your own boss). Consider ""accountability partners"" who keep you on task. If you have employees, document your procedures. Include when they're to be done — for instance, Tuesday is payroll day and Thursday is inventory day. Include who does it and detail all of the steps.


5. Make technology your friendAccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Technology Engagement Center, since 2020, those small businesses showing higher use of technology showed higher growth in sales, profits and employment. Just keep the first four strategies in mind when adopting helpful technologies.Related: 10 Tax Law Changes You Need to Know to Save Your Business Thousands of DollarsTotal masteryYou must accurately capture your transactions for any expense management structure to function. Audit what you do and revise any of the above procedures if they don't work or in the event of change. Whether through growth, lost business or outright disaster, things will change. These will affect all of the above and require new budgets, cost-center decisions, outsourcing needs, office procedures and technologies.


When you first implement these five strategies, your persistence will be rewarded. Profitability will increase as you systematically reduce costs — especially those that don't help generate revenue. The process may be slow and fraught with missteps — whether you make a poor outsourcing decision or take a while to turn Wednesday into bookkeeping day — but with your eye on your goals you'll soon find yourself master of all you manage.

3,How to Combat Payment Fraud and Negative Cash Flow,"Mar 21, 2024",Nick Chandi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/proven-strategies-to-combat-payment-fraud-and-negative-cash/471135,"
Payment fraud poses significant risks for small businesses, often overlooked by the owners. Ignoring this threat can lead to devastating consequences, even business closure. Shockingly, the SEON report of 2021 revealed a staggering 1,862 data breaches and 293 million victims, highlighting the pervasive threat. Business owners must prioritize security and stay vigilant against evolving fraud tactics to safeguard their businesses and customers.Related: How Generative AI Is Fueling the Rise of Fake News and Online FraudProven strategies to combat payment fraudWhen it comes to protecting your business from payment fraud, it's all about making smart choices. One of the first steps is choosing a payment processor that's got your back with exceptional security features. Not all platforms are created equal, so picking one that offers advanced encryption and fraud detection is important. These built-in safeguards are crucial for keeping your transactions safe from any unauthorized access.



Another key aspect is training your team to spot and handle any fishy activity. According to a report, employee tip-offs are the most common method of detecting fraud, emphasizing the pivotal role of staff awareness. Your employees are your first line of defense against fraud, so giving them the right training is essential. By fostering a culture of awareness and accountability, you empower your team to keep your business's finances secure.Keeping an eye on your transactions is also a must. Setting up systems for real-time monitoring and getting alerts for anything unusual can help you catch any fraud attempts early on. Regularly checking your transaction logs adds an extra layer of security so you can stay on top of things.


Traditional passwords might not be enough against sophisticated cyber threats in 2024. That's why it's worth considering multi-factor authentication to increase your security. Research indicates that in 2023, 49% of data breaches involved compromised credentials, highlighting the need for stronger authentication methods. Adding extra verification steps like security questions or biometric data can make it much harder for fraudsters to get in.And if you want some extra peace of mind, teaming up with fraud prevention services could be a wise option. The global average data breach cost in 2023 was USD 4.45 million. Fraud prevention services offer specialized solutions tailored to your business's needs, like real-time monitoring and proactive fraud detection. With their help, you can stay one step ahead of any potential threats and focus on confidently growing your business.Related: Innovation: How Banks and Businesses Can Fight Fraud and Chargebacks Should Regulation FailManaging negative cash flowNegative cash flow can pose significant challenges for small businesses, impacting everything from day-to-day operations to long-term growth prospects. Companies experiencing irregular cash flows are almost twice as likely to exit the market compared to those with consistent cash flows. Understanding its implications and implementing effective management strategies is essential for financial stability and sustainability.


Negative cash flow occurs when a business's expenses exceed its revenue over a specific period. This shortfall can lead to liquidity issues, making it difficult to cover essential expenses such as payroll, inventory, and overhead costs. Left unchecked, negative cash flow can undermine a business's financial health and jeopardize its long-term viability.Several factors can contribute to negative cash flow, including late client payments, excessive overhead expenses, and unexpected emergencies. According to a survey, 61% of small businesses experience cash flow challenges due to late payments from clients. By identifying the root causes of negative cash flow, entrepreneurs can develop targeted strategies to address these issues and improve financial performance.Related: 4 Cash Flow Trends To Know About in 2024 Strategies for improving cash flow managementOne way to start turning things around is by talking to the suppliers and vendors about your payment terms. Sometimes, they're willing to give you more time to clear your bills, which can take some of the pressure off in the short term and help you keep some cash in the bank for emergencies. And offering your clients a little incentive to pay their invoices on time, like discounts or rewards, could also help speed things up on the accounts receivable front.

Maybe there are some areas where you're overspending or doing things in a way that's not as efficient as it could be. By tightening up your processes and trimming the fat, you can free up some cash and make our business more financially sound.Utilizing modern payment solutions can also make a big difference. Online invoicing and instant payment platforms can help you get paid faster and streamline your financial operations, which is always good when you're trying to get your cash flow back in the black.And last but not least, having a rainy day fund is always a good idea. Setting aside monthly money can give you a safety net for those unexpected downturns or emergencies that inevitably crop up when you least expect them. With these strategies in your toolkit, you can take control of your cash flow, strengthen your financial foundation, and set your businesses up for long-term success.

4,10 Tax Law Changes You Need to Know to Save Your Business Thousands of Dollars,"Mar 11, 2024",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/10-tax-law-changes-you-need-to-know-before-filing-in-2024/469805,"
Imagine not knowing about a tax advantage that could have saved your business thousands of dollars. Money that could be used to buy new equipment, set aside for tough times or reward hard-working employees? Now think about Pat, who nearly missed out on the opportunity in 2021 to secure a specific credit for keeping the company handyman on staff during the pandemic. Luckily, Pat learned that the credit could be accessed by amending IRS returns for 2020 and 2021. (The IRS allows this for three years following filing.) Had Pat learned about the credit today, it would not have been available. While relatively small for Pat, it was still meaningful.This is just a small example of the value of keeping up on tax law changes. Any change enacted by Congress (or even your local governments) can save or cost your business. Most small businesses will spend the next few weeks filing their 2023 taxes. That makes this a good time to take a look at changes that you may have missed when planning for 2023, but that you still may be able to take advantage of.Knowing new tax laws is about more than just the effect on your annual business tax. Knowing about tax law changes in advance lets you plan your finances better. You can save money to ensure you can pay. If you pay less, you can use the money to implement business strategies you might have had to put off or forgo entirely.



With the 2023 tax filing season barely underway, now is the time to check to see what changes have occurred that affect your business. If any of these items give you pause, act now to prevent difficulties closer to April 15.Related: Want Taxes to Be Easy? Work on Them Year Round, Not Last Minute.


Top 10 changes to look for while filing your 2023 taxesDepreciation. Businesses formerly could deduct the cost of big assets over the expected lifetime of that asset. If your $1,000 computer was going to last 10 years, you could deduct $100 for it each year until its final year. This likely reduced your tax obligation. Since mid-2017, a business could claim 100% bonus depreciation on it. (Bonus depreciation was the government's way to encourage small business investment and jolt the economy.) However, that bonus became 80% in 2023 and will fall by 20% more each year until the bonus depreciation ends.Environmental credits. Available credits for your business vehicle under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 differ depending on whether you placed your clean vehicle into service from Jan. 1 through April 17, 2023 or April 18 and after.Retirement plan incentives. If you have up to 50 employees and have thought about rewarding them — or want to be more competitive with your hires — any costs you incur to establish a retirement plan are now fully deductible up to $5,000. Businesses with 51-100 employees can get a credit for 50% of their costs.Employer contribution tax credit. If your retirement plan includes an employer contribution, some or all of that expense can be taken as a federal tax credit. This credit can only be taken for participating employees earning $100,000 or less based on how much of their contributions you match. The cap per employee is $1,000.Net operating loss deduction changes. It used to be that if you had a net operating loss — say, you spent $10,000 on inventory but only made $8,000 in sales, you were able to carry that $2,000 loss forward to the subsequent tax year. Starting in 2023, you can only deduct 80% of that loss ($1,600 in this example).Mileage changes from tax year 2022. For business use of your personal vehicle, the mileage deduction increased in 2023 to 65.5¢ per mile (from 62.5¢). This also applies when reimbursing employees when they've driven their vehicle on your behalf.Form 1099K. The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 required third-party settlement organizations (such as eBay, Amazon and PayPal) to report transactions to the IRS if they exceeded $600 for the year. If your business (or, more likely, side hustle) is selling items through an online retailer, you may have been required to supply your social security number or employer identification number to receive a Form 1099K. However, in late 2023, the IRS declared the year to be another ""transitional year,"" and you may not receive the form. You must still report that income and pay tax on it.Interest expense limitation. Since 2017, there has been a limit to how much interest you may deduct. This was changed in 2022, and further refined in 2023. The IRS describes the changes here. The gist is that with the lower limit and higher interest rates, you may not be able to deduct all of your interest. If this applies to you, this is a good example of a time to enlist the aid of a tax professional.401(k) contribution deadlines. The tax year 2023 is the first year sole proprietors and single-member LLCs may make first-year contributions through the April 15 tax filing deadline.Meal and entertainment. If you started your business during the pandemic era when you could write off 100% of those costs, be aware that only 50% of the cost of 2023 meals and entertainment expenses is deductible.Related: Make Tax Season As Painless as Possible by Taking These 6 StepsRemember to make sure that you aren't missing local changes when focusing on federal. Iowa and Arkansas reduced their top corporate tax rate in 2023; did your state and local government?Need help? The IRS is staffing up on customer service representatives — though the recent budget deal reduced some of the funding allocated in the Inflation Reduction Act.Looking forward to 2024, where do you learn about these changes? Be alert to coverage in the business press, either in the business section of a reliable news organization (in print or online; you're already reading Entrepreneur.com) or a specific industry-oriented publication. The IRS website offers a variety of help. Its news releases will give early warning of changes to take place. Also look for tax news websites, chambers of commerce, the Small Business Administration, the small business development center near you, any industry association you may belong to, blogs from your accounting software provider or check with your accounting professional.


Remember, business tax season is really 12 months a year. Stay organized, plan for the future and start watching now for 2024 changes. Doing so will help you adapt and thrive.

6,This Is How Entrepreneurs Can Achieve Financial Fitness,"Mar 1, 2024",Mohammad Farraj,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/this-is-how-entrepreneurs-can-achieve-financial-fitness/469560,"
When we think about ""fitness,"" we often envision bodybuilders at the gym, straining to bench press more weight. Or spin classes, with stationary cyclists pedaling faster and faster to the beat of loud, pulsing music.However, for entrepreneurs, there is a totally different type of training with a totally different goal: financial fitness. That said, some of the rudiments of financial fitness can be compared to their physical fitness counterparts, especially when it comes to bootstrapping a business.Related:  10 Tips for Bootstrapping Your Startup



Set intentionsA new year, job shifts and life changes often lead people to make fitness resolutions. In business, the intention to start a new business requires specific actions. The first step in flexing your entrepreneurial muscles is developing strong fundamentals for bootstrapping the business.What exactly is bootstrapping? The U.S. Chamber of Commerce defines it as: ""the process of starting a company with only personal savings, including borrowed or invested funds from family or friends, as well as income from initial sales. Self-funded businesses do not rely on traditional financing methods, such as the support of investors, crowdfunding or bank loans. Rather, as the name suggests, entrepreneurs must ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps'' by using their own capital to launch.""


That may sound as scary as a nautilus circuit in the weight room. However, even with a pool of investors, the intention for any new business is to launch and scale on a shoestring budget. The first thing that starting a new business requires (like trying out new equipment at the gym) is solid balance. For new businesses, that means:Maintaining lean operating expensesMinimizing unnecessary purchasesMaximizing DIY dutiesTo be able to keep your new business growing while you build the customer base and begin to generate meaningful sales, you must do many tasks yourself. For me, it was to ""DIY"" everything, which meant learning new things to enhance my decision-making and avoid unnecessary mistakes.For example, although I had very little experience with marketing, I educated myself on the best business practices for my business and employed them myself. With time, I was able to learn enough, often through trial and error, to become an expert. I learned that success comes if you focus on a good product and let word of mouth, social media and community relationships do the rest.Related: 3 Bootstrapping Success Stories to Inspire Your Entrepreneurial Journey


Focus on flexibilityStretching is essential for any kind of fitness. However, it's mandatory to develop the financial resilience necessary to navigate inevitable economic downturns in business.In 2020, the world was in shambles as millions of businesses around the country shut their doors. Although many have withstood that difficult time, many others did not. Research conducted at the Sloan School of Business at MIT identified ""three fundamental ways to manage uncertainty: resilience, local agility and portfolio agility.""The sad fact is that according to analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 18% of businesses fail within their first year and 50% within the first five years. For many, that is because they did not build flexibility into their financial fitness regimen. We found that managing expenses and mitigating risks are key to stretching your capabilities and resources during difficult times.I can't stress this enough: You must be able to diversify the services you provide to maneuver through difficult times. For example, we refocused our restaurant's strategy on deliveries and optimized our delivery experience for our guests when everyone was home and not willing to leave. This was a pivotal make-or-break moment for our business since dine-in sales dropped significantly. We also operated for three years debt-free and continue to grow our business without taking on any debt.


Establish a routineLike physical fitness, for financial fitness, you must establish a routine to attain your goals and track your progress. For entrepreneurs, there are three key actionable items:1. Implement a budget tracking systemAlways monitor expenses. We track all COGS spending, labor costs and marketing spend by deploying software that provides us with real-time data on our income and outflow. Each manager receives weekly reports for all expenses and projections/guidelines for the upcoming week to ensure optimal spending. Diversify income streams to reduce dependence on a single source.2. Listen to your customers


Look for what other services you can provide for your customers. This will provide you with other streams of income, so you never need to rely on one single source that may not be sustainable over time or in a downturn.Related: 5 Ways to Bootstrap Your Vision Into Reality Without Outside Funding3. Build an emergency fundAn emergency fund is essential to navigate unexpected financial challenges. An emergency fund reduces stress for sudden expenses. Set a small percentage of your monthly earnings to an emergency fund. We set aside 15% each month for a rainy day that helped us weather the storm.


The most essential aspect of building an emergency fund is to implement a system for making consistent contributions. The U.S. government hosts a Consumer Finance website that offers helpful advice, for instance, ""putting a specific amount of cash aside each day, week or payday period.""4. Make physical fitness part of your financial fitness routineEntrepreneurs can leverage their own personal physical fitness as a business advantage. It has been proven over and over that exercise promotes cognitive function and creativity while reducing stress. And, when the going gets tough times, exercise helps entrepreneurs get tougher.Being physically fit takes motivation, information dedication and sweat. Similarly, bootstrapping your financial fitness requires a can-do attitude, knowledge and singular focus. The most important thing to remember is that to achieve any type of fitness goal, there are no shortcuts and no substitute for hard work.

7,Fraud is Everywhere — Are You Safe? Follow This Guide to Secure Online Transactions,"Feb 29, 2024",Nick Chandi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-online-transactions/469884,"
The prevalence of payment fraud is a growing concern for both consumers and businesses, as highlighted in a 2021 report by fraud prevention firm SEON, which recorded 1,862 data breaches affecting a staggering 293 million individuals. Cybercriminals employ sophisticated tactics, exploiting vulnerabilities in online systems to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. According to a recent survey, 65% of respondents said their organizations experienced attempted or successful fraud activity in 2022.For small business owners, ensuring the safety of online transactions is non-negotiable. Beyond financial losses, falling victim to fraud can tarnish your reputation and erode customer trust. Prioritizing security measures is key to safeguarding your business and maintaining credibility. Investing in robust security protocols and staying vigilant against emerging threats can instill confidence in your customers and protect your brand's integrity. With payment fraud expected to keep rising, it's projected to cost $40.62 billion by 2027, highlighting the importance of staying proactive in protecting your business against online threats.Related: Slow Payment Options Are Costing Your Business — Here's the Alternatives of the Future 



Banking services' role in securityBanks use strong encryption to keep online transactions safe. Encryption scrambles important information so only authorized people can read it. This stops hackers from stealing or changing it during the transaction. Banks follow strict security rules to protect customer data from the start to the end of each transaction. This means your personal and financial details are safe from cybercriminals who might try to access them illegally.By focusing on security, banks protect your information and build trust with customers, making online banking safer for everyone. This commitment to security ensures that your online transactions are secure, giving you peace of mind knowing that your sensitive data is well-protected every step.


Spot phishing scamsPhishing scams remain a prevalent threat, with cybercriminals using deceptive tactics to trick individuals into divulging confidential information. About 22 percent of all data breaches are because of phishing scams, making them one of the most common cybercrimes. These scams often involve fraudulent emails, texts, or phone calls impersonating legitimate entities like banks or government agencies.Small business owners must educate themselves and their employees about the telltale signs of phishing scams, including suspicious links, misspelled domain names, and requests for sensitive information. By exercising caution and verifying the authenticity of communications, businesses can mitigate the risk of falling victim to these malicious schemes.Related: 4 Cash Flow Trends To Know About in 2024 Enhance security with two-factor authenticationTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is a widely used method for online payment security. 2FA and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are powerful tools that can prevent over 99.9% of account compromise attacks. It adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts by requiring two verification forms before granting access. This typically involves a combination of something the user knows (such as a password) and something they possess (such as a mobile device or security token).


With 2FA, you get immediate alerts if someone tries to breach your account using phishing or other scams. Even if one factor is compromised, the second one acts as a barrier against unauthorized entry. Implementing 2FA is a smart move for small businesses, as it greatly decreases the risk of unauthorized access and enhances protection against cyber threats. The anticipated growth of 2FA by 17.28% and its projected value of USD 44.05 billion by 2030 underscore its significance in addressing the rising cybersecurity risks.Get notifications for transactionsTransaction notifications are a powerful shield against financial fraud and uncertainty, empowering small business owners and customers. Instant alerts buzz on your phone when a transaction occurs, giving you the upper hand in spotting any suspicious activity before it spirals out of control.With this kind of real-time monitoring, businesses can nip unauthorized or fraudulent transactions in the bud, keeping losses to a minimum and risks under control. But it's not just about protecting the bottom line; it's also about building trust and transparency in every interaction. Transaction notifications empower customers to take an active role in safeguarding their accounts, strengthening the bond between businesses and their valued clientele.Partner with secure payment providersChoosing a reliable payment provider is essential for small businesses looking to secure their online transactions. Trusted providers offer strong fraud detection, follow industry regulations, and maintain high-security standards. When picking a partner, businesses should assess factors like encryption methods, compliance with PCI DSS regulations, transaction fees, and customer support quality.


With numerous B2B payment companies available, selecting the right one is crucial. By teaming up with a reputable payment provider, small businesses can boost transaction security and ensure a smooth, safe payment experience for customers.Related: Busywork Sucks — How Automation Can Eliminate Boring Tasks for Entrepreneurs Safeguarding your small business against online payment fraud requires a proactive security and risk management approach. By familiarizing yourself with fraudsters' tactics, implementing strong security measures, and teaming up with trustworthy service providers, you shield your business and customers from the ever-present danger of cybercrime. Stay updated on new threats, educate your team on online security best practices, and make safety and integrity top priorities in your business operations. With these steps, you create a robust defense against online fraud, ensuring your business's safety and your customers' trust.

9,Let's Bring Back the Human Element to Paying Bills — Here's 3 Ways to Nurture Vendor Relationships for Business Success,"Feb 26, 2024",Nick Chandi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/3-ways-to-nurture-your-vendor-relationships-to-fuel/469324,"
Turning a small business into a success involves many factors, but a big part of it is how well you get along with your suppliers. Since businesses rely on vendors for essential supplies, cultivating strong ties ensures a reliable supply chain, minimizing disruptions. Managing these connections can get tricky as businesses grow, but there are ways to make it smoother and more cost-effective.The human element is important in improving vendor relationships. Unlike large corporations, small businesses are more likely to engage in regular personal interactions with vendors through meetings, calls and visits. These personal connections often go beyond simple transactions and are more geared towards developing a symbiotic partnership with effective communication and mutual collaboration. The human touch adds empathy and reliability, transforming vendor relationships into partnerships built on trust and shared goals.How can the personal touch in Accounts Payable (AP) (the part of business where you make sure you pay your bills) help foster positive vendor relationships for the success of your small business? Consider these three approaches to ensure a strong and beneficial partnership.



Related: 3 Secrets to Streamlining Your Accounts Payable Process1. Personalize your communication strategiesTo build strong relationships with vendors, it's important to personalize communication. Understand each vendor's preferences and priorities, whether they prefer emails, phone calls, or in-person meetings. When you talk with them, take notes or write down what you remember about them after the meeting. Before you talk with them next, re-read your notes and ensure you don't ask the same question twice. A good Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) tool can help you keep track of how your clients want to be spoken to.


Successful personalized communication includes regular updates, timely responses, and expressing appreciation. Seeking feedback and addressing concerns promptly is important. Simple gestures like personalized thank-you notes, recognizing partnership milestones, or expressing appreciation for timely payments contribute to a positive and collaborative atmosphere in the vendor relationship.Related: 80% of Businesses Fail Due To a Lack of Cash. Here are 4 Reasons Why Cash Flow Forecasting Is So Important 2. Be transparent in financial transactionsTransparent financial dealings with vendors hold significant importance for several reasons. If you share financial information openly, it helps everyone trust each other and work together smoothly. Openly sharing financial information prevents misunderstandings and sets the stage for fair negotiations, potentially resulting in better terms for both parties.In terms of invoicing, clarity on payment terms is key. By discussing and agreeing upon invoices with clients before sending them out, you can ensure everyone is on the same page. No one likes costly, hidden surprises. Being clear ahead of time prevents misunderstandings and shows your commitment to fair and transparent business practices.


When creating invoices, use straightforward language and specify payment due dates. This expedites the payment process and establishes clear expectations, contributing to your business's streamlined and efficient financial workflow. By prioritizing transparency, you build stronger relationships with vendors and improve the overall efficiency of your financial transactions.Related: 4 Cash Flow Trends To Know About in 2024 3. Streamline processes for efficiencySmall businesses can make things run smoother by simplifying their payment processes. One way is by using software to handle tasks like paying invoices and keeping records automatically. This helps avoid mistakes and speeds up payments. Delayed payments are a common challenge, affecting 93% of companies. Another helpful strategy is setting up a standardized payment approval workflow for invoices, which are reviewed and approved quickly. This ensures that payments happen on time and keeps financial operations running smoothly.Also, adopting digital payments makes transactions faster and more accurate, making it easier for vendors. The total transaction value in the Digital Payments market is set to hit a whopping US $11.55 trillion in 2024! Connecting modern payment solutions with accounting systems is another smart move. This ensures that data is reconciled automatically, reducing the chance of errors and improving overall financial management. And with this, small businesses can save hours a week. Small businesses can make their financial processes more reliable and effective by making these changes.


The impact of streamlined procedures on vendor satisfaction and business success is substantial. Efficient processes mean vendors receive timely payments, fostering trust and reliability. This, in turn, improves the overall vendor experience, leading to stronger relationships.Related: Slow Payment Options Are Costing Your Business — Here's the Alternatives of the Future The success of small businesses hinges on strong vendor relationships built through personalized communication, transparent financial dealings, and streamlined accounts payable processes. Paying bills is not merely a financial transaction but a testament to the trust and reliability underpinning vendor relationships. Businesses uphold integrity and accountability by prioritizing transparent financial transactions, laying the groundwork for enduring partnerships.While technology helps us work more efficiently, the human touch – the personal connections we make – solidifies these relationships. Small businesses should prioritize open communication, mutually beneficial collaboration, and a personal touch to ensure enduring vendor connections, creating a powerful synergy for sustained growth and prosperity.

10,How to Know If Your Business Is Profitable This Very Second,"Feb 26, 2024",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-to-know-if-your-business-is-profitable-this-very-second/469484,"
Here's an example: Alex owns a custom framing store with low prices — just above cost — to attract customers. Volume helped keep the cash coming in. One wall of the shop was devoted to artist's paintings, for which Alex received a percentage of the sale. Until a stationery store opened down the block, Alex was the only person in the area who offered custom framing. In addition to pens and printer paper, the stationery shop devoted a corner to custom framing at 20% less than what Alex charged. Alex quickly put a big sign in the window promoting the same price as the stationery shop — and finished the month in the red.You probably recognize Alex's mistake was changing his prices without assessing how it would affect profitability. It didn't help that Alex didn't know whether the framing shop was profitable to begin with.Alex's reactive pricing decision is one of many that a business finds itself needing to make every day. A contractor must decide on the number of workers to bring on board. A growing business may be offered a great deal on manufacturing equipment for cash today. In these cases, there may not be time to run the numbers to make a decision.



Related: Why This Metric Should Be Prioritized Over Growth for Startup SuccessHow is profit determined?Your profit is the amount you have left after accounting for the cost of operating your business. It's different from your revenue. Here it is expressed as a formula: total revenue - total expenses = profit.


Total revenue is all the money that comes into your business. For Alex's business, it's the money paid for framing plus the money received as a percentage of the paintings on the wall. If framing yielded $84,000 and the painting commissions yielded $24,000, Alex's revenue for the year is $108,000.Alex's total expenses include the materials needed for framing, the shop's rent, utilities and supplies. These add up to $96,000 for the year. Using the basic formula, $108,000 - $96,000 = $12,000 profit.That's not much wiggle room. A 20% drop in framing revenue means an annual revenue of $67,200; with the painting commissions, you're looking at $91,200. If expenses don't change, Alex's framing shop is now unprofitable to the tune of $4,800.What does knowing your profitability let you do?Before the new competition showed up, all Alex knew was that the framing business paid its bills with a little left over. When the market changed, Alex needed to determine how to react.


Knowing exactly where the shop stood might have changed Alex's decision. He might have chosen to reduce prices by only 10% — or not at all — or he may have looked for a way to reduce expenses, like finding a less expensive space to rent.Knowing the profitability of any business enables the owner to react quickly. That can be the difference between profit and loss, as in the case above, or it can add profit. For instance, knowing that there was a $1,000 profit every month might have prompted Alex to rent a stall at a farmer's market for $100 a month, which could have led to $500 worth of extra business, or he could have put more paintings in the shop for sale.Business circumstances change and gainful opportunities present themselves at any time. Not every decision needs to be made in a split-second. However, if you can make one quickly, it can make or break your business. This can also be important if you've taken a loan out for your business. If your profitability is different than what you'd presented to your bank, it might affect the loan terms or interest rate. If your profit is less than expected because of the cost of needed materials, you can find a new vendor.Related: Don't File and Forget: Use Your Receipts to Gain Insight on Business Spending


How do you know whether you're profitable?To get a full picture of your condition, consider using the following tools:Profit and loss statement (or income statement). The basic math for this was covered above, but there can be a large number of elements that go into your profit and loss statement. If you know these now, you can make a decision now.Cash flow statement. A cash flow statement focuses on liquidity. In the example of Alex's framing shop, suppose the commission on paintings was paid only once per year. Alex would be in the red most of the year. The essential formula is:Cash inflow - cash outflow = net cash flow. Cash inflow is any source of incoming cash; sales is the big one. Cash outflow is any source of outgoing cash such as rent, utilities, and taxes.Revenue vs. expenses analysis. Total your revenues and your expenses over a period (say, this month) and compare those to another period (for instance, the previous month or a year ago). You'll see whether your business is making progress and what effect expenses are having on your revenue.Real-time metrics for business healthThe only way to know whether your business is profitable at any moment is to keep on top of your bookkeeping. Alex wanted to frame art, but soon learned that keeping books was necessary. The old-school way to do this was by recording each transaction in a journal. A more modern way is a spreadsheet. Cloud-based storage can help, and there are storage options from all of the major digital players. The most modern way to track your business is a document management system (DMS), which can capture data in multiple ways and store it in the cloud for access from multiple places.Timeliness and accuracy are key. Decide when you will attend to your bookkeeping and don't deviate from your schedule. Be accurate; double-check your entries and your calculations (especially with a spreadsheet). You'll be glad you did when you're making a key decision. If you think you'll need data in an instant, then do your bookkeeping frequently.Related: Want Taxes to Be Easy? Work on Them Year Round, Not Last Minute.


Now is your timeBanks can call loans, business can fall off, competitors can open, consumer demands may change, the perfect storefront may become available, a complementary business may be offered for sale at a great price — any of these may happen to your business at any time. Knowing that your business is profitable enough to react appropriately is the path to success. Do it. Now.

This story originally appeared on Under30CEO.comWhat would happen if you were to pass away? If you're a parent or spouse, it's likely crossed your mind at some point. After all, it's only natural to worry about the future and well-being of your loved ones. There are several ways to protect your family, but life insurance is usually one of the easiest. This way, your loved ones will receive financial security if the worst should happen. But before you begin the process of buying life insurance, you need to do your homework. Here are 8 questions to ask yourself before making a purchase:1. Why do you need life insurance?Life is an unexpected journey. With so many twists and turns, there's no telling what might occur. Having life insurance can give you peace of mind that your family will be cared for if the worst should happen. Here are some reasons you need life insurance:



Financial Protection: Life insurance provides financial support to your loved ones in the event of your death. It can help cover funeral expenses, pay off debts, or replace lost income.Related: 4 Personal Finance Tips Every Entrepreneur Should Know


Income Replacement: If you're the primary breadwinner a policy can provide a source of income for your loved ones after you're gone. It can help replace your income, ensuring that your family can maintain living costs.Debt Repayment: Life insurance can be used to pay off any outstanding debts, such as a mortgage or credit card debt. This can prevent your loved ones from being burdened with these financial obligations after your death.Education Expenses: If you have kids, you can help cover expenses like tuition fees, books, and other needs.Business protection: life insurance can help ensure your business's survival after your death. It can provide funds to cover any business debts, pay off partners, or provide a financial cushion during the transition period.


2. How much cover do you need?No amount of cover is enough to replace a life. However, the amount of coverage a family needs can vary. What might suit one family may not be enough for another,Generally speaking, the amount of coverage you need should be enough to replace your income and cover any outstanding debts. It should also provide a financial cushion for your family to maintain their living standards.Another thing worth protecting is your home. If you have a mortgage, you'll want to ensure it's covered in full. Your family can avoid extra burdens or be forced to sell their home.3. What type of life insurance is best for you?There are several types of life insurance to choose from, depending on your specific needs.


Term life insurance covers you for a specified amount of time, such as 30 years. There are three different levels of cover: decreasing term, level term, and increasing term. While it's usually more affordable, the policy only pays out if you die within the agreed term.Whole life insurance provides cover for your entire life. It also has a cash value component, which means you can use the funds to cover unexpected expenses or retirement planning. This type of policy can be expensive, but you have a guarantee of payout.Suppose you're entering old age and want to set aside something for your children or grandchildren. Then, an Over 50s policy may be more appealing. It's also important to assess your circumstances and consider what you want your payout to cover.Related: 5 tips that will help you improve your personal finances


Choosing the right policy depends on your specific needs, the amount of coverage required, and the desired duration. For example, if you have a mortgage with 20 years remaining, a decreasing term policy may be suitable.4. How much will life insurance cost?Before you get into any commitment it's wise to keep an eye on the cost. Once you take out a policy you're expected to make regular payments. So it's vital to ensure you can afford the premium.The cost of life insurance varies on a range of factors:The type of policy you select – For example, term policies may be cheaper than whole life policies as they only cover you for a specific period.Your age, health, and lifestyle – Older individuals and those with pre-existing health conditions usually have more expensive premiums.The amount of coverage – If you're looking for higher levels of coverage, the premium is likely to be more expensive.Your insurer's rates – Different insurers offer different rates, so shop around to find the most competitive one.5. How long do you need life insurance for?How long you need life insurance depends on your specific situation and the reason for getting it. The duration of your policy could be shorter or longer depending on your needs.


If you plan on covering a mortgage, it's suggested to have cover for the remaining length of your mortgage term. This helps to ensure your loved ones can pay off the mortgage if needed.For those who have family members, the policy should provide cover until they are no longer financially dependent. This is usually until the youngest child turns 18, or before retirement.6. How can you lower your premiums?If you're worried about high premiums, there are a few ways to keep the costs down:Take out cover early – The younger and healthier you are, the lower your premiums may be. So if you decide to take out a policy, it's best to do so as soon as possible.Shop around – Don't be afraid to compare different policies and insurers. This allows you to assess what's available and find the most competitive deal for your situation.Opt for a lower level of cover – You may not need to opt for the highest level of cover. Choose one that's appropriate for your needs.Quit smoking – Smokers typically pay higher premiums than non-smokers. Quitting could make the policy more affordable.Take out joint cover – Ideal for couples as it offers protection for both parties. So if one partner were to pass away, the other would benefit from the same cover.7. What is the claim process for life insurance?The claim process varies depending on the insurer and type of policy you have. Generally, it involves providing evidence that the insured has passed away, such as a death certificate. You may also be required to provide other documentation, such as the original policy documents or proof of identity.


Once you've submitted the necessary documents and information, your insurer will assess your claim and decide whether to approve it. If your claim is accepted, the payout will be paid to your beneficiaries within a few weeks or months.8. Do I need to take a medical exam to get life insurance?Medical exams are often required for applicants looking for high levels of coverage or who have pre-existing health conditions.The exam usually involves a doctor taking your vitals and asking questions about your medical history and current well-being. Depending on the insurer, the results may be used to determine your premiums or eligibility.

Taxes aren't just a once-a-year phenomenon. Filing taxes begins with a plan and a daily routine. If your goal is to learn a language so you can visit a foreign country, learning in small, easy-to-digest segments makes it easy to absorb and retain. When you finally take your trip, it's that much more rewarding.The same is true of taxes. Attacking them in the handful of days before they're due is a formula for stress, error and failure. Breaking down tax-related recordkeeping and related tasks into smaller segments, such as reviewing receipts and invoices an hour a week, makes the process more manageable and less overwhelming. Keeping taxes on your radar all year can even be good for your overall finances.Related: Make Tax Season As Painless as Possible by Taking These 6 Steps



Make a regular tax thingHave you ever skipped mowing your lawn for a few weeks? Suddenly, it's up to your knees, the grass gets stuck in your blades and it takes way longer than it should. The same is true of handling your tax-related finances. If you document and file your receipts and invoices when they're fresh in your mind, they're easy to account for properly. That's why you should look at them regularly — how regularly will depend on how much work there is. I recommend looking at everything at least once a month, but if you're doing a lot of business, you may want to do it every two weeks or even weekly. Just make it part of your routine.An excellent way to handle that is to write down an appointment in your business calendar. Writing it down will help in multiple ways. You should also physically write down what you must address at each session.


When you do that, you can also use the information to look forward. This can be really useful if your income differs from month to month. By seeing what you brought in in the past month, you can:Get a better idea of what your year-end income will be.See whether you may fall short and address that before it's a severe problem.Know which clients are your best.When you know whether your year-end income looks like it will be much different from your previous year or what you expected, you can make plans to have money ready to pay at the end of the year or make adjustments to your estimated tax payments.If you find you'll have more money than you expect, it also provides an opportunity to make investments. You can buy something that will help the business — or even take a larger share home.Don't lose the paperworkYour routine attention to tax-related paperwork will pay off at tax time. This is true whether you'll be doing the filing, an employee will or a tax accountant will. Record the expenses that will count as deductions at your regular session closest to when they happen. This will include regular outlays such as rent; variable outlays such as utilities or internet (note the Internal Revenue Service rules if you're declaring the costs for a home office versus a traditional office or facility); and your business phone. One of the easiest expenses to lose track of is business mileage. Entering mileage and the reason for travel will make things easier when it's time to file.


This is where a document management system (DMS) will help. When your business calendar says it's time to attend to your tax-related recordkeeping, you only need to capture all the relevant documents. Whether it's an invoice, a checking account statement, a receipt or any other support you'll need for the IRS, the best DMS will pull all the data in.Leveraging optical character reading (OCR), such a solution will work from cell phone photographs, existing computer files and email attachments. Then, once the data are stored in the cloud, you can categorize your paperwork by type and manipulate them to produce reports you can use, such as expense or income statements. These also reduce errors that make the IRS unhappy and can result in fines and penalties. And, should the IRS wish to conduct an audit, all of those data will be easily accessible and organized. The IRS even prefers electronic records.Related: 3 Ways to Save Money on Taxes That Most Entrepreneurs MissJust a little bit goes a long wayProductivity experts from David Allen to Tony Robbins and publications like Harvard Business Review and Psychology Today have pointed out that the best way to accomplish a large task is to break it down into smaller ones. Short, productive bursts of time will move you inexorably to the finish line as the year progresses. Visual cues, like a Post-It note on your computer, can help you make year-round tax record management a habit. Be specific about your tasks. Mnemonics help; maybe ""Taco Tuesday"" becomes ""Tax Record Tuesday."" With almost no pain, you'll be prepared when tax season begins. While the procrastinators around you are pulling at their hair and biting their nails, you'll be doing things directly relevant to your business — with every hair in place and nails intact.

14,How AI Is Transforming the Accounting Industry — and What the Future Will Look Like,"Jun 6, 2023",Matt Bontrager,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-ai-is-transforming-the-accounting-industry/452837,"
You can't survive in a fast-paced environment without financial management — there is no argument with that. Bookkeeping is the key to surviving that environment. Historically, bookkeeping has been a labor-intensive and time-consuming process.We are going to see a sweeping shift in how our early adopters in this industry leveraged AI effectively: increased specialized roles, brand distinction across the board and a shift for the better in employee sentiment, to name a few.All of our repetitive tasks and automation will now serve as an intuitive function for the business. With a clear head and focused direction, you will be able to easily mitigate any common human errors.



Addressing the elephant in the room: No, robots are not taking our jobs, but new technology may help us do them better! AI is going to be like QuickBooks on steroids.It is still too early to consider AI a replacement, however, we can look to it for assistance in different ways.Related: 3 Ways Artificial Intelligence Will Transform The World in 2023Data entryIn this industry, you know how monotonous data entry can be, no exaggeration. Thankfully, AI-powered systems can handle the mind-numbing work of data entry and reduce manual effort, time and the risk of human error.Optical character recognition (OCR) technology allows AI algorithms to accurately extract relevant information from invoices, receipts and other financial documents, which then eliminates the need for manual input.We save time, assure accuracy down to the smallest number, and we bookkeepers can outsource our efforts to more important matters.


Real-time data processingThis can be the most time-consuming because you have to interpret financial data in a broad context and consider external factors, market trends and business strategies. So, we can say the time can range from hours to days.AI-powered bookkeeping systems can now integrate with various data sources, such as bank feeds and payment gateways, enabling real-time processing and analysis of financial data in a matter of seconds.What this means is businesses will get instant access to up-to-date insights into their financial health, allowing them to make informed decisions promptly.Immediate access to financial information means businesses can monitor cash flow, identify potential risks and respond swiftly to market changes.


Intelligent financial analysisIntelligent financial analysis is a key strength of AI in the bookkeeping field. We can't make the decisions we do without analyzing day-to-day trends.AI algorithms can analyze large volumes of financial data, identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, and provide valuable insights.These insights enable businesses to gain a deeper understanding of their financial performance, make data-driven decisions and optimize their financial strategies.These systems can assist in cash flow forecasting, profitability analysis, budget optimization and trend identification, empowering organizations to maximize profitability and identify areas for improvement, completely error-free and in the snap of your fingers.


Related: Smart Money: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Wealth ManagementEnhanced security and complianceMerging AI into bookkeeping processes also enhances security and compliance measures.These systems can detect irregularities, anomalies and potentially fraudulent activities within financial data. By continuously monitoring transactions and patterns, AI algorithms can identify potential risks and alert businesses in real-time.As a result, we see strengthened security measures and reduced risks of financial fraud. This AI-powered bookkeeping simultaneously also helps ensure compliance with accounting regulations and standards, reducing the likelihood of errors and penalties.


Scalability and cost-efficiencyScalability and cost-efficiency are one of the most pioneering steps in this growing integration. As businesses grow, the volume and complexity of financial data increases.AI automation allows businesses to handle more significant amounts of data without compromising accuracy or efficiency. This scalability enables organizations to streamline their bookkeeping processes, reducing costs and improving operational efficiency.The best part is that there are no restrictions. AI-powered bookkeeping systems are accessible to businesses of all sizes, leveling the playing field and democratizing financial management capabilities.Personalized financial guidanceThis was a surprise to me, but AI can also bring personalized insights and guidance to the table.


By analyzing historical data, industry benchmarks and market trends, AI-powered systems can offer tailored recommendations and insights based on a business's specific goals and objectives.This personalized guidance empowers businesses to optimize their financial performance, identify growth opportunities and navigate challenges more effectively.However, this is all the more reason that AI should be viewed as a tool that complements and enhances the capabilities of human bookkeepers rather than replacing them. Human professionals bring critical judgment, interpret complex financial situations and provide context for decision-making, ensuring ethical considerations and strategic perspectives are taken into account.Related: Can Computers Replace Human Accountants? We Doubt They Can


What's the future looking like?The big question in all our minds is: Will AI replace human bookkeepers entirely?As I mentioned earlier, it's too early to say.What we need to do is recognize that AI is a powerful tool but not a substitute for human expertise.Yes, it can automate repetitive tasks and provide valuable insights, but human bookkeepers bring a unique set of skills and expertise that go beyond the capabilities of AI. Human bookkeepers also possess a deep understanding of financial principles, industry nuances and the ability to exercise judgment in complex situations that AI can't replicate.


Moreover, human bookkeepers can interpret financial data in a broader context, considering the impact of external factors, market trends and business strategies. We provide personalized advice, taking into account the specific needs and goals of the organization.Humans are essential in maintaining the ethical integrity of financial practices, ensuring compliance with regulations and making decisions with a human touch.We need to look at AI not as a replacement but as a transformer.AI-powered bookkeeping systems enable professionals to streamline their workflows, freeing up time for more strategic tasks that require human judgment and creativity. What we are on the path to is, literally, more time for us, more sophisticated applications and innovation.


We do need to remember that there are always risks. Data privacy and security are critical aspects that need to be addressed. Businesses must ensure that AI-powered systems comply with data protection regulations and employ robust security measures to safeguard sensitive financial information.What we are witnessing is a transformation in financial management practices. AI is going to serve as a collaborative asset, leveraging the strengths of both AI and human professionals to drive financial success and organizational growth.The way I see it, we are controlling the robots, not the other way around.

15,Why You Need to Reimburse Your Employee Expenses Sooner Than Later,"May 8, 2023",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/employee-expenses-need-to-be-reimbursed-quickly-heres-why/448788,"
You may have heard this story (or one like it) before: Imagine this: A top sales executive, Lee, undertakes a sales trip to woo a potential client. The trip successfully bumps your expected revenues for the coming year and beyond quite nicely. Naturally, Lee incurred numerous expenses during the trip — airfare, hotels, rental car, meals and other incidentals. Lee paid these with the understanding the company would reimburse them.But the expenses aren't reimbursed quickly, and Lee's personal savings and credit cards reflect that. As days turn to weeks and months, interest mounts and late fees are incurred, affecting Lee's personal financial history. Lee becomes disenchanted and frustrated, which is followed by job dissatisfaction and diminished performance. Quiet quitting becomes real resignation, with your Lee's valuable skills and connections now working for a competitor that reimburses their employees on time. That lucrative business deal is likely to go with Lee.Related: 5 Simple Steps to Prevent Expense Fraud



What you can do — and what you should doA wide range of business expenses allowed by the IRS often need to be paid by employees. Those that cannot be covered in advance can include unplanned flights, cab or rideshare trips, meals or hotel stays. Other times, employees may be traveling on business with their own vehicle, in which case you should, of course, reimburse them for their mileage and vehicular wear and tear. Other common categories of reimbursable expenses may include training, professional dues, supplies, tools and parts and entertainment (note, while you may elect to reimburse employees for expenses such as taking a customer to a sporting event, those costs are not deductible for you and haven't been since the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act).The importance of being timely and accurateAccuracy in tracking your business expenses is important because most, if not all, purchases made by an employee on behalf of your company are for items and services that can be deducted against your taxes.


Some businesses often re-bill expenses to a customer. Examples might be a plumbing or electrical contractor whose employee may need to pick up a plumbing or electrical fixture at a hardware or building supply store.Employees who lay out their own funds on behalf of your business deserve to be repaid straightaway for myriad reasons. First, the business — and the risks and expenses — is yours and not theirs. You may pay them a salary, but it's not up to them to carry cash or expenses to earn you a profit or secure future business. Don't leave them on the hook for doing you a favor any longer than necessary. Prompt payment also underscores your commitment to them as valued employees.Related: Don't Throw Money Away By Not Monitoring Expense ReportsRules are neededIt also helps when employees understand what they're expected to do on your behalf. Give guidelines to employees asked to spend their money on your behalf. That would start with your budget for certain expenses. Establish this in advance. And while the annual list of crazy expense report submissions is amusing to read — from helicopter rides to work to hang gliders ""to avoid a divorce"" — you don't want your business to show up on that list. Often a budget solves this problem, with the added benefit that you don't have to approve every two-dollar purchase.


As reimbursable expenses are realized, they should be recorded promptly using your preferred system. This may be a spreadsheet, but many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) use contract bookkeepers or bookkeeping platforms. More often, they rely on document management systems with expense-tracking features that use optical character reading (OCR) to input data such as receipts and invoices. These documents can be captured in multiple ways, including photographing them, emailing them directly to a cloud server, importing them directly from a computer or scanning them.Once converted by OCR technology, the data can be manipulated in pretty much any method that makes sense. For instance, you may track them for each salesperson you have, you may track them by which department puts in the request or you can track them by client or project. Your employee can do the entry, too.Using a cloud-based system that will let you capture receipts in this way means you can avoid the complexity — and errors — of re-keying information and managing spreadsheets. You can sort the data by category, by vendor or by date. Compare that with spreadsheets, where remembering which tab your expense belongs on and ensuring each cell has the proper equations make it that much harder to reimburse your employees promptly. Paper files have similar flaws. Plus, paper can be lost, misfiled or damaged in tragic coffee-spill accidents.These platforms are also more efficient, which goes hand-in-hand with saving time and money. They make review and control simple, too. Pay your employees back quickly, while gaining insight into what's being spent and for what purpose. You can then make any spending adjustments needed and please your employees.


Related: This One Thing Can Make Managing Your Company's Expenses Super EasyWhat's in it for you?Doing your reimbursements quickly avoids both errors and fraud. It's a risk that's twice as high in SMBs and more damaging to them.But paying back your employees without delay provides key benefits to you. It improves employee morale and job satisfaction, which makes them better employees. Being anxious when your expenses damage their own finances can also hurt their on-the-job performance and spark resentment. And suppose your reimbursement practices become a problem for employees. In that case, it can also make it difficult to recruit new, high-performing employees.But when you give employees their money back promptly, everyone will be happy, resulting in time and resources spent on growing the business.

Rich Mintzer's new book, Start Your Own Pet Business, outlines everything you need to know about launching and growing an animal-based business from your home. In this excerpt, he dives into the specifics of managing your finances to keep your business as healthy and happy as your tail-wagging clients.Sign up for an accounting workshopNo matter if you are caring for two dogs or two hundred, every business needs to keep track of money coming in and money going out. One way to make the accounting and financial framework of your business less daunting is to take an accounting class. You can find many online classes, as well as articles, on basic accounting and/or managing finances for a small business. You can also check with your local Small Business Development Center (SBDC), which may offer small-business accounting classes or keep a list of classes offered through local community colleges or continuing-education programs at a local university. Be logical when you sign up for an accounting class—don't sign up for a class that covers information beyond your current need or ability to understand. You don't need to know how to read the financial report of a $60 million international company to run your $20,000 local pet-sitting operation.Keep receiptsIf you have ever had even the smallest business or if you have ever worked for anyone else, you probably have heard this before, but it bears repeating: Keep every receipt for any dime you spend on the business. Keep them in one place and record them in your ledger at least weekly. These records tell you a lot about your business. You may notice patterns, expenditures that seem excessive, or other changes you could make for your business to be more efficient.



Related: Dive deeper with Start Your Own Pet Business on sale nowSet up a separate checking accountBecause pet-sitting businesses often don't take a lot of capital to set up, you have to be careful not to fall into the trap of starting your business and simply using your personal checking account to pay for expenses and to deposit income. Set up a separate checking account and designate it for the business. Pay for everything with this account, even if you use its debit card instead of actually writing a check. It doesn't have to be a ""business"" checking account—another personal account will do—just give the business an account all its own. Not only is it good for keeping accurate track of expenses, but some psychological aspects result from having separate accounts and ledgers for taking yourself and your business seriously. Have the business name printed on your business-specific checking account—it lends an air of professionalism.


Get bookkeeping softwareMany software programs exist for easy setup of bookkeeping for your small business. Two commonly used ones are QuickBooks and Microsoft Office. Set aside a large chunk of time to get yourself set up, and then set aside time on an ongoing basis, maybe an hour weekly and a morning monthly. Be sure to keep these software products up-to-date by signing up for automatic updates or reminders so you can keep as up-to-date as possible. Although the bookkeeping programs probably won't have as much in the way of updates, tax programs have constant updates. If you know yourself well enough to know you are not going to set aside this time to feed your bookkeeping software, then hire an accountant. The same goes for tax time. You may want to enlist a small business tax expert to decipher what expenses can and can not be deducted, at least for the first year of running your business. Creating invoices and receiptsEven if you require payment on the spot, you always want to provide your client with an invoice for your services. This allows both of you to keep a record of your visits. Depending on how fast your business plan shows your business increasing revenue and adding clients, you may want to think early on about having client software that keeps records of your clients. If you look to have only ten clients for the first year, you could create a spreadsheet using Excel or Google Sheets. As you grow, you may want to invest in a business software package. Besides generating invoices, it keeps an easy-to-access history of services you provided.Related: Pet Lovers, Here's How to Get Your Dream Business or Side Hustle StartedPayment optionsThe easiest manner in which to collect money in a business such as pet-sitting might be good old cash or a simple account transfer via an app like Venmo or PayPal because your fees are typically for only a few hours at a time. As your company grows, you'll want to look into having credit card options, such as the easy-to-use Square payment system, which allows you to use your cell phone as a mobile cash register (https://squareup.com). This will entail setting up a credit card merchant account, a bank account, and a way to process payments. Some startup payment fees and fees per transaction (which are usually around 2 to 4 percent) apply. The merchant account will allow you to accept payments through Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and other credit card companies. You can Google merchant services and compare options.


Paying yourselfOne of the perks of opening a low-cost, no-overhead business is you can usually start taking some money for yourself early on while putting the rest into the business. If you know your ongoing expenses, you can cover them and have some money left over. If, however, you are looking to build a large pet-sitting business with offices and many employees, then—like most startups—you will need to put nearly all the money earned back into the business for the first year or two. This means you need to have some money set aside to help you pay your bills when starting the business. If you can afford to do this, that's great—you should probably plan to do this for at least the first year, depending on how complex a business you establish.

20,How This New Accounting Feature Can Save Businesses From Fraud and Financial Mishap,"Jan 9, 2023",Nick Chandi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/what-is-auto-reconciliation-how-can-it-save-small/441240,"
Imagine this. John Carter begins his job as the country club's new finance and administration director by reconciling its payroll journal entries with employee payroll logbooks provided by its payroll processor. It takes him weeks and distracts him from other important issues. Eventually, Carter deduces that the club's HR director is misappropriating thousands of dollars in overpayments to herself and other employees.Without reconciliation, Carter might not have been able to discover the fraud. He might have caught it sooner — maybe even prevented it — if the club had a monthly or biweekly reconciliation policy that provided tight oversight of its bookkeeping.Reconciliation reliably helps monitor cash by cross-validating accounting data with an independent financial record like a bank statement to reduce errors, duplicated entries and inaccurate information.



Does your accounting data show more cash than is available in your bank account? Maybe a customer's payment bounced, or you forgot to account for bank fees. Reconciliation bolsters the integrity of your bookkeeping, helps monitor cash flow, identifies fraud, prevents overspending, and creates accurate financial statements.Related: Six Technology Trends Every Bank Should Be Ready For In 2021 


Small and medium-sized businesses have very limited resources, typically with one overworked accountant reconciling financial records manually. Depending on factors like a small business's purchasing and sales values, number of employees, operational history, etc., reconciling can be time-consuming, laborious and error-prone. Consider the steps involved:Logging onto the banking portal.Downloading bank statements.Manually comparing each entry against its counterpart in the accounting records.Documenting the process across multiple spreadsheets.A misstep at any stage, with any entry, can jeopardize the whole process.Moreover, most payment methods take time to settle. Here's a breakdown:Related: How to Protect Your Small Business Against Fraud


Payment methods and settlement timesACH (Automated Clearing House) creditApprox. 1 business dayACH debitApprox. 1-2 business daysSame-day ACH credit1 business daySame-day ACH debit1 business dayWire transferInstantReal-time payments (RTP)InstantChecks3-7 daysSome of these settlement times force a lag that masks the available balance, which transactions are still processing, and when different sets of transactions are likely to settle. Small businesses usually work with thin margins, and making financial decisions on outdated or faulty information can be incredibly costly.Banks also process transactions in batches. A small business may make ten separate ACH credit transactions of $1,000, yet, the bank processes it as one $10,000 transaction, making it challenging to tie each payment to the appropriate transaction on the bank statement.Related: How To Properly Write a Check in 5 Simple StepsAutomatic reconciliation solves these issues by uploading and cross-validating banking records with their accounting platforms. It offers accurate financial statements, sped up bookkeeping and improves financial management. With small businesses under increasing pressure to close their books faster, think of the time, cost and labor savings owners could have with auto-reconciliation.


But businesses are limited in choice. Some auto-reconciliation tools require manual intervention, like uploading bank statements, while major accounting platform providers like QuickBooks allow users to import banking data for cross-verification via proprietary APIs with large financial institutions. But what if a small business banks with a financial institution that doesn't link with their accounting platform or vice versa?Related: How Open Banking Can Benefit Small BusinessesBanks have a real opportunity here — to get ahead of the curve and offer true auto-reconciliation through a universal accounting API that pushes banking transactions directly into any and every accounting system. Auto-reconciliation via APIs ensures that a business's accounting records are always up-to-date because its bank automatically populates its accounting platform with real-time information. Offering a universal accounting API ensures that banks never come up short in serving the small business community and that businesses never have to think twice about whether their banks and accounting systems are compatible.The broad application of APIs in the banking industry offers immense value to other services, like loan origination. Lending APIs streamline and accelerate the underwriting process by establishing a direct connection between lenders and loan applicants, increasing transparency and access and reducing the potential for fraud. Banks with supercharged services via third-party APIs are becoming more common in places like the UK, where open banking is government-mandated.

The reality is that auto-reconciliation is one small business need that speaks to a larger one: Small businesses need specialized care. Banks must catch up or risk losing customers to competitors who understand the game and are expanding to access a broader range of niche services. Banks and payment providers that quickly offer value-added services via APIs to their small business clients will benefit long-term through client retention.Of course, technology is not 100% foolproof — some degree of manual checking will still be necessary. But by offering their small business clients a chance to automate a critical accounting process, banks can invest both in their clients and their own futures.

21,14 Tax Deductions Your Small Business Might Be Overlooking,"Dec 22, 2022",Jim Conroy,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/14-tax-deductions-your-small-business-might-be-overlooking/439024,"
While there are other benefits, one of the most important reasons you're in business is to make money. And it stands to reason that if you're in business, you'd like to keep as much of what you generate as possible. That could be why so many people hate paying taxes.But if you're doing your bookkeeping correctly, you'll find there are ways to keep some of the value your business generates. All you want to do is pay your fair share. And keep what's left to run a successful small business or grow that business into something even bigger.Above all, remember that you pay taxes on your profit, and your profit is your income minus your ordinary expenses; you report this to the IRS every year on Schedule C. So when you sit down to do your taxes or hand your information over to your tax accountant, you should be sure you've tracked every single business expense.



Related: These Are the Top Tax Filing Mistakes Made by Small Business Owners (and How to Avoid Them)What deductions are obvious? Anything you buy that directly affects your business and is used for your business. If you're in construction, it's the cost of your equipment and raw materials. If you're a web designer, it's the software you use. Look at Schedule C and you'll see the obvious ones: advertising, office expenses, licenses, utilities and more.


You need to be careful defining some expenses, especially if you're running your business out of your home. Yes, you can deduct the part of your home that you use exclusively and regularly for business. But if you work weekdays at your home office and watch football from it on Sunday, it's not exclusive to your business. If you only do your month-end bookkeeping in it — even if that's all you do in it — once-a-month office use is not considered regular use.But when you're assembling your receipts or downloading expense data from your small business financial management system to provide to your tax accountant, there are certainly some expenses that you might not have thought to include. There may be other expenses you claim that are not eligible deductions. If filed in error, these mistakes could cost you fines — or worse — if you've deducted more than you should have or are permitted to.Related: Here's Why It Pays to Track Every Tiny Business ExpenseTax deductions you might be missingWhile Schedule C enumerates 21 types of expenses, you still might miss some perfectly legal deductions. For instance:


Repairs or alterations to your home office: If you're there all the time, then expenses like painting, re-flooring and brighter light fixtures would be deductible. Having a cleaning service for your office would be as well. The desk and file cabinets you use would also be deductible — as would the repair to the wall after your desk chair banged it up.Education: Any education or training related to what you do to earn money is deductible. Many professionals require professional development courses to keep their licenses current. Others take classes to learn how to improve their business. If it's relevant, it's deductible.Local travel: When you visit a client and pay to park in the lot across the street, that parking fee is deductible. If you take a toll bridge to cross the river to visit your client's office, that bridge toll is deductible. And so is your mileage, assuming your client doesn't reimburse you for those costs.Your website: A website is a must-have to find and connect with new and existing customers. All related costs can be deductible — paying the person who creates it for you, paying for the website to be hosted, paying for its security, paying for the pictures and copy you post to it, etc. It's all part of advertising, which is more than paying to run a small ad on your local radio or television station.Startup costs: If this is your first year, the legal and professional fees you pay to complete and file your paperwork are deductible. Fees above the $5,000 first-year limit can be amortized over the succeeding 15 years.Research and development: If you're creating a new product, the expenses relevant to bringing that product to market are deductible.Interest on debts: A loan you take for business purposes is tax-deductible as long as it's an arms-length transaction. Keep track of the interest costs so you can deduct them at tax time. Your business credit card interest is also deductible.Industry publication subscriptions: Every trade has a publication that keeps its practitioners current, from Advertising Age to Chain Store Age to Industry Week. Online subscriptions are also deductible.Retirement savings for self-employed business owners: These include self-employed simplified employee pension (SEP) plans, solo 401(k) plans and Keogh or HR-10 plans.Business gifts: There's a limit of $25 per person per year for gifts to clients. But, 100 percent of the cost of employee meals at events such as holiday parties and company picnics is deductible.Perks for your employees: Coffee in the office? That candy bowl at the front desk? 100 percent deductible. Lunch brought into the office can be fully deductible, while taking the team out for lunch is only 50 percent deductible.Club or organization membership fees: The organization must be business- or community-related, such as a chamber of commerce, trade association or a professional organization.Lawn mowing: If you receive clients at your home office, keeping the entrance to your house clean and presentable may be deductible.Childcare for solo professionals: If you're a parent and have a home office but you need to meet a client outside the home, childcare is deductible. If you're leaving the house to go shopping, it's not.Related: 75 Items You May Be Able to Deduct from Your TaxesJust remember, you can't deduct what you aren't tracking. Prior to the 1980s, you didn't have many options — record-keeping systems included paper, pencils and file cabinets. The late 20th century made spreadsheets an option, which required ensuring formulas were put into the correct cells as well as remembering where the related backup documentation was saved.The modern era has given way to even better ways of tracking information, and distilling years of accounting and bookkeeping know-how into an easy-to-use software platform. Now you can stay on top of all of the purchase orders, invoices and receipts you'll need as a backup to your accounting records. And, have them all safe in a cloud-based system. Files, images, emails and scanned paper documents can be captured from a mobile device or a computer and stored safely online. You can categorize all transactions easily by account category and relevant tax schedule for subsequent reporting and filing.These systems can be accessed from anywhere your business takes you, from home office to factory floor to out-of-state business pitch. You can pull them up when needed (such as for a loan application, a meeting with your accountant or deciding on financing a business improvement).


Consider financial document management solutions that can also automatically extract data from these documents. Instead of keying these numbers into a spreadsheet or paying your tax accountant to do this manual work, systems like Neat automatically feed financial data to accounting and tax software. These systems can make it easier to account for all of your business expenses — the obvious ones and those that can be often overlooked.Related: The Most Forgotten Tax Deductions Business Owners Should Take

22,How to Master Bookkeeping for Your Business Without an Accounting Degree,"Aug 4, 2022",Garrett Baird,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/your-complete-guide-to-bookkeeping-for-your-business/431193,"
Bookkeeping is the foundation for all small business insight. If you're running a small business, you've got to make it habitual. All too often, bookkeeping is put aside by small business owners to tackle the most pressing matter of the moment. If it's not that, it's procrastination or number phobia (the fear of getting it wrong).Trust me, don't put it aside. Far too many small business owners often allow a backlog of transactions and expenses to build up before organizing them, which can hurt your business in at least two significant ways.First, it creates confusion. Up-to-date bookkeeping tells you the critical things you need to know. Without it, you'll only have a rough idea of how much money you have, which outstanding bills you need to pay and whether you have been paid for the goods or services you provide.



Second, ignoring bookkeeping makes paying your taxes more complicated. There are few things worse than being on a deadline and having to sort through a paper bag full of receipts for items you can deduct — at the same time you're trying to meet a deadline for a client. Using a tax accountant or preparer isn't cheap, either.Here's the good news: You don't need a finance degree to understand and benefit from bookkeeping. The double-entry bookkeeping method, the way accounting is done today, dates back to the 15th century. If you've ever made a checklist of items needed to complete a task and then marked the items off as they were gathered or accomplished, you've got the gist of bookkeeping.


Related: Finding the Right Solution for Your Bookkeeping NeedsBookkeeping 101When you're ready to undertake your own bookkeeping, here's the syllabus for your non-degree course:Accounts. Accounts group similar business activities for ease of analysis (i.e. a sales account). The complete list of your accounts is called your chart of accounts. Items on this list include sales, cost of goods sold, salaries — all of the business activities you do.Accounting period: This is the specific stretch of time over which you're looking at your business. For instance, you may want to know how you did in February. Or the third quarter. Or the year. Or since you've started advertising.Accounts payable: This is money you currently owe vendors or suppliers but haven't yet paid. If you've bought a computer that you haven't yet paid for, that's an account payable.Accounts receivable: You've done the work and sent the bill, but the client's check is in the mail. That's an account receivable.Accruals: Expenses or revenue you've incurred but haven't paid yet (this means accounts payable and accounts receivable are accruals). If you're using accrual-based accounting, you record accruals (both positive and negative) at the time of the sale. In cash-based accounting, you would have recorded when you paid or received the money. The benefit of accrual-based accounting is that it lets you know that while you may have cash on hand, you shouldn't spend it freely. You might owe for that shipment of raw materials you just received. Conversely, you may have worked all month for one client but haven't yet been paid for that work.Assets: Things you own, physical or intangible. These might be items such as property, vehicles, cash, a computer, or the right to use a particular parking space.Balance sheet: This document summarizes all your assets (what you own) and compares them to all of your equity and all of your liabilities (what you owe). With it, you can assess the overall financial health of your organization.Cash flow: A comparison of the money you usually receive against the money you need to pay.Cost of goods sold (COGS): If you make a product, the sum of the costs is directly related to making that product. So, if you're a bakery, these would be materials such as flour, sugar, and eggs, as well as the cost of using the kitchen in which you bake. After you subtract your cost of goods sold from your net sales (that's your total sales revenues fewer sales discounts, allowances or returns), you get your gross profit.Double-entry bookkeeping: By recording each entry as credit and debit, you see the source of your money and where you're spending it. This makes it easier to catch errors. Credit cash when you buy an asset; debit an asset account (for instance, ""computer expense"") when you spend money for that asset. When you check everything, it's called creating a trial balance, which is just a way of telling you whether your debits and credits are accurate. If your debits and credits don't match, someone must go through each item until you find the source of the error. While laborious, catching these discrepancies is the real benefit of double-entry bookkeeping.Equity: The value of your business after you've paid back your liabilities and who owns it (that equity might be all yours or shared with a partner or investors).Expenses: What you spend to keep your business running. Your expenses might be items you need to make a product you sell. These might include the cost of renting your building, your office supplies, your payroll and the like.General ledger: This traditionally lists all the individual accounts needed to delineate the assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expense, gain and loss transactions of your business. Rather than exhaustively list every transaction (say, the wire you bought weekly starting in January), it summarizes from the chronological listings in journals, such as a raw inventory journal or a sales receipts journal.Income statement (profit-and-loss statement): This document compares revenue to your expenditures to reveal whether your business made or lost money in a given accounting period.Liabilities: Money you owe but haven't paid, such as outstanding invoices, credit card balances, and any business loans you've taken out. If your business's liabilities total more than its assets, your business is in trouble.Payroll: The complete list of your employees and how much each is paid, as well as how much you pay in tax and retirement contributions.Related: Five Bookkeeping Tips for Business OwnersBookkeeping 102The next non-MBA skill you need to learn is diligent and accurate recordkeeping. Spoiler alert: A box full of unorganized receipts and related financial papers that you don't look at until minutes before tax time is neither efficient nor recordkeeping.


Watch for other systems that seem as if they should work, but are flawed. For instance, keeping your journals in notebooks or file folders — no matter how easily accessible — can be tedious and might lead to errors. Likewise, spreadsheets seem compact, they're flexible and most people have a basic understanding of them. Still, they lend themselves easily to error and can quickly become complex.Here's what really works in mastering your bookkeeping: an online platform into which your data can be quickly scanned and one that systematically links with your bank accounts and credit cards.Such a platform is easy to set up and can automatically perform most of the tasks that best help you. There are several platforms like this (such as Neat and QuickBooks) that feature the ability to categorize your expenditures and income into standard accounts to help you quickly understand your business finances and where opportunities exist to improve.So go ahead and toss your cap into the air. In just these few minutes of reading this article, you've mastered the essence of bookkeeping without an accounting degree. Now go forth and be profitable.

24,Finding the Right Solution for Your Bookkeeping Needs,"Jun 2, 2022",Garrett Baird,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/finding-the-right-solution-for-your-bookkeeping-needs/426871,"
As a small business, you don't want multiple systems taking care of your bookkeeping, invoicing and financial documents. Perhaps you create your invoices in spreadsheets or word-processing documents, eyeball expenses in online banking and maintain your employee records in an HR folder in the cloud. Some data may be in a file hosting service, while others are password-protected locally on your computer.It can be confusing to others who may need to work with those documents — and for you to lose track of what is where. When you need that information come tax time or for a loan application, you may need to reference those scattered documents. That can take forever to find, and there's a real risk of losing data or even using the wrong data.If you've yet to encounter any serious errors or problems handling your own bookkeeping, you may be tempted to maintain the status quo. However, your financial organization needs will continue to grow more complicated as time passes. Your business may grow wildly, multiplying the number of things to track and complicating your routine. Or, if you haven't been paying much attention to bookkeeping, you're probably tempting fate.

Or you could have all your files, invoices, transactions, bank accounts, customer payments and credit cards flow into one easy-to-use financial management system. Such a system saves time by automatically parsing through your documents or receipts. You can scan and upload everything to a central digital location, capturing essential information without ever having to think about it. No spreadsheet does that on its own. Such a system would be automatic and uncomplicated, instantly searchable on all content and would make it easy to analyze information and make decisions based on that analysis.Gartner, a technology research and consulting firm, examined process automation in accounting and discovered that 89% of general accounting tasks were highly automatable.Such a system would organize your data while reducing or eliminating the time you spend manually entering data. It would make it easy to identify discrepancies in your records without annoying and time-consuming searches in physical files and journals, spreadsheets, documents and boxes of receipts. Most importantly, you'd have a clear picture of your business — and financial control while spending the least amount of your time bookkeeping.Seek the ideal solutionSeveral providers offer automated solutions for financial management, available for both desktops and mobile apps. They simplify the process of organizing and automating your small business bookkeeping, including invoicing and document management.


Look for cloud storage for your financial documents, which reduces clutter while boosting efficiency. It's especially helpful when files can be scanned or captured on a mobile device and uploaded to the cloud.There, the documents are processed and reconciled, and you can even generate reports instantly.Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Manage Their Business Finances With SuccessAutomated invoicing that creates and tracks your branded invoices and receives payments is another capability that should be of interest to you. Offering your customers electronic payment options speed your time to cash significantly with no more trips to the mailbox or bank branch. And, if you link to your bank account and credit cards, your transactions populate seamlessly while providing you reports on money in and money out.


Some platforms offer bank-level security, as well, with all data encrypted in transit and stored in secure databases. Another great feature you can find with financial management software is the ability to securely share files and comment on documents with the accountant who does your taxes without the need for large email attachments.When selecting a financial management platform, look for one whose all-in-one solutions for small teams and sole proprietors don't require extensive accounting knowledge. Live customer support and setup assistance would be a great plus, too. You and your employees will save time and energy while automating the production of critical financial documents that require analysis like P&Ls, cash flow statements, balance sheets, and expense reports. If the platform enables your data to be searched, having all your data quickly accessible and generating automated reports will mean you'll spend less time entering data or running down receipts, invoices, and bank statements, and more time growing your business.In the end, one solution — without spreadsheets and accordion files — means that you can spend less time managing your books. You're not in business to do bookkeeping, but you're not in business without bookkeeping.

25,5 Questions All Entrepreneurs Should Ask Before Hiring an Accountant,"Mar 25, 2022",Kale Goodman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-questions-all-entrepreneurs-should-ask-before-hiring-an/421238,"
When you are in the beginning stages of starting a business, it is often challenging to balance all the necessary assets you need to be successful.One of the most influential people you should have on your team is a competent accountant or accounting and tax planning firm. Whether you are a one-person operation, have a few employees or your business is established and has hundreds or thousands of employees, having an accountant to help guide you with tax returns, audits and bookkeeping is necessary.But how do you find the right accountant for you?



It can be overwhelming and sometimes costly for a business owner to find the right person for the job. The key to finding the right accountant is asking the right questions upfront to understand if he or she is the right fit, but when you're starting a business, it might be hard to know what those right questions are.Related: Why Accounting Skills Are Indispensable for EntrepreneursHere are the five questions you should be asking when you consult different agencies or accounting firms to hire for your bookkeeping and accounting needs. 1. What industries do you specialize in or have the most expertise in?Not all businesses are the same. Similarly, not all accountants are the same.Your business is in a particular niche and has specific requirements for billing, bookkeeping and accounting. If you're a medical provider billing insurance, your books are going to look completely different compared to an ecommerce business. You don't want to miss out on nuanced expertise. Finding someone with a background in your type of business will help you decide on the right company or person to hire. Every business is different, and you will need someone who knows how to navigate that accordingly. 


2. What is your business model?Asking questions about their business model and mode of operation is an important differentiating factor.  Some accounting and bookkeeping firms will charge you for every minute you spend with them, whether it's on the phone or in person. Newer companies like Easier Accounting operate on a different model. We set you up with a subscription that allows you unlimited access to our accountants for questions and consultations.For some, it may work to have someone who bills hourly because you only need him or her a couple of times per year. For others, it works a lot better to have open lines of communication without the fear of spending 15 minutes of billable time for a 15-second question. Know your expectations and ask the right questions to understand if they can fulfill them. Different businesses and business owners will require different types of business models. For newer business owners, working with someone who will mentor and help you is generally the best, but it usually comes with a monthly retainer instead of hourly pricing.3. How many services do you offer?Sometimes it can be good to have multiple sets of eyes on your books. Using one company for bookkeeping and another for tax preparation can have certain advantages, but most of the time, it makes things messier.


Asking about the services they offer is an essential question for many reasons. A lot of this comes down to expectations and an understanding of what your business will need. A record of transactions, known as bookkeeping, is the basic foundation of accounting, but there are other facets of accounting and financials like tax planning and preparation. Knowing how cohesive their operation is should be a factor in your decision to hire a firm. If they are only available to do bookkeeping but can't help with tax filing or audits, you may find better value elsewhere.Many accountants are a one-person show, and it works for some businesses, but other accounting businesses are firms with different departments. This allows the employees to have a deep understanding of their area of expertise while allowing the business to help with multiple aspects of your financials. This specialization is the most efficient way of operating the back end of your business and is something to look for in an accounting firm.Related: 5 Trends Driving Disruption in the Accounting Industry 


4. Are you a single person or a firm? To add to the last question, since it is hard for one person to cover everything well, do they have a team of people who are well-educated and who specialize in a specific service? Knowing more about your accountant and their business can help you find reassurance that you're going to have the best service possible. A firm that does tax planning, bookkeeping and tax preparation and has departments for each will stand head and shoulders above a single-person operation.Some people who are used to dealing with one individual and like to build rapport with that individual may not enjoy the experience as much. Still, you should understand that a single person generally can't serve your business the same way a firm can.5. Do you offer both compliance and advisory services?As touched on above, with larger firms or accounting businesses, it is not uncommon that the company you hire will handle only bookkeeping and tax preparation. While this will keep you in compliance with the IRS, it won't help you strategize to get the most significant tax return possible. 


Understanding the capacity of these firms is essential. Since many firms are only focused on compliance but don't help you maximize your tax return with strategies upfront, you'll want to find one that does both, especially as your business grows and becomes more complicated.Related: Every Entrepreneur Should Know AccountingThere are a lot of questions that don't necessarily have answers when you start a business, whether it is large or small. But having as many resources at your disposal as possible will make the journey less stressful. When you look for an accountant, find a business you can trust and someone you can turn to when things become stressful. It is best to find someone who will be patient and willing to admit when he or she doesn't have an answer — an accountant who will not shy away from seeking an outside opinion or turning to his or her team.


As hard as it is to navigate the bookkeeping, taxes, audits, etc., for your business, hiring someone to help guide you through this process is worth every bit of financial cost and mental focus.

30,Use a Balance Sheet to Evaluate the Health of Your Business,"Feb 8, 2022",Joseph Ferriolo,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/use-a-balance-sheet-to-evaluate-the-health-of-your-business/415147,"
One of the tools that can be used to assess the performance of your business or organization is a balance sheet. A balance sheet, which should be a part of the financial model in your business plan, categorizes your assets (everything you own), your liabilities (everything you owe) and your equity (the financial contributions made by all owners in the business). The cardinal rule for a balance sheet is that your total assets should equal the sum of your total liabilities and total equity (i.e., assets = liabilities + equity). If this equation isn't true, then it's because of an accounting error, not because your business is performing badly.Balance sheets can be difficult to understand since a change in your assets almost always involves a change in either your liabilities or equity (or vice versa) in order for the equation above to remain true. While it would take more than an article to explain all of the intricacies involved in balancing a balance sheet, the following information will help you know what should be factored into your balance sheet and where.Related: 3 Reasons Why You Can't Trust Your Personal Balance Sheet



Current and long-term assetsAssets fall into one of two categories: current assets or long-term assets. The following are some common examples of current assets.CashYour cash is simply the money that you have in the bank or perhaps another location where it is readily available.Accounts receivableThis one doesn't apply to every business or organization, but accounts receivable is money owed to your business that has not yet been received. Your car insurance company probably sends your bill about one to two months before it is due. From the time the invoice is issued until the time the bill is paid, the amount of the bill would be an example of an account receivable to the insurance company.Inventory


Your inventory is items that are used up as a direct result of fulfilling customer orders and that need to be replenished to continue fulfilling orders. A good rule of thumb is that your inventory should be synonymous with the cost of goods sold in your income statement — except that in your income statement, you're factoring the amount of these goods used to generate the revenue you earned, whereas in the balance sheet, you're factoring the total amount of these goods that you have on hand.The assets mentioned above are considered ""current assets"" because your supply of them comes and goes, so the value of each can vary at any point in time. Many businesses also have long-term assets. The following are some examples of things that would go under long-term assets when applicable.Furniture, fixtures and equipmentFurniture, fixtures and equipment (FFE) includes any tangible objects that your company has purchased that help the business make money but are not used up and replenished. Stoves and ovens would be good examples of equipment for a restaurant while chairs and desks would be good examples of furniture for an office.


Intellectual propertyThis doesn't apply as often, especially for small businesses, but intellectual property involves intangible assets that often serve as legal protections for your ideas. Patents, copyrights and trademarks are prime examples of intellectual property.DepreciationAlthough not a cash expense, depreciation is factored into a balance sheet since long-term assets depreciate over time. For intellectual property, amortization is the appropriate term since such property doesn't go down in value per se, but only provides protection for a specific period.


Related: Being in Business for More Than Just a Balance SheetCurrent and long-term liabilitiesLike assets, liabilities are grouped into current and long-term. Here are some examples of current liabilities.Accounts payableAccounts payable includes any non-outstanding monies your business owes but hasn't yet paid. If you hire a professional cleaning company to clean your office in a given month and have not yet paid your bill (but are still within the date the bill is due), then the cost of the cleaning would be an example of an account payable. Accounts payable also includes recurring bills that are paid in full on a monthly basis but don't involve paying off any outstanding debt over a long period of time. Phone bills and utility bills are good examples of accounts payable.


Current borrowingCurrent borrowing isn't as common, but if you have a line of credit for your business, then the cost of any purchases made in a given month would be considered current borrowing until you pay your credit card bill, assuming you pay it the next month.The liabilities mentioned above are considered ""current liabilities"" because they will presumably be paid off and zero-balanced in the short-term. If a recurring bill, then it will presumably be paid the next month.Long-term liabilities are debts taken out by your business that are repaid over a long period of time. A bank loan used to fund your business is a prime example of a long-term liability.


EquityThe following are examples of the equity expressed in the balance sheet.Paid-in capitalPaid-in capital factors any financial contributions made by the owners into the business. These contributions are most commonly made when the business starts although cash injected into the business at a later date would also be factored here after the fact. It should be noted that if an owner withdraws any amount of this money at any point in time, then that amount would no longer be factored (the same amount would be depleted from the cash in your assets to balance).Earnings


Earnings is basically your net profit (or loss) for the period in which your are reporting. So, if you if your balance sheet is for the year 2021, then your net profit for all of 2021 would be your earnings.Retained earningsWhile your earnings factor in your net profit for the current reporting period, your retained earnings factor in your accumulated net profit or loss from previous years. So, if you started in your business in 2021, your retained earnings for 2021 will be $0 since retained earnings are based on the previous reporting period. However, your 2021 earnings (i.e., your net profit as explained in the previous point) would be what you show in your 2022 balance sheet for your retained earnings. Then, you would add your net profit for 2022 to your retained earnings for 2022 (or subtract your net loss) to determine your retained earnings for 2023.Balance sheets can be complicated, but once you understand what they factor in and how to read them, they can be beneficial for evaluating the health of your business.

34,How a Company's Relationship With Its Accounting Firm Changes as It Grows,"Oct 8, 2021",Frank Milone,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-a-companys-relationship-with-its-accounting-firm/383573,"
Every company in every industry has accounting needs, and those needs change dramatically as a company grows and expands. When a company has a true partnership with an accounting firm, it's able to think multiple steps ahead and make sure there's a plan in place.While each company is unique, some general qualities tend to define a successful relationship with an accounting firm at each stage.Companies engaging an accounting firm for the first timeIf your company is reaching out to an accounting firm, it's likely because you are reacting to a need such as tax compliance requirements or an arrangement that now requires a financial statement audit, review or compilation.



The first step is to explore if your need extends further than what prompted the initial call. For instance, it's important to consider how tax compliance decisions being made for the business will impact the individual owners.  Make sure that the firm you engage can move beyond that immediate need and help you get in front of the next challenge or question that is going to arise. Ideally, that firm will not just react to questions or problems, but help you structure your growth and guide decision making in a way that is best both for current operations and the future. 


Tax and compliance in growth mode As your company adds new product lines, enters into different types of agreements, starts selling into different states or holds inventory in multiple locations, the need to be proactive from a tax and compliance standpoint is amplified.While you might be able to get away with a reactive approach to accounting early in a business, as you scale, the stakes just become too high. It can be a huge jolt if you find out you owe taxes in states you weren't planning on paying, for example.Growing companies also tend to enter into more complex agreements, whether that's an equity, debt or revenue arrangement. These deals can have an unexpected impact on your financials, and you need to structure deals carefully to minimize tax exposure.At this stage, your accounting firm can't just be solving problems. It needs to be part of your decision and review process. In addition, certain regulatory requirements kick in as your company reaches growth milestones. When you reach more than 100 employees eligible to participate in your benefits plan, for example, you're required to have an annual employee benefit plan audit. This is a somewhat specialized function not all accounting firms offer, so you may need to engage more than one firm.


Related: 4 Reasons Why It's Time to Hire an Accountant for Your Small BusinessFilling gaps as you enter the upper-middle marketOnce a company reaches a certain size, it makes sense to expand the expertise of your internal team. At that level, the relationship with your accounting firm moves toward a higher level of technical problem-solving.Your accounting firm should have a range of technical expertise to support your internal team. A tax partner from your accounting firm would work with your internal director of tax, while an audit partner would be more engaged with the CFO. Companies in the upper-middle market tend to rely on their accounting firms to support complex areas such as international expansion, mergers and acquisitions, stock compensation or even going public. The strategic relationship with the accounting firm is there to support the internal team and confirm the impact of these transactions.

Whether you're answering questions about taking government assistance or temporarily shutting the business down, it's best to have an established relationship to rely on.

37,How Can Small-Business Accounting Benefit From Robotic-Process Automation?,"Aug 10, 2021",Vlad Rusz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-can-small-business-accounting-benefit-from/378988,"
I recently attended IMA's annual conference, ACE2021. One of the hot discussion topics was robotic-process automation (RPA). The technology itself isn't new — let's face it, we've all dealt with chatbots —but now RPA is more streamlined and in a price range that small businesses can afford.While chatbots are ubiquitous, there is a broad spectrum of what RPA can do for small businesses. If you find yourself repeatedly making the same series of clicks, you can automate that process with RPA, saving you and your company hours. No more copy and paste. No more moving data from one spreadsheet to another. No more hunting online for updated data.Related: How to Scale with Robots: Automation Done Right



Over the years, I've helped many businesses automate parts of their operations and accounting. It's not my specialty by any means, nor my main focus. But over time, those automations have had a tremendous impact, which has prompted me to consider how automation can help small businesses. So how can you start reaping the benefits of RPA in your small-business accounting?1. Automate your current systemsMost accounting software allows for a bit of automation, so be sure to pick the low-hanging fruit first. That is, take advantage of built-in accounting software capabilities. You don't need an RPA bot to send out invoices if you can simply use the recurring-invoice feature built into accounting software. And once you've automated as much as you can, it's time to analyze your accounting process.


2. Designate an RPA managerDesignate someone on your team to be responsible for RPA across your company. RPA must be considered in a specific linear way, and in order to be successful, you need to document each step in the process.3. Rethink your accounting processSometimes your current way of doing things will not be automatable. Some managers and owners maintain that their process is too unique and can't be automated, but the way to overcome this hesitation is to read use cases. After doing so, think about how you can redesign your accounting process so that it can be automated. The goal is to ultimately reduce the amount of time and money a business spends on accounting.4. Document your processOne of the biggest challenges for small businesses is that there is no process documentation. While in most cases this allows a small business to be agile and adaptive, it makes it harder to identify tasks that can be automated. Additionally, without documentation, you can lose a lot of productivity if you have employee turnover since the incoming employee has to rediscover how to do the job instead of picking up where the outgoing employee left off.5. Implement RPAThis last step is the most difficult. Without successful implementation, the work done to this point will be in vain. Implementation is always the hardest for small businesses. It's easy to get excited about a new technology but fail to implement it. There will be stumbling blocks and failures along the way, but the benefits are too great to ignore.


Related: Robots Aren't Stealing Jobs -- They're Making Them BetterAccounting in general has a lot of repetitive tasks that are easy to automate. With the recent push toward automation, much of the data entry and report building is now mostly automated. For many small businesses, RPA might not make the biggest impact in the accounting department. However, it can be a great start that enables you to expand RPA to your operations.With RPA now being available on the cloud and at affordable prices, it's time for small businesses to take advantage. When comparing the price of an RPA bot to the cost of hiring and training a new employee, it is clear which is the smarter decision. Successfully implementing RPA in small-business accounting and other departments will allow small businesses to compete more effectively and make more money.Related: Every Entrepreneur Should Befriend a Robot

41,How a Cash-Only Budget Could Be the Breakthrough Your Small Business Needs,"May 25, 2021",Vlad Rusz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-a-cash-only-budget-could-be-the-breakthrough-your-small/371204,"
Small businesses don't budget — or at least that's the overall consensus I get from most small-business owners. Outside of the vague, ""I need six thousand to cover operating costs"" or ""Sure we have a budget, it's somewhere in the filing cabinet,"" there's not much budgeting happening in the small-business world.Effective budgeting is likely nonexistent because the business owner lacks oversight. Setting a budget and then ignoring it might be worse than not setting one at all. Budgeting is so fruitless for small businesses because they are not using the right strategy. Many small businesses stop after setting a budget and don't develop a whole strategy to implement and reinforce the budget.Over the years, I've experimented with a variety of systems to manage small-business finances from the ground up. In all businesses, the treasury department deals with management of funds. Large businesses have many people with many checks and balances to inhibit misappropriation of funds. For most small businesses, the whole treasury department starts and ends with the owner swiping a debit card.



Depending on how defined your treasury process is, there are different systems to consider, each with their pros and cons. So how can small-business owners budget without hamstringing their operations by having to wait days for approval from the accountant? The best small-business budgeting strategy is to use a cash-only budget based on checking accounts.Related: Dave Ramsey's 5 Budgeting Tips for Small-Business Owners


While this system is easy to implement, it does require some cash to float. The implementation requires setting up checking accounts for each of your major budgets. You split up operations into three to five distinct budgets with separate bank accounts. To save on constantly funding the accounts, you accumulate all your deposits in one account and fund your budgets every two weeks or preferably once a month.The benefits of a cash-only budgetInstant feedback. If you go over budget, you overdraw your account, so you will immediately know. This allows you to quickly spot any runaway budgets and forces you to take action instead of ignoring the problem. Conversely, if a large balance builds up, you know your budget is too generous.Increased focus. While you may have a spreadsheet budget with 20 accounts, it's unlikely that you'll have 20 business checking accounts; this uniquely forces you to stick to three to five major accounts and provides you an increased focus to keep your budget lines relevant to your business. Hard money. Unlike a nebulous spreadsheet with ""money"" that you track and reconcile periodically, a cash-based budget in bank accounts has a distinctly weighty feel. If the money in your marketing-budget account is already there, you know you can spend it without wondering if it's destined for some other expenditure. Forced action. When you track a budget on paper, you will periodically reevaluate and decide how to adjust, but there is no pressing action to take if you go over. On a cash budget, if you find yourself frequently transferring money between accounts for going over budget, you're much more inclined to fix the problem before it spirals out of hand.     Of course, no system is perfect, and there are some drawbacks. Fortunately, some of this system's limitations can be overcome. It will be up to you to decide if the benefits outweigh the costs.Related: 4 Money Budgeting Habits to Empower You as a Solopreneur The challenges of a cash-only budget Constant adjustments. If from the outset you don't get your numbers close enough to reality, you can be in for a rough start with constant adjustments. This is both a hassle and a rude awakening that shows how off we can be when it comes to what we think we spend versus what we actually spend.Loss of detail. Using checking accounts restricts your number of budget categories, which, when compared with a paper budget, limits the amount of available detail. This will have to be a tradeoff unless you want to do a mini budget for each of your checking accounts.Cash heavy. To set up this system efficiently, you will need two to four weeks of cash to fund your accounts. You can do with a smaller amount, but it will require more frequent funding and diminishes the overall efficiency of this strategy.Related: Why Budgets MatterIf you've tried budgeting in the past with no success, I encourage you to give this system a try. With so many online banks, setting up multiple accounts is expedient and easy to manage. As a small-business owner, you should always strive to make your business more efficient, and this is the best budget strategy to make that happen.

46,This Retired Mathematician Won $26 Million From State Lotteries ... Legally,"Dec 18, 2020",Gene Marks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/this-retired-mathematician-won-26-million-from-state/361273,"
A few years ago, Jerry Selbee figured out how to legally win lotteries in Michigan. How? It was all about the roll down.What is a roll down? In Michigan's WinFall lottery, if there was no grand prize winner that matched all six numbers from a field of 49 on a ticket and a jackpot limit was reached. Then instead of letting the jackpot grow, the lottery ""rolled down"" to give the next tier of players a chance to win. Instead of having to match all the numbers on a ticket, a winner would only need to match five, four or even three numbers to be a winner.Any mathematician will tell you that doing so increases the odds of winning. The retired Selbee earned a mathematics degree from Western Michigan University and loved numbers. He also loved winning.



Selbee knew that as the odds of winning increased, the ease of calculating a match also increased. He used his math skills to calculate those odds. He was able to figure out that if he purchased a certain number of tickets, there was a high probability that he would hit a match.Related: How Did This 16-Year-Old Girl Amass 100 Million Followers On TikTok?


So, as he explained in a 60 Minutes interview, he could purchase $1,100 worth of tickets and have a pretty good shot at having at least one ticket that matched four numbers, which would win him back $1,000. But in that same batch, he also had a good probability of having approximately 18 or 19 tickets with three numbers matching and each of those tickets would win $50, bringing him another $1,900. So his investment of $1,100 netted him $1,800 in profit. Now do the same with hundreds of thousands of dollars, spread amongst dozens of stores selling lottery tickets for multiple states running similar games so as not to raise suspicion. Do this over a number of years, seven times a year, spending as much as $600,000 each time and well ... you get it. Over time, Selbee amassed $26 million in winnings, with a net profit of $8 million before taxes. Not a bad take. If you really want to dig into the statistics, here's a great article from the Journal of American Science that breaks it all down.Spoiler alert: Once state officials figured out the flaw in their system, they shut it down. But in the end, Selbee didn't break any laws — he just used math.""It is actually just basic arithmetic,"" Selbee told 60 Minutes. ""The only thing I found really remarkable is nobody else really seemed to grasp it."" 


And that's the thing: What seems easy to Jerry Selbee isn't so easy for everyone else. For most of us, this isn't ""basic arithmetic."" It's black magic. Dark science. Voodoo.Selbee profited because of his math skills. So here's another spoiler alert: My best clients profit because of their math skills as well. This is not a coincidence.Want to succeed in business? Know your numbers. Know your margins. Know your costs. Know how to calculate profit percentages on individual sales. Know what impact a cost increase will have on your operations. Know your break-even point. Know your turnover. Are you comfortable enough with running numbers in your head so as to determine whether or not a deal makes sense, even while in the midst of a negotiation? You better be. If you're not, then you better hire someone who is.Related: How Did This Employee Steal $10 Million From Microsoft?


Sure, you need to have passion, perseverance and a hard work ethic to succeed in business. But let's face it, it's all about the money. You won't be in business very long if your revenues don't exceed your expenses. In the end, running a business — even a legal lottery scheme —  is all about buying something for $3, selling it for $5 and knowing, really knowing, that you're still earning a $1 profit after other expenses.

Entrepreneur NEXT powered by Assemble is a freelance-matching platform leading the future of work. If you're struggling to find, vet, and hire the right freelancers for your business, Entrepreneur NEXT will help you hire the freelancers you need, exactly when you need them. From business to marketing, sales, design, finance, and technology, we have the top 3 percent of freelance experts ready to work for you. Starting a small business is a big adventure — and involves a big learning curve. You have an exciting new product or innovative service, but how are with you managing finances and other business basics?According to a U.S. bank study, more than eight out of 10 new businesses fail because of poor cash-flow management. Don't let your new business fall prey to that likelihood. From bookkeeping strategies to financing options, here's what you need to know to set your business up for success.



Understand cash flows.Cash flow is the lifeblood of any business. In essence, cash flow is any money coming in or going out of your business's hands during a certain time period. Money coming in is known as positive cash flow; money going out, negative cash flow. Obviously, the goal of any business is to have more positive than negative cash flow.For many businesses just getting started, the early stages of operation may be defined by lots of negative cash flow, as you make investments in equipment, inventory or marketing all the while trying to build your customer base. The risk in not understanding your cash flow — and, consequently, why so many new businesses fail — is running into a situation where you have more money going out, whether to pay rent, utilities, vendors, wagers or so on, than you have coming in, on hand or access to by other means, such as via bank overdraft protection or a short-term small business loan. 


Particularly for businesses that experience a lot of seasonality, understanding how your cash flow varies throughout the year will help your business make the most of the strong-sales seasons and better able to weather the weak-sales seasons. Just another reason you'll stand to benefit from meticulous bookkeeping.Keep the books.Getting a firm grasp on all aspects of your business's cash flow is critical to its ongoing success for a myriad of reasons, and you should establish an airtight method for logging money coming in versus money going out. Having your business's key numbers at your fingertips will be helpful for all manner of business matters, including keeping track of unpaid payments, scheduling expenditures, cutting wasteful spending, identifying your most profitable goods or services, helping secure investments or business loans, and many other important tasks.Keeping the books, or accounting, is simply the process of recording all the financial transactions pertaining to your business, and you'll need to decide whether you're up to the task or would benefit from a professional's assistance.


The number one problem shared among entrepreneurs today is finding, vetting, hiring, and retaining expertise. For many small- to mid-size companies, a cloud-based accounting service like QuickBooks is a cost-effective service that makes bookkeeping easy. As your business grows, you may want to consult with a certified accountant in addition to using a cloud-based accounting service.QuickBooks' software allows you to track your business's inventory, sales, invoices, bill payments, employees' wages, loan repayments and so much more. And, because they're part of the Intuit suite of software products, you can easily roll relevant numbers over to another one of their products, TurboTax, come tax time.But QuickBooks isn't the only option, and other bookkeeping software services may be a better fit for your business. Other options include… 


FreshBooks may be more user-friendly if you're a sole proprietor or a very small business. Sage may suit you better if your business requires sophisticated inventory-tracking capabilities.Zoho has an especially good mobile interface if you're accustomed to using a smartphone for a lot of your business activities.Wave may be more cost-friendly with its array of free services. Another advantage is that many of these programs can auto-generate reports like cash-flow projections at the click of a button.Many offer a free 30-day trial to give you a sense if they're right for your business.Don't forget about taxes.Does using an accounting software service eliminate the need for a professional accountant? Definitely not, especially if you have a unique or complex tax situation. While your accounting software may integrate nicely with tax-prep software and having all your business figures documented and in one place will surely expedite preparing your taxes, tax codes change frequently and only a certified CPA can advise you on the most advantageous filing. Plus, going through a CPA limits your liability. You can start a search for a certified CPA that's a good fit for your business using this online directory.Speaking of taxes, what kind of taxes should you be prepared to pay?


As a small business owner, your business is likely categorized as a Sole Proprietorship, Partnership (Limited and Limited Liability), Limited Liability Corporation (LLC) or S-Corporation. All of those categories are considered ""pass-through entities"" for federal tax purposes and must pay an income tax for the owner's personal income tax rate. If you're expecting to owe more than $1,000 in income tax in a year, then you should pay these as estimated taxes according to the IRS's timetable in order to avoid penalties and interest.Additionally, if you have employees, you'll be responsible for employment taxes, which includes Social Security and Medicare taxes, Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA), and their income tax.While technically that last one is paid by employees and withheld from their wages, you're the one who needs to see that it gets to the U.S. government.Finally, you should be aware of…


Sales tax—determined at the state level, though this one can be tricky if you're engaged in e-commerce, as sometimes the sales tax is determined by location of buyer and sometimes determined by location of the seller.Excise tax—aka a ""vice tax,"" this is a special federal-level sales tax on certain items like alcohol, cigarettes, heavy-duty trucks, etc.Property tax—also determined at the state level, for those owning commercial property.State income tax—if you live in a state that requires this.Any other local taxes unique to your municipality.Know your financing options.At some point you may need to inject outside cash into your business, whether to cover a short-term cash flow problem or to invest for future growth. At that point, it's good to know the range of financing options available. Here are the most common types of financing for small businesses.Bank loans: This is one of the most traditional financing options for small businesses. With good credit, your business should be able to choose from a variety loan types, terms and repayment options from a wide variety of lenders. In extreme cases, where money is needed immediately, such as to cover payroll or emergency expenses, short-term business loan options may be available, though the risk will be greater.Small-Business Grants: Even better than a small business loan is a small business grant, since a grant doesn't need to be paid back. The catch is you'll have to research grants currently accepting proposals, make sure you meet all the criteria, complete the application, and win against other applicants seeking that same funding. Many non-profits have full-time grant writers for this express task.


Crowdfunding: An unconventional source of financing that's gaining in popularity, crowdfunding basically asks for small-scale donations from as many people as possible through websites like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or GoFundMe. Typically, a business seeking crowdfunding offers something in return for a donation, whether it's future merchandise from the company or exclusive membership perks. Many new business ventures go this route pre-launch to help get their company up and running. Venture Capital: If you think your small business has high-growth potential, then you may be able to seek out venture capital from professional investors. The funding can be significant, much more than a typical small business grant, and may often come with expert guidance from the investors, though they'll typically want a stake in the company in return, which may also involve ceding some of the decision-making power.Taking charge of your business's finances shouldn't be a headache, and it should be about a whole lot more than just keeping the lights on. With the financial data at your fingertips, you should feel empowered to make strategic decisions for long-term business success.To hire the Experts you need, exactly when you need them, visit next.entrepreneur.com to schedule a meeting with our Expert solutions team.

48,3 Lessons Amazon's Digital Transformation Can Teach Accounting and Financial Services Firms,"Dec 8, 2020",Chi Odogwu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/3-lessons-amazons-digital-transformation-can-teach/360067,"
In the past few months, the world has had to drastically adopt new ways of doing business thanks to the global health crisis. While many companies have now grown accustomed to working with tools like Zoom and cloud-based collaboration platforms, there are still a few industries that have yet to fully implement the required digital transformation to grow their business in the coming years.The accounting and financial services industries, in particular, are typically slower at embracing new technologies and processes. Due to the numerous regulations governing them, compliance and legal teams tend to move slowly when their organizations face circumstances that force them to adapt quickly because of potential problems that may arise in the future.However, if accounting and financial firms expect to survive and thrive in this economy, they will have to accelerate their digital transformation. History has shown us that companies can achieve major operational and organizational leaps by borrowing and implementing ideas and processes from unrelated companies and industries.

50,4 Reasons Why It's Time to Hire an Accountant for Your Small Business,"Oct 7, 2020",John Boitnott,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/4-reasons-why-its-time-to-hire-an-accountant-for-your/356782,"
According to the 2019 Onpay Small Business Finance and HR Report, just 30 percent of small business owners work with accountants. That's not surprising, given how much each dollar counts to a small company.Doing the accounting yourself certainly saves some money in the short term. That said, it might be worth hiring an outside accountant for your company. You, of course, have to weigh the pros and cons yourself, and each business is different, but there is much to be gained by bringing in an outside resource.Here are four reasons why you should consider hiring an accountant for your small business:Related: 7 Tasks You Do Every Day That Waste Time and Cost Your Business Money1. It will save you time and stress down the roadThe Onpay study above found that 28 percent of small businesses have been audited by or received a formal notice from the IRS.



I've seen friends go through audits at their companies and can say with certainty that it can be a nightmare. Just the notice itself can create anxiety over whether you made mistakes.But even if you did everything correctly, you'll still spend hours preparing to demonstrate that and have to deal with all the anxiety that comes with the experience. Having an accountant will eliminate this worry and free up your time, giving you someone to take that burden off your shoulders. 2. Accountants can help with all finance-related workHiring an accountant to deal with your taxes alone can be quite useful. If the accountant can support the entire financial well-being of your company, you'll benefit even more. In the Onpay report, 38 percent of small business owners said they expect their accountant to help with payroll, 32 percent expect help with financial projections and 27 percent with cash flow.When I have started small businesses, my intention was always to offer services and solve customer problems, not to spend my days coping with all the minute financial details and associated stress.


Having someone else to help take care of those pieces and ensure that the numbers work out across the board can be liberating. It frees you to spend more time on what you care about.Related: 4 Tips for Managing Cash Flow When You're Bootstrapping3. Accountants can even provide business consulting and adviceAccountants can support business strategy as well as your company's financial health. In fact, 87 percent of respondents in the Onpay study agreed or strongly agreed that their accountant is a trusted advisor to whom they can turn for a wide range of business advice.


Accountants have worked with numerous other businesses. They often have a keen sense of what it takes to run a company and can offer good advice on strategy. I can think of times when my accountant has proposed a new business unit or changes in pricing that have helped improve our bottom line.4. Accountants are trustworthy sources of supportThe study reveals that for many businesses, accountants were the advisor whom owners and managers trusted the most for business-related advice, more than family, friends, lawyers or  financial planners. Furthermore, 82 percent of respondents said that their accountant knows the business well or very well. Accountants are so valuable because of their objective stance. They don't have the same bias as friends or family, and they are not intertwined with your company the way employees are. Moreover, they have a stake in the health of your company so they have a strong motivation to see you succeed. Related: 10 Ways You Should Invest Your Company's First Profits


How to find the right accountant for your small business It can be time-consuming and complicated to search through online reviews, reach out to several accountants and have many conversations, trying to find the right fit. So to find the right accountant for you, ask for recommendations from professional advisors, trusted friends and colleagues. This approach helps you pre-vet your accountant candidates, making it much simpler to find the right one.When you have a short list of candidates, you should go into conversations with prospective accountants having done research to know what you are looking for and how you'll define the right fit.It's not just about the accountant's experience. Also consider their commitment to your business and how well you get along. Once you find the right person, establish some ground rules for a trial period before locking your business into a larger contract.Related: Brutal Lessons From 4 Failed Startups

The following excerpt is from Money-Smart Solopreneur: A Personal Finance System for Freelancers, Entrepreneurs, and Side-Hustlers, out now via Entrepreneur Press. Purchase from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | Bookshop | IndieBound. Good record keeping is just good business. How you manage data, account for financial transactions and store and retrieve your records is part of running and maintaining your company. Use the following six tips for a more successful balancing act.1. Separate business and personal dataThe line between personal and business finances can get blurry for solopreneurs. It's important to separate the two, so you can easily monitor the progress of your business, plan for the future and create financial statements for specific periods, such as monthly or annually.



Clear business records allow you to identify sources of income, tag tax-deductible expenses and easily prepare your taxes. Without a proper record-keeping system, tracking the details of your business and complying with the law may be close to impossible. For instance, if you don't have a system to determine which restaurant meals or vehicle miles were personal and which were for business, you might be unable to claim valid business expenses as tax deductions.Related: Top Tips for Defining Your Solo Business Model


2. Use a business bank accountTo keep your business and personal finances completely separate, open a dedicated business bank account. If your business is incorporated (such as an S corp or LLC), you must have separate accounts to legally distinguish your business and personal finances. Remember that the purpose of incorporating is to create an entirely separate entity from yourself. You'll need a separate business bank account where you can deposit checks made payable to your business.If your business name is the same as your personal name, you could likely cash business checks or deposit them into your personal account. And regardless of your business-entity type or name, you can pay business bills and expenses from a personal checking account and still claim them as a business-tax deduction. But these actions certainly muddy up your financial waters. So even if you could avoid having a business bank account, it's still a good idea to establish one.3. Apply for a business credit cardMost business checking accounts offer a variety of ways to make payments, including debit cards, online bill pay and electronic transfers. However, depending on the amount and type of purchases you need to make, you may want to apply for a business credit card. Just like with a business bank account, a business credit card makes it easy to keep your business and personal finances separate.You don't have to own a huge business or even incorporate to qualify for a business card — even part-time sole proprietors may be eligible. You can apply for a card even if your business is new and hasn't started earning revenue. However, if you do have income, that's a plus. You'll likely need to estimate your anticipated spending on the card, which helps issuers determine the size of your credit line. If you're not sure how much available credit you'll need, it's better to estimate higher rather than lower.


4. Find an accounting system suited to your needsNo matter the type, size or complexity of your business, you must find an accounting system that suits your company's requirements. The IRS allows you to choose any record-keeping system you like, as long as it clearly shows your income and expenses. Your system could be entirely manual and written on paper. But I don't think there's a real substitute for an online financial tool or desktop accounting software. Just think about the advantages of being able to use a smartphone app to send an invoice, track billable time or take a photo of a receipt that gets automatically uploaded and stored in the cloud. Most small-business accounting programs are easy to use, even if you're not an accountant. They typically allow you to upload images of receipts and documents and to automatically import data from financial institutions.5. Always get receipts for business expensesWhile being self-employed means that you're responsible for paying more taxes than a W-2 employee, the upside is that you get to claim business-tax deductions. Tax deductions are great because they reduce the amount of taxable income for your business, which in turn cuts the tax you must pay.But the proof that your tax deduction is valid is on you. That means you must keep supporting documents, such as receipts, invoices and payments to employees. The good news is that you can store these crucial documents digitally, instead of as paper records, if you wish. You can still claim a tax deduction even if you don't have the receipt. However, if the IRS audits any of your tax returns, you may be asked to explain exactly how you calculated the taxes you paid.Related: Free On-Demand Video: 5 Tips for Building a Side Business


6. Go as paperless as possibleGoing paperless, or as paperless as possible, saves space in your office and keeps your data and documents safe from theft, fire or water damage. Not only does a paperless system save environmental resources, but it also saves time. Try to eliminate all incoming papers, such as bills, account statements and receipts.Note that there are some vital paper documents you will still need to keep, such as deeds, licenses or business records with original seals. You may have other records or contracts that should be retained for legal purposes. When in doubt, check with an attorney for legal requirements and statutes of limitations in your state. Continually pare down what you receive each month. Every time you open your physical mailbox and see paper inside, make a note to log on to your online account or contact the merchant and request to go paperless.No one likes hitting the books, but it's essential if you want to stay in business.

54,Will Covid-19 Change Millennial Minds About Accountants?,"Aug 27, 2020",Ben Richmond,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/will-covid-19-change-millennial-minds-about-accountants/355004,"
As I've spoken with small business owners navigating the many uncertainties of COVID-19, I've been struck not only by their remarkable resilience, but also by the fact that none of them claim to have all the answers. More than ever they are relying on peer networks, online communities, phone conversations, email interactions with friends and – perhaps most importantly – the advice of advisors such as bookkeepers and accountants as they seek to keep their businesses afloat and profitable.The value that bookkeepers and accountants can provide to small businesses every day, but especially during times of crisis, is something that millennial business owners never really had to seriously contemplate until now. Xero's recent Young Entrepreneurs Report found that millennials have been responsible for launching more than half (52 percent) of new small businesses in the United States from 2016 to 2018 and have become a major source of growth for the U.S. small business economy. But most of these owners have never been through the depths of a financial crisis as their older peers have, and they have certainly not experienced a challenge as profound, sudden and devastating as the one brought about by coronavirus.Related: Is Now the Right Time to Start a Business, and How Can I Manage My Cash Flow?



Our survey of millennial business owners was conducted pre-pandemic, so it's interesting to look at the results, and especially their perspectives on the value of accountants and bookkeepers, with the benefit of a few months of hindsight. One of the more interesting conclusions of the survey was that millennial business owners have a strong ambition for growth but also found it more challenging to run their businesses than older generations, especially in areas such as increasing sales and clients, controlling costs and learning new strategies and skills. What the research brought home more than anything is that millennial owners are enormously passionate about their businesses, but they can struggle with the kinds of skills that accountants excel at, such as keeping an eye on costs, crunching sales figures, managing cash flow and developing short-term and long-term plans. 


It is perhaps not surprising, given the thriving economy of recent years, that millennial owners also tend to be more critical of their existing accountants and bookkeepers. Absent a major crisis, the day-to-day value that accountants provide might have been taken for granted. In fact, our research found that a large percentage of those who use outside advisors told us (pre-pandemic) they wouldn't recommend them to friends, and more than half said they were likely or very likely to explore replacing them entirely. Related: 3 Financial Steps Small-Business Owners Should Take Right NowIn this respect, COVID-19 has given accountants an opportunity to prove their worth to business owners who represent the bulk of their client base for the next 20 years. As I've spoken with millennial owners over the past few months I've heard countless examples of advisors going above and beyond to help their clients, even as they faced many of the same challenges their clients have been confronting. Advisors have been key in helping young entrepreneurs increase cash flow, maintain staff, navigate government assistance programs and secure badly needed loans. In an environment where business owners need to focus on the day-to-day, accountants have been integral in helping small businesses get back on track. At the same time, COVID-19 has exposed accountants who are falling short. Those who are excelling have learned to flex new muscles, master new skills and interact with and advise their clients in new ways, with face-to-face meetings out of the question. They've invested in strong digital capabilities, are cloud-savvy and highly flexible.


COVID-19 could very well be a turning point that forever changes the millennial relationship with accountants, especially for those advisors who can help businesses successfully make the turn from just getting by to thriving. For entrepreneurs, COVID-19 is an opportunity to look hard at how they are integrating their advisors as part of their overall team and determining whether their accountants are providing the right skills and capabilities to support them through this crisis period and beyond.Related: How Business Owners Can Optimize Cash Flow During A Crisis

C'mon, just admit it: You're an ABBA fan. I get it. So am I.And how could you not be? The '70's Swedish super group produced some of the most sing-able, happiest, snappiest songs ever, from ""Dancing Queen"" to ""Fernando."" When ABBA is played at a bar or party or just on the radio, everyone — regardless of age — seems to know the lyrics and sings along.Besides their songs, one of the most definable things about ABBA was their clothes. Much has been written about their many outrageous outfits over the years, and most fans would agree that the band's clothing choices were never … well … understated. For years, ABBA's fans thought it was just the group's way of showing their uniqueness, their individuality, their brand. But there's another reason for the crazy costumes, a reason that would actually be more appealing not to the teenagers who went to their shows, but to the accountants who did their taxes.

1. Stress Your Unique NeedsFrom Frank Leggio, audit & assurance partner, Deloitte & ToucheYou need a firm that can support your specific operation and structure. It must understand the franchise model and have experience with multi-state, multi-region, or even global growth models. As you talk with firms, be sure they're committed to at least quarterly communication. Know ahead of time which practitioner will be assigned to your account, and confirm that those meetings are part of client service and not something additional you'll be billed for. Think of your accountant as more than a resource for tax planning, auditing, and bank lending. They also provide advice on business processes and technology — which is especially important as a franchise grows. A franchisor's standardized model should be vetted early, because a model that doesn't replicate well can generate problems. For franchisees, don't underestimate your business's complexity, and consider your own unique needs. For example, many franchise owners hire family members — so ask potential firms if they have experience with family-owned businesses, and the unique dynamics that come with them. Believe it or not, accounting firms can help there.  



Lastly, ask any potential firm for details on the most valuable projects they've completed for clients — then go talk to those clients, especially those who run businesses of similar size and complexity to yours. Those are the people who can validate whether or not the firm you're considering has the expertise you seek.Related: 3 Financial Steps Small-Business Owners Should Take Right Now2. What to Look ForFrom Travis Garrett, controller, Buffalo Wings & Rings Garrett spent seven years as a CPA and knew what he wanted in Buffalo Wings & Rings' accounting firm. He chose RSM because it offered…1. Industry-specific experience Franchise experience is important, but so is sector experience. ""Some firms know restaurants, [and] other firms have no idea,"" Garrett says. For food service, those considerations include labor law issues and oft-missed tax credits related to tipping. 2. More than accounting Garrett needed a partner to help franchisees make decisions in an ever-changing business world. For example, he says, third-party delivery services like Grubhub and Uber Eats have regulatory quirks, and RSM helped franchisees navigate them.3. Preparedness


Before Garrett hired RSM, he asked many firms to explain industry changes in tax law and accounting standards. ""I didn't get very consistent, competent answers from most firms,"" he says.

And Withum is helping the company grow at its own pace: ""We're looking to add 25 franchise locations over the next 18 to 24 months,"" says Merseburg.

59,5 Questions Entrepreneurs Should Ask Their CPAs to Reduce Audit Risk,"Jan 29, 2020",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-questions-entrepreneurs-should-ask-their-cpas-to-reduce/345558,"
To help reduce your fears of a government audit, February is the best time of year to meet with your CPA to review your tax strategy, review your documentation requirements and ask key questions about how to reduce your chances of an audit. What's clear from my 35 years of experience as a CPA is that people fear a government tax audit more than death and public speaking combined. The good news is you can sleep at night by being more proactive. The number one thing the government wants is compliance, so your job is to make sure you're following the rules. Schedule a meeting with your CPA early this year, and ask these five direct questions to reduce your anxiety.1. Are you afraid of the IRS?Your tax preparer should be comfortable, willing and actually very engaged with the idea of handling an IRS audit. If they are afraid of the IRS and/or overly cautious, then find someone else to prepare your returns. People often share that their tax preparer advised: ""Don't take this deduction, even though it's legitimate, because it might raise a red flag and get you audited."" Well, what that statement really says is that your tax preparer is afraid of the IRS. 



Related: A Good Accountant Is Key to a Good Franchise Operation2. If there is an audit, are you going to handle the IRS communications?Your number one goal should be to have the best tax advisor who will interface with an IRS auditor, not you. You can even give your tax advisor power of attorney in the U.S. by completing a Form 2848. I cannot emphasize this point enough. You should never communicate directly with the IRS. It doesn't matter whether it's is a simple request for information or an extensive audit. The reality is that the IRS knows a lot more about taxes than you do, and your CPA should know even more than the IRS. So write this down: ""I will never speak to a government tax authority."" Ask your CPA this question, and listen carefully to their response.


3. Have you ever handled an IRS audit for a client, and what happened?Ask your tax preparer about their experience working with the IRS on audits for clients, and then ask for a few examples and the results (without giving names of course). There are many different scenarios, and you want to gauge their confidence level. After handling many audits over my 40-year career, I am most proud of losing my first audit because I calculated that it meant a huge refund for the client. I ran the numbers not just for the year of audit, because for the year of audit it would have meant a big tax payment from the taxpayer. What I figured out was in the year subsequent to the audit, it meant a huge tax refund if the auditor won. And in fact, when you combined the two years, the taxpayer was better off losing.4. How do you build a relationship with an IRS auditor?This relationship-management question is really important, because you want a CPA with good people skills to oversee your audit. When meeting with an IRS auditor, your tax preparer should make them feel comfortable and really do their best to help them. Auditors have a tough job, and building rapport can make a big difference in the results. Unfortunately, there are tax advisors who treat the IRS very poorly, and that's not in your best interest. 5. What documentation do we both need to keep to minimize audit risk?Keeping proper documentation of expenses for deductions on your tax return is critical. You want to keep physical copies of documentation ideally for seven years. You will probably not turn over documents to your tax advisor until and unless you get audited. As a result, ask for a list of what documents you need to keep. And then ask your tax preparer, ""What information are you keeping that can help defend an audit?"" Along with maintaining a copy of your tax return, the tax preparer should keep copies of your W2 wage statement, 1099, general ledger, balance sheet and income statement for your business. This documentation will be the basis for an audit, and it's critical to keep good records.Related: What I Learned From a 2-Year IRS Audit


By asking your CPA these five audit risk-mitigation questions, you will reduce a prominent and valid fear.  Bottom line, you need three things to reduce audit risk: 1. the right tax advisor who handles all IRS communications for you; 2. great documentation and 3. a tax return prepared in way that's as audit-proof as possible. It's then the CPAs job to make the IRS auditor feel confident in your tax returns and minimize any impacts. Good luck.

61,The 12 Tax Days of Christmas: Day 4,"Dec 21, 2019",Mark J. Kohler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/the-12-tax-days-of-christmas-day-4/344098,"
Rather than your true love sending you a partridge in a pear tree, wouldn't you appreciate some money-saving tax tips? For my year-ending 12 Tax Days of Christmas series, I'll dig back into the archives of previous topical columns to reiterate understandable, realistic and legitimate tax strategies that you need to implement now in order to have a much smaller tax bill come April 15.For this fourth tax day of Christmas, let's address the fact that many small-business owners rush to put their spouse on payroll before year-end, but it could actually be for the wrong reasons and be a costly mistake. First, entrepreneurs think that if their spouse is helping with the business, the only way they can pay them is to put them on payroll. Wrong. The spouse can simply be compensated through the draws you are taking as the owner. By putting them on payroll, you could actually be unnecessarily paying thousands in FICA (payroll taxes).Next, business owners think they are doing themselves a favor by creating ""earned income"" for their spouse so they can contribute to an IRA. Wrong. A non-working spouse does not have to have a paycheck in order to contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. The non-working spouse can create what's called a Spousal IRA. There are really only two requirements: One, the working spouse has eligible compensation that's at least as much as the total contribution to the both IRAs; and two, they file a joint income-tax return. Bottom line, don't cut a paycheck to simply fund an IRA or Roth IRA.



Third, the entrepreneur wants to generate a social-security benefit for the non-working spouse, and they think putting them on payroll is the only way to do it. Wrong. On the face of it, this would seem logical, right? Paying into Social Security so that your spouse will at least get some benefit in the future when they turn 59 1/2. However, this is very misleading. For example, a ""non-working spouse"" of a ""working spouse"" already qualifies for spousal benefits. Speak with a financial advisor that understands Social Security and plan to run the numbers before rushing to cut another payroll check. I also cover this topic in depth and dedicate an entire chapter to this strategy in my book, The Business Owner's Guide to Financial Freedom: What Wall Street Isn't Telling You.Related: The 12 Tax Days of Christmas: Day 2


Although there are some serious misconceptions on when to put a spouse on payroll, I actually believe there are two really good reasons to do so before year-end. Both of the below strategies create excellent tax deductions and are a good use of money.1. Maximize the spouse's 401(k) contribution.There is no such thing as a spousal 401(k) contribution like there exists for the IRA. Thus, in order to put away the big dollars, the business owner and their spouse need to consider the 401(k) and create an actual payroll for the non-working spouse. Now, as a preliminary matter, I always believe the spouse is truly not deemed ""non-working."" The spouse would certainly be serving on the Board of Advisors or Directors for the company, and they would presumably be constantly involved in the operations of the company. Thus, the salary would be justified and appropriate.Also, it's important to note that this strategy most typically involves a Solo 401(k) (but can also be used with a group 401(k) with other employees, but to not to as great an effect). A Solo 401(k) is designed for a company with no outside employees but the owner and their family. 


In 2019, the primary business owner and their spouse could each contribute up to $19,000 (or $25,000 if over 50), and the company can take a tax deduction for the W-2, while the spouse doesn't claim any income on the W-2. Even though you pay some FICA or payroll tax on the W-2 amount in order to fund the 401(k), the ultimate tax benefit is significant due to the ""time value of money"" and the opportunity of the spouse to create and fund a 401(k). Typically, we would ""gross up"" the payroll amount to cover the FICA taxes and then ""zero out"" the rest of the contribution. For example, if your spouse is under 50, the payroll amount would be approximately $22,350, with a net pay of $19,000. Then, with the $19,000 deferral, the W-2 nets out at zero.In addition to the deferral the spouse could make from their paycheck, the company can also do a match on the total payroll. This would further be a deduction for the company and add to its 401(k) balance. In the example above, in a Solo 401(k) this would equate to 25 percent of the payroll amount of $22,350, or approximately $5,500. Just for 2019 alone, the company would have a tax write-off of more than $27,850 and the spouse would have a balance of more than $24,500 in their 401(k) and no taxable income to boot.In fact, if you can afford it and want to get even more creative with both the business owner and/or the spouse, they could fund a Roth 401(k) and create a tax-free account, rather than just deferring taxes until the future.2. Adopt an HRA for the spouse.Most Americans don't get a tax deduction for extra medical expenses. They can't itemize (it's usually not worth the effort with AGI limits), or they don't qualify for a Health Savings Account (HSA). However, if you own a small business, the Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) could be the perfect fit. Just imagine if you could deduct 100 percent of these medical costs. It could be life-changing.


Essentially, putting your spouse on payroll may allow you to utilize the HRA. However, keep in mind that you would have to utilize a Sole Proprietorship (something I call a ""family management company"" and discuss in the coming fifth Tax Day of Christmas entry). The strategy is to create this same ""support"" or ""management"" company that would hire the spouse (and/or children) for services provided to the main company, and under this employment provide for an HRA. If you are single, it's required to use a C corporation. (See Chapter 11 of The Tax and Legal Playbook: 2nd Edition for more information on seven different tax- and money-saving strategies when it comes to medical insurance and health-care expenses.)On the face of it, the HRA may sound complicated or expense, but it is quite simple and affordable. It is self-administered, without the need for an insurance company or bank's involvement, and the cost is under $500 at KKOS Lawyers. However, we always want to consider a cost-benefit analysis, and we typically see it make sense for a family with more than $5,000 in out-of-pocket medical expenses (over and above insurance premiums). You can learn more by reading my breakdown, ""How an HRA can Save you Thousands when facing extra Health Care Costs"".Related: The 12 Tax Days of Christmas: Day 3


The beauty of the HRA is the spouse's payroll is essentially the HRA amount. No need to issue a W-2. Also, this is not a ""use it or lose it"" plan, but a reimbursement plan that can allow a couple/family to deduct almost all of their medical expenses at any age. Look ahead to my sixth Tax Day of Christmas entry for more information on the HRA.Bottom line, whether it's a 401(k) or an HRA, it's important to understand and explain why you are specifically putting your spouse on payroll. Don't do it just because it feels good or sounds good. This can be a wonderful wealth-building and tax-saving strategy, or a nightmare that could cost you thousands in taxes. Whatever the case may be, this is something that must be decided on before year-end.

62,5 Year-End Charity-Donation Questions for Your CPA,"Dec 19, 2019",Tom Wheelwright,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-year-end-charity-donation-questions-for-your-cpa/343924,"
As an entrepreneur, small-business owner or investor, it's important to ask your CPA before year's end about your options for donating to charity. By donating to charity, you can make a positive impact on the world and save big on taxes -- as long as you know how to legally apportion your contributions. Look closely at your bottom line now, and ask your tax-preparer these five key questions about what to donate, how to donate and what documentation is required to maximize your tax savings.1. What organizations qualify for charity donations? Always check with your CPA before making a major contribution to a charity to make sure they qualify. While many know that you can deduct donations to a nonprofit 501(c)(3), there are other organizations that will also qualify, such as churches and some trusts.Related: Does It Matter What Motivates Business Philanthropy?



2. How does my business entity impact my charity donations? There are differences between a C corporation and S corporation for charity deductions. A C corporation can only deduct 10 percent of its income. In comparison, an owner of an S corporation can deduct charity donations, as long as they do not take the standard income-tax deduction, up to 60 percent of their adjusted gross income for cash contributions and up to 30 percent for non-cash donations.3. Can I deduct equipment, inventory and property donations? As a business owner, you can deduct desks, computers or other equipment based on their fair-market value. For more expensive items such as jewelry, collectibles and real estate, you may need a written appraisal. When claiming in excess of $5,000 for donated property, the IRS will require a qualified appraisal and Form 8283. Ask your CPA for insights on how to best calculate this value.


4. Can I deduct volunteer time for employees? If your employees volunteer time to a charity that your organization supports during a work day, your company may be able to deduct their salary, benefits and expenses for that time. Ask your CPA for help on how to document these types of events and your donations.5. What is the best way to donate stock to charity? Ask your CPA what you need to do to transfer stock directly to a nonprofit versus selling it to avoid capital gains. This way, you eliminate the gains on your stock while getting a deduction for the full value of the stock.Related: Are Your Charitable Donations Getting to the Right People?In all cases, ask your CPA what documentation is required for different types of donations. If it's less than $250, a cancelled check or bank statement that shows your cash donation will be sufficient. For monetary gifts that exceed this amount, you will need a record in writing such as a letter.


Keep in mind that certain charity contributions receive state tax credits in many states, which give both a credit on state taxes and a deduction on federal taxes. And next year, don't wait to make these proactive charitable donations at year-end only. Giving back should be a regular part of your monthly budget so that you can be even more strategic with your tax planning and contributions.

63,3 Reasons Your Small Business Should Go Cashless,"Oct 29, 2019",Syed Balkhi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/3-reasons-your-small-business-should-go-cashless/341452,"
When was the last time you paid cash for something? Personally, it's rare for me to even carry it these days. And with the rise of new mobile and digital payment options like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, PayPal and Google Wallet, cash payments are only going to become less common. In fact, according to Worldpay's 2018 Global Payment Report, the global use of mobile payments is forecasted to increase to 28 percent in 2022, surpassing credit cards and cash. Given this trend, it could be time to consider eliminating cash payments from your business altogether. It might seem crazy to stop accepting cold, hard dollars, but there are actually a number of benefits. Check out these three reasons your small business should consider going cashless. Related: 4 Things You Should Know About Cashless Payments



1. It boosts checkout efficiency. Consumers today are busy and don't want to spend time waiting in line to check out. That's why companies like Starbucks have been promoting mobile order-and-pay apps that allow customers to pay ahead of time. In addition, Amazon Go is leading the trend of cashierless stores. There's no lines, no checkouts; just grab and go. According to eMarketer, 43 percent of U.S. internet users would rather try scan-and-go than wait in a checkout queue. Plus, by going cashless, you can even do business on the go. Want to participate in a pop-up shop or local business fair? Instead of being tied down by a register, mobile and digital payments enable you to be where your customers are.  


2. It makes accounting easier to manage. When your business deals with cash, you literally have to count every penny. This can be frustrating, especially on those days when the register comes up short and you can't figure out why. But with mobile and digital payments, every transaction is automatically tracked and recorded, which means less room for error on your part and less time spent manually tallying and recording transactions. You'll also save time by not having to run to the bank to get rolls of change or make daily deposits. Furthermore, with real-time data on the cash flow of your business, you'll be better able to spot opportunities for improvement and make informed business decisions to improve your bottom line even more. Related: How Vietnam Is Embracing the Cashless Revolution3. It reduces risks. For obvious reasons, keeping cash on hand increases the risk of theft. Not only do you have to worry about being robbed by random criminals, but unfortunately, you also have to worry about your own employees taking from the register. Not too long ago, the owner of Baltimore's Park Cafe & Coffee Bar spoke with The Baltimore Sun about going cashless after being robbed at gunpoint five times in four months. The owner had some concerns about loyal customers who didn't have credit cards, but he was committed to working with those patrons to provide them with gift cards. Overall, going cashless can increase the safety for your employees while keeping your company assets secure. Going cashless isn't the right choice for every business, and you do have to consider your customer base. But if your customers are savvy and loyal, they'll stick around through the cashless revolution. Now that you're aware of the benefits, you can make an informed decision for your business.

64,The Rise of Account-Based Marketing,"Sep 24, 2019",George Deeb,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-rise-of-account-based-marketing/338351,"
I've witnessed many evolutions in marketing best practices, from the rise of digital- and social media-marketing to automation technologies replacing human tasks. And now there's a new trend that is starting to take off called Account Based Marketing (ABM), and it has the potential to change everything for B2B professionals.Most B2B marketing campaigns have traditionally been designed to support the B2B sales team, which includes building all internal collateral materials and performing both inbound ""pull"" marketing and outbound ""push"" marketing efforts. The goal has always been to make everyone and anyone that could be interested in your product or service aware of your company. The problem is not all companies in an industry are created equal. You may need to better focus on companies of a certain revenue size that can afford your product or service, or others within a certain geographic region. Otherwise, there may be a lot of wasted effort and spending.Related: Account Based Marketing Wins the Popular Vote



What Makes ABM Different?ABM turns the old model upside down. It basically says: You tell me the top specific company accounts you want to target, and we will put a marketing campaign in place that speaks specifically to them, with no wasted marketing outlay and better automated efficiency than a human sales team. This works particularly well for B2B companies with less complex products at lower price points that don't require in-person selling.A good ABM campaign does come with a few requirements. First, you need to have a good list of targets to go after. Use a service like Experian, Acxiom, Hoovers, D&B or ZoomInfo to help you find the right specific titles/contacts of individuals who can help maximize success for your business by leveraging their revenue size or geographic location. The key here is targeting specific people, not specific companies.


Once that list is built, now comes the fun part. You can upload those email addresses into your Google advertising account, and if you are a whitelisted emailer, Google will target advertising to as many of those people as they can match in their system, regardless of what websites they may be visiting online (assuming it is part of the Google ad network). You'll then set up email campaigns and automated nurturing to those exact people, using six-to-seven content pieces, in addition to utilizing LinkedIn advertising through InMail and promoting via Facebook. etc. Your target contacts won't be able to miss your messaging, because they will see it all over the internet at multiple times, presumably resulting in increased odds they'll want to work with you.Where possible,you should customize your message to that specific user. For example, if you're selling through multiple channels, ready unique content for each one (e.g., client direct, their agency, different departments, different use cases). You can prepare ABM efforts yourself or work with ABM-focused agencies or technology platforms. Just be sure to do your homework and vet any company before employing their services. Related: Account-Based Marketing and Inside Sales Are a Match Made in HeavenThe Case Study of Restaurant Furniture PlusBack in 2018, our company acquired Restaurant Furniture Plus, a seller of furniture to restaurants. The business was 100 percent dependent on Google for leads, meaning they never knew whether the click was going to be a consumer, a single location restaurant, a small chain, a large chain, etc. By employing an ABM strategy, we've been better able to target the desired small growing chains we want, no longer wasting money. In the process, average order size has increased, shedding small orders from single locations. The newly refined Restaurant Furniture Plus became more efficient, needing fewer transactions to drive the same revenues. You tell me which marketing route is better for business.


Concluding ThoughtsIf you are not using ABM marketing techniques today, you probably should reassess your entire B2B sales and marketing strategy and execution efforts. My guess is, you may be wasting a lot of time and money . It will be very interesting to see how ABM techniques and demand evolve over the coming years, but there is no time like the present to be an early adopter.

65,5 Signs It's Time to Switch Your Business Bank,"Sep 4, 2019",Eyal Lifshitz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-signs-its-time-to-switch-your-business-bank/338497,"
As a small-business owner, if you feel like your bank is not meeting your needs, you're not alone. According to a recent study by J.D. Power, only 32 percent of small-business banking customers feel that their current bank understands their needs, and only 37 percent feel their bank appreciates their business. When it comes to financial services, small-business owners should never feel forgotten. However, many financial institutions provide small businesses with antiquated cookie-cutter products meant more for consumers rather than providing small businesses with true business-grade products typically reserved for corporate clients. Evaluating your current banking priorities may inspire you to seek new alternatives and make a switch, especially if there are critical warning signs that your current bank is not meeting your needs. Let's explore some of the most common warning signs, and on the flipside, what great banking for 21st century small-business owners should look like.



Warning Sign #1: You're paying tons of fees. Getting a new business off the ground can be costly, but your bank shouldn't be the one setting you back with expensive and confusing fees. Being charged a ""service"" or ""maintenance"" fee -- which is usually collected when certain requirements are not met -- is probably the number-one indiciator that you're being nickeled-and-dimed by your current bank. Others include in-network ATM fees, bill-pay fees, incoming wire fees,  paper fees and transaction-minimum fees. You shouldn't need to pay for standard banking services. Instead, you should have a bank partner who allows you to bank how and when you want, whether that means holding a small balance or conducting as little or as much account activity as your business requires. In addition, you shouldn't be subjected to numerous penalty fees. You should partner with a bank that has your back. 


Related: 5 Mistakes That Sabotage Your Company's BankWarning Sign #2: You can't do all of your banking online. As a small-business owner, you are constantly on the go, juggling multiple priorities across the business, day in and day out. You need flexible banking services and solutions that are quick, painless and work for your schedule, not the other way around.Currently, small-business owners continue to make routine visits to their physical bank branch but are constrained by business hours and long lines. If your bank doesn't allow you do conduct all of your transactions digitally -- whether that be deposits or applying for and managing a business loan via mobile app or online -- it's time to think about making a switch.Warning Sign #3: Business tools and services are not included.Let's face it: Small-business bank functionality is limited, lacking specialized tools and services for things like online account management, cash management, payroll and credit card processing, integration with financial services software, advanced payments functionality and more. These are features that large enterprises have come to expect as part of their banking relationship but are absent for small businesses.Regardless of company size, in order to scale efficiently, small-business owners need access to the same banking features and business functionality as their enterprise counterparts. Unsure as to whether your current tooling stacks up to that offered with a corporate account at your current bank? Request an overview with your account representative to compare features and assess what you're currently lacking.  


Warning Sign #4: You can't get access to capital.Accessing financing from a bank is make or break for many small businesses. In fact, according to the Federal Reserve, 43 percent of small businesses applied for new capital in 2018. The reality is that traditional banks are the least likely to approve your loan application. In fact, only about 26 percent of big banks approve small business loans, and 27 percent of small-business owners report that they are not able to obtain adequate financing. Bottom line: As a small-business owner, you likely need financing to thrive, and your bank should be able to give it to you. If you can't get the financing your business needs from your current bank, now is the time to begin evaluating new options.Related: How to Pick the Right Bank for Your BusinessWarning Sign #5: You're treated like an account number, not a partner. If you are like the 6,000 small-business owners polled in the aforementioned J.D. Power study, you don't expect all that much  from your banking relationship: a collaborative partnership, an account manager who understands your business and open communication. If you're feeling like you're just another transaction -- whether that stems from being ignored by a teller, waiting on hold with an automated customer service bot for hours on end or having virtually no relationship with a human account representative -- and not receiving any personalized service, it's time to consider other options. Your bank should function as a partner with a vested interest in helping your business grow, and any type of banking relationship less than this baseline may be holding you back.These and other warning signs are unfortunately the outcome of ongoing neglect of the small-business segment within the banking industry at large. It's important that small-business owners heed these indicators and think critically about whether their current bank checks any of these boxes. If the answer is yes, it may be time to explore new options built with small businesses in mind that include minimal fees, a fully digital simple experience, the same tools and services offered to big corporations, financing options and an excellent partnership.

67,Time to Send Out 1099s: What to Know,"Jan 17, 2019",Mark J. Kohler,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/time-to-send-out-1099s-what-to-know/299440,"
The 1099 tax form can seem mysterious. Business owners guess at its rules and requirements, and tracking changes to the procedures can be so exasperating that some entrepreneurs just give up and file nothing at all. (This can be dangerous financially, as penalties can add up quickly.)But the 1099 doesn't have to be complicated. To help simplify things, here's a rundown of the basics. ShutterstockTo whom are you required to send a 1099?As a general rule, you must issue a Form 1099-MISC to each person to whom you have paid at least $600 in rents, services (including parts and materials), prizes and awards or other income payments. You don't need to issue 1099s for payments made for personal purposes. You are required to issue 1099-MISC reports only for payments you made in the course of your trade or business, and you'll send it to any individual, partnership, Limited Liability Company, Limited Partnership or Estate.What are the penalities? The penalties for not doing so can vary from $30 to $100 per form ($1.5 million for the year), depending on how long past the deadline the company issues the form. If a business intentionally disregards the requirement to provide a correct payee statement, it is subject to a minimum penalty of $250 per statement, with no maximum.



graphicstockWhat are the exceptions?The list of exceptions is fairly lengthy, but the most common is that you don't need to send a 1099 to corporations or for rent payments to real estate agents (typically property managers -- yet they are required to send them to the property owners). Additionally, you don't need to send 1099s to sellers of merchandise, freight, storage or similar items.Lawyers get the short end of the stick here. Ironically, the government doesn't trust that lawyers will report all of their income, so even if your lawyer is 'incorporated,' you are still required to send them a 1099 if you paid them more than $600.The W-9 is your best friendOne of the smartest procedures a business owner can implement is to request a W-9 from any vendor you expect to pay more than $600 before you pay them. Using this as a normal business practice will give you the vendor's mailing information and Tax ID number, and it'll also require that the vendor indicate whether they are a corporation or not (saving you the headache of sending them a 1099 next year). You can download a W-9 here.ShutterstockThe procedureRegrettably, you simply can't go to IRS.gov, download a bunch of 1099 forms and send them out to your vendors before the deadline. The form is ""pre-printed"" in triplicate by the IRS. Thus, you have to order the forms from the IRS and pick them up at an IRS service center -- or grab them while supplies last from the post office or another outlet. Next, don't forget to compile all of your 1099s and submit them to the IRS with a 1096 form by the following month. 


ShutterstockThe deadlinesFinally, you are required to issue and essentially mail out all of your Form 1099s to your vendors by January 31. Then you have to send in the transmittal Form 1096 to the IRS before February 28. For those of you that 'outsource' this service, your accountant with the proper system can actually submit the 1096 and stack of 1099s electronically by March 31. Don't forget as well, that depending on state law, you may also have to file the 1099-MISC with the state.graphicstockWhat about foreign workers?If you hire a non-U.S. citizen who performs any work inside the United States, you'll need to file a 1099. It is your responsibility to verify that the worker is indeed a non-U.S. citizen and performed all work outside the United States. For that purpose, in the future you might want to have that foreign worker fill out, sign and return Form W-8BEN. Even if you miss the first 1099 deadline of January 31, contact your CPA and make sure to finish up the process as soon as possible. If you can show reasonable cause for your delay, it could save you major penalties that could arise from not filing the forms on time. Moving forward, make sure to get a Form W-9 from all your vendors before sending out payments. This will save you a lot of headaches next January so you don't have to track down their mailing addresses or EINs.The good news: Most accountants will provide this service affordably and efficiently for you during the month of January so you can stay focused on your New Year's resolutions and making money rather than filling out paperwork.

68,The 5 Most Important Accounting Reports for Your Small Business,"Dec 28, 2018",Due,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/the-5-most-important-accounting-reports-for-your-small/325055,"
When it comes to small business accounting, most people know that it is important to keep your records updated for taxes. However, there are many more benefits from small business accounting that you can use to grow, improve and expand your business. Here are some of the most important accounting reports for your small business that you should know about.Profit and loss statement/income statementThe most important report for any business is the profit and loss statement, also called a P&L or income statement. This report tells you how much money a business makes, as well as a lot more. A well-run bookkeeping operation includes details for where you spend and where your money comes from. For example, I can look at my P&L for a quick summary of how much I make from writing, how much I make from advertising, how much I spend on business travel and how much I pay for computer and internet costs. Each business would have different accounts for its own income and spending categories.Small business owners should look at this report at least monthly. It is also a good idea to look at trends, comparing current results to the same period in the prior year and comparing the most recent month with the last few months. This should tell you what's working well and what isn't, as well as help you focus on the most profitable parts of the business. This is exactly how I analyzed by business to help me reach $10,000+ in monthly income.



Balance sheetA balance sheet gives you a snapshot of what a business has and owes at any given time. For small businesses, assets typically include things like bank accounts, accounts receivables, and possibly an investment account. A balance sheet may also include assets like property, computers, equipment and other saleable physical and intangible property. Liabilities generally include things like credit cards, business loans and anything else your business owes.The accounting equation is based on the balance sheet. It tells us that assets plus liabilities equals equity. The difference in what you have and what you owe should ideally be a positive number and one that grows over time.


When examining the balance sheet, also look at the short-term assets versus short-term liabilities. If you have payments owed soon, you won't want to run out of cash without noticing that your assets are illiquid.Accounts receivable agingYou don't work for free, and your business isn't a charity. Doing the work and sending the invoice is just part of the battle. You also have to make sure those payments get paid and collected. Your accounts receivable (A/R) aging report tells you how well you are doing on the collections side. Look out for customers who are perpetually late, usually pay on time and recently started paying late, and growing late balances from any customer.I've been very lucky when it comes to collections, but part of that is choosing the right clients to work with. Upstanding companies like Due always pay quickly. Some less stable, less trustworthy or financially strained companies are more likely to pay late or stiff you when it comes time to pay the bill.Revenue by customerJust as you should be looking at who owes you money, you should be looking at who gives you the most of it. Your revenue by customer report tells you how much you made from each customer over a period of time. Freelancers and professional service businesses rely heavily on repeat business in many industries. Building good relationships with quality clients can turn in to a lucrative, reliable, and healthy income stream.


However, beware of putting too much faith in any one income source. If too much revenue comes from one source, that is called ""revenue concentration risk."" If one client leaving would ruin your entire business, you need to get more diverse in who your business serves. Putting too many eggs in one basket might just bankrupt your company.Accounts payable agingYou probably wouldn't like it if a company took too long to pay you. Do your vendors a favor and pay them on time as well. Your A/P aging report tells you who you owe and how much. As long as your books are updated, you can easily look and find who you need to pay so you don't miss the due dates.Paying late can sour relationships and may lead to late fees and other costs. Just pay on time. You might even get an early payment discount from some vendors. That's a big win-win!(By Eric Rosenberg)

1: Hire a Bookkeeper, Avoid a Disaster! From Barry Knepper, founder, The Franchise CPADon't try to manage your books yourself, sitting at home at 11 p.m. That won't work, and it will create a terrible chain reaction. Consider: If you don't have organized books, then you make it very difficult for an accountant to complete your audit. If you can't complete your audit, you can't update your franchise disclosure document (or FDD), and for most companies, that needs to be updated every April 30 in order to sell franchises. So if you haven't updated your FDD, you're in a dark period, can't sell any new franchises, and can't even talk to people about new franchises.I see this happen with new startup franchisors. They have a bunch of enthusiasm in the beginning, they go out to sell locations, and then … they don't sell any. It's not uncommon in your first year -- you're competing with 3,800 other brands! But then they feel discouraged, and they think spending money on legal fees to update their FDD is a waste. And they fall into a catch-22; they're not investing in growing their business, and their business isn't growing. Here's my solution: If you have a really great employee who doesn't have the money but has the knowledge to be your first franchisee, finance them and get them into business. Who does a prospective franchisee call if they're thinking about joining your system? This franchisee you just helped! So they'll say good things about you, and you're on your way. Now go hire that bookkeeper.

For example, are you aware of the tax benefits available to both you and your employees for reimbursing them for educational, dependent care, adoption and commuting expenses? Did you know you can take huge deductions for capital equipment purchases and not even have to pay for these purchases upfront? Or that there are significant credits available for you to encourage the hiring of welfare recipients and veterans, disabled people, starting a 401(K) plan or just paying a portion of the salary for those employees taking time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act?Do you have an ESOP? An HSA? A 529?Related: 10 Questions to Ask When Working With an AccountantI bet you don't know all this. But don't feel bad. This was news to a lot of the business owners and managers I spoke to at a recent conference. Is it news to you? More importantly, is it news to your accountant? Does he say to you ""Hey, that's a great idea!"" when you bring something to his attention? Those are not the five words you want to hear from him. Or any expert or advisor.



Look, I'm sure your accountant's a nice guy. To you, he seems to know his stuff. You've been using him for years. You generally enjoy speaking with him. But you're just not entirely sure he's providing you with the best tax or financial advice. Then again, what do you know? You're not an accountant. You're no financial expert. How can you be so sure your accountant is really doing the best job for you?Actually, there's actually a very simple way to know. Just ask yourself: who's the expert?Related: 3 Red Flags That Your Tax Accountant Is an IdiotThink back over the past few years. Have you ever read an article about saving taxes that you sent to your accountant in passing and he responded with something like ""Hey, that's a great idea!""? Or maybe you picked up an interesting piece of financial advice from another parent at your daughter's soccer game that your accountant also found worth investigating? Did he say ""Hey, that's a great idea"" to that too?


Perhaps you're one of those people who pays an above average amount of attention to the numbers. Good for you. You attend a financial seminar now and then, or you listen to a CPA speaking at an industry event like I did. You read your financial statements closely every month and make note of the things that catch your attention. You discuss your operations with colleagues in a business group or an old college friend. You stay on top of the news.Is your accountant doing this stuff? Is he coming to you with suggestions, ideas and recommendations throughout the year? Or are you the one going to him? Who's the financial and tax expert here, you or your accountant?Related: How to Hire an AccountantIf these things are not happening then he's not the expert and he's not an advisor. He's just a form-filler, a task-completer, a clerk. If you're the person telling your ""expert"" how to do his job, then what good is that person? Whether it's an accountant, lawyer, tech ""guru"" or AdWords consultant, you want your advisor proactively coming to you with...well...advice, and not the other way around. The last thing you want to hear is ""hey, that's a great idea!"" from the one person who's supposed to be giving you the great ideas.

71,"Outsource Everything but Accounting, Quality Control and Sales","Oct 6, 2018",Michael Houlihan & Bonnie Harvey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/outsource-everything-but-accounting-quality-control-and/321084,"
It's no secret that most startups are undercapitalized. They need every penny just to stay in business long enough to produce a positive cash flow. Even those that have achieved seed financing usually find out in short order that they need a much longer runway to give sales a chance to take off.Most investors want to see some revenue before they will take a risk on you. So it's critical, especially in the pre-rev startup phase, to strip your company down to its bare essentials, be resourceful, and discover and use your hidden assets. If you can't lengthen the runway, you can at least lighten the plane!As professional speakers in the world of entrepreneurship, we hear hundreds of business ideas every year. The proponents are passionate and convinced that they have a marketable solution. This may be true, but the market usually requires more time than they have planned to accept their solution.



Most of these wantrepreneurs begin by describing the assets they need to buy and the positions they need to fill before they make the first sale. We cringe. Nothing is harder to get off the ground than an overloaded airplane. They can use up the whole runway and still not take off. It doesn't mean that they may have never taken off, it just means they didn't take off with the runway provided.Aside from using trades, strategic alliances, and a repurposed laundry room, aside from keeping our staff down to two unpaid owners and one underpaid manager, and aside from outsourcing our production and services on an as-needed basis, we found many ways to lighten our load to get us off the ground in time. But long after we were airborne, we continued to outsource everything but accounting, quality control, and sales. Here's why:


Related: How I Overcame My Fear of Hiring Outsourced DevelopersAccountingThings are happening much too fast to be dependent on reports that are a month, or even two weeks old. You need to know what's happening daily. Our most important indicator of business health in our critical startup days was what we called the ""Cliff Report."" Basically it was our cash flow projection that told us how far we were from that financial cliff that represented bankruptcy.Understanding your true cost of sales is critical and requires a savvy in-house cost accountant. Most businesses fail in the expansion or buildout phase because they neglected to appreciate how much it would cost them in time, money, and personnel to manage their increasing sales and provide the customer service necessary to protect their reputation and ensure their future reorders.Pay-for-performance is at the heart of every successful enterprise. Chose incentives that are based on sales, growth, and profitability. In order to stay relevant, these bonus programs must be paid in the shortest period of time following the close of the previous month. It's hard enough to get your in-house accountant to crunch these numbers before the 10th day of the new month. It's almost impossible to get these critical numbers in a timely manner from an outsourced accountant.


Related: Thinking Of Outsourcing Work, Take Note Of These Expert OpinionsQuality ControlInvesting in in-house production is probably the greatest financial drag on a startup. It assumes that the company will be able to achieve sufficient sales to justify the investment in production facilities. But for most startups, the initial monthly payments are made out of the proceeds from loans or stock sales. But these payments are due regardless of sales.This dilemma forces many startups to outsource production, as it did for us. But by keeping quality control in-house, we were able to deliver a high quality, consistent, and on time products without the financial burden of in-house production facilities.We also discovered another advantage. When production is in-house, there's tremendous financial pressure to put products on the market that might not live up to your quality standards because you have so much invested in them. But with proper outsourcing, oversight, and performance contracts you can refuse payment for lots that don't meet your standards.


Related: In-House or Outsourced? How Do You Decide?Sales The hardest lesson we learned in business is that no one is going to make sales happen but you! Not only does the buyer want to see the person responsible, but the middlemen you hire are simply not going to do the job! At least not unless you provide them with representation on your payroll.You have too many competitors with their own people making the sales. They are focused on their products only. Because brokers, distributors, and retailers carry many more products than yours, they tend to make whatever sales are the easiest. Especially as a startup, with unproven products, you need your own salespeople to give your products the personalized attention they deserve.We always viewed customer service as part of sales. That too should be kept in-house since your product's reputation and future sales are on the line. You need a direct customer feedback loop to keep your products competitive, relevant, and priced right. Your sales team can give you that.


To survive the startup process, you must give your sales the time they need to take off. Outsourcing as much as possible is a good strategy to lighten the weight so you can meet that challenge in the runway provided. But don't outsource the three key functions that keep you in the pilot seat and keep your plane under control!

72,3 Major Benefits of Updated Bookkeeping and Accounting Records,"Oct 5, 2018",Due,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/3-major-benefits-of-updated-bookkeeping-and-accounting/321129,"
Last week in a discussion with a business coaching client, I asked if she had updated bookkeeping and accounting records that would help her make the best business decision for a big question about her business. ""No,"" she replied, she didn't have updated books. Without them, any decision regarding product lines, pricing or customer capacity is just a guess!Guessing is not the way to run a business. On the contrary, every business big and small should have regularly updated bookkeeping and accounting records so business leaders can make the right decision with a foundation in the data. Follow along to learn three big benefits of keeping your bookkeeping and accounting records updated on a regular basis and some tips to get you started with your bookkeeping for your business.1. Strategically ladder-up your revenueAs a freelance writer for my primary income, one of my biggest goals is finding the best clients that offer me the most significant return on my time invested. While freelancing is a business that is tough to scale, I like to do something I call ""laddering up"" my clients where I climb up and add new high-quality clients while letting go lower-quality and lower-paying clients as they are replaced.



This process is great in theory, and most freelancers and business owners understand the concept. But why do they continue to struggle with low-quality clients? Because they don't look at the numbers and objectively look for ways to bring on better clients and get rid of the bad ones. With no metrics, you might not even know which clients are draining your resources and which lead to the best profitability in your business.A few months after quitting my job to go full-time online, a look at my own updated bookkeeping records showed that about 76 percent of my income came from writing while around 15 percent came from website development and support. That is a clear 80/20 rule example. I cut the 15 percent of my income that was taking way too much of my time and my total income roughly tripled over the next few months!


2. Cut underperforming products and servicesThe focus of my conversation with the coaching client focused on turning her services into a product she could sell for a fixed monthly subscription rate. But with no detailed accounting records beyond the reports she gets from her payment processor, she didn't have any real records to show her income by customer or product. It doesn't matter if you are a solo freelancer or a business with thousands of employees, you absolutely need this information!With the right details in hand, you can pick out the one product that sucks away too much of your time for too little money. You can identify expensive recurring tasks you may be able to outsource or eliminate. As you can see from the example above, sometimes cutting underperforming products or services can lead to significant growth.Success in this area of your business comes down to focus. But without properly updated bookkeeping and accounting records, you don't know where to focus. You might be wasting hours and have no idea because you don't have the data. End that big mistake right away. Get those accounting books together and keep them updated, at least monthly, so you can make the best management decisions.3. Save time and money at tax timeIf increasing revenues and cutting costs were not enough motivation to keep your books updated, here is one last lynchpin: your taxes. You have to do taxes if you have a business. That is not optional. What is optional is making it a stressful period by ignoring your accounting throughout the year and rushing to get it all done in April before the deadline.


Instead of this method, plan and keep your books updated at least once every month. I go a little over what most people need and update my accounting records weekly. But whatever you do, quarterly should be the bare minimum for bookkeeping updates for tax purposes.While most individuals have to file and pay taxes once every year, most business owners and many side hustlers have to pay quarterly estimated taxes. While you can file and pay based on last year's tax rates, keeping your books updated can help you get a better estimate if you need to pay more quarterly to avoid the big one-time lump payment in April.If you have your bookkeeping updated, you just have to print out a P&L and balance sheet and can finish your taxes from there. No other prep needed!4. Don't ignore updated bookkeeping and accounting needs!If you find the idea of accounting and bookkeeping intimidating, you can always hire an expert to handle it for you. My friend Eric Nisall at Account Lancer helps me when I have questions with my books and handles accounting for a long list of solo business leaders. But for the most part, I like to handle things myself.


However you decide to do your bookkeeping is great as long as you stick with it! If you don't, you'll quickly find yourself behind and with useless financial reports. With the right focus on your books, you have the right information to put your business on track to thrive for years to come.(By Eric Rosenberg)

73,5 Accounting Challenges Startups Face and the Tools That Will Fix Them,"Jun 27, 2018",Thomas Smale,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-accounting-challenges-startups-face-and-the-tools-that/315787,"
Accounting. Bookkeeping: The very words conjure up images of dusty ledgers and drudgery. Despite accounting's boring reputation, however, it can't be emphasized too much how essential it is that your business follow accounting's best practices right from the start.Related: 5 Invoicing and Accounting Tools for New EntrepreneursIn fact, financial mismanagement is an oft-cited reason for business failure: An influential study by CB Insights of 101 failed startups found that cash flow was the No. 2 reason why some of those small businesses failed, and was second only to businesses trying to sell a product that their market didn't need.



So, whether you're a bootstrapped startup or you've secured funding, pay very close attention to proactively managing your business's cash as it ebbs and flows. That kind of attention is vital for both long and short-term success.Thankfully, adhering to accounting best practices is no longer as challenging and time-consuming as it once was. In the past decade as a founder, I've learned about a host of tools to help ensure my -- and your -- business maintains its all-important focus on the bottom line. Here are five standout ones small businesses can use to perfect their accounting practices and ensure their financials remain transparent.


Related: 3 Benefits of Cloud-Based Accounting Tools for Small-Business OwnersSifteryMany online businesses rely on a plethora of third-party apps to power and streamline their processes. No wonder: A nearly endless number of tools out there aim to make your business run smoothly. While many SaaS apps are well worth the monthly subscription costs, as your business grows, it becomes harder and harder to track how much you're spending on software.Siftery offers a sophisticated expense-tracking service that makes it easy to calculate and optimize your monthly or annual spend. It also offers Quickbooks integration, making the tracking process seamless.But Siftery does more than just track how much your business spends on software. According to CMO Gerry Giacoman Colyer, Siftery tracks more than 42,000 apps and how 840,000-plus companies use them to power their software recommendation engine. Siftery makes it easy to find SaaS apps that help power your business, and saves you money by negotiating discounts for Siftery users up-front. In more ways than one, Siftery will help you get the most out of your SaaS spend.


HumanityA big challenge any entrepreneur faces  is tracking the expenditures and time of teams, especially those that work remotely. Humanity is an employee-scheduling and time-tracking solution that automates what traditionally has been a painful process.Team members can log in from anywhere to see their schedules and even swap shifts with other employees. The intuitive, cloud-based interface provides a calendar view for both managers and employees, solving for the traditional headache that comes with complicated systems for tracking and expensing remote employees' hours.From an accounting perspective, Humanity helps ensure that your employee's timesheets are accurate and that you're not spending more on wages than you should be. Like Siftery, Humanity offers Quickbooks integration to make workforce management even easier to blend with your overall bookkeeping practices.QuickbooksThere are two applications that I strongly recommend all businesses -- especially digital ones -- incorporate into their business operations. One is Google Analytics, to measure and record where your website's traffic comes from, and site performance. The other is Quickbooks.


While there are many software options, none beat Quickbooks for features and compatibility. Quickbooks has become the industry standard, and for good reason. For starters, It integrates seamlessly with your bank accounts, eliminating much of the labor involved in keeping your records balanced and up to date. Quickbooks is also hosted in the cloud, making maintaining your books from any device or location easy.Its reporting and cash-flow management tools give you an instant snapshot of how your business is performing financially and can help you predict and plan for any shortfalls. Should the time ever come for you to sell your business or seek additional funding, solid and verifiable financials are a necessity. Diligent use of Quickbooks will ensure that you have those financials at your fingertips.ExpensifyThankfully, the days of saving a shoebox full of expense receipts until tax season rolled around are over. With Expensify, which like the other apps listed here offers extensive Quickbooks integration, you simply take a photo of a receipt on your smartphone, and categorize it. Expensify automatically uploads to Quickbooks.If your team members are required to submit receipts for reimbursement, Expensify is then even more useful. It detects duplicate receipts, determines accurate foreign exchange rates and helps ensure the accuracy of each transaction.


Once an expense report is approved, the team member is automatically reimbursed within 24 hours via ACH. Expensify streamlines the expense-reporting process for both managers and employees. Even if you're self-employed, Expensify will save you considerable time and money. According to Forrester's 2017 Total Economic Impact Report, businesses that adopted Expensify saw a 598 percent ROI.FundboxNo matter how diligently you track and plan your business finances, only rarely will your startup not experience an occasional short-term cash flow crunch. That's where Fundbox comes in.Fundbox syncs with your Quickbooks (or other accounting software) to evaluate the credit-worthiness of your business. Fundbox then offers funding options to supply U.S.-based businesses with cash. These options include invoice funding, meaning that Fundbox will advance you money for invoices you have outstanding with your customers -- plus a revolving line of credit of up to $100,000 that your business pays back over either a 12- or 24-week period.Installment payments are deducted from your bank account weekly along with a fee. Two of the primary advantages of Fundbox are that the finance fees are typically much lower than an option like credit cards, and unlike a traditional small business loan from a bank, you won't face long wait times or mountains of paperwork to complete.


Simply give Fundbox access to your Quickbooks or bank account, and you'll have a decision in as little as three minutes. If you are approved, your funds will be available as soon as the next business day.Related: 10 Essential Steps for Getting Started With QuickBooks Accounting ToolsFinal thoughtsNo matter what type of business you run, never underestimate the importance of employing accounting best practices for your business from the very start. This may not seem like the top priority in the early stages of your startup, but as your business grows and demands more of your time, effective accounting and cash-flow management structures will become critical to your business' ability to scale.

74,Your Taxes Are Done but Are You Getting Your Money's Worth From Your Accountant?,"Apr 20, 2018",Gene Marks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/your-taxes-are-done-but-are-you-getting-your-moneys-worth/312226,"
Now that tax season is over, you're probably asking a question that many business owners ask: should I fire my accountant? It's not an unreasonable question.Just to be clear, and to prevent my fellow Certified Public Accountants getting all up in arms at me, there are many, many good accountants. The accounting community is, for the most part, ethical, professional and competent. I believe that every business owner should have a close relationship with a good CPA.But I also believe that we CPAs should always be striving to do a better job for our clients. The world has changed. The demographics of our client base has changed. Expectations are different. We cannot sit back and just assume that our clients are going to keep coming back to us. If you run a business you shouldn't just assume that you're stuck with your accountant. You're not. You should be demanding the same high standards of your CPA as you demand from any partner working with your business. You should expect your CPA to be doing at least these five things.



Related: Getting the Most From Your Accountant Means More Than Just Doing Your Taxes1. They give you a timely response. Sometimes I hear from business owners who say it's difficult getting hold of their CPA, particularly during tax season. That's nonsense. In 2018, 50 percent of the workforce is from the millennial generation and these people, now aged between 18-36, are rising through the ranks of companies. They have grown up watching on-demand movies, having food delivered to their door in minutes and getting fast responses from companies via text messaging, social media and email. This is a generation that expects their accountant to do the same. If your CPA is slow to respond, or you find yourself repeatedly reaching out to get an answer to a question, then this is a CPA performing a sub-standard service.


Related: Want to Gain Customers' Trust? Try These 4 Communications Tips.2. They watch out for you year-round.Do you only hear from your accountant around tax time? That's bad. Today, smart accountants are tying themselves into their clients' cloud-based accounting systems, engaging with them on Facebook and keeping a steady stream of conversations throughout the year. The best ones make it a point to either speak or visit their clients mid-year to get a sense of what's going on so that they can strategize the best approach for tax savings with enough time to take actions.If your accountant is surprised at tax time when you explain a big transaction that happened months ago, then that's a red flag. You, as the client, have a responsibility to keep your accountant apprised of all goings-on within your company. But your accountant has a responsibility to be proactive too. Otherwise, he/she is not doing a very good job.Related: 10 Ways to Keep Making Your Clients Happier and Happier


3. They realize keeping you out of trouble with the IRS is the minimum.I hate it when accountants act like they're an extension of the IRS. I know some business owners who are literally afraid to speak to their CPA because they'll get scolded for doing something risky. You know you have a great CPA when you feel completely comfortable tossing around ideas -- no matter how ludicrous -- for saving on taxes...and you're not being laughed at.Of course, a competent accountant will steer you away from doing anything illegal. But your accountant should be working with you - hand in hand - to innovate and be creative about ways you can minimize your tax exposure. Otherwise, it's like having an auditor as partner and that's not the kind of relationship I'd like to have. Would you?4. They keep you current on emerging best practices.It's very likely that your CPA is running a practice that has dozens - maybe hundreds - of other clients. As a business owner, I find that there are few things more valuable than being compared to what other businesses are doing so that I can learn from and even copy their best practices. Good CPAs know this. They know that they're a conduit between their clients. Without giving away any trade secrets, a good CPA will tell you when certain financial ratios or metrics are better or worse than similar companies in their stead. Or he/she will recommend certain procedures, internal controls and policies that are working well at other like-minded companies. That's a huge value that a CPA can bring to a client and if you're not getting that then you're missing out.5. They keep trying to sell you additional services that are worth buying.Finally, good CPAs are good business people. They want to grow their practices just like you want to grow your business. To that end, I love it when CPAs are always pitching additional services to their clients. Why not? Who isn't looking for better financial planning advice, an audit of travel and entertainment expenses, a recommendation (and implementation) for better software? Many CPAs do this but, unfortunately, some are shy about selling their services more. That's a shame. You want a CPA who is as hungry as you are to make more money. To do that he/she needs to help you with more worthwhile services. If your CPA isn't doing that then that's a bummer.


Related: 5 Simple Upsells and Downsells That Drive Higher ProfitsThere should be no question that your accountant is good at what he or she does. CPAs have stringent professional requirements to keep them up to date on all the rules and most are very competent. But that doesn't mean that your accountant is truly doing the best job for you. If you don't think so, then have a talk. Maybe things can change. If not, consult your local CPA society, ask some friends, search around and get a few others to offer proposals. It could have a big impact on your business.

75,The Accounting Industry's Death is Great News for Your Business,"Aug 17, 2017",Michael Burdick,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/the-accounting-industrys-death-is-great-news-for-your/298649,"
Change isn't comfortable -- especially when it comes to industries steeped in tradition, such as accounting. Whether they welcome the innovation or loathe the disruption, accounting firms are forced to adjust as their previously static sector grapples with major change.Asian brokerage firm CLSA recently released a report detailing the future of technology in the accounting world. While the shockwaves of cloud storage technology still reverberate, the report indicates accountants won't have much time to rest. Machine learning, the gig economy and AI are poised to disrupt the industry even further.We're living during a watershed moment for accounting, which creates repercussions throughout the business world. It's the end of accounting as we know it, but entrepreneurs should feel fine. A new normal will rise from the ashes of the archaic industry, and this revival will lower costs and increase transparency for businesses in every sector.



Why accounting needs a reboot.As an industry, accounting has been broken for decades. It holds onto the old ways of doing things, even in the face of inevitable change.The rise of personal computers in the 1980s turned the profession on its head, with software empowering business owners to handle their own bookkeeping and finances. Accounting became a more commoditized profession because of technology, forever altering the dynamics between accountants and business owners. Unfortunately, accounting firms didn't get the message.


People running accounting firms tend to be older, less comfortable with technology and unfamiliar with new tools. As a result, there is little incentive for junior team members to innovate. Their clients end up missing out on opportunities for increased efficiencies or other areas of improvement.For example, I have met countless business owners who were in the dark about their company financials because of outdated technology. If your accountant is still working on the desktop version of QuickBooks -- or keeping records in shoeboxes -- he or she is the only one who has access to your financials. Unless you can convince your accountant to embrace QuickBooks Online or similar cloud software, you're basically unable to track your company's performance.Beyond glaring technical issues, many accountants stubbornly adhere to antiquated traditions. Firms stifle rising talent by enforcing lengthy wait times for partnership -- sometimes up to 10 or more years. This sort of inflexibility pushes ambitious young workers and creates a stagnant culture. An established accounting firm feels reliable, but entrepreneurs who work with these companies receive obsolete service instead of innovation.Despite these incredible inefficiencies, accounting firms still manage to sustain bloated profit margins. As one of the most lucrative trades in the nation, the accounting industry enjoys net profits averaging 18.3 percent of sales -- the highest of any sector, according to Sageworks. If their net profit margins are nearly 20 percent, their gross profit margins must be closer to 60 percent.


Accounting firms certainly don't mind those hefty profits, but their clients will begin to question bloated bills for second-rate service. Entrepreneurs could easily receive better treatment for less money, but these fossilized firms have had no reason to change their ways. This excessive wiggle room also creates space for newcomers to disrupt the industry. As Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos eloquently stated, ""Your margin is my opportunity."" Ready or not, change is coming to accounting.The dinosaurs of the accounting industry are dying, but new entrants are ready to embrace technology, provide better customer service and offer increased transparency. Amid this accounting renaissance, it's still important to consider a few basics:Related: 3 Red Flags That Your Tax Accountant Is an Idiot1. Understand the differences between various titles.Bookkeepers, accountants, analysts and CFOs all do different things, but that isn't always clear to outsiders. We've had many clients ask for a CFO, for example, when they actually needed a bookkeeper. Considering the average CFO could earn nearly eight times the salary of a bookkeeper, it's important to pick the right person for your needs. Don't let big accounting firms strong-arm you; educate yourself on the role you need to fill, and learn to ask for what you want.


2. Ask potential partners probing questions.How will this firm support your businesses through different growth stages? What resources do they have? How have they adopted new technologies? If they have served others in your industry, request references. Ask which tools they recommend clients use -- including examples such as Recurly, Xero and Kabbage -- and see whether they offer blank stares or useful insight.Finally, ask about their system of checks and balances. How will they assure you their work is correct? How are they billing you? Which deliverables will you receive regularly? Don't be afraid to ask difficult questions; you're trying to find the perfect partner for your business.Related: 10 Questions to Ask When Working With an Accountant3. Consider every available option.While a local mid-market firm might be ideal for your company, don't feel like you're limited by traditional arrangements. Bench, for example, uses artificial intelligence to deliver bookkeeping services to small businesses and independent contractors.


If your company is beyond that initial growth stage, you could embrace the gig economy and use freelancers to handle your accounting. Marketplaces are infinitely more efficient than antiquated accounting firms, creating potential cost savings for business owners. Considering that a Randstad study found that 68 percent of employers believe half the workforce will be part of the gig economy by 2025, it doesn't hurt to familiarize your business with this growing trend.4. Seek like-minded partners.According to CultureIQ, 73 percent of employers believe a better corporate culture provides a competitive edge. Go through a values exercise to solidify what your company stands for, and associate yourself with companies that share those ideals. If you trust your employees while encouraging openness and flexibility, seek modern accountants that buck the old trends and mesh with your approach.Related: Want to Preserve Your Company's Culture as You Grow? Here Are 4 Ways5. Stay on top of trends.Most trends don't manifest overnight. Read books and articles, listen to podcasts and talk with others in your industry to see which way the wind is blowing. If you haven't already -- IDG Enterprise reports about 70 percent of companies have at least one application in the cloud -- use cloud computing to make it easier to share your financial information internally and with external partners.


Are you still clinging to paper receipts? Get with the times by embracing digital platforms to track and organize expenses. Apps such as Expensify and Wave can do a lot of the work for you, but you can also just snap photos and keep them in a designated receipts folder. Stop sending snail mail invoices, and start emailing those documents to clients. These steps might be painful, but they'll make it much easier for your bookkeeper or accountant to see exactly what's going on with your finances.The accounting industry might be broken, but that doesn't mean entrepreneurs can throw their arms up in disgust and neglect their finances. As upstarts break into the field and offer accounting solutions that match the modern marketplace, the landscape will undergo tremendous change. Regardless of your solution to this accounting problem -- a midmarket firm, an in-house accountant or a team of freelancers -- it's necessary to know what you're getting yourself into. Your company's livelihood literally depends on it.

76,Uber Admits it Made an Accounting Error and Will Refund Nearly $50 Million to Drivers,"May 24, 2017",Tom Brant,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/uber-admits-it-made-an-accounting-error-and-will-refund/294831,"
Uber's rocky relationship with its drivers has resulted in the company offering olive branches and occasional compensation, and that pattern continues with a colossal error the ride-hailing company admitted to on Tuesday: drivers in New York City were shortchanged by nearly $50 million in payments, The Wall Street Journal reported.Uber had apparently been calculating New York City drivers' earnings based on an incorrect formula. Instead of subtracting taxes and fees before collecting its 25 percent commission as per its nationwide agreement with drivers, Uber was collecting its take based on a ride's total fare, the Journal reported. It's unclear exactly how much Uber pocketed thanks to the incorrectly-applied commission, which lasted for more than two years. The company says it will refund the entire amount plus interest, which amounts to an average of $900 per driver. Using an independent estimate of 50,000 New York City-area drivers, the Journal calculated that the blunder will cost the company $45 million.Uber is a tech company that prides itself on fine-tuning its smartphone app based on the data that it collects from both riders and drivers, so it's hard to fathom how an apparently simple arithmetic error could have persisted for more than two years. The company said it uncovered the mistake as it was overhauling its driver receipt system.""We made a mistake and we are committed to making it right by paying every driver every penny they are owed, plus interest, as quickly as possible,"" Rachel Holt, regional general manager of Uber in the U.S. and Canada, said in a statement to the Journal. ""We are working hard to regain driver trust, and that means being transparent, sticking to our word and making the Uber experience better from end to end.""



Regaining trust won't be easy given Uber's checkered past when it comes to dealing with drivers, especially those in New York. In January, the company agreed to pay a $20 million settlement to the Federal Trade Commission to resolve charges that it misled prospective drivers about how much they could earn by signing up. Uber claimed on its website that the median annual income for drivers in New York City was more than $90,000, when in reality less than 10 percent of all drivers in the city made that much, according to the FTC's complaint.

77,Don't Wait Until the End of the Game to Start Keeping Score,"Nov 22, 2016",Phil La Duke,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/dont-wait-until-the-end-of-the-game-to-start-keeping-score/284238,"
I used to work at a writing mill, churning out page after page of promotional material on technical subjects. I was not, thank you very much, a ""tech writer."" Business writers view tech writers as failed engineers or talentless hacks who are one economic downturn from working at Taco Bell. Tech writers, in turn, think business writers to be technological maladroits who could not pour water out of a boot if the instructions were not written on the bottom.I was new to the job and eager to impress. I was designing a training program, and I asked the program managers how many hours had been billed to the project; he looked at me blankly and shrugged. He didn't know. Not to be dissuaded, I went to the CFO who told me, ""We don't track that."" When I asked him how many hours they based the quote on, he was equally clueless.Ask me no questions. So there I was working on a project without knowing how many total hours had been bid and how many of those had been used. Madness. By now self-conscious because I believed my questions sounded more accusatory than inquisitive, I gently inquired how in the living Hell the company knew whether or not it was making a profit. I was informed with withering condescension that we billed customers, and that was called gross revenue, and then we subtracted our costs, which revealed our net profit. Madness; all around me, madness.



Related: 12 Billing Mistakes That Make It Harder for Your Business to Get PaidI grew to accept that loosey-goosey accounting method that they don't teach you in accounting classes. There were no lofty terms like depreciation and debits, and no such pesky acronyms as FIFO and LIFO inventories. No, this was something easier and somehow more pure. Truthfully, it removed any and all accountability: I was absolutely at peace with it. Still, this company did eventually collapse, largely because of its amateurish cash-flow system, but I had abandoned ship long before.


There can't be two.I had another job in a velvet sweatshop writing training. I was sure the first company was an outlier: there couldn't be two companies that didn't manage profit and labor on an individual basis. I was wrong.I was again plunged headlong into a world of madness where nobody kept score until the game was over. This time the company only tracked overhead, code for: You useless fool! You aren't working making money for the company. Here, to have over 10 percent overhead on your timesheet was to put a bullseye on your back, although everyone quickly learned how to game that system.Related: 5 Steps to Cutting Overhead SafelyIf you are an entrepreneur -- whether you are a sole proprietor or the owner of a medium- to large-sized company, you must know how much each project is costing you relative to how much you are billing for it.  This is easier than it seems, but there are some rules you should follow:


Spell out exactly what is billable and what is not.In your quotes to prospective clients, detail what's billable. Is travel to and from the customer site billable? How about kickoff meetings? A clear understanding of exactly what constitutes billable activity is essential; what's more, it avoids disputes over billing.Share the quote with the team.Too many business owners are paranoid about their billing; in their minds, they don't dare share that information with their employees. They fear that if their employees knew the rate at which they were being billed to a client, they would demand a raise. If you fear that, explain to your employees the concepts of burden rate (how much it costs a business owner to actually employ a worker) and profit (the reason you're in business). Most people will get it, and the conversation will end well -- except for ones where the employer is actively ripping off everyone in the equation. (You know who you are. So, in that case, you might want to fix that first, you greedy, dishonest pig.)Don't schedule mandatory nonbillable meetings and events.Too many employers fill employees schdules with nonbillable meetings and then punish employees for being nonbillable. Now, assuming a 40-hour week (HA! LOL ... sorry, I couldn't even type that with a straight face), an employer scheduling a daily, two-hour staff meeting instantly cuts employees' billable time by 20 percent. Think about that, but also know I'm being kind here. I have worked for companies that harp on people for the level of their overhead billing and yet routinely schedule 20 hours of nonbillable activities (meetings, training, employee birthday parties, etc.). This practice puts the employee in an intolerable dilemma: either he or she can cheat and bill the customer for that time, or the employee can log an extra 20 hours or so of work outside the workweek to retain a high, useful billability rating.Related: When Expenses Are Really Investments


Keep good time sheets.Everyone hates doing timesheets. Show me someone who enjoys doing timesheets and I will show you someone who probably eats food they find on the side walk (""Oooh, street pizza""). Good time keeping allows you to understand how much effort a project really takes; it differentiates between people who are good at their work and those who aren't.Learn from you failures.Just because you lost money on a project doesn't mean you're workers failed to perform. When you lose money on a project ask yourself why? Was it scope creep (where the project slowly grows but the price stays the same)? Was it poorly quoted? Did you miss listing key assumptions that affected your ability to bill the project more? By knowing exactly why you lost (or for that matter, why made money), you can correct the error and do better next time.

78,4 Accounting Musts for SaaS Startups,"Nov 3, 2016",Anjum Tunuli,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/4-accounting-musts-for-saas-startups/284629,"
Cloud-computing taxation is a complicated issue. Laws and regulations vary not only across national borders, but also across state lines. While there are handy primers available, wrapping your head around all the sales and use tax cases can be a real struggle.Related: Tax Trouble? Avoid These 9 Common -- and Costly -- MistakesNot helping matters is the fact that only a few states have concrete positions regarding whether to tax SaaS or exempt it. Enterprising fintech startups want to fill a void in the market with third-party integration that does real-time reporting across platforms, but not all early-stage SaaS companies stand to benefit from it.



The cost might be prohibitive, or your financials might be too complex for the software to handle.If you're in that position, don't just wait for your first audit and hope for the best. Find a solution before state auditors come knocking.Related: 4 Ways to Crack the Code for SaaS SalesThe muddy waters of SaaS taxRegulations for SaaS don't differ too much from those governing the traditional ""perpetual license"" model of software sales, but they do require extra clarification. Only a few states have taken clear positions on the matter, and these don't always match up.While Pennsylvania, Texas and Utah tax SaaS, it's exempt in both Colorado and Virginia. And, with other states still looking for the best way to tax SaaS solutions, the need to keep on top of changing and evolving regulations is clear.Proceeding with an offering with no concept of your specific liability could lead to some harsh treatment by state auditors. There are no excuses, then: Do your homework and have a professional check -- and a recheck! -- to ensure everything's correct.


There are a few other steps, moreover, that you should take before you call in the professionals. Practice the following four strategies to save your SaaS company's bacon should state auditors end up on your doorstep:1. Scale your tax planning with your company.Few things cause bigger headaches for tax accountants than when a company doesn't factor in compliance when it expands into new markets. In a survey of 29 states by the Governing Institute, 85 percent agreed that business-tax noncompliance is a problem, while nearly 30 percent rated it as a major concern.The trouble is, you might be tax compliant in your original market, but if you're expanding overseas or across state lines, you need to plan for your new liabilities in those places. I've worked with more than one client in the past who had a ""set it and forget it"" approach to taxes. Once those clients' businesses began to scale up, however, that tactic became a big problem.Avoid this issue by ensuring you have a tax professional plugged into your company road map to guide your preparation. Having that knowledge available helps you avoid a potential compliance catastrophe.2. Look beyond up-front revenue.Recognizing revenue up-front is a risky strategy. If a customer requests an early exit from his or her contract and a refund, that could cause a problem if that cash is already earmarked for something else.We regularly see companies that are on the cash-based accounting method when they come in the door, as that method is easy and intuitive at the earliest stages. But we urge caution: We always encourage our clients -- especially the ones seeking outside investment -- to move toward an accrual-based accounting method.Factor revenue in over the length of the contract. And if a customer relationship is likely to extend beyond the life of the contract, build that into your revenue calculations to gain an accurate snapshot of the business.Related: Ways To Determine The Best Pricing Model For Your App3. Recognize extras.Do you sell complementary services to supplement your core product? Are you charging fees outside of that core product? Things can get ugly in a hurry if you're not careful. I recently had to go through this exercise with a client; we had to spend additional time breaking down service and fee structures after the fact.Allocate revenue among components based on the estimated selling price of each service or fee on a stand-alone basis. Many SaaS companies have already recognized the benefits of doing this.Research from Armanino LLP shows a 13 percent decline in companies deferring non-subscription revenues between 2012 and 2014; that's a dip that is chiefly attributable to finding the stand-alone value those supplementary products possessed. This approach won't just help break down the solo worth of your services; it will also help establish standards on the average life of your customers, too.4. Keep on top of the changes.Shifts come from every direction. New-revenue recognition rules went into effect earlier this year, and many states are still figuring out their approaches to SaaS tax.Specifically, regulatory agencies are working hard to find appropriate rules, and with SaaS revenue growing at a CAGR of 19.5 percent between 2011 and 2016, it won't be long before they're on top of the situation.Part of the work my team and I do each month is just stay abreast of additions, subtractions and amendments to tax codes. That task can sometimes be very complex, even for tax pros, but it's good to keep an open dialogue with your tax professional, to check in periodically on any potential alterations.As SaaS becomes more ingrained in the world of commerce, the need to keep on top of changes will decline. But you should still check in regularly with your accountant or tax professional. You don't want to be stung once a new rule is unveiled.Overall, startups can't afford to neglect their accounting partners in the current SaaS climate. As business and regulations both expand and develop, you need to understand your liability. Don't leave it to state auditors to catch your mistakes.Related: The 4 Secrets to Achieving Customer LoyaltyCatch them yourself and save on the hassle and expense.

In this video, Entrepreneur Network partner Mark J. Kohler explains the importance of opening a business account rather than conjoining your personal and business finances. When you're first starting up, you should immediately set up a checking account for your business, Kohler advises. By doing so, you're protecting yourself and your business. A separate business account will provide asset protection as well as corporate veil protection, as long as you're paying your business expenses from your business account and your personal ones from your personal account. Keeping these two accounts separate will also protect you from any run-ins with the IRS. When your books are a mess, you lose out on write-offs and the IRS can go after you, Kohler warns. 



Lastly: open a business account simply for better management and your own sanity. It makes life easier and more organized, so at the end of the year you're not going to go crazy having to separate everything. To learn more about opening up a business account, click play.

80,The Awkward Office Love Affair of Bots and Bookkeepers,"Nov 1, 2016",Mathew Heggem,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/the-awkward-office-love-affair-of-bots-and-bookkeepers/284434,"
Business owners, be forewarned: The AccTech (accounting + technology) bots are taking over. But they're not the towering metal giants or eerily humanoid robots of sci-fi nightmares. These bots are lines of code that grab information and communicate with humans about your business operations. They know (almost) everything before you've even whispered the thought, and they might want to take your bookkeeper's job -- or maybe just work alongside her.I had a recent conversation with Jan Haugo, CEO and vice president of the Institute of Certified Bookkeepers USA (ICBUSA), who emphasized all the ways emerging technologies will transform the role of small business bookkeeping. In particular, we discussed how machine learning and artificial intelligence will enable accountants to interact with bots the same way they would with a human co-worker.Accounting technology brands such as Xero are already capitalizing on this trend. It's continued its innovation by releasing AI tools that will minimize -- and ultimately eliminate -- the amount of transaction coding businesses must do. This may seem scary now (at least for a few old-school number crunchers), but as technology develops and people cozy up to the practice, bookkeeping bots will continue their industry domination.



The evolution of your company's bookkeeper.Bookkeepers play a vital role in many organizations, but what happens when bots handle the flow of information and render several of their manual tasks redundant? The common perception of bookkeeping as a reactive role focused on tracking and managing data gets turned upside down.Technology is reaching a point where humans don't need to be involved in data collection and management. #ZeroDataEntry -- meaning functions such as the recording of invoices can occur automatically and without human intervention -- is quickly becoming a reality for many accounting teams.


The bookkeepers of the future (and, perhaps, the future is now) will go beyond understanding debits and credits and your business's current software. Bookkeepers must be able to think about technology, address workflow issues and add value on the topics of finance and operational strategy. Evaluate the effects of tech on your company, and decide how your current bookkeeper fits into this future narrative. She can assist in future-proofing your business if you give her a chance to become that AccTech advocate.According to Haugo, the U.S. lags behind other countries in this area, so how can you help to close the gap? With the shifting demands of the bookkeeper, do we have enough of the ""right"" candidates in the market? And what can you do to accommodate for this new role?These are all important questions. So here's some advice on finding (and retaining) bookkeepers who will drive your organization into the new era of accounting:1. Know your skills gap -- and fill it!According to a survey of American executives, 45 percent believe a lack of skilled labor hinders growth, and another 30 percent believe it negatively affects their businesses' profits. This is magnified when dealing with numbers professionals. So find out what's missing, and identify the skill sets that are most critical to your company's growth. Doing so will help you recruit the right people to fill the gap.


But don't just hire a bookkeeper because your friend recommended her or because you share an alma mater. Instead, conduct your due diligence to ensure you're building a strong, versatile team with each new recruit.Related: Top 10 Best Chatbot Platform Tools to Build Chatbots for Your Business2. Recruit from a pre-vetted talent pool.It's more crucial than ever to hire and retain top-notch talent -- especially when direct replacement costs up to 60 percent of the previous employee's salary. But as a small business, you need people now, and you can't rely on outdated educational institutions to generate the workforce you need. So start looking for candidates elsewhere.If you're not sure where to find top accounting talent, check out progressive industry resources. Accountex (formerly The Sleeter Group) and Xero invite top-level individuals to speak at their conferences. These panelists are change agents and leaders within the community, making them valuable additions to your network. If they can't help you directly, they may have the resources to find the right person for you.


Related: 5 Data Management Challenges Facing Small Business Owners3. Go beyond the bank reconciliation.Look beyond a candidate's recordkeeping prowess or whether she can complete a bank reconciliation. Instead, ask if she's familiar with Xero, and see if she can discuss any of the 400-plus apps that exist within her market.Evaluate her attitudes around cloud accounting and the impact of technology on the industry. Knowing a few tricks with QuickBooks Desktop and Excel won't cut it, but familiarity with Expensify, Hubdoc, Avalara or Zapier indicate an awareness of how tech transforms bookkeeping.Finally, have her share stories about how she's continued to hone her skills and what problems she's solved for previous employers. The future of bookkeeping is about managing data flow, working with tech and problem-solving. Her responses will give insight into how she'll approach the open position.


Related: How Humans Plus Machines Will Equal Amazing Advancements4. Develop talent, and make personnel changes.Bots will force changes in how bookkeepers work. If your current accounting team is filled with smart people you'd like to retain, help them learn relevant skills or transition to new positions within the company.Online education via AccTech products and organizations (such as ICBUSA) have expanded our access to future-forward bookkeeping training. Leveraging these resources for on-the-job training is crucial as companies help current accounting teams prepare for this shift. Those worth keeping will be excited by the opportunities to grow. Someone who's resistant to change might not be a fit anymore.AI bots will facilitate better, faster data processing, but they can't do everything. Businesses that welcome the bot takeover and halt their investment in humans will find it impossible to stay competitive. People (still) matter! So strike a balance between talent and tech, and do your part in making this awkward love affair between bots and bookkeepers the thriving marriage it can be.

Entrepreneurs must focus on opportunities to move their businesses forward and strategies to take their companies to the next level. But it can be easy to get distracted by all the noise or wallow in negative projections. Think of it this way: Your table is full of junk food that will make you and your business sick! Push all those empty calories off your plate, and you'll be able to concentrate on the meat and potatoes.Here are five ways to start. Find a virtual assistant.You can hire a virtual assistant from onlinejobs.ph for approximately $100 per month. A virtual assistant can help tidy up your schedule, organize your life and take care of routine tasks. It's a great way to delegate the busy-but-not-productive jobs while you handle the strategizing and purpose-driven musts that only you can do. While you're at it, consider hiring a social-media specialist or content manager who's adept at spotting trends and can help position your business.



Don't count your own beans.Unless you're a trained accountant, trying to keep track of the beans is both time-consuming and potentially treacherous. It's more efficient to outsource work that drags you away from what you do best.Hire a professional bookkeeper who can maximize your business-related deductions and keep you out of hot water with the Internal Revenue Service. Ask for referrals from friends, family members and colleagues. Or check out Bench.co, where a bookkeeping hire will run you around $150 per month. An accounting specialist needs to be your bedrock, so make sure you find just the right one for you. Then forget about watching every penny and get back to those entrepreneurial activities that make your company what it is.


Realize that thinking makes it so.Of course it's a cliché. But it's also been studied and proven to be quite true. You are what you think you are. You achieve what you think you can achieve. A quote often attributed to Abraham Lincoln states it this way: ""Many people are about as happy as they like to think they are."" Only in your case, change the word ""happy"" to ""successful.""Your mindset is the most valuable business tool you have. If you feel defeated walking in the door of your office, why bother to come in at all? Your attitude will rub off on others who depend on you for decisions and inspiration. If you think you'll lose, you already have. Remember that no successful entrepreneur ever achieved greatness without plenty of embarrassments and at least one stinging failure.

82,How and When to Grow Your Company's Accounting Function,"Oct 11, 2016",Doug and Polly White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-and-when-to-grow-your-companys-accounting-function/282896,"
Shortly after we had started our consulting firm, Whitestone Partners, we began an engagement with a home healthcare business. As we do in almost all of our engagements, we asked to see the company's financials.In response, the owner reached behind her and grabbed a three-ring binder, from which she extracted three pages, neatly stapled in the top left corner. Immediately, we could see that she had never even looked at those financials, because the paper by the staple contained no crease -- which would have been the case had anyone looked at the second page. That was unfortunate, because when people start businesses, they don't always think about the ancillary tasks that keep those businesses going. For instance, few like to think about accounting. However, if you're going to stay in business any length of time, you'll need to perform some accounting functions.



Related: How to Hire an AccountantIn our experience, accounting functions in businesses that start as a one- or two-person operation and grow to midsize tend to progress through several steps. Obviously, you don't need a chief financial officer (CFO) on day one. But you will eventually need people to help you transition. We've outlined the three progressive steps below explaining how to know when it's time to do that.


Part-time or external-service finance professionalWhen a business starts out, it usually can't support a full-time finance person. Nevertheless, you need to keep accurate accounting records from day one. If you lack the skills, it is often best to utilize a part-time professional and/or an service. You'll need to accomplish three distinct tasks:Setting up and overseeing your accounting system. Many new businesses use QuickBooks, but other accounting packages are available. You'll need to get your company set up by establishing a chart of accounts and determining the format for financial reports. En route, you will run into issues you hadn't thought about when the books were initially established. You'll want to periodically review the setup to make needed adjustments.Bookkeeping. This is the day-to-day entry of transactions into your accounting system and preparation of checks and invoices. More modest skills than those of whoever set up your accounting system will work, here. You may even take this on yourself, or employ a part-time person or an external service.One tip is to avoid using cash and instead make sure you run all transactions through the checking account or a company credit card. This will give you a record of every transaction. Another tip is to make sure that you review any money that leaves the company (e.g., via checks, credit card charges, payroll, etc.).

Unfortunately, fraud in small businesses is rampant. According to a University of Cincinnati survey, more than 60 percent of small businesses experience employee fraud and theft. These periodic checks will protect your business and remove temptation from your employees.Tax preparation -- You will also need a tax preparation person. This skill set is different from that of the two jobs described above -- although the person who set up your accounting system may also have the skills to prepare your taxes. Depending on your business, you may need to pay sales taxes, quarterly estimated taxes, payroll taxes, etc. It's complex. Consult an expert.Full-time bookkeeper, with part-time CFOAs the company grows, bookkeeping tasks will take more and more time. Eventually, your part-time bookkeeper will become full time or you'll see some economic sense in hiring a full-time employee rather than continuing to outsource your bookkeeping.


That bookkeeper won't be enough, however; he or she will need access to a person with a skill set that is broader and deeper: an external, part-time or fractional chief financial officer.This CFO should review the bookkeeper's work and be available to answer questions. He or she will also work with the owner to interpret financial statements and internal metrics, develop financing strategies (e.g., with banks and investors), tackle tax planning, establish internal controls, develop forecasting budgets and, depending on the industry, handle compliance issues.As Deloitte has described it:  ""Today's CFOs are expected to play diverse and challenging roles."" They act as stewards, protecting the company's assets. They assist in financial planning and analysis, tax and treasury tasks. Full-time CFOThe final step in the progression is that it will become cost-effective for you to hire a full-time CFO. This typically happens when the cost of your external CFO service equals what you would have to pay a full-time employee, or when your part-time CFO is working 40-plus hours a week to keep up with the work.


At that point, you will likely have augmented your internal accounting staff. For example, you may have one person handling general ledger and payroll, while another does accounts payable and accounts receivable.Accurate books are essential to running any small business effectively. Unfortunately, it is an often overlooked task. You should make sure that you have the proper accounting support as your business grows. Related: A CFO's Perspective on Mastering Time When Your Startup Needs You MostAs to the home healthcare owner we had, a few one-on-one sessions helped her fully understand and appreciate her financials. We transitioned her from Step 1 (part-time bookkeeper) to Step 2. She now has a full set of metrics that she understands and uses to run her businesses. She also has a competent full-time bookkeeper and a fractional CFO, the next steps on the path to a successful accounting function.

83,7 Crucial Money Tips to Failure-Proof Your New Business,"Sep 27, 2016",Iman Jalali,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/7-crucial-money-tips-to-failure-proof-your-new-business/281281,"
It's easy for new business owners to get overwhelmed. You've seized a fantastic idea and you're bringing it to life, but there's a lot on your plate. At the same time, if you slouch on record-keeping or don't spend money judiciously, you'll crash and burn. And if you focus too much on the finances, your product or service will suffer.Manufacturing startup Fab provides an infamous example. As Alyson Shontell starkly explained to Business Insider, ""Jobs created then lost: 500. Value created then lost: $850 million. Money burned: $250 million."" Shontell also chronicled the end of Clinkle, a payments startup that dramatically failed to build and release an app somewhat like Apple Pay. I'd also bet you're familiar with statistics that show 50 percent of new businesses fail in the first year and 95 percent fold before the five-year mark. With so much at stake and so many information streams to track, what should you be on the lookout for? It boils down to wisely managing the money inflow and outflow -- while keeping your other eye on building your core business. It's tough, to be sure. It's also a necessary skill for anyone working at a startup.



Here are eight tips to help get a handle on it all. 1. Avoid unmanaged cash flow or sloppy books.Keep records and pay attention to them. You need a bookkeeper and an accountant, but you should personally understand where your resources are going. When needed, you must be able to track every transaction down to the dollar (and ideally, to the cent). Online services such as Quickbooks Online and Bench can help.


Related: 10 Expert Tips on Managing Cash Flow as a New Business2. Obsess over accounts receivable and accounts payable.If you're not familiar with these terms, you should be. According to AccountingCoach.com, ""Accounts payable are amounts a company owes because it purchased goods or services on credit from a supplier or vendor. Accounts receivable are amounts a company has a right to collect because it sold goods or services on credit to a customer."" This is a fine balancing act of paying what you owe and collecting what others owe you. Some businesses find themselves in a dangerous cash-flow position after they've let their accounts receivable grow without proper management. You'll feel like business is going great. Sales keep coming in, but a look at your bank account reveals you aren't being paid by customers. Don't just make the sale. Make sure you collect on it, too.3. Know your COGS and your margins.COGS is an essential business acronym that stands for ""costs of goods sold."" Another resource, AccountingTools.com, describes COGS as ""the accumulated total of all costs used to create a product or service, which has been sold."" At minimum, it includes material, labor and allocated overhead -- all costs of purchase, conversion and other expenses a business incurs to bring the item or service to the point of sale.


To keep margins up, you need to keep your COGS number down. Of course, you can't sacrifice the level of quality needed to maintain great service and a standout product. If you run a fast-food restaurant, I expect you to know the margins on every menu item. You should know not only what it costs to make each cheeseburger but also the margin on each piece of cheese and slice of tomato.  Don't assign a random price simply because a competitor has a similar product or business model. Determine your true COGS and establish the right margin to remain competitive and financially viable to your own bottom line.Related: Understand Profit, Cash Flow and ROI to Ensure Your Business' Financial Health4. Diversify your revenue.Know where your money comes from. You put your company in a precarious situation if you never seek new business. Relying solely on old customers or supporting the majority of operations with one large client/contract is a recipe for disaster. You never know when a client might change direction. Never let your pipeline become stagnant. Diversify, diversify, diversify!


5. Don't overpay your taxes.Pay what you owe, not more. Keep all your receipts and make as many claims as possible. You have the right to a correct tax bill, but it's your responsibility to ensure you get it.Investigate your claims options and take full, legal advantage of IRS programs. Put some effort toward documenting all your expenses, or you'll effectively pay them twice. It's critically important for your accountant to understand your business so he or she can recommend how to utilize every possible deduction. Related: The Truth About Saving Your Receipts6. Don't overpay for anything else, either.Never spend more money than you need to. Think sensibly when purchasing. Need to get a desk? Don't spend $500 or more at a furniture specialty store if you can get a perfectly functional desk for $200 plus a bit of assembly time. And do you really need that ridiculously loaded espresso machine?


To put it bluntly, it's stupid to prioritize impressing your employees or satisfying your luxury tastes over extending your runway. Even highly funded startups such as WeWork worry about these kinds of expenses. Create a frugal (but not cheap) spending culture at your startup, and you'll have a much healthier bottom line.7. Watch your time as closely as you do your money.The adage ""time is money"" is especially true at a startup. Make sure you're not being busy without being productive. The opportunity cost can kill you. Pay attention to how time and effort are allocated across your team. It's dangerous to depend heavily on a single employee who's in danger of burnout or looking for a way out.Related: The 80/20 Rule of Time Management: Stop Wasting Your TimeThe biggest takeaway here is to be proactive about your finances. Internalize these processes until they're second nature. You'll be able to keep a keen eye on your money and your product or service.

84,5 Trends Driving Disruption in the Accounting Industry,"Sep 23, 2016",Samuel Edwards,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-trends-driving-disruption-in-the-accounting-industry/281931,"
Over the past few years, new technologies and tools have emerged and transformed just about every aspect of business, including marketing, management, web design and HR. It's easy to feel like accounting and bookkeeping have been forgotten. Until recently, the industry was stuck in the dark ages. But with the emergence of powerful new technologies over the years, it's finally beginning to look like an industry that's ripe for disruption.Before delving into the specifics of the accounting industry and the impending disruption, let's take a moment to review some of the common drivers behind general disruption.Complacency: This is the biggest sign that disruption is on the way. When businesses get complacent and decide to coast on past accomplishments, outsiders take notice and see an opportunity to come in, and stake a claim.



Frustration: Couple complacency from vendors with frustrations from customers, and some friction starts to develop. Customers want better offerings, but the vendors realize they have nowhere else to turn. Again, outsiders take notice, and see an opportunity.Lack of automation: Everything is about automation in business. If there's a task that's still being performed manually, it's costing companies time. Someone else will try to come in, and disrupt the industry by offering an automated solution to satisfy the frustrations of existing customers.


Emphasis on innovation: Finally, disruption starts to boil over when you see startups enter the marketplace, and prioritize innovation. This leads to larger companies taking notice and either purchasing these startups or revamping their own approach to innovation.When two or more of these drivers are present in an industry, then you can accurately predict disruption is right around the corner. Looking at the accounting industry, it's easy to see how all four of these drivers are in play. In other words, disruption is imminent.While it's easy to see how those four factors are present in the accounting industry, let's dig a little deeper and actually analyze some of the trends that are driving disruption at this very moment.1. Clients want better connectivity.Take a look at any service-based industry, and you can identify ways in which processes have become more customer-centric. Well, with the Internet, cloud technology and remote tools, accountants have the ability to connect with clients in meaningful ways. And it looks like they may be finally taking advantage of these capabilities.


""Online technology is giving us real connectivity with our clients and their team,"" Brett Bennett said. ""It means we're having completely different levels of discussions regarding their farms. We can collectively discuss scenarios and business plans, and our clients recognize that value.""Related: 10 Best Accounting Websites for Startups2. Automated data entry.Automation is the key driving factor in accounting and bookkeeping disruption.Specifically, we're seeing this lead to the disappearance of manual data entry. Thanks to things like automatic imports, electronic documents and robust software solutions, some businesses are even able to eliminate data entry completely.


This leads to more efficiency and allows businesses to better utilize human capital.""The greatest disruption will result from automation of data entry and workflows. This alone leads to three major changes. One, faster processing which translates into real-time reporting and more timely financials. Two, increased accuracy with less human error. And three, significant reductions in cost on an order of magnitude of 50 to 75 percent"", accounting technologist Louie Balasny said.Related: 3 Red Flags That Your Tax Accountant Is an Idiot3. Growth of the DIY approach.One trend that we've been keeping any eye on for years is the growth of accounting software. And now that cloud solutions - such as QuickBooks -- have entered the marketplace, we're seeing a lot of small businesses trying the DIY approach.


On a related noted, things like web tutorials, YouTube videos, webinars and search engines, now allow businesses to access just about anything necessary to handle their own accounting and bookkeeping needs.""This act of moving accounting online doesn't precipitate the end of accountants,"" accounting expert Jonathan Poston said. ""However, what does push accountants to the margins is how inexpensive and user-friendly the new online accounting software is.""4. Machine learning and powerful insights.Accountants are generally able to sort through data, and deliver predictive insights based on past information. However, as technology advances, things like machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are making it possible for accountants to access real-time insights that can be used in the moment to add value to businesses and clients.""An accountant will be able to look at [the insights], and hopefully the big data systems will be intelligent enough to be able to say: Here are the key things happening in this business which are different to other businesses in that category,"" one expert says. ""This business is not performing in these areas, so go out and have a discussion with your client about those things.""


Related: 3 Benefits of Cloud-Based Accounting Tools for Small-Business Owners5. Demand for specialization.We're seeing it everywhere. People and businesses are getting a taste of specialization, and they've now come to expect it in every product or service they use.If you think about it, specialization is one of the driving factors of disruption in every industry. Cable customers are cutting the cord and choosing à la carte alternatives. Social media users can tweak filters to see only the content they want to consume. Smartphone users can pick which apps they want. The list goes on and on.In terms of accounting, this is boiling over and creating a demand for specialization over bundled packages. Businesses only want to pay for the accounting and bookkeeping services they need. This is ultimately putting added pressure on the marketplace. As a result, accounting software providers are adjusting their product offerings and pricing structures accordingly. In the future, look for accounting solutions to become à la carte.


There's no doubt that disruption is right around the corner. The accounting industry is still in the dark ages, when compared to other industries, but there's currently a major emphasis on modernizing through automation.It will take a few months, but don't be surprised to see an entirely new accounting industry in 2017 and beyond.

85,4 Relatively Painless Ways to Make Your Business Tax Debt Go Bye-Bye,"Sep 15, 2016",Tom Taulli,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/4-relatively-painless-ways-to-make-your-business-tax-debt/281397,"
It's not good news -- the IRS is hiring again, with a focus on audits and collections. Something else: it appears that a big focus will be on business owners.So if you have been avoiding IRS notices about tax debt, then you may want to think about taking steps to resolve things. If not, your business and personal life could get a lot more complicated and stressful. After all, the IRS has tremendous powers, such as to seize your assets.OK then, what are some of the steps you can take with IRS tax debt? Well, let's take a look:



1. Know where you stand. Review all your IRS letters and tax returns (I recently wrote a post for Entrepreneur on how to respond to notices). As should be no surprise, the agency may have made mistakes -- which means that you could ultimately reduce some of your debt.  Although, it's usually a good move to get assistance from a tax professional. The potential savings you could gin up may be much more than the fee you pay.Related: 3 Tax Issues That Will Challenge Business Owners in 2016


2. Negotiate your penalties.Penalties can quickly spiral out of control. This is why you need to act swiftly when dealing with your IRS debt.But you can also negotiate with the agency to lower or even eliminate your penalties, such as if you can show reasonable cause. Examples of this include serious illness, harsh financial circumstances or the destruction of your home or business. The IRS also has a program that provides relief for those who have gotten in trouble with the agency for the first time. In a recent post for Entrepreneur, I go through some of the actions you can take on resolving penalties.And even if the IRS rejects your request, you still have recourse, such as for an appeal.  3. Payment plan.Once you know how much you owe, you can put together a plan. A common approach is to setup an installment agreement, which can be as long as six years (payments must be made on a monthly basis and interest/penalties continue to acrue). Keep in mind that this type of arrangmet will stop actions like liens and levies.


Related: The Top 4 Tax Strategies To Save Your Business MoneyIf you owe $50,000 or less, the process is likely to be straightforward -- and you should be able to do it online. But you will need to be in compliance with the IRS, such as having made your tax filings, deposits and withholdings.  Although, a big mistake many people make is to actually violate the agreement. If so, your situation will likely get even worse. In other words, before signing any agreement with the IRS, make sure you know the terms.4. Other options.You've seen the TV commercials where the spokesperson makes the claim that you can settle your IRS debt at ""pennies on the dollar."" Sounds too good to be true? Well, often this is indeed the case.


Yet the IRs does have something called an offer in compromise or OIC, which allows you to pay off your debt at a discount. The process -- which involves disclosing extensive financial information with forms 656 and 433 -- will determine the amount the IRS believes you can live on without causing financial hardship.

So because of this, it's a good idea to get the help of a tax professional, who should know how to fill out the paperwork as well as navigate the IRS bureaucracy.

I've met lots of successful business owners and many of them share similar traits. Many are hardworking and optimistic. Many are also intelligent and creative. Some have a good way with people.

It's about knowing how to buy something for a buck and selling it for three. It's about calculating profit margins, turnover percentages and quick ratios. The most successful (and long-lasting) business owners I know are naturally good with numbers. They like numbers. They enjoy doing the math. They get daily reports showing them cash, sales, purchases and commitments. They dive into monthly analysis of their income statement and balance sheet. They are quick to calculate prices and always know what to sell for how much in order to profit.


Profit is a number. Cash is a number.So, what if you're not good at numbers? Can you still be successful at business? You can, but you'll at a disadvantage. You'll need to be honest with yourself and take steps to compensate for this weakness. You'll need to make sure you have people around you who are good at numbers and who can help you overcome this challenge. I have met talented, visionary, creative entrepreneurs who have grown their companies into multi-million dollar enterprises but can't add two and two together. How do they do succeed? They almost always have a money person nearby -- an accountant, a CFO, a controller. They understand that to reach that level of success they'll need to invest in a person to watch the dollars and advise.Related: Why Americans' Efforts to Save Still Don't Add Up (Infographic)Being a successful business owner is about a lot of things.

87,Getting the Most From Your Accountant Means More Than Just Doing Your Taxes,"Aug 5, 2016",Karen Peacock,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/getting-the-most-from-your-accountant-means-more-than-just/279588,"
Great accountants don't just take care of tax-prep and compliance issues. Numbers really do tell a story and today's entrepreneurs are turning to qualified small business accountants to help drive success and business.With the right accountant as a thought partner, you can get insights that deliver benefits to your business by analyzing company data and providing strategic advice in support of a wide range of business decisions. How? The major technology engines of the era -- cloud computing, social, mobile and big data -- are fueling a wave of consulting-based and advisory accounting services.Sound too fancy for your small business? It isn't. As the world becomes more connected, more data becomes available and accountants can access more through the cloud -- the power of what that can do for you as a business owner will only continue to grow. 



Tech-savvy Gen Y and Gen X business owners increasingly expect to interact with their accounting professionals the same way they run their businesses -- from the smartphone in their pockets. And they expect fast responses to their requests. The good news is that accountants no longer have to spend most of their time doing manual data entry. As a result, they can instead focus on business strategy, value-add consulting and services.Following are just some of the ways accountants can help you understand what drives profit for your business, and help put you at the wheel to make essential changes.


Breaking it down.Ever wonder why that high-dollar customer isn't delivering more to your bottom line? Your accountant can help you see that it's because you and your staff are spending a disproportionate amount of time on them -- wasting precious resources.That same kind of analysis can be applied to products and services, too.Related: 10 Questions to Ask When Working With an AccountantSay you're a contractor who does a great job of winning large contracts -- but you consistently underbid them, shriveling your profit margin. Your accountant can come to the rescue, analyzing how much you're underbidding and allowing you to comfortably increase future bids to hit the right level of profitability.


Working with an accountant can also help you figure out which of your products and services you want to really lean into and push to grow. One small business I recently worked with discovered they were consistently underbidding and losing money on one type of job and making a lot of money on a slightly different type of job. Overall, the company was doing fine. But once their accountant pulled apart the pieces, one side of the business was flying and another was not doing as well. Once their accountant figured it out and shared it with them, the owners were able to make changes which meant a significant uptick in their overall business.A trusted partner, powered by the cloud.Understanding the strength of your business should be core to what you expect in an accountant. Your accountant should be a trusted partner, constantly brainstorming how to build on strengths or shore up what's going poorly.


Related: 10 Questions to Ask Before Hiring a Tax AccountantWith the advent of cloud-based accounting software, accountants can tap into your business information in a more granular way. Gone are the days where they need to ""manage the books"" on an hourly basis. Instead, accountants can save you time by ensuring your data is up-to-date by accessing your books anytime, anywhere and quickly moving between the books and offering strategic advice that really matters. Cloud-based accounting software develops key insights from data that accountants can serve up to you with detailed recommendations, and they don't have to actually come to your place of business to do it.Comparative aspects such as year-over-year trends can be actionable if you know what you're seeing. If you know that your January revenue is down this year, how can you know whether that's a bad thing? Your accountant can and should tell you whether it's just a blip or something you really need to work on.The truth is that some small businesses engage their accountant as a real thought partner and have exactly these kind of rich conversations. Others view the relationship as more transactional. As a small business owner, it's incumbent that you ask the right questions, have high expectations of what your accountant can do for you and find the right partner because every small business deserves a trusted adviser. 


Related: How to Hire an AccountantIn my own life, my husband is an entrepreneur. When he started his business, one of the things we talked about was finding the right accountant. For him, it took a hard-won lesson to get there. He initially did the basic work himself -- quickly realizing that it was taking too much time and that he needed outside help.At Intuit, our QuickBooks ProAdvisor Program has an online community of more than 150,000 ProAdvisors worldwide that allows you to search for local accounting professionals, so I pointed him there -- but you can also look on Yelp or other referral outlets. It's worth talking to at least two or three candidates to figure out where you have the right chemistry and how you can partner together to both succeed.For my husband, at first it was about getting help on bookkeeping and compliance. As sales grew, his accountant helped him create a consistent policy for when his company should recognize (or book) revenue and then leverage it to build a financial plan. That's important for all entrepreneurs who are looking to drive growth and need investment along the way. Putting thought into your revenue build will pay off because it's something you'll show potential investors.My husband found someone who was the right fit in terms of skills and expertise for his business. It's inspired him and freed him to concentrate on growing his company. It can, and should, do the same for you.

88,3 Red Flags That Your Tax Accountant Is an Idiot,"Jan 14, 2016",Gene Marks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/3-red-flags-that-your-tax-accountant-is-an-idiot/269463,"
Here's some advice: don't hire me as your accountant. I'm a Certified Public Accountant. But I'm an idiot. That's because I've always been a believer that if it's close enough, it's good enough. That's not exactly a great quality in an accountant, particularly a tax accountant. I've kept my CPA certification because my company sells financial software and does financial consulting where details are not as critical. But when it comes to taxes, I'm definitely an idiot.I'm not the only one, either. So be forewarned: just because someone knows how to prepare a tax return doesn't necessarily make him a good accountant. He can still be an idiot. Just like me. But for different reasons. How do you know if your tax accountant is an idiot? Here are three big red flags.1. He's not responsive.If you're struggling to find and communicate with your accountant, then he's an idiot. Your accountant, no matter how smart he may be, is not God. You are the client. He is the service provider. That means when you need service, he needs to respond. Fast. Every good service provider knows this, and every good accountant I know returns calls, replies to emails and answers texts.



They are, within reason, available for their clients, even on nights and weekends. They are good with technology. They have a support system in place -- staffers, administrators, answering services -- to make sure you know someone is there to help. Clients don't want to hear that their accountant is ""buried"" or that it's ""busy season."" Competent accountants know that they'll be busy between January and April 15, so they make sure they've got an infrastructure to accommodate that level of work.My accountant is excellent. I have his cell phone number. When I call or text, he replies right away. That's what people expect in 2016 -- immediate gratification. Maybe that seems unfair if you're an accountant. If you think so, then you better change professions. Because that's the way it is.


Related: 10 Questions to Ask Before Hiring a Tax Accountant2. He's not proactive.A 2014 survey from the Sleeter Group found that the number one reason why businesses leave their accountants is because they weren't getting proactive advice. We may not be tax experts, but we're not totally ignorant. We know that most tax returns can be completed with relative ease using software and a young staffer. We're not paying our tax accountant to prepare tax returns. We're paying him to give us tax advice. The code is complicated and every business has its nuances. We're looking for our accountant to find ways to reduce our tax burden. We don't want to beg. This should be his primary function.A competent accountant doesn't wait for clients to call. He doesn't hide behind the tax code or nest in his office. He doesn't avoid phone calls or run away from problems. Good accountants are reaching out to their clients proactively. They meet with their clients throughout the year. They ask their clients for financial information way before the end of the end of the year so they can make recommendations.Good accountants are also good advisors and consultants. They don't shy away from helping their clients with issues beyond just taxes. Issues like personal financial planning, insurance, even business management. I don't know a single business owner who wouldn't love a smart financial person to be on his or her team, offering their recommendations proactively. If your accountant doesn't appreciate this need, then he's an idiot.


Related: 5 Year-End Tax Preparation Tips That Will Make Your Accountant Happy3. Finally, he's just not on your side.The worst accountants I meet are the ones who think they're an extension of the IRS. ""Tsk, tsk"" they say, shaking their heads. ""You can't do that.""Successful business owners and entrepreneurs don't want to hear that. Business owners are, by their nature, glass-is-half full personalities. They are leaders. They get things done. They find solutions to problems. They don't take ""no"" for an answer. They're certainly not asking their accountant to do anything that's against the law. But they are in need of an accountant who is creative, innovative and willing to weigh the risks and rewards of decisions that may or may not result in a tax liability. They need someone on their side.If your accountant is not on your side, then he's an idiot. He should be working with you to minimize your tax liabilities. He should be making recommendations and also making you fully aware of your risks. If he truly values you as a client, he will be a partner willing to take reasonable risks with you. If the IRS does come knocking on your door, he should be not only well-versed in the position you've taken and ready to provide a solid rationale, but also ready to stand by you and not run for cover. If your accountant is not willing to be in the foxhole with you, then he's not a partner. He's just a tax return preparer. And he's an idiot.


As you enter this year's tax season, take another look at your accountant. If he's an idiot, then find someone better. Just don't ask me. You'll regret it!Related: Why You Should Hire Your Kids This Summer

89,How Much of What You Are Selling Do You Need to Have Available?,"Dec 22, 2015",Doug and Polly White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/how-much-of-what-you-are-selling-do-you-need-to-have/254218,"
Scarcity vs. excess is a constant challenge for business owners. Having the right number of whatever you are selling, to meet customer need (whether you're selling something tangible like cell phones, or a less tangible item, like consulting hours) can be a puzzle. If you have too many, your product may go to waste. If you have too few, you are probably missing an opportunity.Related: 10 Best Accounting Websites for StartupsSo, how do you determine the correct number of products or amount of anything else to have on hand? As an example, let's say that your company sells sandwiches from a food cart. The first step is to estimate the number of sandwiches you will sell each day. If you have historic information about the number of sandwiches you have sold, your estimate will be useful. If not, use your best estimate, but also collect data going forward.



To do this, the simplest approach is to come up with the total number of sandwiches you sold over the past year on days when you didn't run out of sandwiches and divide that number by the number of days that you didn't run out of product.This will give you an estimate of the number of sandwiches you sell daily. Consider only days when you didn't run out, because on days when you did, you won't actually know how many sandwiches you might have sold.


Once you have this simple point forecast, consider additional factors such as:Trends -- If your business is growing, you will want to forecast sales that are above the average for the past year. Similarly, if sales are declining, you will need to forecast below the average for the past year.Seasonality -- You may find that you sell more sandwiches when children are in school, for instance, because fewer people are on vacation.Day of the week -- It may be that you sell fewer sandwiches on Fridays than other days, because people are taking long weekends.Weather -- The number of sandwiches people purchase may change with temperature and/or precipitation.There are quantitative techniques that can help with demand forecasting, but applying good business judgment is always important. Once you understand the impact of factors such as the ones described above, you can adjust the current day's forecast up or down, as appropriate. The result will be your best estimate of the number of sandwiches you will sell on any given day.Related: Intuit Launches New Online QuickBooks App for WindowsThe cost of overage, or surplus (having to throw out a sandwich, for example), is the money you spent to make each sandwich. The opposite cost (a lost sale) is the profit you lose when you miss a sale because you ran out of product. Note that the cost of this loss will always be the price minus the cost of overage.


We'll assume that the actual demand for your sandwiches is equally likely to be above or below your point estimate. In this case, if the cost of surplus is equal to the cost of shortage, you should simply make the number of sandwiches equal to your point estimate.If the cost of overage is greater than the cost of loss, you'll want to make fewer sandwiches than your point estimate. On the other hand, if the cost of overage is less than the cost of loss, you'll want to make more sandwiches than your point estimate. This makes sense because you want to avoid the more costly consequence.You can use the formula below to optimize the quantity of sandwiches you should make. Admittedly, this is somewhat of an oversimplification, but if we attempted to be more precise, the math gets very complex.Optimal number = point estimate X (1 – (cost of overage – cost of loss) / sandwich price)


Therefore, if the point estimate is 426 sandwiches, the cost of overage is $1.00, the cost of loss is $3.50, and a sandwich sells for $4.50, the optimal number of sandwiches to make is 663.Admittedly, most of the time you will be throwing sandwiches out, but that will cost you only $1.00 per sandwich. Each unit of lost sales because you ran out will cost you three-and-a-half times that much. Therefore, it makes sense that you would want to have a few extra sandwiches. Finally, in deciding how many sandwiches to make, you may want to consider longer-term implications. For example, regularly running out of sandwiches may drive customers away.Whether you are selling a product (sandwiches, cell phones or doorknobs) or service hours, determining how much to have available will be critical to your businesses success. You will want to use good business judgment when adjusting quantities due to various factors. As is nearly always the case, analysis can help you understand the situation, but almost every business decision has an element of judgment.Related: A Simple Guide to Understanding Your Profit and Loss Statement

90,Think You're Not Ready for a Marketing Budget? Think Again.,"Dec 21, 2015",Robert Wallace,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/think-youre-not-ready-for-a-marketing-budget-think-again/253653,"
Ask nearly any startup founder what their marketing budget is, and you'll often be met with a chuckle and -- ""Marketing budget? What marketing budget?"".Cash restraints and unpredictability can equate to rocky projections. And while the idea of having an actual marketing budget may seem unattainable for many early-stage companies, the good news is that today, marketing experimentation is relatively cost effective and approachable -- making it easier to build an actual budget.Before you begin, your leadership team (even if it's just two of you) must outline clear strategic objectives and generate sales-revenue targets. From there, it comes down to brass tacks. The following tips will guide you through the marketing tactics that can help entrepreneurs and young ventures give budgeting for marketing a proper try.



Related: 5 Marketing Changes Small Businesses Need to Make in 20161. Start with standards.There is no one-size-fits-all method for developing a marketing budget. Generally speaking, the amount you devote should be a percentage of revenue generated -- often between two to 10 percent, depending on industry standards. If the data is available, look at the past 12 months of revenue, and determine an appropriate percentage. Your established future sales goals will also come into play here. From there, use your monthly sales targets to determine a short-term budget that will enable you to reach those targets. Be sure you leave room for some flexibility.


It's not uncommon for newly seeded companies to naively throw funds into marketing and promotion without much aim or direction. This leads to unmeasured outcomes and a mentality of waste. Instead, think like you are bootstrapping the entire operation. This will force you to drive for effectiveness and push only for decisions that add real value.2. Measure everything.When the budget is small, you should have as much knowledge as possible before making spending decisions. It takes time, but the more you know about measurement, the more informed your decisions will be.  Every dollar you allocate should have a specific purpose, and knowing how to check those dollars spent for effectiveness is imperative for early-stage companies. It will allow you to quickly pivot and adjust your tactics before you spend too much. Put quantitative measurements in place in order to help prioritize those designated dollars.Related: Keep Your Business Finances in Order With These 6 TipsMarketing budgets can be used on speaking engagements, sponsorships, advertising, promotion and beyond, and if you figure out how to gauge success, you'll be able to see which of these is most effective for your business. If you're lost on how to start, try inviting product managers and line owners who know the market intimately to offer their opinions as to prioritizing your marketing initiatives.


It's not always easy to draw a straight line from marketing efforts to the revenue generated from the dollars spent, but where you can measure, do so. Business-to-business firms can track new leads, while business-to-consumer firms might want to measure new users.Growth hacking, a common term used in today's fast-growth organizations, simply means to experiment vigorously with various marketing tactics. This helps you to identify specific methods of measurement, see what's working and capitalize on repeating that process.3. Stay flexible.Once you've established what metrics matter to your company, you'll be able to stay on top of critical information that informs you when to adjust tactics. The benefit of tracking effectiveness is that it doesn't leave the marketing strategy to chance -- something many young ventures make the mistake of doing. It encourages and enables purposeful decisions, and keeps spending conservative and purpose-driven.Experimenting with the marketing budget is an ongoing process that is rooted in hard data and refined with measurements. The most important thing to keep in mind is that the budget evolves with changes in the company, sales revenue, monthly goals and product launches. Recognizing this evolution helps any size venture make better budget estimates.

Q: How should I go about replacing my controller?A: When faced with hiring for a key position, you'll logically start with a job description. You can find sample lists of general duties and responsibilities online, and your outside CPA firm undoubtedly can weigh in. The list should cover the basics: handling transactions and the operations of the accounting staff and software system, and being able to produce monthly financial statements -- income statements, balance sheets and cash-flow statements -- that are complete, accurate and timely, as well as any other reports you need to make business decisions. You should specify compliance-related responsibilities and whether they involve the government or audits. Depending on the level of outsourcing used, these could include payroll and payroll taxes, workers' compensation, insurance and other requirements.Finding a person with QuickBooks experience is easy. If you use higher-level packages, look for someone who has worked with similar advanced accounting software and is comfortable with its complexities, especially on the reporting side. If the job involves upgrading the company to a more robust accounting system, experience with such an installation is a must.

92,Keep Your Business Finances in Order With These 6 Tips,"Nov 4, 2015",Thomas Smale,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/keep-your-business-finances-in-order-with-these-6-tips/252445,"
Do you find managing your business finances to be a pain? Although it may appear to be, and often is, tedious, keeping your finances in order is extremely important.It helps you to project where your business is headed, and when you know exactly how your revenue and expenses are stacking up, you can begin to make more informed decisions for your business. Maintaining your financial records also makes tax reporting and payments a lot more manageable.Don't try to do it all alone. Leverage the talent and the tools that are available to you. Here are six tips to help you keep your business finances in order:



1. Keep your personal and business finances separate.Mixing your personal and business finances will inevitably result in confusion. It might seem convenient to charge everything to a single card, but ultimately this will make tracking your spending far more complicated than it needs to be.Begin by opening separate bank and credit card accounts for your business. For the ongoing tracking and measuring of your finances, and for tax purposes, this practice will take a major headache out of sorting your transactions every quarter, or every year as the case may be.


Related: 5 Finance Tips All Business Owners Should FollowThis will also take the guesswork out of the equation. If you want to be successful in business, you need to be able to monitor and track your key performance indicators. You need to know the score, and some of the most important elements include cash flow, expenses, revenue, profit and so on.2. Choose accounting software that makes sense for your business.When it comes to accounting software, there are a variety of different solutions. Think of Xero, QuickBooks and Freshbooks. The best online accounting software depends on your business, and it's worth considering several options before making a decision.If you haven't moved your financial data from desktop software to the cloud yet, that should be your first order of business. Cloud-based tools allow you to view real-time insights, and they can be accessed from anywhere at any time. The ability to keep an eye on your finances on the fly gives you a great deal of flexibility as a business owner.


If you've already picked out an online solution, ensure that it's the right one for you and your business. Today more than ever, there are a myriad of options to choose from, and if you aren't satisfied with your current service, you can always make the switch to another platform that better matches your needs.3. Consider hiring a professional bookkeeper.Most people aren't numbers people, and will never be excited about them as much as accountants or bookkeepers are. If managing your own finances is starting to get on your nerves, it's time to look into hiring a qualified bookkeeper.Many entrepreneurs have a tendency to try to handle everything themselves. But as with legal matters, the granular elements of small-business accounting aren't usually within a business owner's wheelhouse.Although it's easy to balk at the expense of working with a bookkeeper, they will be able to help you save money over the long haul. You'll be freed up to work on high value tasks that keep the business moving forward, while your bookkeeper handles the tedium of number crunching.


4. Stay organized and plan ahead.The aforementioned tips should help with keeping your finances organized. Moreover, monitoring your finances and projecting future revenue and expenses will enable you to make better long-term decisions for your business.Without this information, planning ahead can prove challenging. If you aren't looking at the future of your business, you could be taken by surprise. If you want to get ahead and stay ahead of the competition, you should plan as much as 10 years in advance.You'll be able to mitigate unwanted surprises if you stay ahead of the ball. Even if unexpected expenses do rise, if you've been practicing conservatism in your spending, you shouldn't run into any major problems.Related: Things Always Cost More Than You Think


5. Make a budget.Part of staying organized and planning ahead should include creating a budget. Many business owners view this step as dull and unnecessary, but the importance of a budget could be equated with the value of a well-formed business plan.A budget is not a tool for planning out how every penny should be spent. Rather, it's a framework that you can use to help you make clear-headed decisions, whether it's increasing your marketing spend, or cutting expansion costs to keep your profits on track.Make a budget and use it as your guide. Don't allow it to force you into decisions you don't want to make, but use it to make adjustments when and where necessary.6. Find a trusted credit union in your locality.Credit unions are invaluable to small-business owners, especially since they are often willing to provide loans at competitive rates. Make it a point to seek out the best one in your locality, and make sure they understand your business needs. The partnership could prove immensely beneficial.


Some of the other advantages of credit unions include fewer transaction fees and account service charges, as well as flexible, customized services.Since credit unions are not answerable to shareholders, they are empowered to put your interests at the forefront. Credit unions also keep profits within the community, and help budding entrepreneurs get their dream businesses off the ground.Final thoughtsThe reality is that many business owners do not keep track of their finances. Whether you know it or not, this could mean missing out on opportunities to minimize your expenses and maximize your profits.Preparing online business accounts can take time, but the end result is worth the effort. Even if you don't consider finances to be the most important part of your business, streamlining your process will allow you to develop a straightforward step-by-step process as opposed to a search-and-find initiative.


Make the effort to simplify the organization of your business finances moving forward. This will allow for long-term stability and sustainability.Related: 10 Best Accounting Websites for Startups

93,4 Things You Need to Know if You Hope to Raise $50 Million With a Regulation A+ Mini-IPO,"Oct 15, 2015",Kendall Almerico,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/4-things-you-need-to-know-if-you-hope-to-raise-50-million/251000,"
Regulation A+ went into effect on June 19, 2015, with the promise that small companies could raise up to $50 million in new capital through an online mini-IPO with investments from anyone in ""the crowd"" and not just from wealthy accredited investors. By giving access to the general public, this section of the JOBS Act promised to be a game changer for the American economy, and for small businesses everywhere.So why, three months after this law went into effect, is very little being heard about anyone raising money under the new law?One requirement of the SEC filings is that your company's financial records are in order and that the last two years of financial statements need to be audited by an independent CPA or auditing firm for the SEC to approve a Regulation A+ offering. Not surprisingly, few small businesses were ready for this requirement when the law went into effect, and many are still trying to get these records in order and audits completed to file their mini-IPO offering for SEC approval.



Related: 5 Finance Tips All Business Owners Should FollowHaving financials ready for SEC review is a luxury most small businesses were not prepared for when the mini-IPO law became a reality and now are playing catch-up. Craig Denlinger of Artesian CPA is one of the accountants at the forefront of the Regulation A+ movement. I asked Denlinger for some tips to pass along to help facilitate the process of a Regulation A+ filing.


""Initial filings are taking a lot more time than I think people anticipated, from both legal and accounting side,"" Denlinger says. ""As the industry builds out, framework and templates time and costs will go down.""In the meantime, Denlinger suggested the following:1. Preparation for the audit.Companies should get a strong accountant in place, preferably a CPA with SEC experience, prior to the audit. The SEC requires a company to follow Regulation S-X, Article 2, for all financials filed with a mini-IPO offering. Denlinger says that Regulation S-X ""requires the company raising funds to prepare the financial statements, so companies cannot rely on the auditor for full preparation. Audit firms must take a more hands-off approach than is typical under AICPA independence rules.""2. No disclaimers allowed.Denlinger says that opinion disclaimers in the audit are not acceptable under to Regulation S-X. ""If a company is an inventory-based business, satisfying the audit requirement can prove difficult since the auditor is unable to observe the inventory counts for the past two years that are required to be audited,"" Denlinger says. ""This doesn't necessarily preclude companies with inventory from a Reg A+ offering, but it is something that should be discussed very early in the process to ensure the auditor will be able to issue an opinion that the SEC will consider an acceptable audit.""


Related: 10 Best Accounting Websites for Startups3. Experience counts.The Regulation A+ rules create for a hybrid between public company and private standards for financial reporting, so the auditor's SEC experience is important to understand the additional requirements to meet the financial reporting standards.4. What are the actual audit requirements? There is a lot of confusion as to audit requirements of Regulation A+. While it has been commonly reported that a company must have two years of audited financials to attempt to raise up to $50 million in a mini-IPO, there is not much guidance as to what the SEC actually requires. What happens if your business, for example, is less than 2 years old?For example, Denlinger says that a company with a calendar year-end filing with the SEC in February of 2016 would need to present audited financial statements for the years ended Dec. 31, 2013 and 2014, and unaudited financial statements as of a date not sooner than June 30, 2015.


It gets even more confusing if more than three months have passed since the company's year end. This is why you need a good accountant. A number of early Regulation A+ filings were reportedly rejected without review based on the incorrect financials being included. Another reason you need a good accountant.Regulation A+ can be an incredible capital funding tool, but there are a lot of accounting hoops to jump through and roadblocks to avoid.Did I mention that you need a good accountant?Related: 7 Tips on How to Do Accounting For a Kickstarter Campaign

94,5 Finance Tips All Business Owners Should Follow,"Oct 6, 2015",Eric Siu,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-finance-tips-all-business-owners-should-follow/250812,"
I don't know about you, but finances aren't really my strength. I'm an entrepreneur -- a big picture guy. I like to tackle big problems and develop big visions. I don't like to sit around staring at a financial spreadsheet while I spend hours upon hours entering expenses by hand.But whether we like them or not, finances are a necessary part of running a small business. To get some insight on effective procedures that entrepreneurs can adopt to improve their own accounting practices, I sat down for a quick chat with LessAccounting founder Allan Branch.Here's what he had to say on this critically important subject:



1. Don't procrastinate.One of the biggest mistakes Branch sees new entrepreneurs make is that they put off their bookkeeping needs. If you aren't financially-minded, programs such as Quickbooks can make small-business accounting seem completely unmanageable, especially if all you need to do is send out a few invoices and track a few expenses.Related: 10 Ways to Avoid the 'Elephant in the Room': Not Getting Paid


The problem is, of course, that if you put off your accounting work, it doesn't go away. It just gets bigger, and eventually you're going to be faced with an overwhelming mess that you'll need to sort out. The bigger the mess, the more you're likely to procrastinate.Fortunately, though, Branch argues that small-business bookkeeping is actually very simple. If you break everything down into small categories -- categorizing expenses, paying employees, sending invoices -- the whole thing becomes much more manageable and the compulsion to put it off lessens.2. Understand your seasonal cash flow.Another cautionary tip Branch gives to young startups is to understand seasonal cash flow -- and that pointer comes directly from his personal experience. LessAccounting, for example, has major seasonal spikes that occur during tax season, followed by a slowing of conversions from April to October. It wasn't an easy lesson to learn, but Branch eventually realized that he needed to maintain a three- to four-month cash cushion to help get the company through these slower periods.You need to know your sales cycles as well. If you're a business-to-consumer retailer that sells $20 items, your sales cycle is likely fast enough that having a cash buffer on hand is less of a concern. But if you're a business-to-business company whose sales cycles last months, or even years, having extra capital in the bank can mean the difference between being able to weather the long periods before revenue from past sales manifests and having to fold early because your cash has dried up.


3. Focus on your core strengths.One issue that both Branch and I see far too much is startup owners, particularly software-as-a-service providers, believing that they need to create everything from scratch. I get it. If you've already got a coder on your team, it can be seriously tempting to have him or her build internal apps and products rather than investing in existing solutions.The problem with this approach is that it wastes your time. It might save you a few pennies at the end of the day, but the cash you'll save is peanuts compared to what it cost you to take a key employee away from those activities that drive revenue for your business. Instead, it's far more cost-effective to work with existing providers and use the tools that they've already perfected, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel on your own.Related: The 5 Worst Cash-Flow Mistakes Small-Business Owners Make4. If you have to work 80 hours a week, you're not profitable.This lesson from Branch was an interesting one for me. I'm big on growth hacking (I don't run a website called Growth Everywhere for nothing!), but Branch's approach to business has been much more moderate. Of particular interest to me was his assertion that, if you have to work 80 hours a week to keep your business afloat, you're not profitable.


Too many startup entrepreneurs blow through the earliest stages of their company's growth by putting all their time and energy into their businesses at the expense of their health and relationships. While I'd argue that that's fine for short periods, I get why Branch says that this shouldn't be a part of your long-term financial calculations. It's simply not sustainable.If your company is only in the black because you're working yourself to the bone, your numbers are going to take a major turn once you scale back your workload -- if you don't collapse from exhaustion first, that is.Whether you choose to apply Branch's ""no growth hacking"" philosophy to your business, make sure that your labor costs are fully accounted for. Undervaluing the time you invest in your business hurts everyone involved.5. Ask for discounts.Finally, here's a fun tip from Branch: if you're seriously tight on available funds but you want to take advantage of existing solutions, try emailing the founder and asking for a discount. It won't work in every case, but you'll be surprised by how often you can get free stuff just by asking.

95,Things Always Cost More Than You Think,"Sep 28, 2015",Gene Marks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/things-always-cost-more-than-you-think/250880,"
No, that puppy is not free.The sign may say ""free,"" and that mutt may be absolutely adorable and will give you years of love and devotion and pleasure, but that puppy is definitely not free. You're not going to listen to me anyway, are you? You're going to listen to your pleading, tearful 6-year old who definitely wants that puppy and has already named her Sparkles. Fine, go ahead. But you've been warned.You're going to open up your wallet for Sparkles. You're going to buy her a beautiful doggy bed, stock the cabinets with healthy, environmentally-friendly, organic and insanely overpriced dog food and invest in the best collar and leash money can buy -- because nothing's too good for Sparkles. You're going to take Sparkles to the vet and shell out hundreds for examinations, shots and neutering. You will get yelled at by a customer for falling asleep at a sales meeting because you stayed up all night listening to Sparkles bark or chase imaginary (you hope) friends around the house.



Oh, of course it's worth it. Sparkles is a bundle of love! But, oh boy, did it cost you.Related: How Much Cash Do You Need for Your Business's Safety Net?


No, Sparkles was not free. Nothing is free. Everything costs more than people say. Your job, as a business owner, is to make sure you're fully aware of all the costs before you buy in.For example, software has a hidden cost. When you move to that great, cloud-based system to do your accounting, payroll or sales tracking, you're not just paying that ""low monthly fee"" for the service.Who's going to migrate the data from your existing system? Who's going to get everything set up in the new system? Who's going to make sure you're getting the same reports you were getting before? Who's going to teach everyone how to use the new system and be available to answer all the inevitable questions?Someone will need to do all of this. Maybe that someone is an employee of yours or maybe it's someone you'll hire from the outside, or maybe a combination of the two. But the reality is that it will take time and time is money.


Related: 8 Ways to Make Certain Optimism Doesn't Blind You to Signs You're Going BrokeWhen you bring in an outside consultant, lawyer, accountant or project manager have you really considered the costs? No, it's not just their hourly fee. It's the time you're going to have to take to work with that person. No professional can do their work in a vacuum. To really succeed with a project you're going to have to be fully engaged with your consultant. You can't just hand the ball over and expect him or her to run down the field. You can't absolve yourself of any responsibility.Outsiders need supervision, guidance and input from you if they're going to help you accomplish the goals you've given them. Don't expect to just wipe your hands clean. And don't expect it to just cost you an hourly fee. There's a lot more to it than that.When you hire that new customer-service rep, have you considered all the costs? It's not just salary. It's health insurance, social security, Medicare and unemployment insurance. It's sick time and vacation days and 401(k) contributions.


It's the weeks your new hire will need to get up to speed, which means someone internally will need to provide training, fixing mistakes and dealing with customers during the transition. It's the time you'll need to check in on progress, sit in on evaluations and approve that promised salary increase six or 12 months later. No, a person's salary is not the only cost. Even a ""free"" summer intern requires time to supervise. There are other costs you have to consider.Do you consider all of these costs when you're about to invest? It's always more than people say, so build in your cushions and increase your budget. And though you may not wind up with a lovable, devoted puppy as your reward, you can at least make sure you're not paying more for something than you intended.Related: 8 Expenses Businesses Should Pass on to Customers

97,5 Tasks Entrepreneurs Are Better Off Outsourcing,"Aug 25, 2015",Jacqueline Whitmore,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-tasks-entrepreneurs-are-better-off-outsourcing/249753,"
Being an entrepreneur means there's always more work to do, and not enough time to do it. That's why the most successful business owners delegate certain tasks to freelance contractors who specialize in providing valuable time-saving services for a fee.In today's Internet-fueled service economy, it's easier and more convenient than ever to hire people to perform fee-for-service jobs on a one-time or ongoing basis. Here are five jobs you should consider outsourcing to experts, and some resources for finding qualified professionals.1. Accounting and taxes.Frankly, no successful business owner should have to do his or her own taxes. It gets more complicated and time-consuming staying on top of your expenses the bigger your business becomes. Hire a reputable person to keep your books in order, help you grow your business, and give you sage advice. A Certified Professional Accountant (CPA) will organize your finances and help you figure out what parts of your business bring in the most and least income. Word-of-mouth is always the best way to find a qualified CPA or you can contact your state accounting society.

Writing and social media.When you need website verbiage, high-quality blog posts, newsletter articles, marketing materials (like brochures and ad copy), case studies or whitepaper reports, a professional writer can produce it for you. Many writers can also provide content for your social media profiles to get your message out through Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other sites. This guide to hiring freelance writers explains your main options.


3. Graphic design and web development.Whether you want a more attractive website, a brand-defining logo or eye-catching print materials, a professional graphic designer will help your business look its best. Whatever your goals, there's a graphic designer with the talent, aesthetic sensibilities, and visual skills to fulfill your vision and enhance your company brand. Many also offer web development, which will make your website function technically. Check out this basic guide to hiring freelance graphic designers and web developers.Related: These 25 Successful Startups Were Built With Outsourced Development4. Administrative assistance.If you dread sifting through your overflowing email inbox every day, a virtual administrative assistant (VA) may be just what you need to streamline that frustrating process and keep you from being inundated by a constant stream of messages. In addition to consolidating and prioritizing your correspondence, VAs can do other secretarial and clerical tasks such as scheduling appointments and making travel plans. You can find a qualified VA who'll save you time and help you stay organized at the International Virtual Assistants Association (IVAA) or upwork.com.5. Web research.Prospecting for new business and keeping up with the latest developments in your industry can be time consuming and daunting. A web researcher can research information you, whether it's gathering information and statistics for an upcoming presentation or looking up the names of companies and contacts for a leads list. They can also organize this material in a form that's easy to use and read. You can find a plethora of web researchers at elance.com.


Before you waste your time on another project, consider hiring freelance contractors to take care of both routine and higher-level business tasks. This will make your to-do list shorter and free you up to focus on the things you're best at and that generate the most income for your business.Related: 10 Things to Outsource to a Virtual Assistant

99,7 Tips on How to Do Accounting For a Kickstarter Campaign,"Jun 2, 2015",Jared Hecht,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/7-tips-on-how-to-do-accounting-for-a-kickstarter-campaign/246835,"
If business loans make you wary, venture capitalists haven't come knocking and you don't happen to have a trust fund flush with cash, consider an alternative: launching a crowdfunding campaign on a platform like Kickstarter. Crowdfunding can be a great alternative source of funding for your startup or small business.Related: Crowdfunding Nearly Tripled Last Year, Becoming a $16 Billion IndustryBut before you sign up on Kickstarter, before you launch your campaign and start tossing your ""free money"" into the air, it's important to know the ins and outs of the accounting processes and the tax implications related to crowdfunding as a business-financing source.



Here are several best practices you should follow to accurately record and report income from your Kickstarter campaign:1. Separate your business and personal funds.Ordinarily, we could skip right over this step, because if you are even considering a crowdfunding campaign, you already would have done it. But in case you've been living under an accounting rock, let's review: Before you do any sort of fundraising, indeed, before you go into business in any significant way, you absolutely must separate your business and personal finances!


Even if you're a sole owner and not incorporating your business, you need to hold separate bank accounts and credit cards for your business and personal finances. If you fail to draw that initial line in the financial sand between what is business and what is personal, you're just asking for an eventual accounting disaster.2. Set your goals and reward levels.Before you officially launch your Kickstarter campaign, you'll want to be mindful of certain tax implications with Kickstarter funds. The taxes you pay on Kickstarter-related income will impact the net revenue of your campaign, so in order to have all the funds you need to develop your product, you'll should factor those tax requirements into your overall fundraising goal.While Kickstarter isn't exactly a store, funds generated from Kickstarter campaigns are seen by the government as taxable income. We'll get into specifics later on, but for now, know that you'll need to pay both income tax and, in most cases, sales tax on any funds you receive. Your exact income- and sales-tax rates will depend on several factors, including where you live. So, talk to your accountant about exactly what rates you'll be expected to pay.Once you've estimated your state and federal tax rates, consider that additional percentage in your overall fundraising goal and reward levels. If you're uncertain, a good rule of thumb is to take the total dollar amount you'll need for your project, then add 20 percent. That will give you a reasonable margin to cover tax-related expenses.


Related: Why Venture Capitalists Are Turning to Crowdfunding3. Record your Kickstarter contributions.Determining exactly how to record contributions to your Kickstarter campaign can be a bit tricky. It's not equity, and since you're not providing a product upfront, it's not exactly income (although it can be taxed that way by the IRS). Ultimately, with a Kickstarter transaction, your contributor is paying you for a product that you are expected to deliver at some point in the future. But because you're delivering a product and not paying back an exact dollar amount, it's not a small business loan, either.Ideally, you should work with an accountant to determine how best to record Kickstarter funds given your exact campaign scenario. If you're on a shoestring budget and handling your own accounting, your safest bet is to record the contributions as unearned income. Once you've completed your campaign pledges, you'll be able to move those entries over to the earned-income category.However you record the event, the most important thing is that you keep steady track of what crowdfunding contributions you've received and from whom. You'll need this information both for tax-reporting purposes and for accurate fulfillment of your tiered-campaign rewards.


4. Track your project-related expenses.In addition to recording Kickstarter contributions, you'll also need to track any and all expenses related to your campaign pledges. This will include expenses for both any tier level gifts for contributors and many of your expenses for the project for which you're raising funds.Before you launch your Kickstarter, do the necessary research to get estimates for all expenses related to your project. Be as specific as possible on your Kickstarter campaign about the costs associated with your project. Not only will this information let your contributors know where their funds are going but will also help you to justify tax-deductible expenses related to your campaign.Keep invoices, receipts and records for all expenses related to your project. You'll need this information for your accountant or to justify tax deductions in the event that your company is audited by the IRS.5. Provide your taxpayer identification information to Stripe.In January 2015, Kickstarter made the switch from Amazon to Stripe for handling the third-party payments made through its campaigns. While Amazon required users to provide taypayer ID information directly, Stripe works with Kickstarter to receive all taxpayer identification information for accounting purposes.


So, once you've completed the ""account info"" section within your Kickstarter account portal, Stripe will automatically track earnings and file a 1099-K form with the IRS on your behalf.Per IRS regulations, the 1099-K form is filed only if you receive more than $20,000 in gross contributions, or if your campaign has more than 200 separate donor transactions.6. Settle up with Uncle Sam.Contrary to online speculation, you will still owe income taxes to the IRS regardless of whether you meet the $20,000 threshold for Stripe to file the 1099-K.The good news is that you won't owe these taxes until after you've fulfilled your pledge promises, at which point the funds become earned income. However, you also can't claim any deductions on project-related expenses until that point, either. As long as you've clearly tracked both your Kickstarter-related revenue and your project expenses, it should be easy to determine profit or loss for the project and determine what taxes you'll need to pay.


7. Report state sales tax.Income tax isn't the only area where you'll need to deal with taxes. If you live in a state with a sales tax (that's everywhere except Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon), you'll also need to pay sales tax on your in-state backers.One big difference between income and sales taxes is that your sales tax is due at the point of sale. Unlike what happens with income taxes, you don't get to wait until the end of your project to pay these taxes. As pledges come in -- both during your Kickstarter campaign and for any presales during your product development -- you'll need to go to your state's department of revenue website each quarter and fill out a form to declare how much you owe. Many states will also allow you to make quarterly payments on their websites.While sales tax applies only to in-state backers, it can still take a significant bite out of your overall fundraising number, so make sure you factor your state's sales tax rate into both your reward levels and your overall fundraising goal.As with any accounting or tax-related blog, it's important to remember that this isn't tax advice tailored to your particular scenario. Before you launch your Kickstarter campaign, consult a professional accountant about your particular business model and campaign set-up to determine your legal requirements for recording and reporting Kickstarter funds.

100,"Raising Millions With Equity Crowdfunding Will Cost You, But How Much?","May 20, 2015",Kendall Almerico,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/raising-millions-with-equity-crowdfunding-will-cost-you/246063,"
The recently released Regulation A+ is the first section of the JOBS Act that allows a company to raise capital from the general public. By opening up private company investments to the ""crowd,"" Regulation A+ promises to be a game changer for how emerging companies are funded. It's the first nationally available form of equity crowdfunding to non-accredited investors.This will not be as easy as a Kickstarter campaign, however. Raising capital with Regulation A+ will involve more than going online, creating a crowdfunding campaign and watching the money flow in. Regulation A+ involves the sale of equity or debt in your company and is governed by securities laws. This means (cue maniacal laughter) attorneys' fees, accountants' fees and compliance costs. Raising $50 million under Regulation A+ is going to require your company to invest money in the process.The question is: Can Regulation A+ be affordably used by startups and small businesses?Related: Regulation A+ Is Not the Savior of Cash-Seeking StartupsThe first thing to understand is that there are two ""tiers"" of Regulation A+. Tier 1 allows a company to raise between $1 million and $20 million, and there are no limits on the amount that an individual non-accredited investor can invest. Tier 2 allows a company to raise between $1 million and $50 million, but non-accredited investors can only invest 10 percent of their income or net worth in each tier 2 offering. 



There are different rules and costs associated with each tier. Both tiers will have sizeable costs for SEC compliance and legal fees (damn those lawyers). Tier 1 will have costs for compliance with state securities laws or ""blue sky laws."" While tier 2 doesn't require you to comply with the blue sky laws for each state, it will have more onerous accounting, auditing and ongoing SEC reporting requirements.Both tiers have legal fees and SEC compliance costs, so let's tackle that ugly subject first. When the law becomes effective on June 19, expect most of the big securities law firms and lawyers to quote ridiculously large bills of more than $100,000 in legal fees and compliance costs.The reality is, there are competent entrepreneurial-minded lawyers who will charge far less, so shop around, but be sure to check credentials and hire someone who knows the JOBS Act and the Regulation A+ process. Also, as time goes on, expect to see legal fees and compliance costs come down, particularly as innovative companies find ways to automate the compliance process, and as lawyers become more comfortable with the new law.The two remaining factors are the cost of complying with state blue sky laws (in tier 1) and the cost of two years of audited financial statements (in tier 2).Related: Tax Trouble? Avoid These 10 Common -- and Costly -- Mistakes.The tier 1 cost of complying with blue sky laws in all 50 states could run in the tens of thousands of dollars. Some big law firms may even quote six-figure fees. Worse than the cost, the time wasted by having to deal with 50 different state securities regulators could make this process akin to having all of your teeth pulled, one at a time, without Novocain. Because of blue sky compliance, tier 1 only makes sense for a business that is raising money in a contained geographic area and does not need to comply with more than one or two state blue sky laws. Other than that, I believe most companies will use tier 2.The major expense of tier 2, two years of audited financials records, seems like a deal killer for many small businesses. CPA audit costs of more than $25,000 per year are not uncommon for a revenue producing, young business. One CPA I discussed this with says innovators in the accounting industry will find ways to make these audits work.""If a startup is new, and does not have significant financial history, there is no reason an audit should be so expensive,"" says Craig Denlinger, who left a big six firm to start an accounting business geared towards the JOBS Act market.


Denlinger is right. I have seen quotes from entrepreneurial-minded CPA firms willing to do startup audits for as little as $2,500.So what will the ultimate cost of Regulation A+ be? As a crowdfunding and JOBS Act attorney who has been fielding Regultaion A+ calls non stop for the past month, I suspect that the minimum a company will need to spend at the onset, with the right lawyer, the right accountant and the right compliance company, will be at least $50,000.While that seems like a lot for a startup to swallow, how often can a company invest $50,000 into something that will allow them to raise $50 million from the general public? The best news is Regulation A+ allows a company to ""test the waters"" before spending a ton of money. This means you can approach potential investors and gauge their interest before you spend thousands on putting together all of your filings with the SEC.Related: Reduce These 9 Startup Risks for a Better Shot at Investor Funding

102,Tax Trouble? Avoid These 9 Common -- and Costly -- Mistakes.,"May 18, 2015",Anand Daga,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/tax-trouble-avoid-these-9-common-and-costly-mistakes/246221,"
Sound tax and accounting procedures are essential to growing a financially secure company. Unlike individual taxpayers, who habitually wait until April to get their information in order, businesses have to maintain accurate records and workflow year-round. But multiple hiccups --from simple human error to rampant technology adoption -- threaten the accuracy of these processes, elevating the risk of compliance penalties and harm to your reputation.The impact of such mistakes can be huge. In 2014, the IRS collected more than $7 billion in civil penalties from U.S. businesses due to misreported income and employment figures.Bloomberg BNA recently surveyed 200 in-house tax and accounting professionals to explore the blunders their departments frequently face. A look at the top nine mistakes reveals a diverse set of IT, regulatory and organizational struggles that both seasoned and first-time business leaders should strive to overcome.



Unsurprisingly, the most common misstep for tax and accounting professionals is the occasional botched data entry. More than a quarter of survey respondents have seen false numbers plugged in to their enterprise systems, a seemingly minor problem that can result in egregious mix-ups on tax filings, financial statements and business planning.Related: The Basic Tax Deductions Most Small Businesses Forget


1. Failing to attract or retain top tax staffIn any department, success typically correlates with the quality of the people in them. Unfortunately, nearly one in five tax and accounting professionals report that their team struggles to find and keep talented employees. Given the deep subject matter expertise and quantitative chops required to fill these positions, companies that contend with high turnover or under-trained staff expose themselves to increased oversight and accounting misjudgments.2. Saving files with financial information to personal devicesBYOD policies and employees who work from anywhere on their personal mobile devices might be a boon for productivity, but they're a menace to data security. For companies today, it's not even a matter of if a data breach will occur -- it's when. Enacting stricter file-sharing policies or investing in more secure collaboration systems is critical to protecting sensitive tax and accounting documents.3. Deleting custom Excel formulasUsing Excel spreadsheets for important tax and accounting calculations is problematic enough. When colleagues regularly share and resave the same worksheets, the chance of accidentally erasing intricate formulas spikes. If whoever created the original formula is no longer with the company -- or kept no record of it -- tax and accounting departments can burn hours trying to reconcile vital information. 4. Overriding tax system data with external figuresEven companies that wisely invest in enterprise tax and accounting programs grapple with employees' working outside these systems. Relying on figures estimated outside of a central system leaves no paper trail for internal or external auditors to review and distorts any analysis performed for future tax years.

Cranking through to-do lists from coffee shops, coworking spaces or airport terminals may be efficient, but connecting to their public Wi-Fi networks exposes confidential tax and accounting information to malicious intruders. Stronger remote access policies and staff cybersecurity education, along with virtual private network (VPN) access, can help staff work flexibly and safely.6. Prematurely closing the booksMore than one in 10 tax and accounting professionals have seen their team close out a tax year's financial books before all of the necessary information was collected. Process mistakes like these can go unnoticed for months or years, skewing future book numbers and triggering surprising fines.7. Lacking C-suite awarenessExecutives in small and medium enterprises wear multiple hats, overseeing strategic growth, product development, and even sales and marketing. Tax and accounting may be seen as a less strategic corporate function, and C-suites that don't understand its impact (then fail to invest in high quality tax tools and personnel) put their entire operation at risk.


8. Not tracking city-level regulationsBetween the Federal tax code, GAAP accounting standards and state laws, tax and accounting teams have no shortage of rules to follow. Businesses that already lack tax and accounting resources are prone to missing city-specific regulations, a blind spot that can inhibit a company's geographic expansion and tarnish its local image.9. Avoiding tax tool investmentsOne glaring problem underlies many of the aforementioned mistakes: companies' insufficient investment in the right tax and accounting systems. Businesses that settle for free or half-baked tools won't have full visibility into their assets or cash flow, making it difficult for investors to conduct pre-funding due diligence. Similarly, inadequate tax tools usually don't have the functionality or financial controls necessary for companies planning to go public.

Some entrepreneurs act as if everyone is out to get them. I strongly oppose that mentality.It's wise to assume that everyone you do business with is self-interested, because, well, that's true of people in general. Instead of living in fear that someone is going to do you wrong, a better strategy is to think about how you can benefit from the relationships you have -- especially the ones that challenge you.Related: The Greatness Guide to Building Your Brand and Empire

Even if your enemy drives you nuts, don't let yourself fester about it. You can't control how other people feel and act.


The newsSo many people complain about how the news ""gets them down"" and is ""only negative."" Let me be frank: That perspective is ridiculous and laughable. Perhaps you need to be more selective about the media you consume -- there are a lot of different sources. Staying abreast of what's going on in the world helps me run my business better every single day. My business doesn't operate in a vacuum, and neither does yours.People who disagree with youThey're annoying, aren't they? But you need them -- a lot.

Whether it's one of your employees, a client, or a vendor: listen up.Your customersIf you treat your customers well, they will become your army of supporters. They'll stick by you through thick and thin. When you call on them -- to write a review on Amazon or comment on a blog -- they'll be ready and willing to offer you their support. That is truly priceless. Ultimately, your customer service will help you keep your competitors at bay.TimeEach day starts anew! As far as I'm concerned, that's a blessing.

The following excerpt is from Mark J. Kohler's book The Tax and Legal Playbook. Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | IndieBound | Entrepreneur BooksMaintaining your books isn't something you should do solely as a tax-savings strategy; it can also prevent you from losing your sanity and getting dragged into a potential lawsuit over commingling your funds. Here are five significant reasons for maintaining a separate checkbook and set of books for each of your businesses:1. Corporate veil. First and foremost, maintaining a separate checkbook substantiates the corporate veil, one of the primary reasons for forming a new corporation. Having a separate checkbook shows you recognize the company is its own distinct entity. Furthermore, separate checkbooks will hopefully encourage you not to commingle personal and business funds.



2. Tax savings. Separate banking will improve bookkeeping procedures, prevent payments from being missed, and provide better records to improve your tax return.3. Audit protection. Having a separate checkbook will improve your chances in an IRS audit. The IRS will often disallow a number of expenses when personal and business expenses are commingled in a single checkbook.


4. Less stress and more sanity. One might think having separate checking and bookkeeping for a new company is cumbersome, unnecessary, and possibly even a waste of time. In fact, this procedure saves time and money in the long run. When your books are disorganized, you'll feel constant stress to take care of it, and this ultimately can cause you to feel undone.5. Improved decision making. Having a separate checkbook starts the process of better bookkeeping, expense tracking, and budgeting, which leads to quality decision making. How can you expect to be a successful business owner without accurate records? You owe it to yourself and your business to keep good books.The next step is implementing a system for tracking income and expenses. It's absolutely critical for small-business owners to at least consider QuickBooks as their primary accounting software system. Yes, there are a few alternatives to QuickBooks, but not many, and even fewer worth considering.QuickBooks is the most affordable, user-friendly, efficient, and effective accounting software ever written. That may sound a little cheesy or over the top, but it's true. Here are just a few things that QuickBooks can do to help you become a better, smarter business owner:


Keep essential information at your fingertips. QuickBooks generates reports that allow you to easily stay abreast of your business's most important financial information, like profit and loss by product or property, accounts receivable by customer, sales reports, or expense reports.Better use of your online banking system. QuickBooks allows you to harness the online benefits that many banks offer. It coordinates with most banks, even lesser-known ones, to provide instantaneous information so you can download transactions and reconcile your data with ease.Collect more of your accounts receivable. QuickBooks allows you to generate professional-looking invoices that can be delivered via email and offer your customers the option to make online payments. You can also generate statements and create various reports to determine who your high-risk customers are for collection purposes and to help you make better decisions regarding your accounts receivable.Delegate your accounting services with ease. If you are the type that hates bookkeeping, QuickBooks will still make your life easier. Once you understand the basics—and I recommend that every business owner at least master the basics—you can delegate tasks, from reconciling to overseeing financial reporting. QuickBooks will even allow your CPA to log in online to access your financial data while doing your accounting.Pay your business bills efficiently.

Don't be afraid of QuickBooks—embrace it, and it will set you free! OK, that was a little much, but I can promise you this: It will save you money, and you'll also get addicted to the little ""ping"" you hear every time you enter a check or item in the register.Get help implementing your accounting systemBe honest with yourself: Do you want to do the bookkeeping for your business? If so, great. But if not, who's going to do it? Have a plan! Yes, this is my best attempt at giving you an ""intervention."" Look at yourself in the mirror and assess your level of dedication, knowledge, and available time to implement and maintain your books. However, while it's fine if you have someone else do the dirty work, you still need a general understanding of the process and accounting system so that you, as the captain of your team, can oversee the process.The following are five options to consider when it comes to divvying up the accounting duties.Option 1: Learn QuickBooks and input items yourself. I know this strikes fear in some of your hearts. In fact, this may be why your books currently aren't getting done. But you still may want to hold off delegating any part of the process until you put in a few hours a week to learn the basics, like inputting figures. At the bare minimum, you need to be able to view and print reports and check the accuracy of the work.


Option 2: Hire a family member to keep up the books. This is a great way to have the teenagers or young adults you're supporting financially earn their keep and teach them about entrepreneurship in the process. They'll learn about the heart and soul of small business by doing the books. Adding them to the payroll is also a great tax write-off.Option 3: Engage a local bookkeeper. This could be a local college student wanting internship/externship hours or a seasoned bookkeeper with affordable rates. It can free up your time so you can do what you know best: Make money for the business. This is also a natural step in the growth of a business before choosing the next option. Remember, this person will probably not prepare your taxes or do significant planning for you; they'll simply maintain your books affordably so you can focus on more pressing tasks.Option 4: Hire someone ""in house."" You'd be amazed how quickly you can find a local college student or bookkeeper wanting to pick up some part- or full-time work for an hourly wage. This person could come in daily or a few days each week to input data and print reports. You might need to provide some supervision, or you could have your outside CPA train and supervise your in-house bookkeeper. It can be extremely convenient to have an employee available to keep things in order. You can also hire someone who can wear different hats and help with other tasks, like answering phones, scanning, doing collections, shipping, or running errands.Option 5: Use your CPA or tax professional throughout the year. Many business owners like the comfort and security of knowing they not only have highly skilled accountants doing their books daily but the benefit of one-stop shopping for tax planning and quarterly and annual reports as well. It may seem more expensive, but the value of better long-term planning and a higher quality of books can far exceed the cost. More mature and seasoned business owners may naturally ""graduate"" to a more experienced bookkeeper when the time is right. At most firms, you can get an accounting support package tailored to your budget and needs.

106,Sam's Club Adds New Services for Small-Business Owners,"Apr 22, 2015",Geoff Weiss,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/sams-club-adds-new-services-for-small-business-owners/245347,"
Members-only retail warehouse Sam's Club is looking to fortify the legacy of its entrepreneurial founder, Sam Walton, who spun a 1950 Arkansas dime store into Walmart, which is now the largest retailer on earth.After rolling out a trio of services for Sam's Club business members last year, including health care, payroll and legal planning, the retailer has today announced five additional offerings, which it claims can save members up to $2,300 per year.First, in collaboration with Web.com, Sam's will provide digital marketing solutions for small business owners -- 50 percent of whom, according to Web.com, do not have any online presence whatsoever. Five bundled plans will be available to aid in website design, email marketing and social media strategy, including do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM) options.



Next, Sam's is getting into the payments processing game alongside First Data, which will offer point-of-sale-technology and mobile payment options with plans beginning at $19 per month, Sam's said.Related: Sam's Club to Offer Health Care, Payroll and Legal Services for Small Businesses

107,The Top 4 Cash Flow Forecasting Mistakes,"Apr 17, 2015",Bakley Smith,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/the-top-4-cash-flow-forecasting-mistakes/244912,"
Strong businesses have a solid handle on their financial reality, and the cash flow statement is an excellent, if not the best, measure of a company's ability to generate cash in excess of cash invested. Over a sufficiently long period of time, all businesses have to generate positive cash flow or they will go out of business.Forecasting the statement of cash flows is a valuable exercise for a business for several reasons. The most obvious is, without a forecast, the executive team has no way to measure success or failure against its targets. Additionally, going through each item will raise important questions for the financial oversight of the company, and it can be used to hone in on poor strategic or financial decisions and help shape strong management.Now, how to avoid some of the errors that plague cash flow forecasters.1. Changes in receivables and payables.As noted here, companies should set optimal accounts receivables and payables levels through corporate and financial strategy, then forecast those accounts according to their plan. The error is to simply grow A/R and A/P with sales. That is what most outside analysts do; however, they do not have control over the policies. The business or CFO does. Set a Days Sales Outstanding level, then stick to it. This goes for accounts payable as well.2. Tax liabilities are another source of variability in projecting cash flows.A business is not likely to be in touch with every tax change, and that is why the company hires tax professionals and advisers. Tapping into the expertise of the company's accountants before the annual cycle begins is a good technique to avoid problems in the tax line.3. Reporting cash flows from financing and investing activities. This requires a relatively high-level understanding of GAAP and/or IAS standards and principles. And even when the team has the expertise, predicting these cash flows can be difficult. The best way to deal with this area of the financial statements is to set policies and then make and follow a strategic plan in the areas of the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and in activities that result in changes to equity and borrowings. To read more, see this excellent piece from accounting firm Grant Thornton.4. The biggest cash flow statement error can start at the top: the income line.The statement of cash flows is built upon the foundation of income delivered from the business's operations, and errors in income projections can have a large impact on cash flows. One of the most common pitfalls in income statement projections is to incrementalize line items. ""We grew 10% last year; we should grow 12% this year,"" is not a powerful way to forecast a business. Top financial teams actually build from projected contributors such as pricing, volume and product mix (and that can be across divisions and geographies). Using the basic building blocks to drive forecasts does two things: it provides a solid structure to the operating performance of the business and it raises relevant questions all along the way.

In their book, Start Your Own Business, the staff of Entrepreneur Media Inc. guides you through the critical steps to starting a business, then supports you in surviving the first three years as a business owner. In this edited excerpt, the authors provide tips on choosing the right accountant for your small business.While do-it-yourself accounting software is easy to use, it's not the sole answer for business owners. Just as having Microsoft Word doesn't make you a writer, having accounting software doesn't make you an accountant. Software can only do what you tell it to do—and a good accountant's skills go far beyond crunching numbers. A good accountant can be your company's financial partner for life—with intimate knowledge of everything from how you're going to finance your next forklift to how you're going to pay for your daughter's college education.While many people think of accountants strictly as tax preparers, in reality, accountants have a wide knowledge base that can be an invaluable asset to a business. A general accounting practice covers four basic areas of expertise:



1. Business advisory services. This is where accountants can really earn their keep. Since the accountant is knowledgeable about your business environment, your tax situation and your financial statements, it makes sense to ask them to pull all the pieces together and help you come up with a business plan and personal financial plan you can really achieve. Accountants can offer advice on everything from insurance to expansion. Accountants can bring a new level of insight to the picture, simply by virtue of their perspective.2. Accounting and record-keeping. Accounting and record-keeping are perhaps the most basic accounting discipline. However, most business owners keep their own books and records. The reason is simple: If these records are examined by lenders or the IRS, the business owner is responsible for their accuracy; therefore, it makes more sense for the owner to maintain them.


Where accountants can offer help is in initially setting up bookkeeping and accounting systems and showing you how to use them. A good system allows you to evaluate your profitability at any point in time and modify prices accordingly. It also lets you track expenses to see if any areas are getting out of hand. It lets you establish and track a budget, spot trends in sales and expenses, and reduce accounting fees required to produce financial statements and tax returns.3. Tax advice. Tax help from accountants comes in two forms: tax compliance and tax planning. Planning refers to reducing your overall tax burden; compliance refers to obeying the tax laws.4. Auditing. Auditing services are required for many different purposes, most commonly by banks as a condition of a loan. There are many levels of auditing, ranging from simply preparing financial statements from figures that the entrepreneur supplies all the way up to an actual audit, where the accountant or other third party gives assurance that a company's financial information is accurate.Choosing an AccountantThe best way to find a good accountant is to get a referral from your attorney, your banker or a business colleague in the same industry. If you need more possibilities, almost every state has a Society of Certified Public Accountants that will make a referral.


Don't underestimate the importance of a CPA. This title is only awarded to people who have passed a rigorous two-day, nationally standardized test. Most states require CPAs to have at least a college degree or its equivalent, and several states also require post-graduate work. When dealing with an accountant, you can only hope they're well-educated and well-versed in your business's needs. Passing the CPA exam, however, is a guarantee of a certain level of ability.Once you've come up with some good candidates (five is a good number to start with), a little preparation is in order before you interview them. The first step is to take an inventory of what you'll need. It's important to determine beforehand just how much of the work your company will do and how much of it will be done by the accountant.Once you've given some thought to your expectations, you're ready to interview. Your principal goal is to find out about three things:1. Services. Most accounting firms offer tax and auditing services. But what about bookkeeping? Management consulting? Pension fund accounting? Estate planning? Will the accountant help you design and implement financial information systems? Other services a CPA may offer include analyzing transactions for loans and financing; preparing, auditing, reviewing and compiling financial statements; managing investments; and representing you before tax authorities.


Make sure the firm has what you need. If it can't offer specialized services, such as estate planning, it may have relationships with other firms to which it can refer you to handle these matters. In addition, make sure the firm has experience with small businesses and with your industry. Someone who's already familiar with the financial issues facing your field of business won't have to waste time getting up to speed.2. Personality. Is the accountant's style compatible with yours? Be sure the people you're meeting with are the same ones who'll be handling your business. At many accounting firms, some partners handle sales and new business, then pass the actual account work on to others.When evaluating competency and compatibility, ask candidates how they'd handle situations relevant to you. For example: How would they handle a change in corporation status from S to C? Or an IRS office audit seeking verification of automobile expenses? Listen to the answers, and decide if that's how you would like your affairs to be handled.3. Fees. Ask about fees upfront. Fees can range from $100 to $275 per hour. However, there are some accountants who work on a monthly retainer. Figure out what services you're likely to need and which option will be more cost-effective for you.


Get a range of quotes from different accountants. Also try to get an estimate of the total annual charges based on the services you've discussed. Don't base your decision solely on cost, however; an accountant who charges more by the hour is likely to be more experienced and thus able to work faster than a novice who charges less.At the end of the interview, ask for references—particularly from clients in the same industry as you. A good accountant should be happy to provide you with references; call and ask how satisfied they were with the accountant's services, fees and availability.

109,A Simple Guide to Understanding Your Profit and Loss Statement,"Mar 24, 2015",Doug and Polly White,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/a-simple-guide-to-understanding-your-profit-and-loss/244207,"
Most entrepreneurs start organizations because they are passionate about the primary work of the business -- which usually isn't accounting. This means that most entrepreneurs aren't completely comfortable interpreting the monthly financial reports they receive.We have met hundreds of entrepreneurs who never look at their profit and loss statements because they do not understand them and explanations have been too complicated. While we can't teach you to be a CPA, we can give you some basics that will help you with this important financial tool.Related: 3 Key Questions Small Business Owners Must Answer, or Risk Failure



All P&Ls are based on a very simple formula -- sales minus costs equals profit. It really is that simple. Everything else is a matter of breaking out sales or cost into more detail and adding subtotals. Sales are typically shown at the top of the P&L. Costs are shown below sales and profit is at the bottom. You may see a number of subtotals as you look down the column, but it is still sales minus costs equal profit.Unfortunately, we sometimes use different words for sales, costs and profits. This can make accounting seem more difficult than it really is. For example, sales can also be called revenue or income. Costs may be called expenses and profits may be referred to as net income. In fact, the P&L itself can also be called an income statement. All of these AKAs can be confusing, but don't let it throw you. A rose by any other name …


Your company's sales may be broken into several different sources. For example, the sales of a restaurant may come from customers who dine in or take out or from catering. Such a business may choose to break sales into those three pieces. Typically, these three components would be added together in a line called total sales.Similarly, costs are usually broken into various components. For example, you may see material costs, labor costs and overhead broken out separately. There are an infinite number of ways to break out costs, but once you get below the total sales line everything else you see is a cost, broken out in one way or another.Related: 7 Deadly Sins of Financial Management (Infographic)One of the most useful ways to subdivide costs is into those costs that are directly associated with delivering your product or service and those that are not. Consider a company that makes and sells different types of widgets. It will have the cost of the components used to make the widgets, the cost of the workers who assemble the widgets and the costs of the production facility. These costs are referred to as cost of goods sold (COGS) because they can be tied directly to the production of widgets.


In a service business, this is called the cost of service (COS). For example, a lawn maintenance service would include the cost of the employees who do the work, fuel costs and the cost of other supplies such as fertilizer and grass seed.Sales minus COGS is known as gross profit (or gross margin). This is the money the business earns after it subtracts the cost of delivering its product and/or services. It is also the money needed to cover the other costs associated with running the business and still generate a profit.Other costs of the business are not associated with the production of widgets. Such costs might be the cost of the people who sell the widgets, the cost of the accountants who produce the P&Ls and even the president's compensation. These costs are most often referred to as selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A). With this addition, the P&L is now broken down into two parts: sales minus COGS equals gross profit, and gross profit minus SG&A equals profit.If you have been filing your P&Ls away without reading them, you are not alone. However, understanding your P&L is essential to being able to run your business successfully.
