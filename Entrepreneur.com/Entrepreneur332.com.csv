0,Your Work Ethic Is Not the Problem — Debunking Three Modern-Day Productivity Myths,"Apr 22, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/lets-debunk-these-3-modern-day-productivity-myths/471744,"
In ancient Greece, philosophers like Plato and Aristotle were already grappling with the notion of work-life balance. The latter described amusement as a remedy for the ""ills of work,"" which he said was accompanied by ""toil and strain."" Work, they acknowledged, was necessary for living a virtuous life — and paying for stuff — but it shouldn't be the end, in and of itself.Nearly two-and-a-half millennia later, we still struggle to define what constitutes a good life and how work and productivity factor in. Our modern-day hustle culture, and many of today's outspoken business leaders, would have you believe that more is more. A steely, unwavering work ethic is a requisite for success. Sleep can wait, so the thinking goes.But a growing body of research plus some innovative companies are showing that the truth about productivity is more nuanced. More isn't always more — but working long hours isn't always bad either. There are no hard and fast rules.

1,Looking to Achieve Your Goals But Don't Know Where to Start? Try These Proven Goal-Setting Strategies.,"Apr 20, 2024",Deep Patel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/16-actions-to-take-to-achieve-any-goal/318347,"
Setting goals is essential to living a life with purpose and meaning. They provide direction and focus, help you stay motivated and drive you to exceed perceived limits. Whether your goals relate to an exercise routine or running a small business, they help organize your life for the better.In business, setting goals and benchmarks is how you move your company forward — growing a customer base, hiring employees or expanding your footprint. It pays dividends in your personal life, too. Research shows that people who set goals have higher self-esteem, self-confidence and motivation than their non-goal-setting counterparts.Still, many goals end in failure, with distractions getting in the way. Think of the last big goal you set: How did you hold yourself accountable? Did you make a plan? Did you write it down? Did you end up accomplishing that goal?



Below, you'll find essential tips and insights to put you on a path of setting — and achieving — your most ambitious goals:16 actions for setting achievable goalsSetting big, ambitious goals is great, but it takes time and discipline to actually achieve them. In fact, the process begins before you take any action at all: How you brainstorm, plan and measure your goals is just as important as how you execute them. Likewise, it's essential to check in and audit your own progress as you work toward your goals.So what does it take to set a goal and see it become reality? Here are 16 steps to get you started:1. Consider your overarching goalsBefore you take on a new goal, ask yourself: What do you want your life or business to look like? Does your goal fit with that vision? Consider what excites you, what benchmarks you want to hit and what broader objectives your business has. Goal-setting should be relevant and meaningful to you and your company.2. Get it down on paperWriting your goals down forces you to crystalize what exactly you hope to accomplish. One small study found that you are 42% more likely to achieve your goals if you write them down. This simple act can keep your goal top of mind – and for a business, it can remind employees of long-term company objectives.3. Brainstorm what needs to happenYou know what you want to accomplish; now begin strategizing the actions needed to reach that vision. Identify the main steps and tasks you need to accomplish your goal. Are there certain steps to prioritize or time-sensitive tasks that must be done in a certain order? Start determining what needs to happen, and when.


4. Come up with an action planThis is the road map you can follow to your goal. Think of this as creating mini-goals — breaking bigger objectives into smaller steps, until you have ""bite-sized"" chunks. This makes the larger goal seem less daunting, and it ensures you don't miss important steps in the process. Be specific about what you want to achieve each step of the way.5. Consider your talents and expertiseThink hard about your strengths and weaknesses, and consider what it will take to accomplish the tasks en route to your larger goal. Do you have the necessary skills and expertise? Should you seek help with some tasks? Identify how to play to your talents, and build your goal-achieving plans accordingly.6. Make it measurableAlong with your action plan, set benchmarks, so each step builds toward your larger vision. Whether it's for your personal life or business, make these mini goals measurable — e.g., sales numbers or days you visit the gym each week — to ensure you're staying on track. This means setting deadlines that are reasonable. What is your target timeframe? Work backwards and start setting target dates for benchmarks.7. Take actionYour goals will never come to fruition if you don't act. It may seem scary to take that first leap, but if you wait until your fears dissipate and every detail is perfect, you'll never start in the first place. Jump in, let go of your fears (as best you can) and start figuring it out as you go.8. Build a success-oriented mindsetThis means you're confident in yourself, but you can also learn from mistakes. People with this mindset see failures as opportunities for growth and embrace challenges. It's easy to get fed up and feel discouraged. A positive mindset helps you visualize yourself achieving those dreams.9. Share your goals with othersA great way to hold yourself accountable is being open and public about your goals. That way, you'll hold yourself accountable if you aren't making steady progress. The idea is to take ownership in what you're doing and keep yourself motivated to continue.10. Find your inner motivationThe best goals are those that connect with your intrinsic motivation; in other words, the things you feel compelled to pursue, with no outside pressure. Keep your motivation high by setting goals that are attainable and relevant to you and your life.11. Solidify positive habitsSuccess doesn't happen overnight. It's about doing the work, day in and day out. This demands good habits. Healthy habits (e.g., eating well and getting enough sleep) will give you the energy and stamina to keep on the path to achieving your goals.


12. Delegate less important tasksYour most ambitious goals may take more than individual effort. It's important to build a complementary team and surround yourself with supportive people. For tasks too time-consuming or out of your area of expertise, consider handing off work to employees. If you don't have help internally, consider hiring a contractor or freelancer. By delegating tasks, you can stay focused on your strengths.13. Seek feedbackSeek out constructive criticism and listen to what others are saying — the good and the bad. Feedback is the most powerful way to gauge how other people perceive your work, and it's an important tool to assess whether you're meeting your own standards.14. Evaluate how the plan is workingAs you begin moving forward with your goals, take time to track how things are going. Is the plan working? Are you able to meet the deadlines and milestones you've set for yourself? Periodically reevaluate your goals, and identify where you may lag behind.15. Reset your goals if necessaryChange is a part of life, and that means you need to be flexible. You may require an alternative plan if things aren't going your way. Don't become so focused on your goals that you forget the larger vision. Is it time to make some sweeping changes and alter your course? If so, better to do it sooner rather than later.16. Reward yourselfIt's important to celebrate your successes each step of the way. Remember, this is about the journey as much as the end goal. Give yourself a pat on the back for all those wins — big and small. Celebrating your accomplishments will keep you motivated and focused, and it will give you a chance to recognize those who helped along the way.How to brainstorm effective goalsThe goals you set will dictate your day-to-day priorities, so it's important to be deliberate about your objectives. Your company's long-term outlook will also change along with your goals. Effective business leaders set goals that drive employee performance and push the company forward. Below, you'll find a few steps to brainstorming goals that will benefit you and your business:Set a timerBlock off a short period of time — between three and five minutes — dedicated to brainstorming goals. This short time span forces you to focus on what matters, blocking out all the reasons those goals might be hard to achieve.Write down your goalsStart noting all your goals, no matter how big or small; try to come up with eight to 10 objectives you hope to achieve by this time next year. Keep the paper in your office or close to where you work, and refer back to your list regularly. It should act as a reminder and occasional kick in the butt to keep pushing.


Find your ""game-changer"" goalNext, circle one goal that has the potential to completely change the course of your life and serve as a domino effect for every other goal on the list. This is your ""game-changer"" goal. It should be an objective that, once reached, benefits all facets of your life. Maybe your ""game-changer"" goal is to pay off the last of your student-loan debt or to quit drinking. Write down all the things you need to do to achieve that major goal of yours, and add one or two tasks each day to your to-dos.Different ways to frame your goalsPerceptions create reality, and how you think about a particular challenge can determine its difficulty. The same rule applies to setting goals: When you frame objectives in a positive light — something exciting to tackle, rather than a looming deadline — it makes the entire process more seamless.Reframing requires mental strength and constant check-ins, but approaching your goals with the right mindset makes all the difference: You'll be more confident, clearer in your approach and more driven to continue through adversity. When setting your goals, business or personal, consider these framings:M.E. goalsWhen setting your goals, think about what motivates and engages you (hence, M.E.). Ask the question, ""Does this excite me?"" You'll need that motivation, especially when nothing seems to be going your way. But reaching your goals requires more than motivation; find a deeper meaning in what you're working toward. Does the goal provide you with purpose and direction?Q goalsTo stay on track and committed, think of your goals as quantifiable tasks. For example, if your goal is to onboard 1,000 new customers this year, break it down into smaller goals. Shoot for 19 new customers per week or three new customers per day. By breaking it down, larger goals feel much more manageable, easier to plan for and not so overwhelming.""I will"" goalsStarting your goal with the statement ""I will"" puts yourself in a position of obligation to reach it. It keeps you responsible and accountable for the results, which in turn, keeps you committed. Write your ""I will"" goals down, and consult them whenever the task seems daunting. By framing your objective as a declaration, you can trick your brain into thinking of your goal as a given, not a far-off dream.Setting SMART goalsFor decades, another kind of goal-setting has dominated corporate boardrooms and small businesses alike: SMART goals. First proposed by George T. Doran in a 1981 issue of Management Review, SMART is an acronym for ""Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound."" There's a reason universities, CEOs, life coaches and Olympic athletes all tout SMART goals: By breaking your objectives down into specific, defined chunks, they become easier and help you build momentum.Below are the five elements of a SMART goal:


SpecificWhen writing your SMART goals, be as clear as possible. For example, if you work in the marketing industry, your job likely centers around key performance indicators (KPIs). Choose a specific KPI or metric to improve, and write down the names of team members who can help you achieve this goal.MeasurableYou need to be able to track your progress to evaluate whether your plan is working, so include quantifiable elements. For example, instead of saying that you want to increase the traffic to your site by a certain date, be more specific. Set a goal of increasing traffic by 25% by that date. This way, you have a specific goal to measure your progress by.AchievableYour goal should be attainable and motivating, not a burden. If you've never run more than a mile, setting a goal of running a marathon within a month is probably not realistic. But ""easy"" is not the target; rather, your goal should feel like a challenge.RelevantChoose personal goals that fit into your life and business goals and help your professional development. These goals should be relevant to you, the individual, as well as the business you run.Time-boundSetting a time frame keeps you on track and allows you to easily measure progress toward your goal. Set deadlines and make calendar notes for benchmarks. At any given moment, you should be able to check your progress against your time frame. This way, you can adjust in real time if you're not meeting expectations.Examples of SMART goalsYou can use SMART goals for anything from schoolwork to opening a business, and it's helpful to see this framing in action. Start with a challenge: What's not working? What could you improve? From there, it's time to put SMART goals to action. Below are two examples of how you can use this formula to reach goals in your personal and work life:Problem: Mobile users are slowing down your company's websiteSpecific: Your site has too many mobile visitors, so you want to build an app.Measurable: You want 60,000 users to download the app within six months of launch.Achievable: All departments needed to create the app have signed on, and you've set up regular check-ins.Relevant: Improving your site's mobile experience is the company's top goal next year.Time-bound: To achieve 60,000 app installs within six months, the app needs to be launched by June and an aggressive marketing campaign put in place that continues until the end of the year.Problem: You failed your math exam and must improve your gradeSpecific: To raise your grade, you need to improve your work with fractions.Measurable: You want to improve your grade from a D- to a C+ by completing homework assignments, smaller quizzes and the final exam in two months.Achievable: You can hire a tutor and set time aside daily to work on fractions. You can also ask fellow students for help.Relevant: Multiplying and dividing fractions is essential to passing the class.Time-Bound: In two months, you should be able to multiply and divide fractions with minimal to no errors.Taking the time to identify your goals and incorporate the steps above to create your own SMART action plan is key. By defining your goals, creating a step-by-step plan to achieve them and putting in the hard work, you'll change your life for the better.Creating 10X goalsBy setting a goal, you're in effect determining the finish line, but this can be a double-edged sword. Too often, leaders in risk-averse environments are conservative with their goals. They'd rather hit a modest goal and appear successful than fall short of a wildly ambitious one. However, when growing a company — or improving your personal life, for that matter — you need to think big. How big? Try 10 times big.


10X goals, a concept developed by Grant Cardone, are what many would consider ""stretch goals."" The idea is to set targets 10 times more ambitious than your perceived limits. This also takes 10 times the effort to accomplish them. Formidable? Sure. Unachievable? No way. This mindset of scalability promotes massive growth and will help you outperform your competition.Below are some benefits of setting these 10X ""stretch"" goals for yourself:Increased productivityBy challenging yourself to work 10 times harder than your competition, it's only natural for your productivity to skyrocket. Will your output actually increase tenfold? Maybe not, but conduct a before-and-after comparison with a measurable data point. You'll see marked improvements.Ambitious new ideasWhen you start exceeding goals and expectations, you raise the bar for what's possible. Challenges that once seemed intimidating now feel exciting; your pie-in-the-sky ideas are no longer unrealistic.Heightened sense of accomplishmentAchieving your stretch goals is a major confidence-builder, which can keep you motivated to push forward in your next task. Ask any high achiever, and they'll tell you: Once you start knocking down the barriers, it's hard to stop that momentum.Achieving your higher-level goalsSetting goals is a lifelong pursuit, and it doesn't stop once you accomplish one or two. No matter how far you make it, there will always be another obstacle to move past or challenge to conquer. The more your goals test you, the more you grow personally and professionally.Your most ambitious goals may take years, not months, to achieve. Maybe it's turning your restaurant into a franchise operation or training to compete in an Ironman triathlon. To achieve the growth, success and change you desire, you need to start taking action. Consider these steps when thinking about your higher-level goals:Phone a friendTap a mentor, trusted friend or business coach to keep you accountable. This gives you someone to answer to, and their objectivity can help you reprioritize your goals or rethink your strategies. A trusted ally also provides emotional support, a vital ingredient to any challenging endeavor.


Let it goThe waiting game can be one of the most frustrating aspects of goal setting. You set a goal and act, but results may not immediately follow. Once a goal takes off, learn to let go. Obsessing over things that are out of your control – for example, whether that potential client will sign a contract – only leads to frustration and anxiety.LearnLife is a constant cycle of failing and learning. Next time your goals don't go according to plan, search for the silver lining. What did you learn from the experience? Maybe your goal was misplaced or you didn't set up the right parameters. When you approach goals as learning opportunities, they provide valuable lessons regardless of outcome.Start againThis can be the hardest step after a setback, but the only path is forward. Focus on the next goal, and heed the lessons from your last try. Failures provide you with blank slates; you can start anew and rediscover what really drives you. A fresh start isn't a result of past failures; it's an opportunity for future success.Your goals are waitingNothing in life usually goes according to plan, and goal-setting requires patience, accountability and flexibility. By following proven goal-setting strategies, you'll position yourself for long-term success — in both your personal and professional life.

2,5 Ways to Move Forward After Shutting Down Your Business,"Apr 16, 2024",Philip Blackett,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-move-forward-after-shutting-down-your-business/472327,"
When entrepreneurs start a business, we envision it succeeding beyond our wildest dreams. But what happens when reality does not align with our goals and vision for our business? How do we recover and move forward after closing down our business?I experienced a similar nightmare when I shut down one of my businesses after battling the recent pandemic. Now, several months after making such a tough decision, I want to share five ways you can move forward from an unfortunate business failure.1. Give yourself time to grieveYour business may have been a labor of love or even your baby. It's hard to face the facts and move on. Be fair to yourself and give yourself time to grieve the loss, even if it is frustrating and heartbreaking to the point of tears. You cannot truly move on to the next chapter while still holding on to what could have been in the old chapter.

Reconnect with loved ones and recover from burnoutLeading up to the decision to close your business, you likely exhausted all possible options. You used all your physical, mental and emotional energy in the process. Now that it's over, give yourself the freedom to relax, recover and rejuvenate. It may mean taking a trip outside your city for a few days in a new setting.


Consider unwinding to movies you had meant to watch but had no time or picking up that hobby you abandoned while building your business. This is a great time to surround yourself with family and loved ones who love you beyond the business and can support you regarding the next steps.Related: The 10 Warning Signs of Employee Burnout and How to Handle It3. Reflect on your past journey and consider possible next stepsOnce you have had time to grieve and recover emotionally, now you are in a position to consider what's next in your life. Take inventory of the lessons you learned from your experience running your business beforehand. It may help to document them, so you can carry them into your next adventure. You can also share such lessons with other aspiring entrepreneurs or colleagues who are running businesses. Ask yourself what you can see yourself doing in the next chapter and start researching what that would look like and what the first few next steps to pursue.4. Consider getting a ""bridge job""Once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur, right? Well, running a business is not for the fainthearted. Some former entrepreneurs may desire the security of a paycheck and fewer responsibilities that they had as an owner accountable to everyone. While you consider the next steps, it may be a good idea to take a mental break from your previous responsibilities and get yourself back to work, even if it is working for someone else on a temporary basis. Doing work that provides a regular paycheck for you and your family can help you stay active, take down the mental workload you once had, and give you oxygen — and money — while you consider your next move.


Related: What To Do If Your Company Shuts Down5. Make a decision: stay an employee or launch out as an entrepreneur againNow that you have had some time to grieve, recover, reflect, and even work again, only you can make the decision whether you want to build a business again. You may be in a better position to consider collaborating with others to build again or consider building on your own. Give yourself a suitable timeline (ideally between 3-12 months) to decide your next steps and then commit to your next adventure all the way.Recovering from failure is never easy. Your dreams are broken. You may feel like a failure in the eyes of your family, friends, and fellow entrepreneur community. However, one of the biggest lessons I learned as an entrepreneur is that success does not happen in a straight line. Failure is part of the process. Depending on your mindset, you can view failure as a stepping stone to your subsequent success or as a barrier that dissuades you from ever trying again. Mental toughness and resilience are built not only through the ups and downs of running your own business but also when you have to make a tough decision to close down and move on with your life.The good news is that you are not alone in experiencing failure. You do not have to be an entrepreneur to know what failure feels like. You live long enough, and you realize that everyone has to respond to the failures and misfortunes they experience. It is not a question of whether or not you will fail. It is more a question of how you will respond when failure knocks on your door, even when you least expect it. I hope these five ways can help you recover from your business failure and build the courage to forge a new adventure on your entrepreneurial path.

3,Former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Says 2 Things She Learned in the Military Made Her a Better Leader — and Reveals How to Have Productive Conversations When You Disagree,"Apr 15, 2024",Jeff Fenster,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/tulsi-gabbard-a-journey-of-service-and-unity/472416,"
This week, I was honored to have Tulsi Gabbard on the show to discuss her life, passions and new book, For Love of Country: Leave the Democrat Party Behind.From her early days as an environmental activist to her distinguished military career and subsequent political journey, Gabbard's life has been marked by a commitment to public service and embracing the transformative power of personal growth.Related: Use This Simple Strategy to Push Through Limitations in Your Life



Her journey began with her passion for environmental activism. When she was a teenager, she co-founded the nonprofit Healthy Hawai'i Coalition, but she says it was her military deployment that truly shaped her perspective and instilled in her the values of adaptability and critical thinking. She enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard in 2003 and deployed to Iraq in 2004. Serving in the military taught her the importance of being open to different ideas and perspectives, a lesson she says she carried to her political career.""I enlisted because of 9/11 like a lot of other Americans and volunteered to be deployed to the Middle East,"" she says. ""During my almost 21 years of service, I can't express in words how grateful I feel to have served alongside such incredible people from all walks of life, from all parts of the country — people who not only love our country but love each other.""


As she detailed during our conversation, she believes that respectful conversations and exchanging ideas are essential for progress and unity in American society. Gabbard emphasized the need to bridge the divide between differing opinions, encouraging citizens to engage in meaningful discussions rather than resorting to divisive rhetoric. By prioritizing the well-being of the people over political agendas, she says we can create a more inclusive and cohesive society. ""If [politicians] are not focused on serving the people, then [they] are focused on the wrong things,"" she says.Related: 'First to the Gym, Last to Leave': The Mentality That Drives NFL Great Shawne Merriman's SuccessGrassroots movements and collective action are also at the core of Gabbard's vision for positive change. She believes real transformation can only be achieved when citizens actively participate in the democratic process. Gabbard encourages individuals to be informed, hold leaders accountable and engage in civic activities that drive change from the ground up, no matter how difficult it may seem.Her life of service in the military and politics has taught her a valuable lesson about keeping calm and collected during tough times. ""Stay spiritually grounded in [your] purpose,"" she says. ""Know exactly who you are, and know that generally speaking, those who are attacking you are doing so based on their own insecurities and fears.""


In a time when political polarization seems to be the norm, Gabbard's journey reminded me of the importance of being open to different ideas and staying active in the community. As we navigate the challenges of our time, I believe that we can all draw inspiration from Gabbard's leadership principles of humility, compassion and spiritual grounding. ""Be humble,"" she advises those in leadership positions. ""In order to lead, one must do so truly with a servant's heart that cares for, inspires and teaches those they've been charged to lead.""About The Jeff Fenster ShowSerial entrepreneur Jeff Fenster embarks on an extraordinary journey every week, delving into the stories of exceptional individuals who have defied the norms and blazed their own trails to achieve extraordinary success.Subscribe to The Jeff Fenster Show: Entrepreneur | Apple | Spotify | Google | Pandora

6,Employees Are Burning Out — and the Culprit Isn't What You Think,"Apr 9, 2024",Rob Cross,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/employees-are-burning-out-and-the-culprit-isnt-what/471340,"
Imagine you're headed home from work, unwinding by listening to your favorite podcast. Your phone chimes with an email from your boss. They want you to revamp a slide deck. Rather than resting, you spend the evening working and come into work the next day fried.All of us have encountered this kind of microstress — a term I coined with my co-author, Karen Dillon, in our recent book ""The Microstress Effect."" Microstressors are small but stressful moments that add up to harm our health, work performance and personal lives. Data suggests that these small negative interactions are up to five times more impactful than positive ones.Very stressful events trigger our brains' fight-or-flight mode, a response that helps us identify and deal with stress. But microstressors are minor enough that our brains don't always notice them, even as our bodies produce stress hormones like cortisol. Research suggests that microstressors can accumulate in our bodies. Our brains then pick up on the fact that something's wrong, but without always knowing what's responsible for our mood.



Microstress helps explain why employees are so burnt out. As a professor at Babson College who has studied the workplace for decades, I believe every company needs to tackle microstress if it wants to reduce burnout and boost productivity. Here are three ways you can reduce stress in your organization.Related: I Was Experiencing Extreme Burnout Until I Practiced These 3 Things to Come Out Stronger


Reject ""toughing it out""High-performing people are used to toughing it out. Push through the next deadline, convince yourself it will ease off after that and repeat as another deadline emerges. But no one can work at a perpetual sprint without sacrifice. I've spoken to some executives who worked their way to exorbitant wealth at the cost of multiple divorces and ruptured relations with their children.Toughing it out also falsely assumes that working longer and harder means working better. This isn't always true. My research suggests that we spend up to 85% of our time on collaborative work — from check-ins to project meetings to all-hands and more. We can cut down on that time and boost output by being more intentional and efficient in how we collaborate.Reject a culture of toughing it out in favor of one that focuses on working smarter. And recognize that burnt-out employees innovate less and are more likely to leave their jobs.Related: How I Pulled Myself Out of Burnout and Turned My Ambitions Into Reality


Identify and target microstress through team interventionsMessages from the top signal organizational priorities. But the best place to address microstress is at the team level.I recently worked with a group of employees to tackle microstress. Each Monday, the employees emailed me describing a new microstressor they wanted to focus on that week. Maybe a colleague was asking for too much help on projects. Maybe their boss kept shifting expectations. Maybe family obligations were creating too much pressure. On Fridays, they sent me an update on their progress in tackling that microstressor.For three weeks, I noticed only incremental movement. But in week four, employees began to see how working to control microstressors could make a big impact in their lives. There are three important lessons from these experiments:First, awareness of microstress can help us solve it. Employees need examples, a list they can look at and say, ""Oh, yeah, I know that feeling!"" In my work, we used ""The Microstress Effect"" app, which catalogs different sources of microstress.


Second, because microstress consists of dozens of small things, don't try to solve everything at once. Reducing stress shouldn't cause more stress. Take microstressors one at a time and begin with an easier one — not the most impactful — to build momentum.Third, microstress should be addressed at the team level. Teammates should be paired up in groups to generate ideas for actions to reduce microstress, as well as to build accountability by updating one another about their progress. This team structure also recognizes that we can be a source of microstress for others and that the only way we can communicate about our stress is in a supportive, open environment.Related: Improving Yourself Takes 9.6 Minutes of Work Each DayBe proactive, set new norms and change cultureToo often, it's easier to absorb microstress than to do something about it. If you've ever shied away from an uncomfortable conversation—even though avoidance led to lingering stress — then you know what it's like. But microstress accumulates in ways that are devastating to our well-being, so it's important to be proactive. One very effective step in tackling microstress is to change the culture to avert stressful moments.


In one exercise I do with companies, we list out collaboration tools in one column, from video chats to instant messaging to email. The second column focuses on the positive ways these tools should be used. In the third column, we brainstorm norms of use we'd like to improve.Let's take emails for example, one of the most common causes of microstress. Employees often feel like they're drowning in emails that take too long to read and respond to. Moving forward, a team might agree to write emails only in bullet points to prioritize brevity.Some people might see this as silly. Who has the time to set up systems for how we email one another? When we're in constant firefighting mode, we feel too busy to think of tweaking systems. But not tweaking those systems and changing culture is why we're so busy. A few hours of proactive work now can save hundreds of hours and prevent microstress down the line.Microstress can harm you, your team and your business. The stressors may seem small, but that doesn't make them any less important. So, reject toughing it out. Encourage teams to identify and target microstress. And then work together to generate new norms and change culture.

Syed Lateef runs his Airbnb business in Chicago.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Syed Lateef, a 36-year-old Airbnb Superhost in Chicago. It's been edited for length and clarity.I'm the CEO of SyedBnb, a short-term rental company with over 300 units and 100 employees.After dropping out of college for one year before returning to get my degree, I started working in finance, but I didn't aspire to have the lifestyle of the company's VPs. I wanted wealth, exotic cars, luxury vacations, time, and freedom, so I pivoted to real estate.



I started my business in 2017, and in 2023, we made $11.5 million in revenue and $1.4 million in net profit.Real estate was the key to the life I wantedAfter being let go from my first role as a financial analyst, I landed a job at Allstate. I was promoted three times within five years, but the salary increases weren't meeting my expectations.I realized that the people I knew in my community who were wealthy and had nice homes or cars were involved in real estate, which made me believe that was one of the main drivers of wealth.I started listening to the ""BiggerPockets"" podcast and read ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad,"" which motivated me to pursue financial freedom. I expected it to take me 15 years to replace my salaried income through real estate, but I was determined.


In 2016, I purchased my first multifamily building in Chicago using savings from my finance job and a loan on my 401(k). I put one of the units on Airbnb with a goal to make double the rent in one month that I could expect from a long-term tenant.I hired cleaners and virtual assistants to do the admin work and implemented pricing software from the outset (I use PriceLabs).Within four months, I made three times the expected market rent for a long-term tenant. I realized what an incredible opportunity this was and converted all the units in my building into Airbnbs. I was addicted and wanted more.Three to four months into my side business, even though my family and friends encouraged me to keep my salaried role, I gave my notice to leave. I was now a full-time entrepreneur.


Since its launch, I've scaled the business to over $35 million in revenueOne of Lateef's units in Chicago. Courtesy of Syed LateefI became an Airbnb Superhost in 2018, which means my average reviews are above 4.8 out of 5.In the second year, I expanded into rental arbitrage (renting units from landlords and subleasing them on Airbnb) after realizing it was an easier way to grow my business. After furnishing my units, I lacked the cash to buy more rentals. I now own 13 apartments and arbitrage 320.


My revenue hit $2.8 million in 2019. 2020 was a down year due to COVID-19. By 2022, I had my first eight-figure year, reaching $10.5 million in revenue.I only work a few hours a weekWith the help of my employees and the implementation of author Gino Wickman's guiding principles of the EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System), my workweek hovers around two hours.EOS is a set of concepts and tools for entrepreneurs to have people in the right seats, track scorecards, document processes, identify issues, and get traction on their business. Weekly leadership meetings using the EOS system help me achieve a two-hour workweek, but those two hours are intense meetings.I also handle my landlord relationships and business growth, but that's periodic, as well as the occasional proverbial fire.


The biggest mistake I made was growing too quicklyThe biggest mistake I made was being too optimistic about growth in the winter before the pandemic. I started scaling and ran out of cash, but I didn't expect COVID-19 to hit me with a knock-out punch. My revenue went to zero. Airbnb refunded all my future guests. I didn't have the money to pay the landlord's rent.I negotiated with all my landlords to allow me to stay in business. I purchased assets from bankrupt companies and was able to scale significantly. For example, I bought furniture for $250 per apartment from a bankrupt company.Here's my Airbnb adviceMy best advice to other aspiring Airbnb Superhosts is to learn from other hosts' experiences. Get in the Airbnb Facebook forums and connect with others. Attend networking events. Hire a coach or purchase a course to help you start the business.Then, take action. If you can't afford a property, consider rental arbitrage. So many people get stuck in the learning and planning process. Inevitably, you'll learn while being in the actual business.


When I got started, I asked my sister, who's into interior design, to help me furnish my first Airbnbs. For guests' needs, we modeled hotels to see what items created a good stay. I learned everything myself through experience.Let's put you on the fast track to success. Accelerate your business growth with our all-inclusive subscription.

10,"Following These Five Practices Dramatically Improved My Mental Health — Find Out If They Could Help You, Too.","Apr 8, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-following-these-5-practices-saved-my-mental-health/470699,"
Mental health affects all of us. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), 1 in 5 adults experience a mental illness every year. Both NAMI and Forbes Health cite suicide as the second leading cause of death in adolescents ages 10 to 14 years alone. The CDC reported a 2.4% increase in the number of adults receiving mental health treatment between 2019 and 2021. There's no doubt that poor mental health affects our ability to thrive in our relationships and at home, work and school.Mental health can be a challenging thing to manage. Nine years ago, I decided I wanted to learn more about it, and I hired a licensed therapist (who I still see weekly). After nearly a decade of focus, I've found that the following five practices dramatically improve our mental and emotional well-being. I discuss these practices with my clients on a daily basis, and literally all of them report positive effects from practicing them.Related: We Need a Real Commitment to Mental Health at Work. Here's How (and Why).



1. Identify and then prioritize the things that matter most to youIt's easy to get swept up in the demands of others and forget about ourselves. Determine what activities, hobbies, events and jobs you love most and prioritize those things. Mental wellness often seems to disappear when we don't make time for the things that make us tick. It doesn't matter whether it's pickup soccer, painting or playing guitar. Figure out what you love to do and regularly spend time doing it. Have dreams and articulate them.If you've always wanted to learn to speak a foreign language or write a book, I recommend you don't lose sight of that. For some, these goals are forgotten once we have children or start to age. I recognize it's hard to juggle and balance the demands of a family or career with your own needs and interests, but it's not impossible. It starts with you believing it can be done and committing to doing it — no matter what. To start, create a vision board or mission statement and post it somewhere you can see it. This helps remind us of the things that matter most.


2. Set and enforce boundariesDon't be afraid to say no. Some of us were raised to be people-pleasers and feel compelled to always ""do it all."" This thinking is misguided. Anytime we say yes to one thing, we're automatically saying no to something else. If that ""something else"" is always yourself, you're likely not caring for your mental health. In my expeirendce, this will catch up with you. Unhappy, frustrated and burnt-out individuals spend a tremendous amount of time doing things for other people and not nearly enough time doing things for themselves. Figure out what you really want to do and what you don't. Then, articulate it confidently and without guilt.As Stephen Covey said, ""It's easier to say no when we have a greater yes in mind."" When you know what matters most (to you), you'll have an easier time making (and protecting) space for it. To start, give the things you most want to accomplish a place to live and breathe on your calendar. Use Outlook or another calendar to schedule time for your top priorities — this will help you say no when a last-minute conflict arises.Related: Entrepreneurs Are Scheduling Their Days Down to the Minute for Ultimate Success3. Honor and validate your emotionsMany of us like to be right. Understandable; it feels good to know things and be correct. However, sometimes our desire to be right stands in the way of us actually doing what's right. It's not uncommon to gaslight others. Frequently, people invalidate the experiences, beliefs and emotions of others just because they don't mirror their own. Learn to recognize that you can't control how often this happens to you, but you can control your response. Make a point to regularly connect with yourself and truly understand your feelings. Once you know what those are, trust and listen to them. Don't allow yourself to be talked out of them.


Getting advice and mentorship from someone you deeply care about (who also has your best interests at heart) is one thing. Being gaslit by someone who feels threatened by your success or is uncomfortable with a difference of opinion is entirely another. If you choose to be influenced or persuaded, make sure it's for the right reason. To start, regularly journal or talk to a therapist (or coach) about how you feel. This helps you connect with yourself and be self-aware of what you're really experiencing.4. Celebrate every step of your journeyWhen it comes to pursuing big goals, the road is long. It can be easy to become discouraged. Remember to celebrate your efforts along the way, not just at the end. Make time to acknowledge what you've done well and choose to be proud of yourself. Instead of focusing on perfection, focus on progress. Are you wiser, stronger and braver than you were a few months ago? What about a year ago? If the answer is yes, then make sure you choose to feel good about yourself and where you're at, even if you're not completely done yet. To start, keep a gratitude journal or list of your accomplishments. Catalog specific things that are working well. If you do this consistently, you'll rewire your tendency to see the negative or engage in any sort of negative self-talk. Instead, you'll notice far more of the good. And that feels good.Related: 3 Reasons to Celebrate Small Wins in Your Business5. Only associate with people who support your mental healthWho we surround ourselves with matters. Many people who struggle with mental well-being keep the company of others who actively try to undermine them. Ultimately, we tend to adopt the beliefs, values and mindset of those we see the most. If you associate with negative people who complain, you'll develop a tendency to do the same thing. If you associate with catty people who love to gossip, you'll develop a tendency to judge as well.


It's been said that ""Two things prevent us from happiness: living in the past and observing others."" If we care about our mental well-being, it's important to surround ourselves with like-minded people. Spend time with others who have goals, pursue their purpose with passion, set and enforce boundaries and will respect you as you do the same. To start, take inventory of the people with whom you spend your time. How do you feel when you're around them? Do they support and encourage you? Do they champion your goals? If not, limit your interactions with them and replace that time with these other activities.Most of us face a tremendous amount of outside pressure from our bosses, families and even friends. It can be extremely hard to prioritize ourselves and our well-being over the demands of others — but we must. As hard as it is to show up for ourselves, regularly practicing these five principles will make it easier.

11,Stop Using the Term 'Cold Calling' — Use These 5 Alternative Names Instead,"Apr 1, 2024",Roxanne Klein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-alternative-terms-for-cold-calling/471600,"
I recently attended a meeting where my managing broker suggested we consider alternative names for cold calling. Although I was initially a little resistant, the idea of renaming a task has grown on me. Since cold calling sounds so cold, this article is meant to share some of the names that were brainstormed to eliminate the word ""cold"" from ""cold calling.""By using a creative title, it is possible that the mindset around cold calling can be changed in a positive manner. Once the task is thought of as positive, its effectiveness will be improved. The mind is extremely powerful. By focusing on the fun elements of your work, there is a high probability that the results will be beneficial.1. Scavenger HuntOne of the first names I thought of to inspire myself regarding cold calling is ""Scavenger Hunt."" When I was little, I loved going to parties where we went on scavenger hunts. The idea of going to a random person's house and asking for a random item was very intriguing to me. Although cold calling in the business world is not as random as a scavenger hunt, there are similarities.



Instead of looking for an object, I am looking for an assignment. The assignment could be a new listing or a new tenant rep account. If you are on the hunt to help your business grow, next time you are about to make business calls, I encourage you to consider adding a scavenger hunt to your calendar.Related: 4 Tips for Mastering Cold-Calling (and How to Not Annoy Leads in the Process)


2. Playing ClueI enjoy playing the Game Clue. It allows you to investigate and solve a mystery. Similar to when you are prospecting, you are looking for clues to help with the overall big picture of gaining business. If you like playing games and enjoy solving puzzles, I recommend you try ""Playing Clue"" instead of cold calling.Related: How to Get Over the Most Challenging Part of Cold Calling3. Friend FindingI thought ""Friend Finding,"" suggested by one of my colleagues, was extremely clever. Like many other sales-related businesses, commercial real estate is about relationships. Relationships are formed when two people like each other and have common interests. By thinking that you are picking up the phone to find a friend, the idea of calling strangers can seem less cumbersome or intimidating.Although I like the name Friend Finding, I recommend being cautious about friendship in business. Since often it can be awkward to hire your friends if you focus too much on friendship and not enough on your business, your original goal of calling to create new accounts might be deterred.


4. Dialing for DollarsIf you are motivated by money, there is the well-known ""Dialing for Dollars."" This name has such a great ring to it and is much more fun than cold calling. Dialing for Dollars has both an action and reward, all in three words. Although it is used often, I prefer this term any day over cold calling.Related: Phone Call or Email? How to Choose the Right Sales Outreach Approach.5. Sailing for SuccessThis name conveys a journey that ends positively. ""Sailing"" is much more entertaining than calling. By sailing instead of calling and success instead of cold, ""Sailing for Success"" might be the perfect name replacement for cold calling.Regardless of the term, the important key here is mindset. I do not think I have ever met someone who told me they love cold calling. Like public speaking, most people put cold calling in the category of items they abhor.


The key is to pick the name that works best for you. Whether it is one I shared in this article or one you come up with on your own, you need to figure out what motivates you. You also need to consider what your goals are for cold calling. Once you figure out your goals and motivation, you will be on your way to sailing for success.After you know your favorite name for cold calling, you need to implement it. I recommend having your colleagues and even family know the name you are using for cold calling. If everyone around you knows the name, you will probably use the name more. Your goal should be to eliminate ""cold calling"" from your vocabulary and replace it with your preferred term. Remember to write your preferred name on your calendar if time blocking works for you. The more you see it, the easier it will be for you to utilize it.

12,These Are the Five Attributes of Highly Successful and Happy People,"Mar 29, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/these-are-the-five-attributes-of-highly-successful-and/470701,"
During my 21 years in corporate America, I spent thousands of hours observing others. Now, as a coach and consultant, I often get asked what attributes I value most in people — and these five stand out. If you're looking to achieve new levels of happiness of success this year, consider how well you embody the following five attributes. Not only do they drive success in leadership, but they drive success in life.1. VisionHumans have a gift that no other living organism has: the power of imagination. Successful, happy people use this gift. They imagine a compelling and different future than the present, and they believe in their ability to create and shape it. They don't reactively accept the status quo or things they don't like. Instead, they work hard to improve the world around them.They recognize that they have agency and can proactively alter their surroundings and environment. They never say things like: ""That's just the way it is"" or ""We've always done it that way."" Instead, they imagine their desired or ideal state and then compare that vision to their actual state. If they identify a gap, they immediately begin devising possible solutions that will close that gap. Then, they get to work in employing and experimenting with those. People like this show us that anything is possible, and they're fun to be around because they tend to inspire us to do the same.



Related: There Are 6 Types of Great Leaders — Which One Do You Fall Into?2. PassionWe all have unique gifts and talents that excite us tremendously. Time flies when we use them. We tend to be better at them than our counterparts. They come more naturally and easily to us than others. Thus, we're able to hone and improve our skills at a rate faster than our peers. Doing these things feels more like play than work, and we can hardly believe that someone pays us to do them.


Life is too short not to invest in yourself. We're most successful and happy when we identify what unique gifts and talents we have, and take the time to practice them. Not only does this help us feel fulfillment and joy, it allows us to best serve society. Many individuals experience burnout, anxiety and depression because they spend 40 hours or more a week not doing what they love. When we engage in activities that energize us (instead of things that drain us of energy), we're not only happier, but we're healthier.I've had a few jobs I didn't like and my life suffered while I had them. I felt drained of energy when I arrived home. I struggled to find the motivation to exercise and pursue personal hobbies. I gained weight and lost touch with friends. When I got back to a job I loved, all this changed. I became a marathon runner, reconnected with friends and pursued personal hobbies like photography, scrapbooking and writing. Focusing on what we're passionate about is incredibly important.3. CourageFear is a powerful motivator. Research shows that our brains all have a subconscious component that works to protect us and keep us safe. Many of us hold back and live life with the brakes on because we're afraid of change and trying new things. We have a fear of being uncomfortable, making mistakes, failing or facing judgment from others. Courage sets us free.As Franklin Roosevelt said, ""Courage is not an absence of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear."" Courage allows us to speak our minds in the board room, express our true opinions, suggest unconventional courses of action and go against the status quo. This is what allows us to progress, develop and innovate.


It can be scary to speak up. But, it's important. The right people will value your bravery; not squash it. Having the courage to be vulnerable, authentic and transparent gives other people permission to do the same thing. Going against the grain and inciting real, honest dialogues when others can't or won't usually doesn't hold you back, but helps you progress, especially if you're in the right environment.Related: Why Successful People Never Second-Guess Themselves — and 5 Strategies to Help You Get Rid of Indecision4. CompassionWhen we empathetically hold space for others, we free them from their own fears and worries. Compassion allows us to create a safe space for others to be themselves, and that's when people are most able to contribute in a meaningful way. Our spouses, families, and friends aren't the only ones who appreciate compassion. Our employees do, too. When others feel valued, appreciated and seen, they give us their all. They do their best work and deliver their best ideas, which is what helps us move forward.Over the years, numerous employees have thanked me for being so kind and understanding. They've told me how enjoyable it is to come to work when they have a boss or colleague who truly cares about them. Sadly, compassionate leaders are somewhat rare. If you're one of them, you stand out and this breeds a tremendous amount of loyalty and respect. When people respect you, they're more willing to push through challenges and find solutions for you, which means you'll get better results.


5. AccountabilityIt's amazing how much traction you create in life when you keep your word. The most successful people I know always do the things they said they'd do. They regularly keep their commitments, including the ones they make to themselves. Over time, people notice. This breeds a great deal of trust. When you take responsibility for both your behaviors and the results, you'll work harder to find solutions in the toughest of circumstances. When the buck stops with you, and you don't blame others for your problems, you save a tremendous amount of time.Most people spend an inordinate amount of time finding scapegoats and assigning fault to anyone but themselves. This behavior prevents us from getting better. People who are truly accountable stay focused on their circle of control, not their circle of concern. Therein, lies all the difference. Whether you're leading others or just leading yourself, accountability is what makes progress possible.Related: The Super Successful Have These 5 AttributesPractice these five attributes and your life is bound to improve. If you haven't been doing one or more of these things and start now, you'll be shocked at how quickly others around will notice and appreciate the changes. This holds true for your personal and professional relationships.

14,"Your Business Will Always Require Most of Your Attention — But You Need to Make Time for Yourself, Too. Here's How.","Mar 26, 2024",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/your-business-will-always-require-most-of-your-attention/470553,"
As an entrepreneur, your days are jam-packed with meetings, emails, tasks and more. However, one thing your day might be missing is some time for yourself, also known as the ever-elusive ""work-life balance."" I get it — your business is your baby! You nurture it, care for it and are there for it 24/7, but are you there for yourself, too?Working all the time can lead to burnout and loss of motivation. And, as any seasoned entrepreneur can tell you, your business will always require most of your attention. This is why it is incredibly important to block out time for yourself to do something you enjoy to relax. This will look different for everyone, but here are a few ideas to help you avoid burnout and unlock your entrepreneurial potential.1. Schedule time for yourselfBlock out time on your calendar. That's right, add a chunk of time to your calendar where no one can schedule meetings with you. In fact, block out two separate times on your calendar. One chunk of time should be for you to do something you enjoy. This might look like lunch with friends, reading a book or even going for a nature walk so that you can disconnect for a short time.



The other chunk of time should be set aside for your productivity. This is when you do not have meetings, accept phone calls or acknowledge emails that came in during this time. Instead, you sit down and focus without interruption on your to-do list. Make it through the emails that came in earlier in the week, wrap up a project or two or whatever has been hanging over your head causing you stress. While you do not need a productivity block every day (although I recommend it), you do need to add time to unwind and relax to your everyday life. Prioritize some time for you so that your business can continue to grow and you remain healthy mentally and physically along the way.Related: 3 Insights From the First Large-Scale Study on Burnout and Entrepreneurs


2. Add movement to your dayManaging your stress sounds easy enough, but as we all know it is far easier said than done. While most people will tell you to just remove whatever is causing stress from your life, we know as entrepreneurs that is not likely to happen which means you have to figure out ways to manage your stress — and the number one way to do this is to add movement to your routine.Sitting at your desk all day is not only hard on your body, but it is bad for your stress levels, too. Stress needs to go somewhere, and if you do not have an outlet, it will stay in your body. That is why you should add physical activity to your daily routine. Be sure to include a variety of things such as cardio, stretching or weight training. Cardio does not have to be something with crazy high intensity, just going for a short walk or two can make a huge difference. Stretching can be as simple as stepping away from your desk to stretch a bit before returning to work.3. Practice mindfulnessDo you have goals set for your company? How close are you to achieving those goals? Where is your company going this year, or the next, or the next? Do thoughts like these constantly swirl around your mind and add to your stress? Define the direction of your company and protect your mental health by practicing mindfulness.Step one here is to get all your thoughts out of your head and organized. This might be the old-fashioned way through paper and pen, or you might prefer to use something like your notes app on your phone. Whatever it is, get your thoughts down and work on organizing them. Not only will this help calm your mind, but it also helps define where your company is going while providing accountability so that you can see the progress you are making toward accomplishing your goals.


Step two is to work on relaxing your mind. During your scheduled time for yourself, you might choose to do cardio exercises which is great for the tension you hold in your body, but it does not always help with the tension you hold in your mind. This is where meditation practices can come in handy. Find a quiet, relaxing space. Sit comfortably, close your eyes and let your mind wander. Acknowledge thoughts as they appear, but do not try to hold onto them. Slowly breathe in and out, breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. It can help to count for a certain number of seconds while breathing in and then exhale for that same amount of time. This can help settle and clear your mind so you return to work more focused than before.Related: Worried That You Don't Have Time for Self-Care? Here's How to Fit It Into Any Schedule4. Practice prayer and/or meditationThe best way I've found for me to de-stress and get re-energized is to spend quiet time in prayer. I've also found meditating on the truth in God's word to be instrumental for me in my business, but of course, everyone holds different beliefs. I gain wisdom and clarity when I turn to God and try to unclog some of the mental stress of running a business. I also find great peace and tranquility in spending time in prayer — but you have to find what works for you.Armed with these ideas and tactics, you can return to your work refreshed and motivated to tackle even the most complex problems. Stepping away from your business is an integral part of maintaining your drive for your company and avoiding burnout. Include the aforementioned tactics into your daily routine and truly unlock your utmost potential as an entrepreneur who lives a healthy, balanced life!

When I was 17, I founded a company to save police officers' lives. We distribute and manufacture body armor and other protective equipment. And yet, I will admit: For the first eight years, this work felt abstract — like watching war unfold on the nightly news. I understood its importance, of course, but it wasn't personal.Then, an officer in a nearby town was killed. It changed everything.His name was Louis Pompei. He was 30 years old, served in Glendora, California, and was killed while off duty, as he heroically tried to stop a grocery store holdup. We'd never met, but we had many mutual friends. When some of them invited us to his funeral, my wife, Melissa, and I immediately accepted.

16,They Grew Up in a Financially-Challenged Single-Parent Home and Now These Twins Run a Multimillion-Dollar Real Estate Business. Here's How They Turned Hardship Into Inspiration.,"Mar 25, 2024",Jeff Fenster,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-resilience-led-to-the-mathis-twins-success-in-real/471381,"
In the world of entrepreneurship, success stories often emerge from the most unexpected places. On this episode of The Jeff Fenster Show, real estate experts Jeremy and Joshua Mathis, better known as the Mathis twins, shared their journey, highlighting the impact of resilience, resourcefulness, and the importance of instilling an entrepreneurial mindset in children.Related: How This NFL Running Back Trains His Mindset for Resilience On and Off the FieldGrowing up in a less-than-privileged environment, the Mathis twins faced numerous obstacles. However, they credit their difficult upbringing as instrumental in their entrepreneurial journey. They emphasize the role of parental support and exposure to entrepreneurship in their development, highlighting the importance of surrounding oneself with positive influences.



One key lesson the Mathis twins have learned is the significance of understanding their strengths and weaknesses in business. By recognizing their areas of expertise and seeking help in areas where they lack proficiency, they have been able to build a solid foundation for success. They stress the importance of continuous learning and being open to feedback, as it allows for personal and professional growth. Failure is an inevitable part of any entrepreneurial journey, and the Mathis brothers have experienced their fair share. However, they firmly believe that failures are valuable learning opportunities.Related: How Giving Your Time and Resources to Others Can Unlock Opportunity and Wealth


By analyzing their mistakes, they have been able to refine their strategies and improve their decision-making processes. Their story serves as a reminder that setbacks should not deter aspiring entrepreneurs but rather fuel their determination to succeed. The Mathis twins are strong advocates for instilling an entrepreneurial mindset in children. They believe that teaching financial values and exposing children to entrepreneurship from an early age can set them up for future success.Encouraging creativity and problem-solving are ways parents can nurture their children's entrepreneurial spirit and equip them with essential life skills. Transitioning from wholesaling to fixing and flipping properties was a significant milestone for the Mathis brothers. They attribute their success in this transition to strategic partnerships and continuous learning. By collaborating with experienced professionals and staying updated on market trends, they have been able to adapt their business model and thrive in a competitive industry.The Mathis twins' real estate business model revolves around rental strategies and long-term wealth building. They emphasize the importance of cash flow and building strong relationships with investors. By sticking to a proven formula and avoiding unnecessary risks, they have been able to create a sustainable and profitable business. While achieving business success is undoubtedly fulfilling, the Mathis twins also emphasize the importance of balancing their entrepreneurial endeavors with family life. Effective time management and prioritization are key in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. They believe in leading by example and instilling essential life lessons in their children, ensuring that they grow up with a strong sense of financial responsibility and a solid work ethic.Related: Gary Vaynerchuk on the Power of Authenticity and Accountability

18,Want to Attract Success? Don't Do These 9 Things,"Mar 20, 2024",Kelly Hyman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/want-success-dont-do-these-9-things/471131,"
Every entrepreneur has their version of what's led to where they are today. Whether it's a specific routine or tried-and-true perseverance, there's a lot of advice on the ""to-dos"" of success.But what about the things to avoid?There are as many ways to limit your success as stepping stones to lead you to where you want to be. Avoid getting in your own way and making it harder to get to your destination. There's plenty not to do to prepare for success as well. Here are nine things to avoid. Often, simply switching to a more positive mindset (eliminating negative habits) can clear the path.



1. Neglect self-careToo often, entrepreneurs focus on the grind alone without taking breaks or paying attention to their physical and mental health. This isn't sustainable and will lead to burnout or, worse, giving up on their business dreams altogether.Schedule time to exercise, sit down for meals and sleep at approximately the same time every night. These simple habits are as important as any metrics to measure your business success. By taking care of your health, you'll see the difference in your energy and outlook, which only helps fuel your growth.


2. Doubt yourselfSelf-doubt plagues every entrepreneur, at least in the beginning. Being your own boss means you need to be your own cheerleader as well. Turn to trusted peers and friends to give you constructive feedback when needed, but keep confident in your abilities.Once you begin second-guessing your choices, it becomes harder to move forward. Getting stuck due to indecision or feelings of unworthiness creates additional barriers. As entrepreneurs, there's already enough of those to deal with.Instead, explore different things and experiment with what works. Not every move will be perfect, but everyone can help you learn and improve as you go, which makes for a better entrepreneur and a better business.Related: The Biggest Threat to Your Boundaries Isn't Your Boss or Family — There's Someone Else You Need to Face First


3. Refuse to ask for helpEven if you have years of experience in your industry, stay humble enough to know when you need guidance. Trying to juggle every aspect can be overwhelming and means you don't have time to concentrate on the things that really matter.You must consider not only your trade or craft but also accounting, taxes, marketing and all the other aspects that help you grow. Whether it's advisory support from a respected colleague or outsourcing help for things like social media or copywriting to build your brand, delegating tasks helps you grow your business.4. Avoid networkingBuilding strong professional relationships leads to limitless opportunities. Expand your connections by networking with those both in and beyond your field. Start online through LinkedIn. Interact with posts and share helpful information of your own.Also, attend in-person events to meet with like-minded individuals. It will expand your business circle, and networking can be motivational as you take your business to the next step. You never know who might cross your path and who may be a valuable resource for you or vice versa.


Related: 4 Reasons Why Networking Is a Must for All Successful Entrepreneurs5. Postpone goalsTalking about ""someday"" means goals get pushed back further and further. Aiming high is great, but taking it step by step is a more realistic way to get you to your goals and continue once you reach them. Don't put off your goals because they seem out of reach today. Instead, put steps into place that can lead there so you get closer to your goal every day until you realize you've arrived at its doorstep.6. Overlook planningPlanning is the catalyst that helps you reach your goals. Without a plan, days go unstructured, and it's easy to do many small things that aren't linked to any objectives. Instead, take time at the beginning and end of each day to look at the day/week ahead.Also, prioritize deadlines. Though everything may seem urgent, trying to do it all at once means fewer things are likely to get done or, at least, get done well. Being an entrepreneur means balancing schedules to ensure you have enough creative time to dream and enough productivity time to do.


Related: 4 Strategies to Increase Your Success7. Play it safeBeing an entrepreneur already means you've taken a risk. Explore new areas where you can take the next leap and avoid getting too comfortable. It could be speaking on a panel, authoring an online article, or broadening your services.There is always another lesson to learn or another goal to create. Stay curious and eager to head to what's next. However, don't skip over the wins, big or small.Related: Want Success? You Have to Take Risks.


8. Minimize winsThere was once a time when you wanted to be an entrepreneur, and you put the plan into action to make that come true. Every time you achieve something, make sure to celebrate the win.It can be a revenue goal, a new client, or even crossing off your weekly to-do list. Looking back and adding up all the wins motivates you to keep going and lets you know you have what it takes to succeed.9. Stray from valuesAlways hold true to your values no matter how much success you achieve. When people slip away from their integrity, it trips them up and prevents future success.Stay aligned with your vision, work ethic, and how you treat people. You will go further when you align, and the wins will feel all the more worth it.

19,She Cashed in $100K of Her Retirement Savings to Start a Business. Here's What Happened.,"Mar 18, 2024",Kim Kavin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/she-cashed-in-100k-of-her-retirement-savings-to-start-a/470085,"
Sometimes, building the life you want requires a big risk.That's what Keri Gardner realized when she cashed in $100,000 of her retirement savings to buy a franchise. It was November 2020, and she had just been laid off from her executive role at a health company. A franchise recruiter called her and asked, ""Do you want to work for anybody else?"" Gardner replied, ""Absolutely not. I work really hard. I want to do it for me.""She was passionate about the environment, so was drawn to Filta Environmental Kitchen Solutions. The company, which has 127 franchisees in 348 territories, cleans fryers in commercial kitchens and filters impurities from their cooking oil so it lasts longer, swaps out the oil when it's spent, and recycles oil for use in biofuels. Gardner used the money from her 401(k) to buy two territories on Long Island. Six months later, she was getting so much business that her husband quit his job to join her. Now the couple owns six territories. Here, she shares what the transition was like — and why the risk was worth it.Related: The Role and Responsibilities of a Franchisee, DefinedWhy'd you decide to cash out your 401(k)?It was terrifying. I thought: If I don't get another job that I deserve, and I can't keep padding my 401(k), then it's really not enough to retire on anyway. So why not roll the dice? I didn't want to have loans. I wanted the first year [of the franchise] to be fully paid for, so we could jump in and run — and that's what we did.How did you find Filta Environmental Kitchen Solutions?



I worked with a franchise coach. He asked what I was interested in, and I said the environment. I also looked at mobile dog grooming because I love dogs, but there are a lot of mobile dog groomers out there, and nobody was doing this oil filtering on Long Island.How does it help the environment to filter oil from a restaurant's fryers?Instead of just dumping oil and getting rid of it, we're saving so many things. We're saving on the plastic jugs. On fertilizer. On all the farming of all the soybeans. We take oil out of the fryers to be processed into biofuel, so it can be used in planes and things like that. It's double revenue and double environmental impact.How hard is the work? We're filtering all the impurities out of the oil, and we're vacuuming all the crumbs and junk out of the bottom of the fryers, so you have more consistent quality for cooking for a longer time. It is hard work. It's not for the faint of heart. The equipment is heavy, and you're moving this equipment in and out of places using loading docks. But my husband tells all the guys who work for us that his 55-year-old wife is outworking them right now.Related: He Opened a Pizza Restaurant to Serve the Native American Community. It Was So Successful He's Opening 20 More.Who are your clients?During the pandemic, we went after the big guys because everything else was shut down. Filta has contracts with companies that run arenas and stadiums: UBS Arena, Citifield, Hofstra University. Once those guys get to know you, and they know you're here, the sale isn't as hard as you think. You just have to get the right person to talk to.Do you plan to keep the focus solely on those larger clients?We're trying to build out more of the smaller businesses now. If something happens to one thing, you want to have yourself covered with something else. If I'm going after smaller accounts, they're probably right near my bigger accounts, so it just makes the route more profitable.

20,How This NFL Running Back Trains His Mindset for Resilience On and Off the Field,"Mar 18, 2024",Jeff Fenster,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-this-nfl-running-back-trains-his-mindset-for-resilience/471060,"
In a world where the glitz and glamor of professional sports often overshadow the harsh realities of life after the game, Austin Ekeler stands out as a beacon of adaptability and foresight. His story, detailed in a captivating conversation with Jeff Fenster on his podcast, is not just one of athletic prowess but of strategic planning and execution in the realm of business.Related: How Giving Your Time and Resources to Others Can Unlock Opportunity and WealthAustin Ekeler's narrative begins in the rugged, competitive landscape of college football, a world where thousands of hopefuls dream of NFL stardom, but few make it. Ekeler's relentless work ethic and determination set him apart, propelling him from a promising college athlete to a distinguished professional in the NFL. However, what makes Ekeler's story particularly compelling is not just his success on the field but his visionary approach to life beyond it.



The Athlete's Mindset in the Business ArenaEkeler's transition from the NFL to becoming a successful businessman didn't happen by chance. It was the result of deliberate actions, constant self-improvement, and an unwavering commitment to excellence. His journey is a testament to the fact that the qualities that make one successful in sports—discipline, resilience, and the ability to perform under pressure—are equally valuable in the business world.In his conversation with Fenster, Ekeler emphasizes the importance of seizing opportunities. This principle guided him through his NFL career and into his business ventures. By always being prepared to take advantage of every situation, Ekeler demonstrates a proactive approach to life that many aspiring entrepreneurs and athletes can learn from.


Lessons in Perseverance and AdaptabilityEkeler's story is particularly relevant in today's fast-paced, ever-changing world. It highlights the necessity of adaptability—both on the sports field and in the boardroom. His ability to pivot from a career in sports to successful entrepreneurship showcases a level of agility that is commendable and rare.Related: Gary Vaynerchuk on the Power of Authenticity and AccountabilityMoreover, Ekeler's emphasis on continuous improvement is a crucial takeaway for anyone looking to make their mark, be it in sports, business, or any other field. The mindset of never settling, always striving for better and viewing every failure as a lesson rather than a setback is what has made Ekeler a role model for aspiring athletes and entrepreneurs alike.A Blueprint for SuccessAustin Ekeler's journey from the NFL to the business world is not just a story of personal achievement; it's a blueprint for success that emphasizes the importance of hard work, resilience, and the ability to adapt. His insights, shared candidly with Jeff Fenster, offer valuable lessons for anyone looking to navigate the complexities of career transitions.


As we look at Ekeler's evolution, it's clear that his achievements are no stroke of luck but the result of a strategic approach to life's challenges. His story inspires us to pursue our goals with fervor and to remain adaptable in the face of change, reminding us that the principles of success remain constant across all arenas of life.Related: How to Empower Yourself to Unlock Your Full PotentialAustin Ekeler's narrative from NFL stardom to business success is a vivid illustration of how skills honed in one area can translate into another, proving once again that the qualities of determination, adaptability, and continuous improvement are universal keys to success.About The Jeff Fenster ShowSerial entrepreneur Jeff Fenster embarks on an extraordinary journey every week, delving into the stories of exceptional individuals who have defied the norms and blazed their own trails to achieve extraordinary success.

23,15 of the Best Time Management and Productivity Books of All Time,"Mar 8, 2024",John Rampton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/15-of-the-best-time-management-and-productivity-books-of/329378,"
Entrepreneurs are always on a quest to win the race against time. As if that weren't stressful enough, we also have to enhance our willpower and strengthen our self-discipline. If not, then all of the distractions flying around will stand in the way of us getting things done.Since I'm an avid reader, I've learned over the years that the best way to improve my time management and productivity skills have been through books. Of course, it can be overwhelming when you're searching online or browsing in a book store for literature that can assist you in living a more fruitful life. That's why I've made the decision easier for you by sharing with the 15 best time management and productivity books of all time.1. ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change"" by Stephen R. CoveyFirst published in 1989, ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" is regularly considered the best book to read if you want to improve your productivity both professionally and personally. It focuses on developing new habits so that you can stay-on-track as opposed to eliminating bad habits. Most notably, defining your goals and priorities.



Covey uses the analogy of placing rocks, pebbles, and sand into a jar to help you define what's really important. If you start by putting the little things, such as the pebbles or sand, the rocks won't fit. However, if you begin with the rock there's enough room for you to put the tinier items around them in the jar.Key quote: ""The key is not to prioritize what's on your scheduling app but to schedule your priorities.""Related: 5 Ways to Be a More Effective People Person2. ""How to Stop Procrastinating: A Simple Guide to Mastering Difficult Tasks and Breaking the Procrastination Habit"" by S.J. ScottIf you're struggling with procrastination, this is arguably the only book you'll need to own. How to Stop Procrastinating is a down-to-earth and uses a specific framework to assist you in becoming action-oriented. Scott also shares his own experiences on how he overcame procrastination and explores the main reasons why we drag out feet.Personally, I enjoyed how straightforward this book. The advice provided isn't too complex. It simply encourages you to does this, then do this, and after do that.Key quote: ""If you're someone who procrastinates, then this bad habit is limiting your success in a variety of ways. If you don't address this issue, then you'll reduce the likelihood that you'll achieve your major goals.""


3.""Eat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time"" by Brian TracyIf your procrastination still persists then Eat That Frog! should help you get over that hump. Inspired by a famous Mark Twain quote, ""Eat a live frog the first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day,"" author Brian Tracy details why and how you should tackle your most challenging task in the morning.Additionally, Tracy shares successful time management techniques like how to set goals, get organized, practice the ""Law of Three,"" and applying the 80/20 Rule.Key quote: ""You can get control of your time and your life only by changing the way you think, work, and deal with the never-ending river of responsibilities that flows over you each day. You can get control of your tasks and activities only to the degree that you stop doing some things and start spending more time on the few activities that can really make a difference in your life.""4. ""The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich""by Timothy Ferriss

24,Having Time Management Problems? Then You Must Do One Thing to Avoid These 3 Consequences,"Mar 8, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/having-time-management-problems-try-this-weekly-habit/469749,"
Nearly everyone wishes they had more time. One of the biggest challenges facing most of my clients is finding enough time to ""do it all."" We have more time-saving tools and resources at our fingertips than ever before. Many of them come in the form of electronic devices that exist to serve us. Yet, most of us report having less time than ever before.Ultimately, time management is just self-management. Those of us who do it well experience much higher levels of satisfaction and success in every area of our lives. My advice? Carve out 1-2 hours early in the week to strategize and plan your time and calendar. Many of us don't make time to do this (because we feel we can't), but that's a mistake. Here's what happens if you don't do this every week.Related: 5 Reasons Why You Need to Learn Time Management for Your Business



1. You'll never connect to your wildest goals and your core valuesWhen you don't regularly make time to check in with yourself, you rob yourself of opportunities to identify what you're passionate about, where your talents lie and what you were put on this earth to do. You'll start to forget your ""why."" The things that must be done today will always feel more urgent than the things you'd like to do tomorrow — but the latter is often far more important.Without alone time to focus on the future, it's incredibly easy to get sucked into the day-to-day minutiae or whatever deadline your boss gave you that's fast approaching. Without intentionally pulling yourself out of the daily grind, you'll never develop a true plan for where you want to end up in five or 10 years and what you stand for. Without that, it's nearly impossible to take the right actions this week to manifest your future self.


If you have an idea of what you'd like to be remembered for, it's imperative that you spend time now crafting that specific vision and how you plan to make it happen. It won't happen on its own. This is also a chance to ensure you're living in accordance with your core values. Many verbally say things like ""family is the most important thing to me,"" but then don't back those words up with action. If you take time to remind yourself of your most important values on a weekly basis, you'll have an easier time prioritizing and committing to them.2. You won't know who to empower and what to delegateWe all have the same 24 hours in a day. Strategy time doesn't add more hours to your week; it only takes time. It doesn't allow your plate to become any bigger, but it does allow you to decide how you'll remove things from your plate. A weekly strategy session allows you to figure out what can be automated, delegated or eliminated. Ask yourself: Is there a way I can use technology to make this process faster? Is there someone around me who is better suited than me to complete this project or task, and who would also view it as a great growth opportunity? Do I have the right people on my team? How am I helping them become ready to take on more?When you make time to ask questions like these, it's amazing what epiphanies you'll have. Private strategy sessions are a great place to make plans for who you'll ask to do what and why it's the right decision — not just for you, but for them. In my days as a senior leader in financial services, I'd use my strategy time to make careful decisions about which direct reports I'd ask to lead our weekly conference calls and monthly meetings, as well as who I might tap to complete special assignments. Until I made this shift, these were all things I felt I had to do myself. It was incredible how many hours I was able to free up on my calendar once I realized that empowering the talent around me is a key part of great leadership.Related: What Are You Wasting Your Business Time On?


3. Your calendar will fill up with other people's most important priorities instead of your ownWhen you make time to strategize and plan each week, you get to load the things that matter most (to you) onto your calendar before others have the chance. As Stephen Covey said, ""Act or be acted upon. It's easier to say no when you have a greater yes in mind."" It's true. It's much easier to turn down an invite for a meeting or an event when you already have a conflict scheduled on your calendar that feels more important to you. Saying no becomes far less personal.Taking time on Sunday night or Monday morning to map out your week and give your most important priorities a place to live and breathe on your calendar strongly increases the chance that those things will get done. It's amazing how much metaphorical gravel and small rocks will fit onto your calendar (between all the cracks) once you schedule your big rocks first. This allows you to be proactive instead of reactive. If you've already been intentional and deliberate about what you want to get done each week and where you feel your time is best spent, you'll be able to articulate those thoughts more easily in the heat of a moment when someone spontaneously asks you if you can spare time for them.If you already feel that you don't have enough time, I understand that making time to strategize around your biggest priorities, plan for the future, and calendar your week feels nearly impossible. But remember: Time is not found; it's made. Don't be a slave to time. Practicing this discipline does take time, but this practice returns more time back to you, especially in the long run. This process will help you (and everyone around you) become stronger. If you consistently make time for this activity on a weekly basis, you'll eventually find that you're ahead of whatever is coming down the pike and you've got time for all the things that matter most, both professionally and personally.

      Key Takeaways    



        MrBeast is shifting his YouTube style from fast-paced and high-energy to slower storytelling.
      


        He credits this new approach for a significant increase in his video views.
      


        This shift may help Donaldson increase his reach and influence to more mature viewers. 
      



















MrBeast via Business Insider
YouTube's biggest star MrBeast.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. MrBeast appears to be ushering in a new, more mature era of YouTube.In his latest post on X, the YouTube megastar said wants to leave frantic, energetic personas in his videos behind.



""This past year I've slowed down our videos, focused on storytelling, let scenes breathe, yelled less, more personality, longer videos, etc. And our views have skyrocketed!"" YouTube's biggest star said in a post on X on March 3.He urged his fellow YouTubers to ""get rid of the ultra fast-paced"" and over-stimulating era of content. ""It doesn't even work,"" he said.It's a wise move, according to experts, and one that could help him rapidly grow his roughly $700 million-a-year empire.The formula for YouTube successMrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, has 242 million subscribers on YouTube, and his numbers are still growing rapidly.In 2024 alone, he's earned 17 million subscribers — significantly more than most creators will ever achieve in their careers.In his videos, Donaldson shreds Lamborghinis, gives away massive amounts of cash, and performs ambitious, over-the-top stunts like recreating the Netflix phenomenon ""Squid Game."" He's also become famous for his charity work, planting millions of trees, building wells, and paying for people to have cataract surgery.


But while Donaldson built much of his brand riding the wave of colorful videos full of lively, dynamic characters that served YouTubers so well in the early days, he's experimented with being a bit more composed in recent videos.This past year i've slowed down our videos, focused on story telling, let scenes breathe, yelled less, more personality, longer videos, etc. And our views have skyrocketed!My fellow YouTubers lets get rid of the ultra fast paced/overstim era of content. It doesn't even work ? pic.twitter.com/J7IBwHF6Jj— MrBeast (@MrBeast) March 3, 2024In September 2023, for example, he tried adjusting his thumbnails where he had an exhilarated, open-mouthed expression to a grin, and he said ""the watch time went up on every video.""Whatever Donaldson is doing is clearly working, having amassed 13 billion views on his channel since then. However, some viewers have criticized him for backpedaling on what made him popular.


One critic said Donaldson has realized he's the ""Oppenheimer of YouTube and is trying to undo the damage he caused.""Others, however, said they have enjoyed Donaldson's newer content. ""I'm all in for this kind of content,"" one viewer said. ""It's quality over quantity era again.""MrBeast has grown up, and so has his contentIn his latest stunt, ""I Survived 7 Days In An Abandoned City,"" Donaldson and his crew flew to Kupari in the southeast of Dubrovnik, Croatia. After being heavily shelled during the Balkan War in the 1990s, buildings in the area have been abandoned for decades.In 17 minutes, the group explored derelict buildings, set up camp, and documented some fun and eerie moments, such as discovering stray cats, building fires, and hearing glass breaking while they tried to sleep at night.


The video is still packed full of multiple angles and jump cuts but, apart from the introduction, it doesn't have any of the over-the-top shouting many associate with early YouTube.Katya Varbanova, a viral marketing expert, told Business Insider this pivot makes sense because Donaldson is no longer the 13-year-old he was when he started out on YouTube.""Now he's about to turn 26 and he's a whole grown businessman,"" she said. ""So of course he has evolved as a person, and of course, his content will evolve too.""She said she thinks it is Donaldson that is craving this change toward more storytelling and a slower pace, rather than it necessarily being what the majority of his audience wants.


""I think we have to ask ourselves if younger Jimmy who was blowing up with fast-paced content was reading that tweet, would he agree with it and pivot his strategy at this moment in time? I am not sure,"" Varbanova said.""In fact, I am willing to bet he would say 'Who cares about the rules — I am carving my own path.'""Donaldson's decision to slow down his videos seems to be a choice for him and his viewers rather than trying to game YouTube's indeterminable and unpredictable algorithm.In October 2020, Donaldson said he doesn't stress about the length of his videos just to try to appease a metric he can't see. He showed thumbnails of videos of differing lengths, demonstrating that they were all doing well, and urged creators to upload the ""best video"" they possibly could. ""Whatever length that is, upload it,"" he said.


""If a video is a banger, the algorithm will find an audience for it,"" he said, adding that YouTube wouldn't suddenly push out a video because it was ""a minute shorter than what you usually post.""The right content at the right timeBen Steele, a social media marketer at The Big Phone Store who runs the company's TikTok account, told BI that when Donaldson was first starting out, this ""toned-down content would have worked against him.""But now, Donaldson has the benefit of having a strong parasocial relationship with his followers, and a track record of bringing in clicks and engagement. This means whatever he chooses to do, his followers will probably respond positively.Donaldson's new content makes him appear more authentic, which will help him increase his influence even further, Steele said. He's already dominated the younger demographic, and his more mature content will likely be more interesting to millennials and older generations.


""In order to grow further, he needs to appeal to a broader audience, which includes older viewers who would be put off by the loud, obnoxious kind of video that readily goes viral,"" Steele said.Varbanova said the best way to thrive as a creator is to be a good storyteller, educator, or entertainer, and find what works, rather than trying to emulate what made someone else successful. This is a ""recipe for failure,"" she said.""The easiest way to struggle as a creator is to try what everyone else is doing without questioning whether it's right for you or not,"" she said. ""I would caution any content creator to not blindly listen to advice from someone who's 1,000 steps ahead of them.""The best creators think long-term, Varbanova said, and make content that's ""sustainable, not trendy.""""Or be the one that sets the trends,"" she said. ""Then you can do whatever you want.""BI has reached out to Donaldson's representatives for comment.

      Key Takeaways    



        Nupur Dave retired at 40 after working jobs at Google and startups.
      


        She became part of the FIRE — financial independence, retire early — community.
      


        Days later, she realized the early-retirement lifestyle wasn't for her, like many others.
      



















Nupur Dave via Business Insider
Nupur Dave retired at 40 but decided to rejoin the corporate world the same year.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Nupur Dave thought her decision to retire at age 40 in 2022 was an easy one.At the time, she was living in Bengaluru, India. She had worked at Google for 10 years in the company's Atlanta, Mountain View, and Bengaluru offices. In addition to that, she had worked for startups, was secure about her finances, and was confident a corporate 9-to-5 was no longer for her.



""I quit my job on a Friday,"" Dave told Business Insider.""By Monday evening, I was just bawling,"" she continued. ""I was crying my eyes out because I realized that I need to be with people.""


Coworking spaces weren't inspiringDave during her time working in Google. Nupur Dave via BIDave had her post-retirement life planned out: She would write her third book, hang out with her old colleagues, and network with founders and artists at coworking spaces.But the reality of retiring early turned out quite different.She quickly realized she would no longer have the same relationship with her former colleagues.""The loneliness of the coworking space actually hit me when I physically went in there and sat down — it was completely empty,"" Dave said about her first day as a retiree.She spent the next few weeks ""coworking-space hopping."" While some of the coworking spaces she visited were sold out, some hardly saw any traffic because they were used as placeholders for companies that were largely remote, Dave said.""I was not making friends, and I didn't feel inspired by the physical surroundings of the coworking space,'"" she said.Too much independence was also scary.""Even though people say, 'I like that I'm on my own terms,' sometimes being completely untethered is scary,"" Dave said about her retirement. ""It felt like doing a space walk.""Savings and financial independenceDave on her last day at a financial services company in front of an early retirement advertisement. Nupur Dave via BIBy retiring at 40, Dave became part of the FIRE — financial independence, retire early — community.For her, the decision to retire early came from a place of financial security.Working in the U.S. for 11 years allowed her to build savings that went a long way in India, where the cost of living is lower. Dave was earning about $100,000 a year in San Francisco when she left her job.Before retiring, she worked with a financial advisor to ensure her savings were enough to cover her expenses, and sales from her previous books and consultancy would help pay day-to-day bills. The critical part, however, was her location.


""The whole idea of FIREing was possible because I'm in India,"" Dave said. ""There's no way I could have FIREd in the U.S.""""Everything is much more doable in India, and you can still maintain a life of luxury,"" she added. Dave said she had a helper coming in to help with cooking and cleaning, which cost from $100 to $200 a month.Challenges of retiring earlyWhile Dave's problems with retired life were social in nature, some in the FIRE community chose to rejoin the corporate world for other reasons.""Early retirement is not for everyone,"" a financial planner, Jovan Johnson, previously wrote for BI. He wrote that those who plan to retire before the age of 60 would fall into the minority of workers, and those keen to pursue the lifestyle should have a clear sense of what they'd do in retirement, be aware that the lifestyle could be isolating, and create passive income streams to make their money last.


 Gwendolyn Merz previously told Business Insider that she went back to her corporate job nine months after retiring. For her, it was financial.Merz retired at 28 in northern Illinois after tracking her expenses and savings to the penny. But she ran into unanticipated problems soon into her retirement. She couldn't access parts of her savings that were tied to retirement accounts, she wasn't earning enough from her side hustles, and she was paying a lot more for health insurance.Michelle Jackson wrote for BI that she was once enticed by the FIRE movement but realized she didn't want to wait years to live her best life. She was in debt and was professionally exhausted, and it didn't make sense to invest more than 50% of her income.


As for Dave, her early retirement lasted four months.Not long after retiring, she landed a role as the head of special projects at an electric vehicle infrastructure firm in Bengaluru.""I am in corporate right now, but my goals are different,"" Dave said. ""It is not to build a career or make wealth out of this, but to see people every day and make sort of a predictable routine for myself.""

28,How Can You Make Sure Your Business Will Survive Anything? Try These 3 Proven Strategies,"Feb 29, 2024",Mike Szczesny,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/3-strategies-to-make-sure-your-startup-can-survive-anything/469549,"
After a few years of economic uncertainty, 2024 is shaping up to be a promising time for startups to get off the ground. While software may see a particular resurgence due to anticipated market growth, every industry has opportunities for fresh concepts and innovative companies. That's beneficial for founders entering the tech industry. However, technology isn't the only area ripe for new companies, ideas and concepts.Take ecommerce, for instance. According to Insider Intelligence, it's a sector expected to expand as sales soar toward $1.72 trillion within three years. Renewable energy is another promising sector to explore, with the World Economic Forum noting that green solutions are expected to account for 35% of global energy by next year.In other words, it's a good time to consider launching a business or product. However, resilience remains crucial for all entrepreneurs venturing into the startup space. Even in the best of times, launching companies can be risky. Flexibility and adaptability are essential to success, no matter the economic climate.



How can you ensure that you are prepared to pivot at a moment's notice? Implement a few proven strategies to keep your growing business agile.Related: The Basics of Building a Budget for Your Business


1. Design your annual budget allocations to account for uncertaintyWhat are some reasons why startups fail? According to CBInsights, 38% of failed startups cited a lack of cash as the primary issue. That's nearly 4 in 10, which is a compelling reason to ensure that you dedicate significant time to adjusting your funding allocations.First off, be sure to set aside emergency dollars. Having some money in reserve could save you from problems if a vendor suddenly increases prices or you can't meet payroll. This is beyond just being efficient with your cash flow; it's setting aside a slush fund, so you're not struggling to cover basic bills.Next, invest in your profit centers. These will naturally include your sales, marketing and support departments. Many founders have made the mistake of trying to reduce their sales and advertising budgets. That's a good way to lose a lot of leads and make it difficult for you to generate revenue for your business. You can (and should) still operate with a lean, grassroots mindset. Don't be frugal in small matters and wasteful in larger ones, especially if you've allocated those emergency funds.2. Stay alert for opportunities to broaden your influenceYou need a solid business plan to establish a supportive and visionary framework for your company. That's great, but remain open to opportunities that might not align with your current plan. You don't have to seize every opportunity to grow, but stay alert to possibilities.


For example, let's say you have developed a product, and your business is in the U.S. However, your sales team brings you some interesting findings: They are receiving a lot of interest from buyers in foreign markets. This might indicate that you are focusing on increasing international sales. In 2021, INS Global discovered that 42% of companies found moving outside domestic markets a popular way to diversify.The point? Staying updated on trends is essential for making real-time decisions. Nothing should be set in stone, from marketing to reaching a new demographic to changing your internal processes. If you are too rigid, you will not experience the benefits that come from being able to adapt.Related: 10 Tech Trends That Will Shape the Next Decade3. Differentiate your company through exceptional customer serviceEvery company has competitors. Some of your competitors may offer products or services almost identical to your startup's. Yet, you can still win over customers with innovative customer service solutions.

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2006, El Ghatit was working in IT when he got the idea for a sentimental telephone-based business. 
      


        A few months later, he was laid off and decided to focus on growing his side hustle. 
      


        As a side hustle, the venture earned $100,000 per year; now a full-time business, it's on track to see more than $700,000 in 2024.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Alaa El Ghatit, founder of LifeOnRecord. LifeOnRecord is a service that lets people phone in stories, memories and well wishes for someone celebrating a birthday, retirement, wedding or other special occasion. The recordings are put onto a keepsake speaker or a vinyl album.Image Credit: Courtesy of Alaa El GhatitWhen did you start LifeOnRecord as a side hustle, and what inspired it?



Back in 2006, I was working in an IT department of a large employee benefits consulting firm, managing 60 people, and I wasn't feeling fulfilled at my job. I didn't like being in meetings all day, and I wanted to get more hands-on again and work on something more meaningful, but I couldn't see a viable path to doing that where I was.I had been playing around with a telephone system in my spare time and wondered if I could create a business by having people call in and record their favorite stories and memories about a person as a way to celebrate their birthday, retirement, wedding, etc.


Related: He Started a Side Hustle in His Parents' Basement and Won Big on Richard Branson's TV Show. The Business Saw Over $650 Million in Annual Revenue Last Year.What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground? My mother-in-law's 65th birthday was coming up, and I thought she'd enjoy hearing from all her kids, grandkids, friends, husband, etc.So, as a trial, I set up a phone number that everyone could call and gave her the resulting recordings on a CD (remember — this was 2006). We all listened to it together on her birthday in her living room. She loved it, there were tears, and it sparked a lot of stories (18 years later, she still loves it).


I thought the idea had some traction, so I worked on it in my spare time to make it a service.A few months later, I got laid off, and I decided to take some time to try and grow the business. People started ordering, but not in the volume that allowed me to support my wife and four young kids, so after nine months, I took a job as a director of IT for a mid-size company where I could be hands-on and manage a small team.Were there any challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? Navigating the side hustle of LifeOnRecord presented three significant challenges. First, I got used to the security of a corporate salary with the entrepreneurial aspect of LifeOnRecord. I enjoyed both, which kept me from fully committing to LifeOnRecord. Despite the automation and minimal time LifeOnRecord required, the camaraderie of my corporate role left me hesitant to leave until 2022.


Additionally, keeping LifeOnRecord a secret from colleagues fostered an emotional barrier, making me more reserved and unable to share valuable insights across both my worlds. This secrecy persisted until the pivotal moment I decided to quit my corporate job. Surprisingly, upon revealing LifeOnRecord to the CEO, I found unexpected support rather than resistance. The company facilitated a smooth transition, allowing me to gradually shift my focus to LifeOnRecord, with the CEO even providing guidance along the way.Lastly, an early challenge involved defending LifeOnRecord's intellectual property against infringement from a multi-national corporation. Through perseverance and direct negotiation, which took over a year, I secured an agreement from them without legal intervention, and I licensed my intellectual property to them for a fair but significant licensing fee.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money.

Growth was gradual, but people who used the service talked about it with others and developed into repeat buyers. Before I focused on it full-time, it brought in a little over $100,000 a year as a side hustle. With my corporate salary, it allowed us to live comfortably, fund college for my kids and go on trips.How much annual revenue is LifeOnRecord projected to see this year? For me, it is not really about the money and growth but more about me being able to provide a personal, customer-focused experience that I can be directly involved in. Having said that, last year was the first year it was a full-time venture, and it brought in about $350,000, and this year we will more than double that amount. We're always super responsive to customer questions and requests, and I don't want it to get so big that stellar customer service is no longer a priority.How have you approached scaling the company? What has really been key in helping it grow? 


Right from the start, my strategy was all about leveraging technology to scale and enhance the customer experience. Recognizing that customers wanted more control over their contributions, I developed a ""My Recordings"" portal for them to edit, organize or delete their messages. I streamlined the audio enhancement process by partnering with Dolby Labs for top-notch voice clarity and noise reduction, and I expanded contribution options beyond traditional phone calls to include six alternative methods.[While] balancing this growth with my corporate responsibilities, I was mindful not to expand too quickly, aiming to maintain a healthy equilibrium between my day job and LifeOnRecord. This balance allowed me to enjoy the perks of both my professional career and my entrepreneurial venture without overwhelming myself or the business.A key innovation was introducing vintage rotary phone rentals for wedding receptions for guests to leave messages for the wedding couple. Unlike competitors that simply rent out the phones, we integrated these pieces into our broader service ecosystem. Guests love the charm of leaving messages on these classic devices, which are then enhanced and preserved through our platform.Related: This Fun, Flexible Side Hustle Pays $35 an Hour and Gets You Into Exclusive CEO Summits, Music Festivals, and Sports EventsAs you look back over your journey with LifeOnRecord, is there anything you wish you would have done differently? There's a lingering thought that maybe I should have stepped away from the corporate world sooner to fully embrace the entrepreneurial path with LifeOnRecord. The allure of stability and a predictable income often held me back, anchoring me to a role that, while comfortable, perhaps limited the potential growth of my passion project. Yet, with every decision comes a silver lining.Staying in my corporate job perhaps longer than I should have afforded me invaluable lessons and experiences. It was in this professional setting that I honed skills that later became crucial in navigating the entrepreneurial landscape: the discipline of managing projects, the art of negotiation and the ability to lead a team.This period also served as a vital incubation phase for LifeOnRecord. It allowed me to slowly but surely build the foundation of the business, testing ideas and refining the model without the immediate pressure of having it be my sole source of income. In a way, it granted me the freedom to experiment and innovate with less risk, laying the groundwork for what LifeOnRecord would eventually become.


What are you most excited about when it comes to LifeOnRecord's future? Customers have used LifeOnRecord in innovative ways. People have used LifeOnRecord to send out audio thank yous, and brides have recorded their feelings of ""saying yes to the dress"" using LifeOnRecord, then played that recording as they walk down the aisle. I think there are many more ways to market LifeOnRecord that we can explore in the future.What's your favorite part about running your own business today? I love the impact the business has on customers. When I had a corporate job, I felt like a cog in a wheel, but with LifeOnRecord, I created a way for people to make a connection with others. I'm especially grateful when people buy it and record messages for someone with a terminal illness. They say it's one of the few things they can do to show how loved the person is.Beyond that, I like the lifestyle flexibility and not needing to be accountable to anyone other than our customers. I love being identified with it and the excitement that other people have when I share what I do.

32,The CEO of Catholic Prayer and Meditation App Hallow Says Founders Need to Be Part of Something Bigger Than Themselves,"Feb 26, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/hallow-ceo-says-founders-need-to-be-part-of-something/470048,"
Hallow is the number one Catholic prayer and meditation app in the world with over 12 million downloads. And after a surge in downloads following its Super Bowl ad, it took the top spot on Apple's App Store across all apps.The company has raised a total of $105 million to date, thanks, in large part, to the blood, sweat, and tears of co-founder and CEO Alex Jones. On this episode of The CEO Series, we visited Hallow's headquarters to speak with Jones about all things business, leadership, and faith. Below are some highlights from that powerful conversation which have been edited for length and clarity.Related: With Over $120 Million in Sales, Dude Wipes Is No Joke. Here's How the Company's Chief Executive Dude Keeps Things Fun and Profitable.



Divine inspiration""Hallow is a prayer and meditation app for anybody looking to grow closer to God. Its origin goes back to my faith journey. I was raised Catholic but fell away from my faith in high school and college. After I graduated, I got really into meditation. I found these apps that had just launched, Headspace and Calm, and I started using them every day and I loved them. But every time I would meditate, my mind would oddly feel pulled towards something spiritual, like an image of the cross. So I started reaching out to priests, pastors, and folks I knew from Notre Dame and asked what I thought was a really interesting question: Is there any way that there's some sort of intersection between this faith thing and this meditation thing? And they pretty much all laughed at me and said, ""Yeah, we've been doing it for 2000 years. It's called prayer!"" And that changed my life. I knew I needed to do this. I knew how to code a little bit so we built the first version and went from there. The app has helped me grow tremendously in my own spirituality, which has been phenomenal.""Something bigger than themselves""My cousin passed away when he was 45. He died in his sleep randomly. He had just gotten married and his wife was pregnant with their first kid. His mom, who is my aunt, was obviously heartbroken. We had just launched the app and she sent us a note that I have saved to this day. It said, 'I honestly didn't think I'd be able to make it through my first Christmas without my son and I just want you to know that these little meditations on the app are the only thing that's reminded me that I'm able to have hope and that I'm able to get out bed and carry on in this deep time of a pain.' And I just like broke down crying on the floor in my tiny little studio apartment.""

I remember I went back to my studio apartment after hearing no after no — people basically telling me that the core of who I am is stupid and this idea is never going to work. It was so heavy. I was so stressed. My heart was in pain. My back had all these knots in it. I started praying and I said, 'God, look, this is too much. I can't do this. I'm done. I can't take this weight.' And then I was like, 'I'm gonna make a deal with you. I promise if this thing works out, you're always gonna get the credit. I'm never gonna trick myself into thinking I'm some successful startup CEO who figured all this stuff out. It was all you.' That massive weight immediately lifted and the next day we went for a pitch meeting at a coffee shop with this guy and he gave us a term sheet. And we then get like three, four more the next day.

33,3 Mind-Changing Habits Every Leader Should Follow,"Feb 20, 2024",Jason Hennessey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/3-mind-changing-habits-every-leader-should-follow/469561,"
The human mind is incredibly powerful in shaping our feelings and behavior, which is why your mindset can make all the difference in your level of success as well as your daily happiness. In fact, your mindset even affects those around you through your attitudes and actions. Because of this, mindset is especially important for business leaders, whose feelings and decisions affect the people they lead and the outcomes of their businesses. But changing your mindset takes more than just willpower — it requires regular thoughts and actions.One of the most effective ways to change your mindset is through the power of habit. Habits come in many shapes and sizes, good, bad and neutral. Once a habit is established, it's easy to continue doing it, which is what makes it such a powerful tool to affect your mindset. Here are three habits that I use to help me create a more successful mindset.Related: Hope, Optimism and Resiliency: The Three Most Powerful Leadership Tools You Can Have As An Entrepreneur



1. Build resiliency through optimismWe've all been told at some point in our lives to adopt a positive mindset — and for good reason. It's incredibly beneficial not only in making you feel happier but also in building resiliency, a skill that every leader needs in order to recover from challenges and setbacks.While it may seem more practical to take a pessimistic or realistic approach to challenges, an optimistic approach is often most advantageous because it doesn't allow you to become discouraged from continuing to try to find a solution and push through the difficulty. A positive attitude allows you not to take setbacks personally and to believe in your own abilities even when things aren't going according to plan. For a leader, positivity during times of challenge or crisis is especially important in order to support team morale and direct the team toward solutions rather than discouragement.


Of course, choosing a positive attitude isn't as simple as flipping a switch when you wake up in the morning. It takes a significant amount of work, but luckily there are a few practices you can use to help you establish and maintain a positive mindset.I use the practice of gratitude journaling, which has become popular as a form of reflection and as a mindset tool to foster positivity. Taking time to appreciate positive things in your life will naturally make you feel uplifted and happier, so a practice like this can be worthwhile to establish. Similarly, you can focus on the positive by finding things throughout your day to appreciate. For example, try challenging yourself to pay five compliments every day to five different people. Not only will you make someone else feel positive, but you'll feel good about it too.When you do catch yourself thinking negative thoughts, whether that's about yourself, someone else or a situation you're in, try to reframe them into something positive or change your focus onto something uplifting. While this isn't always possible, the more you practice it, the easier it will become to keep your mindset positive as a whole.2. Practice generosityNot only is generosity virtuous, but it has a number of positive effects on your mindset. First, and most obviously, it feels good to do something nice for someone else, which can help you maintain a positive attitude. But if you make a point of practicing generosity regularly, it can have even more benefits. It affects the way people see you and the kind of culture you create as a leader. And when you give to others regularly, it helps you develop a mindset of abundance rather than scarcity.


At my company, we have an annual Random Acts of Kindness week, in which all employees participate. We're a remote company, so it might look a bit different if you were to implement it. The week has opportunities for employees to show kindness towards coworkers on Monday, their team on Tuesday, their loved ones on Valentine's Day, local small businesses on Thursday and the community on Friday. We post photos on our Slack channel and donate money towards a charity.Related: Why Your Creativity Is Your Most Valuable Skill3. Create a habit of creativityCreativity is essential for the business leader in growing your business, and it's one of your most important functions — something no one else on your team can do for you. But creativity is like a muscle, and the more you practice it, the easier it becomes. By maintaining a creative mindset, I find I'm better able to respond to problems, and I'm constantly coming up with new ideas. Creativity is never a struggle for me because I make a habit of it by creating space in my regular schedule dedicated to creativity.Making creativity into a habit starts by simply scheduling time for it regularly, then showing up and staying focused on your creative tasks without distractions. Your mindset is something you get to choose, but it takes work to get there. By establishing habits that help you craft the mindset you desire and practicing them regularly, you'll be able to more easily maintain a mindset that will help you reach higher levels of success as a leader.


The power to shape our mindset and improve our business lies within our grasp, offering a gateway to enhanced success and daily contentment. As business leaders, recognizing the profound impact our mindset has on those we lead and the outcomes of our endeavors is paramount. Yet, the journey toward a transformative mindset requires more than sheer willpower — it demands the cultivation of habits that nourish positivity, generosity and creativity.By embracing practices like gratitude journaling, fostering a culture of generosity and carving out dedicated time for creativity, we pave the path toward a mindset primed for triumph. Join me in committing to the regular cultivation of habits that elevate not only our own success but also those around us.Related: The 8 Habits of Highly Effective Entrepreneurs

34,"Adapting to Change Is Key to Surviving Every Consumer Demand — Just Ask Netflix, Blockbuster, WeWork and More","Feb 19, 2024",Zain  Jaffer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/pivoting-is-the-key-to-survival-just-ask-these/469582,"
The case of how the shared workspace company WeWork went from being a darling of American business to bankruptcy is an example of a long line of business failures that stem from an inability of top management to adjust to a major change that has occurred in the world.Many do not see the iceberg ahead, but some can shift courseThe RMS Titanic sank in 1912 because everyone thought she was unsinkable. Human hubris and pride is a flaw we all have. Even C-level executives have it despite their opinions to the contrary, and old practices that worked well in the past are hard to change.Take for example Nokia, a giant in the analog cellphone sector. When Apple launched its iPhone, and Google came out with the Android operating system, the Finnish giant which had pivoted earlier from the lumber industry radio business to cellphones decided to stick it out with its proprietary Symbian operating system. The market did not agree, and soon thereafter Nokia lost its lead in the industry along with players like Sony Ericsson and Motorola to newer phone makers like Samsung and Apple.



When Netflix was a puny startup, they offered themselves up for sale for $50 million to Blockbuster, which declined Netflix's DVD mailing movie business. During that time, Blockbuster was the giant in the VHS/DVD movie rental business, with a retail store presence on many street corners. Unfortunately for them, they failed to recognize the changes that had occurred, namely that streaming video technology had become cheap. Netflix on the other hand was humble enough to recognize the shift and is now one of the major behemoths of the NASDAQ.Related: How Pivoting Saved My Business When Things Didn't Go According to Plan


Often those who have stellar educational backgrounds fail to recognize these shifts particularly if success is all they have encountered with the status quo. It is after all hard to question why you are successful. Most people will simply take it for granted, and in some cases, decide that their special management abilities are what led to their success.On the positive side, one example of a major strategic shift that was executed successfully was when Intel under their late CEO Andrew Grove with cofounders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore led their business shift from memory chips to the new business of microprocessors in the '70s. It is easy to make that shift as a business if the current business is losing money, but harder if it is making tons of money. In Intel's case, they decided that if new management came in, they would shift to microprocessors because of the upcoming personal computer (PC) business with IBM and others, so they decided that they would do it instead.Grove pointed out in his management bestseller book, Only the Paranoid Survive, that each company and industry might in its future face what are called Strategic Inflection Points. These are key moments when management should recognize that something major has shifted, and if a company is unable to pivot, the company might face a decline or even extinction.How, then, should we act?The number of eventual business failures that have graced the covers of top business magazines shows that hubris is everywhere. A real business leader, to remain successful throughout the duration of a career along with the company should also exhibit some humility.


What is worse is we often try to defend our positions and use confirmation bias, even if the data that supports our argument is random to begin with. Meaning that the data, while appearing to support your position, does not.The first step we need to do is to admit that as human leaders, we are not infallible. Every one of us can make mistakes. Appearing on the cover of a business magazine and getting invited to speak in prestigious global forums like in Davos, Switzerland or sitting in the C-Suite does not make us less human.Next, learn some statistics, such as how to use an XY scatter plot. At least enough so that you know you need enough data to show a real correlated trend. Learn not to infer a trend from a random set of data that does not even show a line or a curve if graphed. Just because you got three coin tosses as heads does not mean that the next coin toss will land the same as before.A turkey's life before the ax falls on its head is pretty good. The turkey is well-fed and gently treated. In short, past performance is not an indicator of future performance.


If your data already shows a trend, do not suffer from analysis paralysis just because you are incapable of shifting gears. If it is time to change course, just do it. Discuss with your team what to do if you are wrong and actually make that shift in direction. Have a pre-agreed exit strategy from the position you first took, no matter how hardcore you were. If something has changed, be ready to pivot.Related: Knowing When — and How — to Pivot Is Key to Your Business' Survival. Here's What You Need to Do.Do not become extinctHaving the ability to spot when something has changed, and the willingness to abandon the success of the past that may no longer be true for a new uncharted course is part of good business leadership.It is not risk-free, but it is necessary. It can prolong your business for the next few decades to come if your company masters this skill — otherwise, you'll become just like the dodos and dinosaurs.

I dipped one toe in the water and a sharp pain shot through my system. Knowing that I'd never be able to ease my way in, I quickly slid the rest of my body into the freezing cold water. I took slow, deep breaths — experts say this signals to your brain that ""I'm okay"" and prevents you from going into flight or flight mode. But as my mind ran circles around the physical sensations, I felt anything but okay.Then a funny thing happened: a minute passed, and it felt ever so slightly easier to stay in the water. Thirty seconds later, I emerged with a strange and surprisingly pleasant feeling of calm. I had survived my first cold plunge — and was already wondering when I'd do it again.Cold plunging is just one example of biohacking. A term borrowed from the ""tech hacker"" ethos, it's the science of tweaking your physiology and nervous system for optimal performance. Some types of biohacking may seem extreme, exhibitionist even — like when someone plunges a syringe in their hand to inject themselves with a genome-altering substance. But there are also more subtle techniques that anyone can start using today; that I have incorporated into my routine to perform my role as CEO of Jotform to the best of my body's ability — without losing my mind. Here is a closer look at some of those techniques, plus why I've become a believer in biohacking.

37,How to Upgrade Your Brain to Boost Focus and Productivity,"Feb 15, 2024",Ben Angel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-upgrade-your-brain-to-boost-focus-and-productivity/469007,"
Do you find yourself struggling to maintain focus and productivity in your personal and professional life? The fast-paced and ever-changing world we live in can make it challenging to tap into our full potential. Fortunately, we can optimize our cognitive abilities and thrive by finding solutions that work best for us.So says this week's guest, Dr. Gregory Kelly, who is an expert in advanced clinical nutrition and has contributed to the field of mental health. In our conversation with Dr. Kelly, he emphasized the importance of establishing a solid foundation for focus and productivity by addressing fundamental aspects such as sleep and nutrition. By understanding the body's natural rhythms and the role of sleep in regulating cognitive function, we can create a better environment for our brains to function optimally.Related: The Biohackers Guide to Getting Things Done In Times of Uncertainty



Additionally, nootropics – substances that enhance cognitive function and support brain health – can help fill nutritional gaps. Dr. Kelly has a deep understanding of cognitive systems and neurotransmitters, which he uses to formulate nootropic stacks holistically that upgrade various cognitive functions.Related: 13 Ways to Supercharge Your Focus, Increase Motivation and Boost Drive


Dr. Kelly also shed light on the importance of attention restoration and its impact on creativity because our brains require periodic breaks to restore attentional and cognitive capabilities. He shared his personal practices for attention restoration, such as taking walks in nature and engaging in kinesthetic activities. Dr. Kelly also highlighted the role of adaptogens, such as bacopa and alpha-GPC, in calming the brain and restoring focus.If Ben Angel's Beyond Unstoppable lights up your day, please take a moment to rate and review the podcast!

38,Embrace Your Fears — How Top Entrepreneurs Use Doubt to Drive Growth,"Feb 12, 2024",Chad Willardson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-successful-entrepreneurs-use-doubt-to-drive-growth/469095,"
Taking big leaps toward growth as an entrepreneur can bring on a lot of fear and self-doubt. You also risk your reputation in a way. What will others think about you? What if you completely fail? Why are you so ambitious anyway? Can't you just be happy with what you have or where your business is today? You may feel that fear of being judged, or you may be hesitant to go for the big jumps because of the unpredictability or possibility of failure.Just know this: Every entrepreneur faces challenges and failures and feels self-doubt from time to time. That doesn't even disappear completely once you reach higher levels of success and growth. Maybe you've heard the phrase: ""Fear is wetting your pants, and courage is moving forward with wet pants."" As an entrepreneur, you're going to have to move forward with wet pants many times. These fears are not roadblocks but part of the journey. In fact, if you're never scared or nervous about your goals, you're likely thinking way too small.As you progress in your business journey, consider these fears as indicators of where you need to focus and improve. It's not about eliminating your fear but about understanding and leveraging it to drive your business forward. By recognizing your fears, setting clear and actionable goals, and seeking insights from mentors and coaches, you're not just moving forward in your business — you're strategically navigating it toward growth and success, one step at a time. You're also doing things that strengthen your discipline and take you outside of your comfort zone. Most of your breakthroughs are on the other side of your fears.



Here's how you can redefine fear and transform it into a powerful ally on your entrepreneurial journey.Related: 5 Easy Ways You Can Turn Self-Doubt Into Success


Face your fears head-onThe first step is to acknowledge that your fears are a natural part of the entrepreneurial landscape. However, instead of shying away and avoiding them, confront them head-on. Recognize these fears not as roadblocks but as signposts, guiding you toward areas ripe for growth and innovation. Write them down, understand their roots, and then systematically address each one. By facing your fears, you're taking the first crucial step toward mastering them. Commit to moving forward with wet pants.Create a vision beyond your comfort zoneSetting goals is the cornerstone of progress. Yet, the real magic happens when you dare to envision beyond your immediate reach and current capabilities. Don't just plan for the next milestone; set your sights on what lies way beyond that. Envision where you want to be five, ten or even twenty years into the future. This approach might feel ambitious, even audacious at first, but it's about setting a trajectory that keeps propelling you forward.With each goal you meet, set a higher benchmark, even one that feels completely unattainable. It'll surprise you how much you are truly capable of. This cycle of continuous, ambitious goal-setting ensures that you're not just keeping pace with success. You will likely surprise yourself when you aim for ""impossible goals."" Remember, perhaps more important than reaching a specific goal or milestone is who you become in the process of striving toward that milestone.Related: 9 Ways to Conquer Fear and Realize Your True Potential


Align with a mentor who's walked your pathThe entrepreneurial path is full of complexities and unexpected turns. If you're seeking a path of steadiness and certainty, entrepreneurship is not for you. The good news is that you don't have to walk this path alone. Find a mentor or coach who has not just navigated similar paths but has also achieved the type of growth and success you're aiming for. A mentor brings not just experience but also foresight — the ability to foresee challenges and guide you in preemptively addressing them. This foresight is invaluable, helping you navigate your journey with a clarity that's often obscured when treading the path solo.By integrating these strategies into your entrepreneurial journey, you're not just overcoming fears; you're rewriting the narrative of your path. Each step taken is a bold declaration of your potential, a testament to your resilience and a milestone in your journey toward unprecedented success.It's very important for you to remember that this entrepreneurial journey you're on is not just about the milestones or the achievements or revenue targets. It's about you — yes, you — becoming the person who can reach those heights as a leader. It's about the grit and grind, the fears and doubts, and how you face and overcome them. Every big name out there, every success story you admire, they've all had their moments of doubt, their own moments of hesitating, standing there with their wet pants. But what set them apart? They kept moving forward, determined to succeed.Related: 12 Things You Need to Know About Fear, and How You Can Be a Better Entrepreneur Because of It


So, here's my parting thought for you: Embrace the mess, the uncertainty, the fear. Let it fuel you, not freeze you. You're not just building a business; you're building yourself and all the people on your team that you lead. Every setback, every fear overcome, is shaping you into the entrepreneur, the person, you're meant to be. Your journey is unique, and so is your destination. Don't shy away from setting those audacious goals, seeking that wise mentor or coach, and, most importantly, believing in yourself and your cause. You've got this, not because it's easy, but because you're capable of tackling the hard stuff. Here's to moving forward, wet pants and all, towards a future you're creating every single day.

      Key Takeaways    



        A Georgia-based millennial is earning over $250,000 a year secretly working two remote jobs.
      


        He said his childhood made him want financial security and that overemployment provides him job security.
      


        The IT professional shared his four pieces of advice for overemployed workers.

A Georgia millennial says a desire for financial security motivated him to work multiple jobs in secret. Worker in the story not pictured.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Tomas, a Georgia-based IT worker in his 30s, said his journey to an ""overemployed"" lifestyle began at a very young age.He grew up ""very poor,"" he told Business Insider, and after his mother left his father, he, his mother, and four siblings shared a one-room apartment for two years.



""As I got older I was like, 'I don't want to live like that,"" he said.In 2016, when Tomas had roughly $40,000 in credit card debt and was struggling to pay child support, he decided to look for a second remote job he could work on the sly. Two years later, job juggling had helped him pay off his debt, but he wasn't ready to give it up.


""I kind of felt invincible, and it made me feel like that will be one less thing I have to worry about in life,"" said Tomas, whose identity is known to BI but has been withheld due to his fear of professional repercussions.To this day, Tomas is secretly working two full-time remote jobs that pay over $250,000 a year in combined salaries, according to documents viewed by BI. Doing so has helped him grow his net worth to over $500,000, pay off two new cars, travel more, and find ""financial stability and freedom,"" he said. Tomas added that he'd love to have a third job if he can find the right fit.Tomas is among a small group of U.S. workers — many in the tech and IT industries — secretly holding multiple remote jobs. Working more than one job at once may not violate federal or state laws, but it could breach some employment contracts and be a fireable offense if a worker is ever found out.As layoffs have spread across the tech industry, Tomas said the extra job security that comes with overemployment has become even more important. He's even encouraged some colleagues to look for second jobs and provided advice on pulling it off.


""Companies will terminate you or lay you off without any notice at all,"" he said. ""I now have the belief that everyone should always keep two jobs.""Finding the right job for over-employment isn't easyTomas has had several different stints as an overemployed worker.Roughly a year after he began his overemployment, he decided to take a break. He said one of his jobs became much more demanding and that he wanted to adjust to the workload before he took on a second job again.Additionally, throughout this career, Tomas has worked a mix of full-time and contract jobs, and the latter have typically had an expiration date.


As pandemic fears have eased in recent years, Tomas said he's also worked for companies that required employees to return to the office. Given working remotely was key to his overemployment, he decided to part ways with those employers.These job separations are the main reason Tomas has had roughly seven different jobs since 2017. While he's generally had no more than two jobs at once, he said there were three to four months when he had three jobs — and one month when he had four. All but one of his jobs were remote — he said flexible working hours enabled him to juggle a hybrid and remote role for a while.At his peak, Tomas said he earned close to $400,000 across his jobs in a single year.Four pieces of advice for over-employed workersTomas has four suggestions for people interested in the over-employed lifestyle.


First: Know your job well so you can complete tasks quickly and dedicate time to your other jobs. Second: Figure out which job has more flexibility so you can reschedule those meetings if need be. Third: To appear constantly online for a job, don't rely on mouse jigglers — he said he thinks some IT departments can figure out when workers are using the latter. Fourth: If you think your boss is suspicious of you, it's probably time to leave that job.Tomas said job juggling has been fairly easy in his two current roles. Both jobs have flexible hours, and his shifts start at different times of the day — with only three hours of overlap between them. He said he's only had one or two overlapping meetings that have required him to come up with an excuse for missing one of them.But during a prior overemployment stint, Tomas said he had a boss who seemed to suspect he was job juggling — asking questions like why he was online well past working hours. When these questions didn't go away, Tomas decided to leave the job.Unless he finds one job that pays him over $250,000 a year, roughly his current combined salaries, Tomas said he has no plans to give up his overemployment.""I'm going to keep going as long as I can,"" he said, adding, ""The rewards definitely outweigh the labor.""

43,Tough Feedback Can Really Sting. Here's How to Take It With Grace and Turn It Into Power.,"Feb 8, 2024",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-take-tough-feedback-with-grace-and-turn-it-into-power/468431,"
It's performance appraisal season, and that means many of us will soon be getting essential feedback. While much advice exists about how to give tough feedback, there seems to be less instruction on how to receive it. Yet receiving critical feedback gracefully (then figuring out how to learn from it or apply it) is a hallmark of successful professionals.Relationships flourish and thrive when participants can both deliver and accept critical feedback, so this is a crucial skill to develop. Receiving tough feedback well isn't just about ""taking it,"" either. Successful professionals carefully navigate these conversations with poise and master these moments. Here's how I've seen them do it.Related: If Your Leadership Style Is Ever Judged By Others, Here's 8 Things You Should Do



1. Start by recognizing that feedback is a gift and express gratitudeMany of us have had a boss who gave us little (or no) feedback. If we're getting any feedback, even negative feedback, we're already better off than those who get none. It takes time and can be hard work for others to give us feedback, so if we're receiving it, there's a good chance the feedback provider cares about us and wants to help us develop and grow.Giving critical feedback can be uncomfortable; many people worry about how it will be received. So, take time to say ""thank you"" and express how much you appreciate the candor and honesty. This ensures your audience will give you feedback again and that means you'll always know where you stand with them. As tough as it might be to hear negative things about yourself, you can't grow or evolve without that kind of information, so remember that being able to absorb this kind of information sets you up for future success.


2. Ask for more informationWe must understand the feedback we're getting. If you're being coached on some aspect of your behavior, it's helpful to get specific examples of it, because then you'll know exactly what to change. You can ask for more information in an inviting and friendly way. You can start by saying that your goal is to grow and develop, so you'd like to learn more about your behavior and how it comes across to others.Having specific examples allows you to think back on the moments in question and make self-discoveries. Perhaps you were viewed as curt or rude on a day you fought with your spouse before coming to work. Perhaps you were viewed as short or abrupt in a meeting that coincided with a major deadline on another project. Getting specific details allows you to make sense of the feedback as you digest it. Perhaps you've got blind spots, but it's also possible others are missing information, too.Related: Why You Should Ditch the Sandwich Method When You Give Feedback3. Sit on itOftentimes, the decisions we regret most are the ones we make in the heat of the moment. Almost always, we choose better when we allow ourselves some space to think about how we want to respond. Before you jump to conclusions and decide the feedback you've received is unfair, take some time to process what you heard. Ask yourself: ""Is it possible there's any truth to this?""


Also, recognize that people are allowed to interpret and experience you differently than you experience yourself. Sort through what parts of the feedback, if any, really do feel unfair to you and what parts could be valid. Expect and understand that new and unexpected feedback can sometimes hurt. Remember it's okay to feel hurt by someone else's words.As part of your reflection, consider the source and intent behind the feedback. If you decide the feedback is coming from someone who routinely mistreats, disrespects or verbally abuses you, you'll probably decide to ignore it or pull back from the relationship. But, if you feel that the feedback came from someone who has your best interests at heart and cares for you, it might be worthwhile to pause and absorb it, even when it stings. If the feedback is coming from your boss, remember that their wisdom and years of experience might put them in a position to see things you can't yet (but will someday).4. Prepare for a follow-up conversationOnce you've had time to process your initial reactions, it can make sense to go back and continue the conversation, especially if this is a relationship you want to continue (or must continue) and you feel confused or misunderstood. Perhaps you feel portions of the feedback are incorrect or unfair. Getting a chance to say so (respectfully) will give you psychological oxygen. You can start by saying, ""I've spent some time thinking about what you said, and I hope it's okay I share what my intentions were and/or what my perspective is now.""It's critical to be respectful and kind as you share what you've thought about the feedback and see things differently. Sharing that you wanted to speak up because it felt important to be honest and truthful about your viewpoints can help your audience not feel attacked or dismissed.


Related: The Simple Question Great Leaders Ask People Every Day5. Come to an agreement on next stepsEspecially if you see the feedback differently, you must work to come to an agreement on what should happen next. You might ask, ""What would you like me to do differently so we're not in this situation again?"" or ""What can I/we do to resolve this?"" If you care about the relationship, others need to know that you value their opinions and are open to change. As part of this process, you might also have a few asks of your own. Perhaps you ask your friend to be more patient when you're a few minutes late or ask your boss to give you more notice when assigning last-minute projects.Getting critical feedback isn't often fun, but if you practice these five steps, you'll find it doesn't have to be a terrible experience and you don't need to walk away licking your wounds. If you remember that honest feedback makes you stronger, you might even begin to look forward to these conversations.

44,3 Tips to Actually Stick to Your New Year's Resolutions in 2024,"Feb 2, 2024",Rob Volpe,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-tips-to-actually-stick-to-your-new-years-resolutions-in/468228,"
There are plenty of articles out there telling us that we aren't going to make it when it comes to New Year's resolutions; that the data is against us. Just like nearly half of all small businesses exit before five years, most of us won't be able to keep our resolutions for more than one month and only 9% of Americans who make resolutions actually complete them. It's enough to make us wonder, ""Why bother?""This is not one of those articles.What if this year were different? What if, in 2024, we were able to stick to a resolution to create a positive change in our business? What would that feel like once we achieved it?



First, let's get the negative stuff out of the way. It's true that the further away we get from the holiday cheer, the harder it is to maintain our resolutions for the new year. Often, we've set a BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) that's misaligned with reality and it would require us to be a different person, team or company to succeed.Since ""comparison is the thief of joy,"" let's stop trying to be something we're not and instead take a different approach where we set intentions based on our understanding of who we are and what's realistic.


Related: Why Your New Year's Resolutions Won't Work Unless You Stop Doing These 4 ThingsSet intentions, not resolutionsIf I were able to keep my resolutions, I'd have been a billionaire 20 years ago. Not because I set a resolution to get rich — that'd be a real BHAG — but if the resolutions I made were achieved and had the desired effect, it would have paid dividends many times over. But the world doesn't work that way.The etymology of the word ""resolution"" starts with breaking something down to a finite point — to resolve a puzzle, for example. There's a firmness and finality to it. Once a puzzle is solved, that's it. There's no room for interpretation or external forces. If a piece of a jigsaw puzzle goes missing because the dog ate it, we're unable to complete the puzzle. We've failed.""Intention"" comes from Latin words meaning ""to stretch"" and ""aim,"" ""design,"" ""will"" and ""wish."" The malleability inherent in these words seems more fitting. It provides space for adaptation to the external forces impeding our progress.


What got in the way of making my first billion dollars? Plenty of things. First, the inability to effectively change my habits because I had set a BHAG. Second was external forces beyond my control. Clients change priorities, economies recede and uncertainty in markets exists because of current events. In fall of 2001, I was living in New York City and running a small consultancy practice. All my new business leads dried up after 9/11. Businesses didn't know what to do next. The shock of the attacks was beyond disruptive and traumatic. Burning through my savings, it came time for me to ""return to the warm embrace of a large corporation,"" which I did, joining what was then Kraft Foods for a couple of years while the world righted itself.If I had kept a fixed mindset instead of being flexible through intention, I would be facing the feeling of failure. A negative result is hard enough without negative self-talk from resolutions unmet. An intention can morph and adapt based on the external. Shifting from a fixed mindset of resolutions to a growth mindset of intention will be beneficial in many ways, especially in the chaotic business environment of 2024. High interest rates, two wars, societal queasiness from culture wars and upcoming elections have created uncertainty. No matter what we resolve to do to drive growth, manage spending or make smart investments, there's little to do other than buckle our seat belts. Intentions give us the adaptability to thrive in uncertain times.Related: 8 New Year's Business Resolutions That Will Keep You EnergizedUnderstand the cause of the behavior you seek to changeToo often, we focus on the fix instead of the root cause. While that might get us out of a jam, it won't prevent it from repeating in the future. Many people resolve to do something differently while ignoring the ""muscle memory"" and neural pathways established from having done it the old way a million times in the past.


What's required is a combination of self-awareness and then self-empathy. Self-awareness is recognition of the behavior we seek to change while self-empathy goes a layer deeper and helps us decode the cause behind the behavior. Understanding what has led to the behavior will ultimately help us adjust it.For example, when I was in a business development role, I once set an intention to increase the sales that I generated. Instead of willing myself to make more calls, take more meetings and let that drive the sales, I took a step back to examine my past patterns and what needed to change. Doing that, I realized I tended to reach out to the clients that I was friendliest with, rather than the ones I hadn't talked to in a while. I wasn't casting a net as wide as I could.Going a little deeper to understand that behavior, it didn't take long to realize that I was staying in a comfort zone instead of applying a more strategic approach to who I connected with and when. Once I had that self-empathy, the behavior was easier to change as I was able to shift my perspective to self-motivate and talk myself through my discomfort.As we move into self-empathy, keep these five steps in mind — dismantle judgment, including negative self-talk; ask good questions of yourself; actively listen to what's coming up; integrate into understanding, what we discover doesn't make us weird or wrong, it provides more information to work with; use solution imagination to identify how to create the behavior change that will last.

That means that we won't make progress in a straight line, nor will we be perfect every time we execute the behavior we intend to change.It's okay. We are human. Making mistakes is how we learn and grow. Make space for that growth.Even if it is a few weeks into a new intention and it's feeling tenuous or there's been a slip, avoid the self-flagellation. Instead of getting down or giving up, turn it around and consider what adjustments can be made to revive the intention, pick it back up or start afresh and keep going. After all, there are 52 weeks in a year and we're just at the beginning.

45,5 Vital Lessons I Learned By Taking a Mini Break From the Entrepreneurship Grind,"Feb 1, 2024",Meghan Gaffney,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-lessons-i-learned-by-taking-a-mini-break-and-getting-away/468109,"
Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a retreat for successful female entrepreneurs. I had 100 reasons not to go.My company was onboarding a large client. Regulatory policies impacting our industry were being debated in Washington, DC. We just wrapped up a major trade show. Things were busy at home. I was tired. I didn't have time.As much as I wanted to decline, I went — and it was one of the best decisions I've made all year.



As founders and leaders, if we just keep our heads down and focus solely on getting tasks done, we miss critical opportunities for big thinking. The kind of thinking that leads to growth and transformation. The kind of thinking that can impact the trajectory of a young company. And to be honest, the kind of thinking that is necessary of leaders and founders and those of us responsible for the vision of our companies.Here's what I learned when I took the time to step away from the day-to-day for this retreat.Related: 5 Priceless Lessons For First-Time Entrepreneurs1. Lessons from outside your industry are invaluableAs startups, we are often able to bring an important outside perspective to the industries we operate in. We're disruptors who think differently and aren't constrained by legacy norms that can slow down innovation.But then we grow and there is a shift that happens. Instead of bringing the outside perspective, we sometimes find ourselves needing an outside perspective. That's why it's critical to spend time developing important relationships with peers outside of our sector.Other innovators will look at a problem (and solution) with fresh eyes and help ground us in the innovator role we built our company on. We can learn from the experiences they've had, even if we serve different industries.


And, when called upon, we should return the favor when peers from different industries come to us to help get them unstuck.2. Curiosity is contagious (and beneficial)At Veda, we have always strived to create a culture of curiosity — but in the day-to-day, it's sometimes challenging to stop and ask questions, listen to others and honestly just take time to learn.One of the gifts of the retreat I was on was that it reminded me how important learning is. Yes, I learned a lot while I was there, but more importantly, I learned how much I need to learn.Since returning, I've already doubled down on our culture of learning and have committed to regular lunch-and-learns in the office and ensuring that the whole team has time to experiment with new technologies — true learning for the sake of learning. I am confident it will be time well spent and the team and company will benefit as a result.

Open peer-to-peer exchange is especially important for female foundersFemale founders often face gender-based stereotypes and biases that can impact their entrepreneurial journey.Sometimes this manifests itself in our male counterparts responding to our ideas from a place of bias — maybe intentional, maybe not. But there is a filter through which our ideas are considered that can impact their adoption.The opportunity to engage with other female founders provides the opportunity to kick the tires on ideas that aren't seen through a gendered lens.


4. When your head's down, you miss what's on the horizonWhen we're not looking up, we end up simply iterating in the same space that we already occupy instead of opening up to broader, bigger thinking.My co-founder likes to say that those incremental ideas are simply ""putting more horses on the same wagon when what we need to build is a train."" We need to be thinking multiple steps ahead of where we are today and that comes from opening our minds and imagination to conceive of what's next.5. When you're too busy doing, you're not leadingAs founders, it's critical that we inspire confidence, build trust and foster collaboration. With teams, boards, investors and customers. To do that we need to take time for self-reflection and big thinking. This introspection contributes to the development of a strong, authentic leadership presence that resonates with colleagues, peers and other stakeholders.An effective leader recognizes strategic thinking isn't done for three days a year at an offsite leadership meeting. Strategic thinking is an ongoing process that we need to make time for throughout the year. This is as true for senior leaders of major corporations as it is for entrepreneurs eyeing their next fundraising round or bringing a product to market.

Taking time away for personal and professional development ensures that I remember to look up.

46,Breaking Out of the Matrix — How to Take Control of Your Life and Create a More Fulfilling Future,"Feb 1, 2024",DeAnna Spoerl,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-break-free-from-the-mundane-and-create-a-more/468365,"
Breaking out of the matrix sounds like fun, but what exactly is the matrix anyway? Maybe you've seen the film The Matrix (and if you haven't, I am judging you), and it felt a little too abstract or other-worldly to relate to. You can think of the matrix as a set group of things that affect the way situations develop. In our lives, we may hear the phrases, ""It's my lot in life"" or ""That's just the way it is"" to describe situations that we feel are out of our control. I know I've felt that way before — like the hand I was dealt is all I have to work with. But if you're familiar with the film, you'll recall that Neo, the protagonist and Chosen One, began to experience glitches, or moments of clarity and reality that were out of the norm.Don't get too excited; we won't be catching bullets mid-air any time soon. But I want to encourage you to consider the abnormalities in life and to embrace new paths for a more freeing future as an entrepreneur, business leader and — most importantly — as a human being.Related: 7 Steps to Living a Fulfilled Life



The mundaneThink for a moment about what your typical day looks like. Then a typical week. And finally, a typical month. Do you notice any patterns? Habits? Do you wear the same outfits like a cartoon character every day? Sometimes I feel like Wednesday Addams with the amount of black I wear. Do you drive the same route to work and stop at the same coffee shop? Do you end up having the same conversations and small talk with people you see regularly? Here's the point: When we aren't thinking too deeply about the things we do, we end up repeating them over and over again.As author and neuroscientist, Joe Dispenza explains, the same thoughts lead to the same actions, which lead to no new or significant changes. You don't have to think when you're in the matrix of life. In fact, the matrix doesn't want you to think. And that realization was the moment I knew I needed to make a change in my life. I didn't want the same things to keep happening. I wanted adventure and growth that would leave me fulfilled. So, I started looking for glitches in my daily life.


Get glitchedWhen I think of glitches, I used to associate them with something going wrong or awry. ""My car engine isn't working, it's glitching."" ""My laptop is glitchy."" Or, a regular for me when I stumble over my words: ""My mouth is glitching."" But ever since I've opened my mind to abnormal experiences, I view glitches simply as little moments that seem odd or curious and need attention.For example, if a stranger strikes up a conversation with me about a recent book or author I've just started reading (true story), that feels like a glitch in the matrix. Something broke through in that moment and connected us in a strange way. Another time, I was cleaning out an old wallet and found a Health Savings Account (HSA) debit card from two jobs ago, and I happened to log into my account — surprised it was still active — and discovered hundreds of dollars just sitting there. Thirty minutes later (remember, this is also a true story), I got a call from a medical provider whose first question was, ""Do you have an HSA account that can cover this expense?"" Glitch? Well, some might call it synchronicity or luck or divine intervention.But it's moments like these that are out of the ordinary and indicate, at least to me, that there's been a breakthrough. The key to these experiences is to ride with them. Embrace them. Don't shrug them off as weird instances (but they are weird, I 100% agree). This is where the magic happens.Related: Embrace the Unknown to Transform Your Life


Not the Magic Kingdom, but still magicalLet's take a moment to pause here. You don't have to believe in magic. Or miracles. Or anything in the realm of the intangible. But if we want to see an undeniable change in our lives, a ""quantum flip"" if you will, we must be open to the mystery of the magical. These are the stories we love to read about: the person who faced multiple tragedies and later became a world-famous movie star. Or the child who suffered unbelievable trauma and became a multi-billionaire by helping others (Keanu Reeves and Oprah Winfrey, respectively, in case you were wondering).Perhaps in your personal life, you've witnessed a loved one turn their circumstances around to experience a fulfilling, exciting life. We may ask how it happens. Well, it happens in those moments of fear, anxiousness and hesitation. It happens in those moments when you just go for it. When you take a wrong turn or when you pick a new coffee shop, unafraid of doing something different, and you allow whatever is around the corner to happen. Life is waiting for you to shake it up.Be freedThese moments are small, seemingly insignificant decisions that could totally free you from the matrix. In my life, I've experienced quantum flip moments many, many times. One in particular was when I made the tough decision to quit a fairly stable but problematic job. The decision was made without a backup plan, and it put my family in a one-income situation that scared me. Within two weeks, however, my lost income was more than made up for with the small business my husband and I operated.I took a leap, and it liberated me. I felt freed. I felt a trust within myself I had never felt before. And that trust is really a major point in this piece of written content. I want whoever is reading this to be freed. Freed from the stress of your high-paying but miserable managerial position. Freed from the burdens of financial forecasting or debt you're taking on as an entrepreneur. Freed from the fear of what to do next or of not doing anything at all and becoming complacent.


Related: How to Get Your Conscious Mind in the Driver's Seat and Create Control in Your LifeWhatever being freed from the matrix means for you, whatever your desire is, I hope with all my heart you find your freedom. It starts small, so small. But believe me, however small you think your start is, the payoff is huge. Switch things up. Take a new route to work tomorrow. Wear your hair differently. Say hello to a stranger. Quit your job and hop on a plane. This life we live is full of surprise and mystery, and the best part is that it isn't only for a select few. It's for us all. And if your ""lot in life"" sucks, pick a new lot. We only have one life to live. Don't you want control over yours?

1. Build meaningful relationshipsAt the heart of a fulfilling life lie relationships that nurture and empower. Cultivate connections that enrich your life and the lives of those around you. Invest time in deepening friendships, strengthening family bonds and fostering professional networks. Meaningful relationships provide support, guidance and a sense of belonging that contributes significantly to personal growth and happiness.Start by listing specific key relationships you currently have and new ones you want to create this year. Identify how you can set up regular communication or meetings with these key individuals and/or seek opportunities for collaborative projects. Whether it is a personal or professional relationship, acknowledge why this is important to you and how you plan to make it happen.

Embrace challenges as opportunities to expand your skills and knowledge. By understanding different perspectives and continuously evolving, you equip yourself to navigate life's complexities more effectively.Make a list of your key personal and professional interests and passions and how you can learn more about these. Analyze your strengths and areas for personal and professional growth, and then seek opportunities for improvement in both these areas. When it comes to personal or professional projects/goals, develop a plan for your most significant personal project, break each process down into actionable steps, assign tasks and deadlines, monitor progress, and adjust strategies as needed.3. Implement the right strategiesCrafting a successful year involves strategic planning and execution. Define your goals clearly, and outline actionable steps to achieve them.

One should always keep in mind how they want to model leadership behavior and the people with whom they want to include in their shared vision.


5. Excel in every wayStrive for holistic excellence in every facet of your life. Balance is key. Aim for excellence in your career, health, relationships, personal development and leisure.

The world moves fast. Thomas Tull wants founders to move faster.That's why, when he invests in a startup, he gives them this advice: ""Prepare for velocity."" In other words, make sure you're ready to grow quickly and pivot at a moment's notice.Tull has taken that advice himself. His career has run on fast growth — from when he ran a chain of laundromats after college, to later founding the film studio Legendary Entertainment (which made massive hits including The Dark Knight trilogy and The Hangover series). That work, along with finding success as a tech and VC investor, made him a billionaire. After leaving Legendary in 2017, he continued his investing career — starting Tulco, and supporting Pinterest, FIGS, and Oculus Rift — as well as the United States Innovative Technology Fund, which invests in companies like Sandbox AQ. He's also part-owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New York Yankees.

Aditi and Ankur Daga had a daring idea for the jewelry industry: to own the online market for colored gemstones. Yes, De Beers had sold the culture on ""a diamond is forever"" since 1947, but by 2005, the Dagas felt people were ready for a change.They weren't so sure, however, about investors. They worried VCs wouldn't appreciate the rainbow; they'd just want high sales and immediate returns. So the Dagas shelved their vision, and launched a business that mostly sold diamonds, called Angara.They'd married and studied as grad students at Harvard, both from families in the jewelry space in India, and thought they understood the market. But the competition was stiff. They didn't get the revenue to attract investors. It took almost going bankrupt for them to learn how to build Angara into a company with 500-plus employees, 10 offices around the world, and annual revenue of $100 million.

53,5 Reasons to Consider Franchising When Changing Careers,"Jan 16, 2024",Ray Titus,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/5-reasons-to-consider-franchising-when-changing-careers/468096,"
It's not hard to tell when an employee is ready for a job change. When I see people who are so bored with their jobs that they're just going through the motions or so unhappy that they start complaining, making negative comments and getting snippy with everyone, I know it's time for them to go.If that sounds like you, but you don't want to land in another version of the same unfulfilling situation, it could be time to promote yourself from employee to boss as the owner of your own business — and franchising may be the perfect choice for someone with drive and ambition but not necessarily the experience of entrepreneurship.At United Franchise Group (UFG), we have about 1,600 franchisees in almost 60 countries, and most of them have transitioned from another career; many can do so without having worked in the industry they're investing in.



So, here are five reasons to make your next career a franchise:Related: How To Know If Franchising Is Right For You


1. You know it worksIt's a fresh start in a proven business model, with an attractive balance of risk and reward. When you purchase a franchise, you get a company whose products and processes have been tested and perfected in the real world, with real customers and employees. Plus, you get the priceless strength of representing an already established brand that's recognized and trusted.2. You get invaluable training and supportUnlike starting an independent business from scratch, joining a franchise gives you training, set-up assistance and support, including shared resources like cooperative advertising and mass purchasing. At UFG, we also provide help finding a location, negotiating a lease, building out a floor plan and many other tasks, with ongoing support as long as the franchisee is with us. We even have a mentor program in place that fosters a relationship between experienced, successful business owners and new owners. We believe an established mentoring program is one of the most valuable things a company can do.Thanks to programs like these, you can open your business with a high comfort level, so you're free to focus on building and growing your business rather than working on so many tasks that it takes time away from growth.Related: Which Franchise is Right For You? Follow These Steps


3. There's a franchise to fit almost anyoneCompanies in almost every industry are available as franchises, and you're likely to find one that suits your personality, skills and goals.In my experience, all personalities work in franchising except the ""know-it-all"" who refuses to follow established procedures (and their maverick style doesn't work in many companies, franchise or not). Following the system is necessary, so if your ego won't allow you to learn from others, a franchise is not right for you.4. No experience is necessaryAt our franchise brands, our training and support systems mean you don't have to come from the industry you're investing in. Sometimes, lack of experience can be a benefit; you're not bringing old habits that might go against your franchisor's procedures.You really need to like the business, however, and especially what that business can do for (or to) your lifestyle. I also suggest that you choose a business you like or have some affinity for. If you can't tell a monkey wrench from monkey bread, an auto repair franchise is probably not for you. Look for a company where you can utilize your strengths in sales, marketing, communications or technology.


Before making a final decision, research the industry. Meet the franchisor and the team to get a gut feeling about it all, and then visit other owners. Visit their competitors, too, and speak to professionals in the business before making a final decision.5. Franchisees still have controlWhile corporate leadership does dictate that certain procedures be followed, the franchisee still has a lot of freedom and flexibility in managing their business. Every team should include management, marketing, sales, production and technology, but the way those teams are utilized is up to the franchisee. At UFG, we get our best ideas from our franchisees, so it's critical to give them the freedom to make decisions while balancing them with our successful systems.Related: 7 Tips for Aspiring Franchisees from Top FranchisorsAll businesses ramp up differently depending on sales and expenses, but the typical time frame is six to eighteen months. That first year or so is always the toughest for any kind of business, as you are learning a new industry, hiring all new staff and finding your way. A franchise has many of the same challenges, but with resources to make the experience a little less overwhelming. As owner, you have a manual to refer back to at any time, and you can always rely on corporate leaders and fellow franchisees to have your back.


Franchising gives you all the benefits of big business with the freedom of being a local owner. If you're considering taking a leap from your current job, you can count on a safety net to help you make a softer landing.

58,Reach New Levels of Productivity By Treating Your Personal Life Like a Work Project,"Dec 11, 2023",Nickie Rowley,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-project-manage-your-personal-life/465179,"
If you audit time in terms of what you said you'd accomplish versus what you actually did, it's not uncommon to see deltas like, ""I only completed to my satisfaction 20% of what was needed: 70% got pushed to the next week, and 10% wasn't done well."" Normally at a corporate job, this level of productivity is a recipe for unemployment, but when it comes to personal lives, we tend to extend ourselves so much grace that it can border on self-sabotage.Why? Well, because we can. There's simply less accountability within a personal space not governed by a passion to be more effective and efficient with time (efficacy here essentially means ""I'm getting it done,"" while efficiency translates to ""I'm getting things done faster and better""). And the only way someone can ever truly embrace both is by leveraging the tools and systems connected to how we operate on a granular level. This is what good project management does.Define objectives and create deliverablesThe first step in applying better management to your personal life is to clearly define objectives. This includes breaking them down into smaller deliverables and defining the time needed to achieve each one. Say you need to clean out the garage: Instead of saying, ""This is a goal, and I'll do it this Saturday,"" a better mechanism might be detailing that ""Garage section 1 will take 40 minutes, and section 2 will take 50 minutes."" You've broken tasks down, assigned a duration to each, and can now monitor whether it took less or more time than anticipated.



Related: Why Inner-Mastery is the Key to Self-GrowthI've found that the two most important things about setting objectives are:


Ensuring what needs to be done is detailed, as lack of information leaves room for ambiguity. In other words, make sure goals have a defined scope.Emphasize measurement: that dates, durations and progress can be attached to the objective.PrioritizationAmong the most challenging parts of project management is beating the ""I know what to do, there's just not enough time to do it all"" syndrome. Such a phrase is a common indicator of an overwhelmed calendar and a lack of prioritization. Suppose deliverables are schedule-arranged according to the level of importance. In that case, there will be a strategy for choosing immediacy or delay and a schema to dictate later calendar development.One organizing method I apply is the ""P1 to P5"" scale:P1 (Critical): Anything that needs to be addressed immediatelyP2 (High priority): Important but not time-sensitiveP3 (Neutral): No immediate deadline, but it still needs to be addressedP4 (Low priority): Should be completed when there's timeP5 (Unknown): No estimated or outlined deadlineRelated: How Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Project ManagersSchedule curationCreating a comprehensive timetable can be tedious, partly because of shifting priorities attached to deliverables, taking longer than expected, forgetting pre-requisites (what needs to be completed first) and the inevitable fact that people won't always adhere to what we forecasted for their time. Investing in a project management scheduling tool for personal matters is great, as it introduces automation to help recalibrate these many variables. This is not to say that manual intervention will not be required on occasion; it is just that more detail will be captured and better managed over time.


A few tools to consider are Wrike, Asana, Trello, Monday.com and Smartsheet — their principal assets include:Ease of schedule updating, as it lives in the cloud and can be categorized by master or sub-schedules, allowing for both high- and low-level granularity.Quantitative assessments can be made to show, for example, how many tasks were planned versus accomplished, along with time overruns and scheduling delays.Resource tracking can help hold people accountable for completed tasks.Incorporating the often overlooked, such as potential risks, will make it easier to create contingency plans.Connectivity to existing schedules on Google or Outlook Calendars to provide additional visibility.Related: 5 Best Project Management Tools of 2023The payoffsAny capable project manager makes it a point to document rigorously, including lessons learned, and the same should apply to ways personal lives are organized. This may seem at first like a needless expenditure of effort, but consider the business corollary: If you were late on deliverables 25% of the time or if high-priority items were not being handled well, the effects would be dramatic. Putting better systems in place requires consistency, discipline and focus. Still, you'll find that practice quickly becomes a habit — that what once seemed fussy translates into real-life improvement and better results in all of its aspects.

59,How to Strategically Preserve and Evolve Workplace Culture Amidst Change Management,"Dec 5, 2023",David Eaton,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-preserve-and-evolve-workplace-culture-amidst-change/465952,"
Many organizations have become attuned to the need for formalized change management, which helps support enterprises facing inflection points, such as restructurings, mergers, divestitures and changes in ownership. Such companies often engage experts who redefine and redeploy organizational models and business processes to smooth the required transitions and maximize the value of significant strategic and/or tactical changes.Unfortunately, most practitioners don't usually consider workplace culture's impact on change management success. This fundamentally limits the work's potential as the cultural norms that pervade every workplace can significantly inhibit needed change management initiatives.Related: How to Better Manage Corporate Culture During Times of Transition



A change management primerChange management is built around the idea that people and organizations require help adapting to new approaches, models and technologies as required by triggering events. The field is based on our modern-day understanding that C-suites can't simply decide to make a significant adjustment and expect their employees to just follow along.To provide the help that organizations need, change management practitioners design systematic approaches for dealing with necessary transitions or transformations. They create formalized processes for planning, testing, communicating, scheduling and — ultimately — implementing the necessary changes. They also document the processes and evaluate their short-term effects.


While intended to be comprehensive, these approaches often bypass any assessments, analyses or planning tied to how changes underway might be perceived as threatening or run counter to existing workplace norms. Failure to bridge this gap can result in ineffective change management and, bigger picture, diminish morale and productivity, and drive turnover.What happens when change management neglects cultureAs an example, consider a behavioral health provider that has accepted investment from a private equity sponsor and is implementing a change management process to help drive the adjustments required to enhance the value of the organization. Like many mission-driven organizations, the provider is staffed by service-minded individuals whose first priorities revolve around providing care.Upon learning of the transformation underway, the team members begin to feel an immediate sense of unease. They've heard that private equity prioritizes profits over patients and see the advancing changes as validating their perceptions. They read memos full of business phrases that reinforce the feeling that the organization has embarked on a very different direction. Ongoing requests by change management consultants make it more challenging for them to meet the needs of their patients.Ultimately, the most experienced, respected team members decide the best thing to do is leave.Related: 3 Keys to Successful Change ManagementAvoiding cultural pitfalls in change managementAs an essential, early and repeated element of any change management effort, organizational leaders would be wise to first clarify the intentions behind the transformation — an indication of their cultural objectives. For the behavioral health provider, it could be that the infusion of capital will allow them to serve more patients as part of their mission-driven ethos. It could also be that the organization is evolving its mission, a potential challenge for its people that experts can help mitigate — for example, providing team members with alternative ways of ""living their values.""Such exercises should inform a cadence of professional communications to employees capturing leaders' thinking, making it relevant to individual employee groups. The goal is to bring team members along on the transformation journey, helping them embrace not just the changes but the potential accompanying cultural shifts.Maximizing communications by tapping into essential human needsGiven the vital importance of these communications, it's vital that leaders have a full grasp of not just the strategy behind them, but also the essential human needs that their people will experience as they internalize the change and process them within the workplace's cultural context. This will help inform the tone required in written communications and all near-term interactions.


Such needs include:Information: Details about the changes underway will allow people to process and personalize the transformation, considering how it might impact them. Such information should include leaders' insights on the ""why"" behind the changes underway as well as recommendations on how to work through them and what to do once the initiative is complete.Empathy: Imagining or trying to deeply understand what it's like to experience organizational change from the employee's perspective will help leaders grasp its inherent challenges and best overcome them. They would be wise to publicly acknowledge the difficulty of such changes even as they cast a vision for the future.Ideas: Throughout an organization's change management journey, leaders should provide employees with ideas for how to ""digest"" the change underway, helping them understand what is expected of them and when. This clarification will serve as guideposts for individuals and teams who might be feeling adrift.Time: Just as leaders took time to consider the change in question before they adopted it, people need time to wrestle, question, process and get aligned with the change being thrust upon them. Those who are given this room to ""catch up"" with leadership will be most responsive to change management.Related: 3 Key Steps to Becoming an Effective Change LeaderThe savviest organizations go a step beyond professional communications. They evaluate and map out the existing and potential future culture, designing and implementing work streams that facilitate a transition from one culture to another and ""pull"" new cultural elements through every facet of the company.When handled in this thoughtful, intentional manner, organizational cultures no longer impede but serve to accelerate change management and drive results across enterprises.

60,How Stay-at-Home Moms Can Reignite Their Career and Re-enter the Workforce,"Dec 4, 2023",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-stay-at-home-moms-can-reignite-their-career-and/464732,"
When I had my first child, I had a difficult decision to make: Do I stay home with my child, or do I put them in daycare while I work? Staying home sounded nice, but my family needed the income from both myself and my husband — especially with a newborn on the way. However, missing some of those crucial first moments with my child made me incredibly sad. What if I missed their first steps or their first words?With the support of my loving husband, I decided to make my own way and work from home while raising a child. It was not easy, but I was determined to make it work. We made many sacrifices, but I count them all worth it. But unfortunately, many other women choose to step away from the workforce completely, not knowing what options are available.Once the kids are grown and able to take care of themselves, that leaves many women wanting to return to their careers. A great way to do this is through a returnship — something that was not an option when I had my first child.



Related: On Momternships: Do Working Moms Really Need to Start From Scratch?Understanding what a returnship isA returnship is a unique opportunity designed for individuals who have taken a break from their careers and are looking to re-enter the workforce. It combines aspects of an internship and a full-time job, offering valuable work experience and a chance to update skills in a supportive environment. Unlike traditional internships, returnships are tailored for professionals with prior experience, allowing them to showcase their talents and bridge the gap in their resumes.


A returnship is for anyone who took a career break, but this arrangement can be particularly beneficial for busy moms who have taken time off to raise their children and are now ready to jump back into their careers. You can showcase all your previous experience, but you can also showcase what you've learned from being a mom which can include prioritizing, meeting deadlines and staying organized.The pros and cons of a returnship for working mothersReturnships can offer many benefits for working mothers looking to re-enter the workforce. On the positive side, a returnship provides a structured and supportive environment to refresh and update skills that may have been dormant during a career break. It allows moms to gain relevant work experience, build new connections and showcase their talents to potential employers.Returnships also offer a chance to ease back into the professional world, providing a smoother transition from being a stay-at-home mom to a working professional. However, there can be downsides, too. Returnships may come with lower pay or limited opportunities for career advancement compared to regular positions; remember, at the end of the day, these are essentially internships and are treated as such. However, they provide a wonderful way for you to dip your toe back into the workforce, so to speak.Related: Make Yours a Mom-friendly Business


Preparing yourself for a successful returnshipReturning to the workforce after a career break can be both exciting and daunting, especially for busy moms. To ensure a successful returnship experience, it's important to take some steps to prepare yourself. Working exclusively with moms, I can offer a few key words of advice if you are preparing to apply for a returnship.First, update your skills and knowledge by enrolling in relevant courses or workshops. Take advantage of online resources and professional development opportunities to stay current in your industry. I understand that you may have a tight budget — there are many great resources online that are free through big names you already know about like YouTube and LinkedIn. Find what works best for you on your schedule.Next, revamp your résumé and online presence to highlight your experience and skills. Tailor your résumé to fit the requirements of the returnship program or position you're interested in; this needs to be done for each position for which you apply. For example, if you apply for a marketing position, highlight relevant skills such as meeting deadlines. Then if you also apply for an accounting position, highlight skills such as attention to detail.It never hurts to research the company offering the job and include some information in your application materials about them — this shows you are serious and spent time finding more details about the business. Additionally, in the age of social media, many companies will check your socials during the interview process. Take some time to update them and look at them through a professional lens.

You can find some of the most popular questions online with a quick search. Ask a family member or friend for help and have them stand in as the interviewer so you can practice with a real person. Remember to maintain eye contact. Be truthful about your experience; it is okay if you do not know the answer to a question! Just let the interviewer know you are not sure, but bring the question back to your relevant skills for the position.If you are a busy mom looking to transition back into the workforce, then a returnship can be the perfect solution for you. They allow you to gain relevant skills, polish up some old ones and get you on the path back to a full-time career.

63,From Passive to Resilient — These 7 Strategies Will Empower Your Team to Thrive Through Change,"Nov 29, 2023",Murali Nethi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-ways-to-empower-your-team-to-thrive-through-change/465267,"
Change is hard. Yet change is also necessary for organizations to adapt, evolve and stay relevant in today's dynamic world. However, change that is not managed effectively often leads to employee resistance. This resistance can sabotage even the best-intended transformations.To successfully implement organizational change, leaders must utilize sound change management strategies. Change management is guiding an organization through transitioning from its current state to its desired future state. It involves preparing employees for changes, equipping them to adopt changes, and sustaining momentum to ensure they stick.Let's explore some key change management strategies that can help organizations navigate transformations smoothly and minimize resistance from employees.Related: Change Is a Team Sport — So Every Player Needs to Own It. Here's How to Get Everyone Involved.1. Communicate the need for changeOne of the biggest reasons change initiatives fail is a lack of open and frequent communication. Employees want - and need - to understand why change is happening, what will be changing, and how it will impact them. They also want their concerns to be heard. As such, over-communicating is crucial during times of transition.



Schedule regular updates to provide clarity and reassurance. Be transparent about both the challenges as well as opportunities change presents. Answer questions promptly and clearly. Communicate using multiple channels - email, one-on-ones, town halls, Yammer, etc. And encourage two-way dialogue so you can address issues as they arise. Consistent communication will help reduce uncertainty and build trust that you have employees' best interests in mind.Related: How to Harness the Power of Change in Entrepreneurship2. Involve employees in the processPeople are much more willing to accept change when they feel they have a role in shaping it. Whenever possible, involve employees in envisioning and planning for change. Solicit feedback on proposed changes through surveys. Create cross-functional task forces to tackle issues and generate new ideas. You can also run pilot programs to test solutions before full implementation.You can develop more creative and practical solutions by including employee perspectives and expertise. You'll also gain buy-in since staff had a hand in the process. Just provide regular updates on how their input was incorporated or why certain suggestions couldn't be adopted.


Related: How To Create a Work Culture Where Everyone Has A Voice3. Provide support and trainingChange requires adaptability that doesn't come naturally or easily for many. Supporting employees through the transition professionally and personally will go a long way toward smoother change adoption.Offer dynamic, robust training and development opportunities to build new skills. Provide coaching or mentoring programs. Create flexible, temporary roles for those struggling so talent isn't lost. Make EAP (employee assistance programs) accessible for those needing additional support. Check in frequently through one-on-ones to address concerns promptly. Recognize efforts openly with appreciation to boost morale.Caring, holistic support demonstrates that you value staff and want them to thrive - not just cope - through change. It fosters resilience and makes people more open to what may initially feel threatening or undesirable.


4. Leverage early adoptersWhile change can be difficult for the majority, there will always be a subset of 'early adopters' who readily embrace new ideas. Identify and engage this influential group from the get-go to help advocate for and model change behaviors.Ask early adopters to actively participate in task forces or lead training sessions. Highlight their achievements and successes to showcase incentives for adopting change. Encourage them to serve as mentors and support systems for others struggling more. Provide a forum like Yammer where they can discuss benefits and troubleshoot together.Tap into early adopters' contagious enthusiasm and expertise to ease others into changes at their own pace. Their buy-in gives social proof that change can be a good thing well worth adopting.5. Align incentives and accountabilityFor change initiatives to be sustainable long-term, they need clear ties to organizational goals that people are measured and incentivized against. Connect change milestones to individual performance reviews and compensation metrics or evolve role responsibilities to drive new priorities.


Be sure goals are specific, measurable, and have reasonable timelines. Try tracking progress publicly to signal strategic focus and importance. Highlight role models who embody the evolving culture through reward and recognition programs. Address poorly aligned behaviors promptly with guidance and coaching before escalating to discipline.6. Be patient and celebrate successesCultural change takes intentional effort sustained over months or even years. Expect some missteps and pushback as people grapple with adjusting to new paradigms and letting go of habits they're used to. Accept that change won't happen everywhere uniformly or on the same timeline for all.Rather than punish what's not going perfectly right away, focus on praising even small accomplishments and steps in the desired direction. Frequently mark milestones achieved and share qualitative or quantitative results transparently across teams. Recognize that people want to feel successful and appreciated, not just chastised for falling short.Gradual, sustained progress sustained by celebration builds momentum and affirmatively shapes new norms, which is the ultimate goal of any organizational change initiative.


7. Lead from the frontAbove all, leaders must authentically role model change themselves. People will watch to see if new behaviors are genuinely endorsed from the top or just nice ideas imposed on others. Live an organization's evolving values in your own actions, decisions and communications and continually develop skills the change demands.Related: A True Leader Doesn't Just Talk the Talk — They Walk the Walk. Here's How to Lead from the Front.The conclusionUltimately, transformational change depends on leaders wholeheartedly embracing evolution both professionally and personally. Walking the talk consistently signals strategic importance and brings others along on the journey. With the right strategies and steadfast leadership, organizational change can empower continuous improvement.If your retail organization wants to update your point-of-sale (POS) system to meet the needs of today's customers better and drive future growth, consider implementing Hana Retail as your solution.

65,"She Wrote An 'Escape Plan' to Quit Her Job and Move to an Island. Now She's There Generating Nearly $300,000 A Year","Nov 27, 2023",Jason Feifer,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/she-wrote-an-escape-plan-to-quit-her-job-and-move-to-an/465839,"
In 2007, Marla Bainbridge Martinez went on a vacation that changed her life.She visited Isla Mujeres, a five-mile-long Mexican island off the coast of Cancun, and fell in love with it. She returned for regular visits, meeting other Americans who had moved there, and started thinking: ""They get to live there. Why not me?"" The answer was work — she was a consultant at a technology firm, and couldn't just quit and move to an island.To make this big change in her life, she needed a plan. So she wrote one: She called it The Escape Plan — ""my detailed, step-by-step plan on how I would quit my job and move to a Caribbean island,"" she says.



In November 2023, that plan was completed. She operates a business called OIE On Isla Experiences, which is an umbrella for multiple income streams that drive nearly $300,000 in annual revenue. She books vacation rentals, offers concierge services for tourists, provides a private chef for people in vacation rentals, operates a small cantina, makes island-related merchandise, and designs websites for local homeowners.(Full disclosure: I met Bainbridge inside SPI, a community for business owners where many experts, including me, offer advice and mentorship.)So, what was in that Escape Plan? Here, she breaks it down.Writing The Escape PlanBainbridge has a background in education and curriculum development — which is to say, she knows how to plan. ""I started with the end in mind and worked backwards,"" she says. ""I mapped it out by month with monthly milestone-like goals.""In a Google Doc, she outlined the three categories that mattered most:1. Financial. She took stock of what she has, what she owes, and what kind of budget she'd need to live on. She called it ""Operation Debt Reduction.""


2. Network. She listed out her most important contacts, along with how they might help her during this moment of transition. Did any of them have work she could pick up, for example? ""I was able to pick up side hustles until I could get my finger on the pulse of what was needed on the island,"" she says.3. Action: She listed the actions required to quit her job and move to an island. That included selling her house, her car, many of her belongings, putting other things in storage, and so on. ""Each action was a stepping stone towards reaching the goal,"" she says.What Happens After 'The Escape'Bainbridge wanted to escape — but of course, her plan had to extend beyond that. Once she moved to the island in 2010, she needed to earn a living there. But how?During her first year on Isla Mujeres, she looked around for problems to solve. ""There was a need for marketing local businesses to help them stay competitive,"" she says. ""I began filling that need, building websites for businesses and enhancing their online presence on the internet and social media.""


Related: This Salesman Was Unimpressed with a Local Pizzeria, So He Bought It — and Then Built A $20 Million Restaurant BusinessThat work led to new connections and opportunities. For example, she started building websites for people who own vacation property rentals. One client needed more help — not just in building a site, but in driving business to it. Bainbridge stepped up and ultimately took over the site, which she's grown from 10 to 100 vacation rental listings.At each step, she'd repeat her process: She'd do good work, then explore what other needs people had. That helped her enter adjacent spaces, such as the concierge and private chef services for tourists.Her Island Life TodayBainbridge has been living her Caribbean dream since 2010, and now loves helping entrepreneurs escape to their own fantasies. She says the foundations are simple: If you want to build a life you love, you need to plan for it, draw support from your community, and take real action.


""My story is not only about my journey,"" she says. ""It's an invitation for other entrepreneurs to embark on a similar path toward being brave to take risks, achieve growth and refocus to build the live they want to live instead of one that they stumbled onto. It's being intentional and focused about that journey.""

66,Expensive Pain: The Untapped Social Capital for Entrepreneurs,"Nov 16, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/expensive-pain-the-untapped-social-capital-for/459728,"
Do you have expensive pain? Here's how to find out.When was the last time you shared something personal with your audience, even if it felt a bit uncomfortable?And I understand why you may be hesitant to do so, especially when those personal stories involve painful moments. But what if there was a price to pay for holding this information back?



I call it Expensive Pain. But, why is it expensive?Because people give you opportunities when they feel connected to you, and shared pain brings people together.


This isn't just my opinion. A study from the Association for Psychological Science concluded that ""despite its unpleasantness, pain may actually have positive social consequences, acting as a sort of 'social glue' that fosters cohesion and solidarity within groups.""So if you're trying to grow your business, your network or just from stronger connections with those around you, that ""social glue"" is crucial to attracting the right opportunities.What opportunities could you be missing out on? I'll share a few examples from my own experience. But first, I'll need to tell you about my most painful story.My son, Terry Junior (TJ) died on May 29th 2017. I'll go into details at a later time.


But as you can imagine this tragedy has had a profound impact on my life, and many people don't know about it. Reason being, I didn't talk about it publicly until June of this year while speaking on stage at a ConvertKit conference.Based on my recent experience, here's what expensive pain can cost you and the rewards that come from being more transparent.It can cost you relationshipsAfter talking about my son on stage I was immediately flooded by attendees who had their own experiences with losing someone they cared deeply about.They expressed gratitude and, in many cases, were overjoyed by my willingness to connect with them on a human level.


But a specific conversation stood out to me among all others. One of the attendees let me know their friend recently lost a son and was burying him the same day as the event.He shared my story with her that morning and focused on how I used the pain of losing my son as a catalyst, encouraging me to help other people as a way of honoring his legacy.This gave her comfort during a difficult time. And I can't ignore the coincidence here, her son is also named TJ.Sharing my pain allowed me to create a stronger relationship with those in the audience and help people I'll never even meet.


It can cost you moneyRemember, people give you opportunities when they feel connected to you. I'll explain why this is so important for your business in a moment but I'll share another story first.Audience feedback is incredibly valuable so I always encourage people to fill out a survey after my keynotes. One of those questions is ""Do you know of other event organizers who may be interested in featuring me as a speaker?""Sometimes I get one or two responses, sometimes I don't get any. After speaking at ConvertKit I got five solid referrals, one of which is moving forward rather quickly.So what changed? This was the first time I talked about my son on stage and that made me stand out even more as a speaker.The truth hurts but keep this in mind; being an expert at your craft is a prerequisite. It's not enough to make you stand out among the crowd.Your personal brand is your only real unique differentiator. It's the key to making connections and unlocking opportunities.You can't have a personal brand without telling personal stories.What stories can you tell that will build your brand?


A valuable lesson you learned, perhaps the hard wayStruggles you've overcome, and how they made you a better personHow you juggle your personal and professional life, even if it's not always perfectYour stories will always be your best marketing channel, so don't limit your income by staying quiet. Related: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Crafting a Successful FutureIt can cost you your identityConvertKit has a series of books and videos called ""I Am a Creator"" that features inspiring stories from creators.I was able to share my background in Volume 3 of the series and, if you've been following me for a while, you've probably heard most of it.I worked at Adobe and FacebookThen I started my own businessNow I write for Entrepreneur magazine, speak on stages and have a podcastThen I went into the same story that so many other experts share. You know you've heard it before.""I struggled to get my business off the ground, I finally found something that worked, now I'm sharing it with the world so you can learn from my mistakes and succeed more quickly""Still awake? Congratulations if you are, because that story has already been told thousands of times. It's predictable, boring and impersonal.In my case it also leaves out one of the most important parts of my life, my kid died.And once you know that about me you can better understand not just what I've done, but who I am as well. You'll understand my identity.Before we move forward, let's unpack the meaning of identity. Psychology Today states ""Identity encompasses the memories, experiences, relationships, and values that create one's sense of self.""So why is knowing - and expressing - your identity so important?Here's one more citation for you from Frontiers in Psychology.""Researchers find that entrepreneurs' identity has a significant influence on entrepreneurs' individual characteristics, such as passion, persistence, and self-efficacy. Evidence also shows that identity can influence entrepreneurs' psychological status such as well-being. O'Neil et al. (2020) suggested that if entrepreneurs are not able to assure their own identity, it would harm their well-being.""In short, getting clear on your identity can help you perform better while also maintaining your mental health.You'll also be better understood by those you interact with. This is crucial when the impact of those painful moments requires you to take a mental break.Beyond that, it can lead to more meaningful connections and partnerships.And speaking of partnerships, I reached out to ConvertKit for another chance to share my story, the full story that includes my son TJ.They immediately agreed and we spent the last several weeks producing a video documentary about my life. The footage captured includes me working at my office, playing with my kids, exercising at the gym and visiting my son's grave.To be honest, I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable about sharing such a private moment. But that's how I know I'm on the right track. I don't have a desire to be comfortable, I just want to help people overcome setbacks, embrace opportunities and perform at their highest level.


This is part of my identity and I avoid expensive pain by taking actions that are aligned with my identity.And when you're ready, I know you can help a lot of people - including yourself - by sharing your full story and taking these actions as well.Next StepsIf you'd like to hear more about my journey, including the impact of losing my son, you can view the keynote I delivered at ConvertKit on my YouTube channel.

67,How to Harness the Power of Change in Entrepreneurship,"Nov 14, 2023",Henri Al Helaly,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-harness-the-power-of-change-in-entrepreneurship/464117,"
Change is an undeniable constant in the world of entrepreneurship. As founders, business owners and professionals in the entrepreneurial landscape, we often encounter individuals who change over time, and it's not always for the better. This transformation can manifest in various ways, including deceit, manipulation or even addiction.In this article, we will explore the importance of recognizing these shifts in our entrepreneurial relationships and explore strategies for navigating them with awareness, all while drawing upon my own experiences in the entrepreneurial world.Related: 4 Ways Leaders Can Navigate Change and Find the Hidden Opportunities



Understanding the dynamics of change in entrepreneurshipIn my journey as an entrepreneur, I've understood that the relationships we build play a pivotal role in our business growth and development. However, it's essential to recognize that people can change, and not all changes are positive. Just as Dr. John M. Grohol, CEO and founder of Psych Central, emphasizes the significance of this awareness in personal relationships, the same holds true in the entrepreneurial context: ""Recognizing changes in the behavior and character of individuals in your professional life is the first step to maintaining healthy business relationships.""One common change I've encountered is the erosion of trust due to dishonesty and deceit. A study found that trust is a critical component of strong business relationships. When trust is compromised by lies or manipulation within the entrepreneurial world, it can lead to feelings of betrayal and hurt, ultimately challenging the foundation of a business partnership.


Embracing change through self-awareness in entrepreneurshipTo effectively navigate these changes within the entrepreneurial realm, I've found that it's crucial to begin with self-awareness. Understanding my own values, boundaries and red flags has been the foundation for recognizing when someone's behavior no longer aligns with those values.My values have served as a compass, guiding me through the complexities of entrepreneurial interactions. I become better equipped to identify deviations from those principles when I understand what I stand for and expect from a business relationship. This self-awareness is empowering and protective, helping me make informed decisions in my entrepreneurial journey.Related: 7 Ways to Stay Resilient in Uncertain TimesThe power of effective communication in entrepreneurshipOpen and honest communication has been the bridge that has helped mend business relationships strained by a change in my entrepreneurial experience. I've seen firsthand how it plays a pivotal role in entrepreneurship.


Engaging in candid conversations with the individuals involved has provided opportunities to express concerns, share feelings and seek understanding within my entrepreneurial ventures. It's essential to note that sometimes, individuals may be unaware of how their actions affect the business. By initiating a dialogue, I've been able to shed light on the impact of their behavior and potentially inspire positive changes in our entrepreneurial collaborations.Related: Why Embracing Change is the Best Catalyst for GrowthSetting and reinforcing boundaries in entrepreneurshipEstablishing clear boundaries is another crucial aspect of navigating changing relationships within entrepreneurship. Boundaries are not meant to isolate or exclude; they are guidelines for how I want to be treated within a business relationship.When I communicate my boundaries assertively and consistently, I establish a framework for mutual respect in my business partnerships. It's crucial not to be afraid to reinforce these boundaries if they are repeatedly crossed. Boundaries are meant to be respected, essential for maintaining a healthy entrepreneurial relationship.


Seeking support and guidance in entrepreneurshipIn cases where a business relationship is causing harm or is particularly challenging, seeking support from mentors, peers, or professionals within the entrepreneurial community can be invaluable. They can provide valuable perspectives, guidance and emotional support.Support networks within the entrepreneurial world can offer insights I might not have considered, helping me make informed decisions about navigating the changes in my business relationships. Additionally, seeking advice from experienced entrepreneurs or business coaches can effectively address complex issues and facilitate communication and understanding between individuals involved in a business venture.Related: 7 Networking Groups Every Small Business Owner Should Be Involved InPrioritizing self-care in entrepreneurshipAmidst the challenges of navigating changing relationships within entrepreneurship, I've learned the importance of prioritizing self-care. Taking care of my physical and emotional well-being has been crucial in ensuring that I am in a good place mentally and emotionally, equipping me to make tough decisions about my business relationships.


Self-care practices, such as regular exercise, meditation, mindfulness and maintaining a healthy work-life balance, have played a significant role in my ability to navigate change within entrepreneurship. As the saying goes, ""You can't pour from an empty cup."" By nurturing myself, I ensure that I have the resilience and clarity needed to address the changes in my business relationships effectively.ConclusionIn conclusion, navigating changing relationships with awareness is a complex but essential aspect of entrepreneurship. Just as people can change in personal relationships, change is also a constant in the entrepreneurial world. By practicing self-awareness, setting boundaries, seeking support and making tough decisions when necessary, I've found that I can cultivate healthier connections and protect my well-being while pursuing my entrepreneurial endeavors.Change is an inevitable part of the entrepreneurial journey, and relationships are dynamic. As entrepreneurs, let us continue to embrace change, remember the importance of self-awareness, effective communication and self-care

69,There Are 5 Types of Innovative Personalities. Which Are You and What Does It Mean for Your Chance of Success?,"Nov 13, 2023",Scott Greenberg,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/which-of-the-5-types-of-innovative-personalities-are-you/465099,"
Franchisors are very familiar with this bell curve:It's always on their minds, and rightly so, since their business model is vulnerable to changes in the marketplace. Even if they do everything right, there's bound to be disruptions. It could be a new competitor (consider what Netflix did to Blockbuster), a new technology (consider what cell phones did to pay phones), or a new way of delivering products (consider what Amazon has done to everyone). Economies can change dramatically due to world events (as they did in 1927, 2007, and 2020). Franchisors are also aware that consumers gravitate toward new things, so they need to provide that novelty before their competitors do.Related: Most Franchisors Fail to Scale Because They Don't Realize This



Franchisors also want to boost efficiency and reduce costs. That might mean a new point-of-sale system, new goods, new procedures, or new vendors. And if new leadership comes on board, you can expect them to implement their own ideas. With new ideas comes debate. That's not just true for franchising— that's human nature. People tend to fear anything that threatens what they're comfortable with. If they're used to doing things a certain way, disrupting that triggers the amygdala. Often there's pushback before they will even consider new ideas, even when there are potential benefits to switching things up. Change is an extremely sensitive topic in the franchise world, especially when it's required, and even more so when it costs money. Most franchisees don't like being told what to do, and certainly not what to spend, although they will welcome new ideas when the benefits are obvious. Sometimes franchisees request changes to the model and complain that corporate is dragging their feet. But when they're unsure about a change, they can be reluctant to accept it.Related: Why You Should Buy a Franchise Instead of Starting Your OwnSometimes corporate is right, and sometimes they are wrong. But remember that failure is a necessary ingredient in the recipe for success. You have to try things to create great things. The popular Post-It note is the result of an adhesive that failed to tightly bond. Thomas Edison conducted thousands of experiments in order to create his alkaline storage battery (often misattributed to the development of his lightbulb). And that spray in your garage is called ""WD-40"" and not ""WD-1"" because it took them 40 tries to get it right.


When I do speaking engagements for franchisees, the message I want to deliver is this: When it comes to change, we need to lean in. As risky as change might be, not changing is deadly. As a collective, we can't rely on the status quo. We must ask questions but keep an open mind and trust the people with the track record and the data. We need to allow for a certain margin of error to encourage ongoing innovation. Mostly, we need to follow the lead of wealthy franchisees. They have good instincts and clear heads, and they're engaged with the franchisor. There's a good chance they were involved in creating the new idea. Wealthy franchisees are excited to be at the forefront of innovation and frequently volunteer to be trial stores.Related: Franchising Isn't for Entrepreneurs, It's for SystempreneursDiffusion of InnovationsSocial scientists have studied the way members of a population embrace change. Some of the most interesting work came from Bryce Ryan and Neal Gross, rural sociologists at Iowa State University. In their 1950 report, titled ""Acceptance and diffusion of hybrid corn seed in two Iowa communities,"" they examined the rate at which farmers in Iowa adopted the use of hybrid corn seed. Later, in his book Diffusion of Innovations (Free Press of Glencoe, 1962), communications professor Everett Rogers expanded the discussion to other industries. He classified people within a population into five different groups based on how rapidly they embrace an innovation.Innovators are the risk-takers who jump on board as soon as something's available. These are the folks who spend the night in front of a store so they can be the first to own the latest cell phone or gaming console.Early Adopters are among the most influential people in society when it comes to accepting innovations. They notice what the innovators do and take a slightly more calculated risk. They still come on board before most people, but they want a little information first. This group has a lot of influence over the rest of the population.The Early Majority joins in once the innovation is proven. They follow the leadership of the early adopters.The Late Majority comes in behind the curve. They're skeptical about change but realize they probably don't have much choice if they don't want to get left behind.Laggards are the last to get on board. They cling to tradition and only change when they absolutely must. That's my grandmother, buying a touchtone phone only after it was no longer possible to use her rotary dial telephone.Related: Making Your Community The Secret Weapon in Rapid Franchise ExpansionLike all models, it's not an exact science. It does, however, provide a pretty good general idea of how groups of people adopt new ideas. Wealthy franchisees are generally among the innovators and early adopters. Their desire to keep getting better opens their minds to experimentation. They also speak up assertively (but respectfully) when the change seems flawed. As top performers, they have influence with corporate. Often they're especially quick to embrace new ideas because they're the ones who came up with them.

70,Dismantling the 9 to 5 — Why Job Stacking Is the Future of Work,"Oct 31, 2023",Zach Wade,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/dismantling-the-9-to-5-why-job-stacking-is-the-future/459302,"
The American workplace is undergoing a paradigm shift — one that labor economists should be reluctant to dismiss as a fake trend. As work-life balance is being redefined, a majority of Americans are expressing disdain for the traditional Monday through Friday, 9 to 5 job regime.Instead, many Americans are yearning for a professional life that offers more flexibility and autonomy. Remote workers, having tasted the fruits of working from home, are steadfast in their refusal to return to the conventional office setup. Meanwhile, the four-day work week, pioneered by nations like Iceland and Japan, is gradually gaining traction in corporate circles. Yet as the evolution in the work sphere continues, a new trend is emerging for millennials and Gen Z, who have been vociferously demanding a revolutionary work model since their initiation into the workforce. This burgeoning trend is none other than job stacking.Related: A Gen Xer Who Secretly Works 3 Full-Time Remote Jobs and Makes $344,000 Paid Off His Mortgage and Is Saving to Send His Kids to College Debt-Free



What is job stacking?Job stacking is the practice of concurrently working multiple full-time jobs simultaneously, accruing more than one full-time salary. This approach to work diversifies income streams and maximizes earning potential, and has been adopted by over 400,000 Americans, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.My personal tryst with job stacking commenced in 2020 at only age 22. As I plunged into this novel work model, I found myself adeptly handling five different job roles and amassing a staggering annual income of over $375,000. This venture propelled me into a space of financial freedom and allowed me to save the funds to kickstart my agency.


In a scenario where over 70% of the workforce finds themselves discontented in their jobs, the concept of job stacking resonates strongly with those who aspire to reclaim control over their time without compromising on their income and benefits. At its core, job stacking entails juggling multiple job roles, often across various domains, to create a lucrative and satisfying work mosaic that caters to the diverse interests and skills of an individual.Why is job stacking becoming a preferred choice among Americans? Let's delve into the dynamics that are fostering the adoption of this model:1. Facilitating balanced parentingOne of the most profound impacts of job stacking is on the parenting front. Rigid work schedules have been a long-standing issue for working parents. Flexibility is a top-ranking employee benefit for both men and women, but parents with young children are more likely to rate it as one of the top-ranking employee benefits. If flexibility were not available, 38% of working parents would have quit their jobs or reduced their hours. Job stacking comes as a savior in this context, providing parents with the liberty to tailor their work hours to suit their family commitments. Furthermore, the financial benefits accrued from multiple job roles can significantly offset the childcare costs, which currently hover around $10,600 per year.Related: Why Working Multiple Jobs Will Be the New Normal


2. Empowering employees to lead a fulfilling lifeAs mental health has become more of a priority, many full-time workers are trying to live a fulfilling lifestyle beyond the weekends. Gone are the days of employees' existence being confined to the boundaries of an office. Recent Deloitte research shows that millennials and Gen Zers are desperately seeking work-life balance, even placing it at the top of their consideration list when selecting a company to work for. Job stacking serves as the golden key to unlocking this lifestyle. By mastering time management skills, individuals can sculpt a work-life structure that allows for ample personal time to pursue travel and other fulfilling endeavors, defining ""after work"" on their own terms.3. A counter to underpayment by employersA grim reality facing the American workforce is the issue of underpayment. A large faction of employees feel that the remuneration offered by companies is inadequate to sustain a decent quality of life, especially given the escalating cost of living and real estate prices. Job stacking emerges as a potent solution to this dilemma, empowering individuals to supplement their primary income with earnings from various other roles, thereby elevating their financial standing.What makes for an excellent job stack?Not all jobs are stackable. Obviously, it's impossible to job stack jobs like working at call centers or being a barista. To succeed at job stacking, look for jobs with a few key characteristics, the first being that the job is completely remote. Industries like information technology (IT), customer service, writing/content creation and digital marketing tend to have a significant remote workforce, making those easy roles to stack. Aim for in-house positions, which typically offer better control over your workload. Roles that require extensive management are less ideal for stacking across various companies.Focus on securing mid-level positions, as they present an optimal balance of responsibility and compensation, often offering salaries exceeding $40,000 annually without the intense oversight inherent in higher-level roles. Additionally, prioritize finding positions that align with your existing skills and can be streamlined or automated, allowing you to perform at your best.

Moreover, it's difficult to feel financially secure when layoffs are occurring regularly. Job stacking and its multiple revenue streams offer an increased sense of financial security. But here's what's even better: It allows you to be selective in the roles you take on. This way, you have the ability to pursue jobs that you really love, leading to feelings of joy and fulfillment in your job. Having this sense of financial security and work-life satisfaction will ease anxiety and promote fulfillment.As we stand at the cusp of a work revolution, job stacking is emerging as a potent force that is equipped to dismantle the traditional work structures that have long dictated the American work landscape. As more and more individuals embrace this multi-faceted work approach, we are likely to witness a happier, more satisfied and more financially secure workforce that thrives on autonomy and flexibility.For those considering treading this path, remember that job stacking is not merely a career choice; it's a lifestyle, a movement that is empowering individuals to redefine success on their own terms, fostering a future where work harmoniously coexists with life's pleasures and pursuits. Embark on your job stacking journey today and be a part of the revolution that is setting a new benchmark for professional satisfaction and personal fulfillment.

72,When to Update Your Business Plan,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/9-signs-its-time-to-update-your-business-plan/459459,"
When's the best time to update your business plan? How about always.Writing a business plan is one of those skills that improve with practice. The first one or two times you create a plan, you may feel a little unsure of yourself and even less certain that what you're doing has value.If you go on to start several ventures during your career, you'll naturally write several business plans, and each one will be better than the last. It's likely also that with better planning skills will come improved business skills, boosting the odds that each successive company you start will do better than the previous one.But there's no reason that only serial entrepreneurs should benefit from regular business planning sessions. If you start just one company or never start a company at all, you should be constantly honing your business planning skills by updating your business plan.



Related: 6 Reasons to Update Your Business PlanUpdating a plan usually is easier than starting from scratch. Instead of trying to figure out what your basic business concept is, you only have to decide whether it's changing. You'll usually be able to reuse the financial formulas, spreadsheets, management biographies, and other more or less evergreen contents of your plan.Nine Reasons You Should Update Your PlanWhen's the best time to update a plan? Here are nine instances you might want to give it a tweak.A new financial period is about to begin. You may update your plan annually, quarterly, or even monthly if your industry changes quickly.You need financing. Lenders and other financiers need an updated plan to make financing decisions.Your customers' needs and desires have changed. Talk to your customers often to find out what they're buying, if your solutions still meet their needs, and if you can provide new solutions.Significant markets change. Shifting client tastes, consolidation trends among customers, and altered regulatory climates can trigger a need for plan updates.New or stronger competitors are looking to your customers for their growth.Your firm develops a new product, technology, service, or skill. If your business has changed a lot since you wrote your plan, it's time for an update.You have had a change in management. New managers should get fresh information.Your company has crossed a threshold, such as moving out of your home office, reaching $1 million in sales, or employing 100 people.Your old plan doesn't seem to reflect reality anymore. Maybe you did a poor job last time. Maybe things have just changed faster than you expected. But if your plan seems irrelevant, redo it.Related: When Is the Best Time to Write Your Business Plan?


Don't RushSome entrepreneurs may be more prone to rushing into making changes to their business plan when things aren't working out. One important thing to remember: Take your time.""Don't feel like it's a requirement to update your plan. You should only refine your plan if your strategy either isn't working or things are going much better than you had originally planned, says Noah Parsons COO of Palo Alto Software. ""If you're meeting your expectations, staying the course might be the best bet.""Related: Business Plan Updating ChecklistTake the time to challenge some of the core assumptions of your prior plan to see if they still hold up. Have profit margins been higher than you expected? Then, plan to make the most of any extra cash you generate. Is your new retail store unit not performing as well as you expected? Now's the time to figure out why. Has competition for your new product arisen sooner than you guessed? Look at other products to see if they are more vulnerable than you think.In large corporations with strict planning routines requiring annual, semiannual, and quarterly plans and plan updates, managers spend at least part of their time working on or considering a new plan or plan update. All that information flowing up to senior managers in the form of plans helps keep the brass informed. It helps those in the trenches, too. It's a fact that everybody is judged by past performance. The best way to ensure that a year from now you'll be looking back on your performance with satisfaction and pride is to plan now and often.Related: The Benefits and Risks of Writing a Business PlanBe ConservativeWhile you don't want to fail, there is a point when rewriting a business plan that you have to admit the possibility of failure. It's only natural to create a plan that will describe a roaring success. But you have to be careful not to present an overly optimistic view, especially of such elements as sales, costs, and profit margins.


It's tempting to noodle around with the numbers until you produce the desired result. And if you make only minor changes here and there, it may seem all right. What difference does it make? Say you increase your projected market share by 1 percent here, reduce expected costs by 2 percent, and lower your estimated required startup capital by a few percentage points.Related: 12 Reasons You Need a Business PlanSome similarly small changes, in sum, can make a big difference in the bottom line of your plan and turn what otherwise looks like a loser into a projected winner. But don't be seduced. You may ask for investments from friends and family you care about and put your life savings into the enterprise. The feelings of arm's-length investors may not be so important, but if you mislead them in your plan, you may open yourself up to accusations of misrepresentation.Looking at things in your plan through rose-colored glasses may even doom your business to failure if it causes you to seek insufficient startup capital, underprice your product or service, or expect unrealistically rapid growth. Temper your enthusiasm. If your plan indicates that the business idea isn't sound, by all means, look for errors. But don't make the mistake of skewing your plan to fit an idea that isn't sound.Related: The Ultimate Guide to Writing a Business Plan

73,How to Create a Strategic Hiring Plan,"Oct 27, 2023",Eric Butow,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/how-to-create-a-strategic-hiring-plan/459473,"
One of the beauties of being an entrepreneur, as opposed to a solo practitioner or freelancer, is that you can leverage the activities and skills of all the people you employ. This is one of the secrets to building a personal fortune. And it's one you can use even if you didn't happen to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth or an oil well in your backyard.The decision of how many people you want to manage is entirely up to you. It depends on the time commitment you cannot make to do other tasks or the need to perform skills that aren't your strengths. Part of hiring other people is to have them handle aspects of the business that you cannot or should not be doing. After all, we have different personalities, interests, and passions.There are very few one-person businesses unless you are including independent contractors. Businesses are run by teams of people, from two or three to thousands, and team members excel in many areas. You also need to factor in how much you expect to grow. Some entrepreneurs want to retain a small, easy-to-manage business, while others want to build an empire.Organization Chart""For many businesses, personnel is the largest expense, so it's important to think through the forecast and make adjustments to the timing of planned hiring based on your revenue projections, profitability, and the cash you have available to meet payroll obligations,"" says Noah Parsons, COO at Palo Alto Software. ""You'll also want to think about how your business is organized and what the management structure will look like. You can use tools such as an organizational chart to help figure out your personnel plan and then add that to your business plan.



An organizational chart, or org chart, graphically sorts your company into its major functional departments—finance, administration, marketing, production, etc. It's the quickest, clearest way to say who is in charge of what and who reports to whomHiring ConsiderationsTo help you in your strategic staffing projections, consider these factors:What are your key business objectives? (Hint: These may be things such as increasing sales or reducing costs. The idea is to make sure that your hiring decisions fit your strategy. If, for example, geographically expanding your retail store chain is a primary objective, a staffing plan will have to include managers for each new location.)What skills will your employees need?What new skills will current employees need to possess? (Hint: You may find you are better off with fewer workers who are more highly trained or have different skill sets.)Which of these skills are central to your business—your core competencies? (Hint: You may want to outsource peripheral functions. Accounting, legal matters, and human resources are frequently outsourced by companies whose main business is elsewhere and who find it doesn't make sense to spend the effort to attract and retain skilled employees in these areas.)List the jobs and job descriptions of the people it will take to provide these skills. (Hint: The idea here is to identify the employees whose job titles may mask their actual function in the organization so you can figure out how many people, and what type of people you really need to include.)Determine how many people you will be hiring and what your budget will be for these positions. Will there be any job sharing? (Hint: Make sure your salaries are commensurate with the going rates in your region. If you can pay more, you can attract a higher level of employees. If you pay less, try to find nonmonetary benefits that you can offer, such as telecommuting, which saves employees time and money on getting to and from work each day.)Now, you should be able to accurately predict how many and what kind of people you need to achieve your long-term objectives.Adding and Retaining Key Employees If you want your business to grow, you'll want to have key employees who share your vision and goals. Sometimes, you will find an established individual, like a highly acclimated chef for your restaurant or an art director with years of experience for your company. You may not always know what the future holds when you bring someone on board, but you believe they have what it takes to become a key employee. These are individuals that you can envision moving up the path of ascension. Either way, you should make it clear in your business plan which key positions you want to fill and how you plan to find the people to fill those roles.


Of course, the economy will factor into your decision on whom to hire and how much you can afford to pay them. In a struggling economy, more highly skilled employees will be seeking work, but you may be unable to risk high salaries. In such instances, you may opt for trial periods before committing to full-time salaries. You may also look for independent contractors for key positions. Remember, it's much easier to find skilled people in various aspects of business than it is to learn everything yourself. When the economy is going well, however, you will have to up the ante to bring on key employees because there is more competition. Then there is your plan to hold onto key employees, which is important to include in your business plan.An organizational chart graphically sorts your company into its major functional departments—finance, administration, marketing, production, etc. It's the quickest, clearest way to say who is in charge of what and who reports to whom.What Employees WantThe things that make employees want to come to work for you and stay vary. For employees, choosing whom to work for is a highly personal decision. That's why it's crucial to understand the individual needs of your key employees so that you can give them exactly what they want. If you offer only a higher salary to an employee whose most important concern is that she works at a job offering flexible hours so she can care for an elderly parent, then you probably won't retain that employee.Here are some common concerns that drive employment decisions:Benefits Paid holidays and sick leave, health insurance, and retirement plans such as 401(k)s are among the benefits listed as most desirable by employees.Compensation Salary, bonuses, stock options, profit sharing, and auto mileage allowances are among the most important compensation issues to employees.Other perks On-site childcare, flexible schedules, telecommuting, paid memberships to business groups, and health perks such as yoga classes or free medical screenings are also important to employees


This list is by no means comprehensive. Employee needs are as complex as humanity. One person may stay because she likes the view out her window on a high floor; somebody in an identical office may leave because heights make him nervous. One of the most important needs, especially for highly motivated employees, is maintaining a constant atmosphere of learning, challenge, and advancement. If you can find a way to let your employees grow as your company does and feel a sense of ownership and inclusion, they're likely to be more conscientious and motivated.

74,This Is What True Success Actually Looks Like,"Oct 23, 2023",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/unleashing-the-power-of-purpose-key-ingredients-for-success/463835,"
Because people often equate success with wealth and status, it's easy to lose sight of what actual achievement looks like. In this episode of the Jeff Fenster Show, we discuss the importance of purpose, motivation, gratitude, and identity in attaining success.We begin by diving into the difference between your purpose and your passion.""Passion should be seen as the fuel, while purpose is the vehicle,"" says guest Brian Boesche.



He believes purpose goes beyond a mere reason for being; it is the guiding force that propels individuals towards their goals. While passion is a fleeting emotion that can waver over time, purpose holds steady, providing the necessary direction and focus to overcome obstacles.Taking vs. GivingJeff Fenster, host of the show, emphasizes the significance of understanding the cycle of taking and giving. Building long-term relationships and success requires a balanced approach, where one contributes to others' growth while receiving support. This symbiotic relationship fosters community and propels individuals towards their goals.


As Gab Boesche, another guest on the show, highlights, motivation is derived from fulfillment. By helping others and witnessing the transformative impact of their actions, individuals find the drive to push forward. Through these acts of service, one discovers their true purpose and experiences a profound sense of fulfillment.Recognizing and celebrating small wins is crucial in the journey towards success. Whether securing a first client or achieving a personal goal, these milestones are stepping stones to greater accomplishments. Expressing gratitude towards team members and acknowledging their contributions fosters a positive work environment, boosting morale and encouraging continued growth.Making better decisionsMaking better decisions is another critical aspect of compressing time and multiplying the impact of one's efforts. By recognizing and addressing patterns that hold us back, we can break free from self-imposed limitations and propel ourselves towards success.Seeking mentors is essential in navigating the path to success. Mentors provide guidance, wisdom, and support, helping individuals avoid common pitfalls and accelerate their progress. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the dangers of excessive privilege and ensure that mentorship is grounded in humility and a genuine desire to learn.


For those seeking guidance and support in discovering their purpose, the Purpose Company stands ready to assist. By reaching out to their team, individuals can tap into a wealth of knowledge and resources to help them on their journey toward success.Ultimately, it is essential to remember that one's purpose is one's permission to pursue greatness. By embracing purpose, finding motivation through service, expressing gratitude, and making conscious decisions, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve remarkable success.As Jeff Fenster concludes, ""Successful people have coaches.""

75,The Art of the Pivot — 6 Steps to Reengineer Yourself for a Career Change,"Oct 20, 2023",Scott Deming,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-reengineer-yourself-for-a-career-change/463297,"
If you're reading this, you're likely considering a significant career change or maybe even dreaming of starting your own business. Wanting a change doesn't necessarily mean you're unhappy where you are or that you're stuck in a rut. Often, it's a pursuit of something more — be it greater personal fulfillment, new challenges or more freedom. However, desire alone won't get you there; you need a solid strategy. This is where reengineering becomes invaluable. It provides you with a comprehensive roadmap for navigating the intricacies of an ever-evolving career landscape.Why reengineer if you're making a changeWhether you're captivated by the allure of entrepreneurship or are considering jumping into a new field, understand that shifting careers is akin to navigating an intricate, moving maze. The ground beneath us is shifting, thanks to technological advancements, the post-pandemic hybrid model, and the gig economy, among other factors. If you're contemplating a change, reengineering offers you the tools to navigate this maze effectively. It's not about discarding your previous experience or skills but leveraging them in a new context.Related: Is Pivoting a Last-Ditch Effort or a Sound Business Strategy?



My reengineering storyIn 2003, after two decades at the helm of my advertising agency, I found myself at a career crossroads. Over the years, I honed my craft in creating powerful ad campaigns, leading talented teams, managing complex relationships with clients and suppliers and even venturing into startups. Alongside this, I took on the role of training my clients' sales and leadership staff.Despite how rewarding this was, I recognized that my skills and experience could make a broader impact. My ambition took a decisive turn. I shifted from focusing on mere advertising and occasional client training to a concentrated effort aimed at empowering individuals and companies. My new mission involved developing stronger leadership skills, elevating sales and service quality, transforming customer experiences and fostering corporate cultures that are both passionate and purposeful.


In essence, my goal became to help my clients and their staff evolve into their best selves—a mission advertising alone couldn't fulfill. Recognizing the need for a dramatic change and leveraging the skills and experience I'd amassed over the years, I reengineered myself from an advertising executive into a corporate speaker, trainer, and author. And so, a new chapter in my career story began.Are you changing because of burnout?Unfortunately, when faced with career burnout, many people opt for extreme changes. From lawyers turning into farmers to corporate executives opening cafes, the move is often radical. The idea is to reboot by diving into something entirely different, leaving their old careers in the rearview mirror. While this radical change can work for some, it's usually short-lived. Many find themselves acting impulsively and regretting their decisions. My advice? Slow down. Take a moment to evaluate your existing skills and strengths. Instead of leaping into unfamiliar territory, consider how you can leverage your current expertise to transition into a different yet related career.Related: These Are the Core Elements Needed to Successfully Pivot Your BusinessSelf-assessment: Your strategic foundation for reengineeringJust like in my speaker training sessions, the first rule of thumb for considering a career change or starting a business is to understand yourself thoroughly. This isn't a superficial exercise; it's laying the foundation for your future. So, how do you go about it?


1. Identify Core StrengthsStart by identifying your core strengths and abilities. These are your ""superpowers"" that set you apart in the workplace. Are you a problem solver, a people person, or perhaps an analytical thinker? Knowing this helps you pinpoint the types of roles or businesses where you'll naturally excel.2. Recognize Your MotivatorsNext, what fuels your fire? Is it the thrill of closing a big deal, the satisfaction of leading a team to success, or maybe the joy of creating something new? Understanding what motivates you is crucial because a career that doesn't align with your passions and intrinsic motivators will likely lead to burnout or dissatisfaction.


3. Assess Marketable SkillsIt's equally important to have a pulse on the market. What skills or knowledge do you possess that are currently in high demand? The last thing you want is to pivot into a field that's already oversaturated or declining. Do your homework — industry reports, job postings, and even informational interviews can offer valuable insights.4. Utilize Assessment ToolsVarious tools can assist you in the self-assessment phase. For instance, Gallup's StrengthsFinder offers an in-depth report on your unique talents and how to utilize them effectively. On the other hand, a SWOT analysis provides a comprehensive view of your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Just as companies regularly conduct SWOT analyses to gauge their competitive standing, you should adopt the same practice to understand your own position in the business landscape.


5. Seek External InputDon't underestimate the value of external perspectives. Talk to mentors, colleagues, or friends who know you well and can provide candid feedback. Sometimes, others see potential in us that we might overlook.6. Document Your FindingsFinally, make sure to document everything. Create a ""Career Reengineering Blueprint"" that outlines your strengths, motivators, marketable skills and any areas for development. Refer back to this blueprint as you plan and execute your career transition.


By engaging in this comprehensive self-assessment, you're not just engaging in introspection; you're developing a strategic blueprint that will serve as the foundation for your reengineering journey.Time for tacticsNow that you've laid the groundwork with self-assessment, it's time to get tactical. The journey from contemplating a career change to executing it successfully can be broken down into three crucial phases: Planning, Preparation, and Performance. Pair these with the right tools and resources, and you're not just dreaming of a new career; you're crafting it. Let's delve into how each of these elements plays a pivotal role in your reengineering process.Related: The 4 Secrets to a Successful PivotThe 3 Ps of reengineeringPlanning — The first step in any journey is setting the destination. Define your career objectives, but remember, rigidity is the enemy of adaptability. These goals may need to pivot in response to market trends or personal circumstances, so remain nimble and be willing to adapt.Preparation — Skills are the currency of the modern job market. Take specialized courses, attend workshops, or even go back to school if necessary. Networking is equally vital; connect with professionals in your desired field, attend industry events, and consider finding a mentor.Performance — Once the plan is set and the preparations are complete, the next step is execution. Monitor your progress using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) tailored to your career objectives. Data doesn't lie; it will show you whether you need to steer the ship in a different direction.Related: Pivot or Persevere? The Key to Startup Success


Tools and resourcesTime to gear up. From LinkedIn Learning courses to industry-specific webinars and workshops, there's a wealth of resources at your fingertips. Don't underestimate the power of online communities either; they can offer invaluable advice and connections.ConclusionIf you're on the cusp of considering a career change or pondering the launch of your own business, here's something to mull over: Reengineering isn't just an intriguing option; it's a strategic necessity in today's dynamic job market. But hey, if you're waiting for that ""perfect moment"" to take the leap, let this serve as food for thought: The perfect moment just might be now.

76,Knowing When — and How — to Pivot Is Key to Your Business' Survival. Here's What You Need to Do.,"Oct 17, 2023",Lissele Pratt,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/knowing-when-and-how-to-pivot-is-key-to-your/462909,"
In business, staying ahead is a constant game of strategy. You're always rethinking what you offer, who your audience is and how to make it all work — and let's not forget keeping a close watch on the market, your rivals and trying to predict where demand and tech trends are heading.Traditionally, this process unfolded methodically, following a more predictable path. But then came 2020, a year that shattered predictability and made adaptability an absolute necessity. That year, a Harvard Business School survey showed that 71% of executives from more than 90 countries said adaptability was the most important quality they looked for in a leader.I felt the turbulence as I steered my business through the uncharted waters of the global pandemic. I had just launched my business and it was very challenging given that it was important for us to meet clients face to face and attend events in person. Plus, working with high-risk businesses in the banking and payments industry, I also have to pivot frequently to adapt to the ever-changing regulatory landscape.



But here's what I've learned: Precisely during these moments of chaos and upheaval, the art of pivoting shines the brightest.Related: How Pivoting Saved My Business When Things Didn't Go According to Plan


What is pivoting in business?In the context of business strategy, a pivot represents a substantial shift in course, a recognition that the existing products or services are no longer in sync with market requirements. The primary aim of a pivot remains unequivocal: augmenting revenue or bolstering a business's standing in the market. Yet, the finesse of pivoting extends beyond the act of change itself. It's about making the right changes at the right time. It's the difference between merely staying afloat and thriving in the long run.When should you pivot?Determining the ideal moment for a pivot is a crucial decision. Pivoting isn't a magical solution for all business problems. However, you could consider a pivot when:Substantial investments of resources and capital yield minimal progressBusiness development hits a plateau with no significant upward trajectoryCustomer response to your products falls short of expectationsIntense competition in the market hinders growthOnly a single feature or service of your company gains meaningful tractionTips for successfully pivoting in businessChange isn't a threat in business — it's your greatest ally. Here are some tips on embracing change and mastering the art of pivoting:Tip 1: Don't become complacentNever rest on your laurels. Just because you're at the top today doesn't guarantee you'll stay there tomorrow. Maintaining your position requires relentless effort and constant assessment of your competitive landscape.


In the early days of Capitalixe, I faced a significant setback. We lost one of our biggest clients, accounting for over 50% of our revenue. It hit us hard, and for a moment, it felt like the ground had shifted beneath us. But because I had not been complacent prior to this, I had a pipeline of prospects ready to go. I tirelessly worked to build new relationships and quickly adapted our approach. It wasn't easy, but we recovered and grew stronger from the experience.Here's how can you steer clear of complacency and keep your business on the winning track:Stay hungry and never stop striving for improvement. Keep looking for ways to make your products or services even better.Actively seek feedback from clients and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement. Don't just assume you know what they want. Ask them for feedback and then use that feedback to make positive changes.Don't get so wrapped up in your own business that you forget to see what others in your industry are doing. Learn from their successes and failures, and use that knowledge to stay ahead.Related: The Sunk Cost Fallacy is Ruining Your Decisions. Here are 3 Life-Changing Lessons I've Learned From PivotingTip 2: Seek revolution, not evolutionDon't settle for incremental progress. Be willing to take bold, disruptive leaps forward. Radical change often yields the most significant market impact.


Early in my entrepreneurial journey, I saw a gap in the market. High-risk businesses were underserved, thanks to their complex challenges like ever-changing regulations and high charge-back rates. Instead of shying away, I embraced the opportunity. With a revolutionary mindset, my team of experts and I dove into these uncharted waters. We crafted innovative financial solutions tailored to their unique needs. Our bold approach paid off, and we didn't just evolve, we reshaped the market, proving that in the face of challenges, revolution often yields the most significant impact.Here's how to embrace this revolutionary mindset:Encourage your team to question existing norms and practices. What can be done differently and more efficiently? Where can you push boundaries and defy convention?Understand that disruptive change often yields the most substantial rewards. It's about reshaping your industry rather than just fitting into it. Look for opportunities to challenge the market and set new standards.Don't fear change. Instead, embrace it. Be open to radical ideas and unconventional approaches. Create an environment where innovative thinking is encouraged and rewarded.Tip 3: Swift action is non-negotiableWhen the world moves fast, your response must match its pace. Delay can be as detrimental as inaction. Adapt and pivot with urgency. Here's why swift action is key when it comes to pivoting:When you're dealing with a rapidly changing landscape, timing is everything. Opportunities can vanish in the blink of an eye, and challenges can escalate if not addressed promptly. Being quick on your feet gives you a competitive edge.Proactive adaptation allows you to stay ahead of industry shifts and market trends. Instead of merely reacting to changes, you're positioned to anticipate them, making you a trailblazer in your field.Clients today expect quick responses. Whether it's addressing their concerns, delivering products and services or rolling out innovations, meeting these expectations is important for retaining customer loyalty.Related: Is It Time to Pivot Your Business? These Are the Only Two Signs You Need to Look For.


Final thoughtsChange is not a foe but a friend in business, and adaptability is your greatest asset. Remember, staying the course without room for adjustment is a path to obsolescence.Embrace change, innovate fearlessly and never hesitate to challenge the status quo. In moments of uncertainty, pivot when necessary and always be the architect of your success story.

77,"He Was Sentenced to 65 Years In Prison, But the 'Coffee Bean' Message Turned His Life Around","Oct 9, 2023",Jeff Fenster,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/from-addiction-to-redemption-damon-wests-inspiring/463092,"
In this episode of The Jeff Fenster Show, host Jeff Fenster sits down with the incredible Damon West to talk about his journey from addiction to redemption.In a world where addiction and adversity can often lead to despair and hopelessness, West's remarkable journey serves as a beacon of inspiration and redemption. From a promising career as a division one starting quarterback to a life of addiction, homelessness, and a lengthy prison sentence, West's story is a testament to the power of resilience, determination, and the transformative impact of a positive influence.A lifelong battle with addictionWest's battle with drug addiction began at a young age. After his football career ended, he turned to cocaine to fill the void. Despite achieving success as a stockbroker and even working for congress, his addiction eventually caught up with him, leaving him destitute on the streets of Dallas. Introduced to crystal meth, West quickly spiraled into a life of crime to sustain his addiction, leading to his arrest and a daunting 65-year prison sentence.



A prison mentor turns his life aroundIn prison, West faced a grim reality. He was warned to join a gang or get tattoos for protection, but an encounter with an older inmate named Mr. Jackson changed the course of his life. Jackson, a wise and influential figure, shared a powerful message with Damon: the strongest man in prison walks alone and does not succumb to the pressures of joining a gang. This encounter sparked a spiritual awakening within Damon, igniting a newfound determination to turn his life around.Damon emphasizes that addiction can manifest in various forms, affecting individuals from all walks of life. His story serves as a reminder that success is not limited to those with abundant resources or privileged backgrounds. He firmly believes that anyone can achieve success by following a formula of determination, resilience, and self-belief.


During his incarceration, Damon discovered the ""coffee bean"" message from Mr. Jackson, which says that life is like a pot of warm water that can be transformed by adding coffee beans to it. West learned that adversity can be overcome, and it is essential to tap into one's full potential. Inspired by this philosophy, Damon emerged from prison a changed man, dedicating his life to sharing his story of redemption, grit, and determination.Influential speaker and writerDamon's message has resonated with millions, impacting organizations such as Walmart, AIG, Chick-fil-A, and even the US Army. His best-selling book, ""The Locker Room,"" is set to become a film, and his children's book, ""The Coffee Bean for Kids,"" has sparked Coffee Bean Clubs in schools nationwide.Damon's journey also sheds light on the flaws within the criminal justice system. He shares insights on the five variables that can determine whether someone might have a negative interaction with the system, highlighting the need for reform and compassion.Furthermore, Damon warns against the corrosive power of hate, emphasizing that in prison, inmates are segregated by race, and the inmates themselves run the asylum. His experiences serve as a reminder of the importance of unity and understanding in our society.


Damon's story serves as a powerful reminder to look beyond our limitations and focus on the potential of each day. He honors Mr. Jackson by establishing a scholarship in his name, recognizing the profound impact of mentorship and positive influences.Damon West's journey of redemption is a testament to the human spirit's resilience and the transformative power of second chances. His story inspires individuals to overcome adversity, embrace opportunities, and strive for personal growth and success.

Change is an inevitable part of any organization's journey toward growth and success. In today's fast-paced and dynamic business environment, the ability to adapt and respond to change is a critical factor for an organization's survival. Two terms often used interchangeably but have distinct roles in managing change are ""change management"" and ""change leadership.""Understanding the difference between these two concepts is essential for effective organizational transformation. In this article, I'll discuss the difference between the two terms and why understanding this difference is essential for successfully driving change in your organization.Related: 3 Keys to Successful Change Management

80,So Your Company Is Talking About Transformation — But Is It Ready? Here's How To Tell.,"Sep 28, 2023",Brendan P. Keegan,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/so-your-company-is-talking-about-transformation-but-is/457109,"
Change. If talk of it has been swirling around the water cooler, people on your team probably have questions. When will the shift happen? Who's going to be most involved? What does the change mean for specific roles? While each of these questions matter, perhaps no question is more critical than this: Is the company ready?Plenty of businesses throw this question into a lake, distracted by competitive pressure, the whims of egotistic leaders or the desire to stay comfortable. But it's by facing the question that the business can devise a regret-free game plan.Committing to transformationAlthough headlines in the news might have left workers uneasy about the idea of company changes, companies have a choice about whether they want to transform or not. In fact, they have three choices: stay the course, evolve or disrupt.



Staying the course typically means growth of 0-3%. Popular retailer TJ Maxx sits in this category. Their brick-and-mortar approach and support of different brands has been effective for them. Companies that evolve see growth between 2 and 5% — consider the NASCAR pitstop today (21 people, 12 seconds) versus the pitstop of the 1960s (4 people, 5 minutes and 38 seconds). Disruption happens when growth is more than 5%. But that takes challenging the status quo, bringing the company's core capabilities into new, auxiliary or complementary markets, and offering clients new and different things. Netflix, one of the most well-known disruptors, changed the entertainment game with streaming video services.Disruption or transformation is like a chocolate brownie. It's easy for people in a company to say they want it — but are they willing to do what it takes to make it from scratch? It's tougher to actually execute, so companies have to be willing to commit. To get that commitment, they need first to check for a solid market opportunity, develop and communicate a shared vision, and then ask, ""Are we ready, willing and able?"" If the company has a good attitude of buy-in around the opportunity and workers have the skills necessary to execute, the business can often successfully transform.


Related: 9 Entrepreneurs Who Have Rapidly Transformed Their Businesses for the BetterThe eight pillars of transformationAssuming a business is ready for transformation, it should look at eight distinct pillars to make the change happen:1. Leadership. Are enough people willing to accept responsibility to organize people toward the common goal? A company might need as many as 100-150 champions on the team who can show others why the company is doing things differently. Build out the leadership team so there's a good mix of homegrown and outside talent that can create healthy debate.2. Culture. What do people want the company to be? What's the gap between that vision and where the company is right now? Initially, our team's culture was a high-touch service where workers aimed to do anything for the client. Now, we're striving to be more innovative. We actively work against fixedness and apply the broken window theory — i.e., the idea that little things can make a big difference.


3. People. Do people have the right attributes and skills necessary for the transformation? Don't be surprised if there's some variance. Typically, just 20% of people readily conform, 60% are the neutral majority and 20% need some proof or encouragement before coming on board. Companies can address skills gaps in lots of ways, but we introduced a program called Learn IQ, where any employee in the company can take a micro-credential program at any university.4. Systems. Does the company have a scalable system model in place? Without one, the business will bring clients in the front door only to have them run out the back. We went from 289 units on the road in 2018 to 30,000 units in 2022 by taking a very systemic approach.5. IQ. Can people interpret the core, adjacent and macro signals available (e.g., interest rates)? Can they execute logically? When we decided to do the last mile, we intentionally decided not to try to please everyone because we had something to learn and wanted to get better at it. We focused on market entry, expansion and diversification and didn't bring in other clients until we knew our first clients were satisfied.6. EQ. Does the company know when to hit the gas versus the brakes? During Covid-19, we took a high EQ approach, stayed cool and focused on what we needed to do. As a result, while the overall industry dropped 17%, our team went up 38%. Any team can look into implementing this during moments of tension or stress.


7. Flexibility. Does the business see challenges and opportunities with a willingness to fail? In mobility, we started in Class 1. Now, we go all the way through Class 8. We were willing to try franchising and then pull out when that didn't work.8. Fearlessness. Every team has fears, uncertainties and doubts. Is the team willing to face those and stare them down? Many times, we don't have data or know something is going to work. But we encourage people to try things out and fail fast because we know bold actions create new opportunities. Betting on young leaders is one way we're committed to being fearless.Related: How to Create Success for Your Business Through Digital TransformationStep up, hit repeat, competeIn many companies, staying the course or undergoing gradual evolution is the right decision. However, a business needs to be constantly assessing circumstances and goals. The team might find that, at a certain point, changing is the right move to make. Once they are ready, willing and able to take the transformation on, success depends on the company stepping up to all eight transformation pillars. If the business can hit repeat on that sequence over time, it can continue to meet customers' demands for generations and enjoy long-term competitiveness.

81,Self-Care Isn't Selfish — It's Essential for Sustaining High Performance. Here's How to Avoid Burning Out.,"Sep 26, 2023",Jonathan Kirschner,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/self-care-isnt-selfish-its-essential-heres-why/459098,"
What's your first instinct when you feel the mounting pressures of running a business?If you're like many leaders, you double down on your workload. That means spending more time at the office and less time on your personal health, hobbies and relationships — and that might work sometimes. You may even attribute your business's success to that instinct.The problem is that humans aren't designed to function at maximum capacity 24/7. Working twice as hard doesn't necessarily result in getting twice as much work done. Instead, pushing yourself past the point of exhaustion has been shown to lead to less creativity, reduced working memory and capacity for problem-solving and worse business outcomes.



Unfortunately, ""self-care"" has become so overused as a buzzword that it has become meaningless other than as a way to sell bath bombs and expensive retreats. But self-care isn't a self-indulgent luxury for people with more time than you; it's an essential tool for high-performing leaders who want to excel in their business.If you want to maintain high performance and effectively navigate the challenges of leading people and leading a business, it's time to shift your perspective.Related:The rise of burnout in leadershipWe heard a lot about burnout during the pandemic and its aftermath. Reporting from Gallup showed that the burnout rate among managers increased significantly between 2020 and 2021, leading to increased quit rates among managers and leaders and unmanageable workloads for those who stayed.But, burnout among leaders is a perennial problem — one that existed long before the pandemic, and one that will persist in the future. For instance, Gallup polling from 2018 showed that more than two-thirds of workers were burned out, with managers reporting more stress and burnout, worse work-life balance and worse physical health than members of their teams. And, a recent survey found that even though life outside the workplace has returned to normal for most people, 70% of C-level executives are considering leaving their company and taking a new role in an organization that supports their well-being.Self-care: Beyond the bubble bathOf course, as an entrepreneur running two companies, I know that understanding the importance of self-care and making time for self-care aren't the same thing. Here are some practical methods for incorporating self-care into your routine and infusing it into your organization.


1. Small acts of self-kindnessSelf-care doesn't require grand gestures. Instead, small investments can have an outsized effect. It can be as simple as slowing down to taste your coffee in the morning or taking a short walk in the fresh air before heading into the office.To carry self-care through your workday, you could build a playlist of your favorite songs that plays in the background as you work. Or get a vase of fresh flowers once a week to place on your desk. If you find yourself fading around mid-afternoon, take a walk, take a few deep breaths and reset yourself for the rest of the day.There's no limit to the amount or types of things you can do to take care of yourself at home and work. Finding ways to add elements of self-care to your daily routine is a great way to ensure your mind and body are getting the rest and nourishment they need to fuel the rest of your day.Related:


2. Take extended breaks, tooVacation time should be viewed as mandatory, not optional. Completely unplugging from work is linked with increased well-being, engagement and creativity. Going on vacation can also lower stress and reduce your risk of developing heart disease. Don't believe it? Consider that Lin-Manuel Miranda credits his idea for the award-winning musical Hamilton with taking a vacation.But, so many of the entrepreneurs and executives I work with are reluctant to take a vacation. This mindset is not only bad for you — it's bad for your employees. According to the Pew Research Center, 46% of employees in the U.S. take less time off than their company offers. Many of them don't want to burden their co-workers with extra work. Some fear they will miss out on career advancement opportunities or possibly lose their jobs if they take time off.3. Make yourself less essentialWe all know that entrepreneurs wear many hats, especially in the early days of their business. But if your company comes to a standstill the moment you step away, you're doing something wrong.It can feel gratifying to be integral to your business's functioning, but ultimately, you're shooting yourself (and your business) in the foot. A Gallup survey found that companies run by CEOs who delegate have a three-year growth rate that is 112 percentage points higher than companies with CEOs who do not delegate.


Leadership is the act of setting a vision and then accomplishing that vision through others. Surround yourself with people that you trust and then empower them to do their jobs. That way, you can take a break without feeling the burden of your business crumbling behind you as you walk away.4. Lead by exampleAs leaders, we need to remember that our employees are watching us and taking their cues from our behavior. When you ignore your own well-being, you send the message that your employees should ignore their well-being, too.As a leader, it's on you to create a permission structure and culture of self-care at your organization. Talk about the importance of self-care at work openly and frequently, especially with your leaders. Encourage employees to set (and keep) boundaries, especially when they are working remotely and the lines between when their workday begins and ends are blurred. When leaders practice self-care, the rest of the organization is more likely to follow.Related:


5. Build self-awarenessOnce you've created permission for you and your employees to take care of yourselves, you have to build the self-awareness to know when you're showing up in an unproductive way and the self-efficacy to take some time when you are.For example, I recently had a day that found me spiraling into a ball of stress and burnout. So, I decided to take the next morning a little slower than usual. Instead of rushing to the office, I spent a few extra minutes outdoors, picked a few fresh tomatoes from my garden and made an omelet.I knew I wasn't going to show up in a productive way if I just barrelled into the office all stressed out.You need to expect the same from your employees. Forcing your employees to take care of themselves is infantilizing. They're adults. Set an example and then trust them to follow it.


Build your surge capacityIn an interview with the American Psychological Association, Dr. Ann Masten, a psychologist and expert on resilience, talked about the importance of protecting what she called surge capacity — the mental and physical resources we use to survive the stressful situations that are so common to life as an entrepreneur.Unfortunately, she said, that capacity can get depleted. Faced with continuous challenges, we get exhausted and overwhelmed. When it does, we need to step back and try to replenish and restore our capacity through self-care.As a leader, there will always be days when walking away from work feels challenging or even impossible. The key to taking care of yourself on the days you can is to remember that acts of self-care now will enable high-performance in the moments that matter.

In the ever-evolving landscape of the business world, change is an immutable force, one that is indispensable for fostering growth and adaptation. However, the inevitability of change doesn't negate the fact that even the most well-conceived and well-intentioned transformations often encounter formidable resistance from employees and stakeholders alike. As a change leader, your proficiency in skillfully navigating and surmounting this resistance is not just a valuable asset but an absolute necessity for the triumph of any transformational endeavor.This article delves into the intricate dynamics of resistance to change, dissecting the underlying factors that fuel this resistance, and it serves as a compass to guide change leaders toward effective strategies to quell such opposition. From understanding the psychology of fear of the unknown to addressing concerns of job security, we will equip you with actionable insights and proven tactics to foster not just compliance but genuine enthusiasm among your team and stakeholders during times of change.Related: The 5 Most Important Aspects of Leading Others in Times of Change

85,This Startup Is Reinventing the Yellow School Bus. Here's Its Playbook for Winning Over the Hardest Customers (Like Public Schools).,"Sep 19, 2023",Liz Brody,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/this-startup-is-reinventing-the-yellow-school-bus-heres/458411,"
How do you drive a big yellow school bus with 70 kids goofing around in the back every day? ""You just gotta tune out the noise,"" shrugs Marllury Urbina, who's been doing it in and around San Francisco for 22 years.She's always loved the job, but it's come with stress. Out the door at 4:50 a.m. every day, she got used to maneuvering hilly city streets with one hand on the wheel while the other held a sheet of paper with directions for changing routes. There were student names to memorize, and antsy moms and dads to please. People always wanted to know — was she late? Did she already come and go? She had no way to communicate with parents, so she just started getting out of the bus and drawing an X in chalk on the ground, as if to say, Yes, the bus was here.Urbina saw the world start to change. Uber coordinated fleets of cars. Google Maps made directions easy. But the school bus industry was stuck using paper and chalk-drawn X's. And then, finally, it seemed progress would come for the buses too — or maybe not?



Related: How to Tap Into Innovation, the Most Essential Part of Your Entrepreneurial JourneyIn 2015, a startup called Zūm sped in on Silicon Valley va-voom. It could revolutionize Urbina's job with modern technology, if only the company could figure out a way in. But that wouldn't be easy. Yellow buses are part of an old, deeply entrenched, $50 billion global industry of large fleet operators — and to compete against that, Zūm would need to win over the huge, change-resistant, slow-moving bureaucratic public school districts that hire them.This is the moment that kills many innovative companies. Medical brands that can't sell to hospitals. Tech startups that can't get hired by governments. A founder realizes that their outré-clever innovation is worth nothing if it can't lure big customers away from their comfort zone.So, how do you do it? That was Zūm's billion-dollar question — and here is the playbook it came up with to make the sales.Ritu Narayan, who started Zūm to get her daughter from school, says, ""It's all her fault!""Image Credit: Courtesy of ZūmRULE No. 1  Get a toe in the door. Zūm did not set out to conquer impossible enterprise clients. It was born out of a much more personal problem — one that ate at an immigrant mother named Ritu Narayan as she worked inside a cramped cubicle at eBay.


Narayan built a career off defying expectations. She grew up in Delhi, where women did not typically become engineers, but she did — and left for the U.S. at age 24. She worked stints at Oracle, IBM, and Yahoo before running a senior product team at eBay. One day, her daughter's ride from preschool fell through. What was she supposed to do? Drop everything to go pick the kid up? Then it kept happening. Narayan had watched her own mother have to quit her career to raise children. ""And I'm here sitting in the heart of Silicon Valley, which solves any problem,"" she says. ""Why not this one?""So she started building a solution. It was a rideshare service like Uber, but specifically for getting kids around. Maybe the babysitter fell through, and the child needed to be picked up at school or had to go to soccer practice. Parents could use Narayan's app to summon a car, driven by someone who'd gone through intensive background checks and also had childcare experience, and then they'd be able to track it and communicate in real time. The service launched in February 2015, and to name it, Narayan held a little contest among people she knew. As if on cue, a 12-year-old came up with the winning entry: Zūm (pronounced zoom). Narayan's brothers, Vivek and Abhishek Garg, joined as cofounders.Related: 10 Growth Strategies Every Business Owner Should KnowImmediately they discovered that there was a small market for this. Some parents used it for emergencies; others paid for daily or weekly school pickups. There were even a few competitors in the space, including Shuddle, which raised $12.2 million. But Shuddle ultimately folded, and Zūm started looking to acquire more clients.One day, they were chatting with the assistant dean of a local private school, and they learned something interesting: The school was using a big bus to regularly shuttle a few students between its two campuses. Maybe Zūm's drivers could handle this instead for less money? Narayan and Vivek convinced the school to give them a $50,000-a-year contract, and it opened their eyes to the kind of revenue that was immediate and dependable: What if they became a transportation solution for parents via schools?As it turns out, school systems — both private and public — have a need for what's called ""alternate"" transportation, generally jobs not covered by basic yellow school bus service. For example, it might be helping students whose commutes are too long or too challenging for the regular routes to accommodate. Zūm started going after these small contracts, and by the end of 2018 it had several between $50,000 and $1 million.Despite this new line of business, Zūm was still very much the company Narayan originally envisioned. Parents were using the app to get rides for their kids, while the work for school districts was being fulfilled by Zūm drivers in their own cars. But in 2019, Narayan bumped up against the kind of existential question that many entrepreneurs face: What business was she in, and did her old ideas have to fall away to fulfill her company's true potential?Those thoughts started to percolate with one of Zūm's contracts in California's Oakland Unified School District, which paid Zūm $400,000 over three years to transport special education students with especially high needs. After it got going, Narayan was meeting with the transportation director, who walked her into a room where parents were often faxing — yes, in 2019! — their pressing concerns about school bus issues: Did it come yet? Did Tommy get on? Then the director shared how antiquated the bus system was, with walkie- talkies being used to coordinate with drivers. Narayan left that day wondering, If Zūm was transporting 10% to 20% of the kids in its school districts, why not go for 100%? Why not become a full-fledged yellow school bus company — but one wired for safety, efficiency, and user experience, kitted out with ace technology designed by the best engineers they could find?


Narayan started to think through what this would mean. First, there was the question of whether they could even get the big ""100%"" contracts. ""Districts are very hard customers to sell,"" says Narayan. Many of them owned or leased their bus fleets, and only contracted with private vendors for part of their daily transit needs. And the school bus industry — with 500,000 buses carrying more than 25 million children across America today — was dominated by a handful of large operators with long legacies.If Zūm decided to go for it, there was another question: Could they be both a school bus company and an on-call service for parents? That seemed unlikely; those were very separate businesses, and too difficult to run simultaneously. This was harder for Narayan. She was proud of Zūm's origin story — of being a working mom helping other working moms. Now she might abandon those women. ""There came a point where if you don't make a decision, it's too late,"" she says. ""You lose the edge that you have created in the market. But it's so tough because you could be giving up everything you've done so far, too. This is where you die or you fly.""Related: The Four Steps to Creating Lasting Change in Any Area of Your LifeNarayan spent around eight months wrestling with this decision. Her inner circle was split too. Her brother Vivek, who serves as chief operating officer, advocated for switching. ""Uber and Lyft had raised billions of dollars, but they were not profitable,"" he told her — which was to say, Zūm's original model might be iffy. But at least one investor and board member was not so sure. ""We were a bit intimidated,"" admits Bryan Schreier, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which bet early on Apple and Airbnb and led Zūm's $5.5 million Series A in 2017. ""We're used to founders dreaming big. But to us, school buses seemed like a super entrenched business, and it was really hard to see how a startup would truly reinvent it.""Narayan and Vivek, however, had come up with another differentiating factor. They wouldn't be just any old high-tech yellow bus company. Theirs would also help districts convert to electric vehicles. Over 90% of school buses run on diesel — a head-scratching figure, given the growing concerns about climate change. Zūm's founders believed that technology, combined with sustainability, was a strong value proposition for school leaders. ""That started to sound a bit more promising,"" says Schreier.Narayan finally felt confident to make the pivot to yellow buses: Yes, she'd be walking away from her original vision for Zūm, but she'd be building a sustainable company and making the planet healthier for all those children she loved serving. Now all they needed was to figure out how to actually pull it off­ — and to find a school district willing to hire them.RULE No. 2 Find the lone wolf. Kimberly Raney has always done things differently. In 2016, when she became director of transportation at Oakland Unified School District — two years before Zūm came on her radar — she wasn't your typical leader. (This is a woman who spent 18 months traveling in an RV with her wife, 12-year-old kid, two monkeys, a cat, and a rescued pig.) She'd been a manager at FedEx and had run a package delivery company. So when she landed at Oakland, she looked around and went, What the heck? ""It just amazed me to see the lack of technology,"" she says. ""I'm 48, and the buses show up the same exact way as when I was a kid.""Raney had a big job. The district contains 99 schools and partners with the city, using its public buses to get most of its students to class. But it awards big contracts to private vendors for about 1,500 special-education children, who are ferried door to door. Especially for this kind of delivery, it seemed obvious to Raney that the parents should be able to track their kids, the same way they could follow a FedEx package.


That's why when Zūm first pitched her in 2018, she was intrigued. At the time, Zūm was hunting for ""alternative transportation"" jobs, and Raney gave them the $400,000 contract — as a ""trial run,"" she says, ""to see if they could actually do what they said they could do."" Raney was the one who showed Narayan the fax machines that had prompted her to rethink the company.So when Zūm's founders decided to become a more full-service yellow bus operation, the first person they thought of was Raney. Maybe she'd be willing to give them a shot.Related: 4 Steps to Getting More Clients Right NowBut you don't make a pitch like this out of nowhere. Instead, Vivek started having conversations with Raney, talking theoretically about how Oakland could tech up its whole transportation system. He found out in 2020 that the district's contract, which would pay $11.5 million annually, was coming up for renewal for all their special-education students, and potentially could be worth $115 million. The current vendor was First Student, which has been around for more than 100 years and, with about 40,000 buses, is arguably the leading operator in the country. But anyone could submit a bid. And Zūm decided to go for it.First, though, it had to figure out: Would it try to become a school bus company all at once — acquiring and operating a whole fleet? Narayan decided against it; that was too much to start. For this bid, they'd propose partnering with an established operator that would use Zūm's platform in its own buses. Meanwhile, her team doubled down on its technology.Zūm took the software it built for ridesharing, and scaled it for an enterprise level. Fleet operators could save time and money with route optimization and collect data on driver performance. Drivers would have tablets that guide them by voice through the streets, alerting them when a child was sick and rerouting them to save time. Parents would have apps that let them always see where their kids were. And the schools got dashboards showing where every vehicle, driver, and child was at any given moment, with more information (like driver history, students' special needs, exact time a child was picked up or dropped off) available with a click on an icon.As the engineers worked, Vivek shared some of this potential with Raney. The idea was to give her a sense of the capabilities she could get for Oakland if she asked for them in the Request for Proposal (RFP) — the document she was working up to solicit bids for that next big contract. And sure enough, when Oakland did issue its RFP in January 2020, it required, for the first time, real-time tracking, route optimization, and electric buses. Zūm had three weeks to submit its proposal.By now the founders had realized: If you want to win over a difficult client, you need to learn to speak and think like them — which is why they hired a vice president of partnerships named Sarah Skinner, whose career in education included working with public school districts on data-driven strategy. When Oakland put out the bid, Skinner says, ""We asked, 'Can you provide your routing data and the number of students that need transporting? Because we want to understand if we can optimize these routes.'"" After Oakland provided the information, using Zūm's new tech platform, the company found a way to do the job with fewer buses — 76 instead of 103 — while reducing the number of children who spent an hour or more commuting from 70% to less than 10%. Oakland's fleet, it promised, would be fully electric no later than 2025.

We'd be taking a first chance,"" says Raney, who's not sure she'd have been so bold ""if I wouldn't have had so many conversations with Ritu and Vivek, and really seen that they care about my opinion to fix things immediately. But I knew they would do everything in their power not to fail.""Zūm had turned a sympathetic supporter into its first big contract. Now it needed to leverage this into getting many more.Image Credit: Courtesy of ZūmRULE No. 3 Be ready to fight. With Oakland secured, Zūm was developing a playbook for other districts: Get a toehold with the small alternative vendor contracts. Find an innovation-minded adopter who can become a champion. Build a relationship and show them how your company differs before they look for a vendor. Then, go all out to win.Later in 2020, just across the bay, San Francisco's public school district put out its RFP for school busing. Looking to transport at least 3,500 students to 122 schools for five years, its scope was more than twice that of Oakland's, and it asked each bidder to submit a price. As with Oakland, the incumbent was First Student.To win the bigger contract, Zūm decided it was time to compete head-on. Now that they'd successfully launched their technology in Oakland, they moved to become a ""full-stack"" yellow bus service: They'd lease the fleet, integrate their tech, hire drivers, and become electric in San Francisco by 2026. They put in a bid for $152,121,000 for five years.Related: Change Is a Team Sport — So Every Player Needs to Own It. Here's How to Get Everyone Involved.


But Narayan was not naive about the steep road ahead. At some point soon, this wouldn't just be about winning contracts — it would mean doing battle with incumbents. ""When disruption happens, the old guard tries to protect their territory,"" she says matter-of-factly. ""They'll try to remove the new player from joining the trade associations or other places of importance so they look like a small clown who will soon get out of the business.""The fight happened fast. San Francisco gave the contract to Zūm, and unlike in Oakland, First Student did not go quietly. It protested the award — and when that didn't work, it asked a California court to intervene. It also sued Zūm. It alleged in part that its former operations manager who was hired by Zūm misappropriated trade secrets during the bidding process. Narayan says the two companies settled. Zūm kept the contract.The feud intensified last year over the bid for Seattle's public schools, but in this case, Zūm was the aggressor. The district gave the contract to First Student, its vendor for 30 years. Zūm protested, saying it had come in at a lower price, and pointed to errors in evaluating the two bids. In response, the district canceled that RFP and put out a second. First Student won again. And again, Zūm protested. The district's final solution was to split the contract between the two companies — three years for around $40 million each — starting on July 6, 2022, with just two months to go live before school started. ""It's just what we had to go through,"" Narayan says.RULE No. 4 Play every hand you have. In 2022, there were 19,269 public school districts in the U.S. — and Zūm started plotting to get all of them. As part of that strategy, they eyed Los Angeles Unified School District. It's the second-largest district in the country behind New York, with nearly 600,000 students in more than 1,400 schools and centers covering 710 square miles. If Zūm won a big chunk of business there and executed well, it would prove its ability to handle the needs of most other districts. But that's easier said than done. Although the L.A. district has a projected expense fund of $12.9 billion this school year, it's said you can't even sell them a pencil.Related: Two Words That Can Help You Get More ClientsThis district gets most of its students to class via the 3,000 buses and other vehicles it owns. They outsource the rest. When the latest bid went out for what would be 405 buses, Zūm threw its hat in. To up its chances, the company hired yet another industry vet — Liz Sanchez, who'd been in the C-suites of First Student and National Express, Zūm's fleet partner in Oakland. Sanchez became Zūm's executive vice president of school transportation and started calling up her contacts in Los Angeles. ""I had good relationships there,"" she says. ""This is a very small industry.""Still, the district had a new transportation director that Sanchez didn't know, so Zūm leaned in hard on its strengths. As a tech company, it was acquiring more and more data: money saved with route optimization, commute time decreased, emissions cut. They could also prove things like a 98% on-time pickup rate in Oakland and 4.9 out of 5 stars based on over a quarter million parent satisfaction ratings across all districts on the app. (Whenever it's a three-star rating or below, the founders and executive team get notified and someone calls the parent immediately.) It all made a convincing case for Los Angeles, which awarded Zūm the contract last June. Over five years, it will pay over $400 million.


Zūm's vehicles are all carbon neutral and by 2027 will be fully electric, with batteries that give power back to the grid.Image Credit: Courtesy of ZūmRULE No. 5 Evolve your story while staying true to the narrative. Today, a little over three years after winning their first district, Zūm services more than 4,000 schools in six states and has $1 billion in multiyear contracts. Having raised $200 million, the founders say the company is winning about 75% of the contracts it bids on, and will be profitable next year. ""We are only, like, 0.6% of the market share,"" Vivek says. ""So there's way more room to grow.""(Update: It hasn't gone without hitches. Since this story went to press, a new contract with Howard County public schools in Maryland got off to a rocky start with missing buses and delays, due in large part to a national shortage of drivers. Zūm has apologized and is giving updates on its site on how it's resolving the situation.)If Narayan could go back and do anything over again, it would be those months of debating whether to abandon Zūm's founding vision to embrace the bigger possibility. ""I wouldn't take that long!"" she says with a laugh. She knows why she clung to her personal origin story. It was what her investors, employees, and first clients all bought in on. But she came to realize that a skilled entrepreneur is able to evolve that narrative as circumstances and opportunities shift.Related: 5 Factors That Contribute to the Success of Your BusinessToday, as she continues to do that, Zūm's narrative is increasingly about clean energy. If all goes to plan, next year as students head back to school, Oakland will consist entirely of Zūm's new electric buses, a fleet designed to send power back to the city grid. In line with a push from state and federal funding for electrification of the industry, Narayan's early bet on sustainability is proving on the money. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, if half the school buses in the country converted from diesel to electric, it could cut more than 2 million tons of carbon dioxide every year and, with vehicle-to-grid batteries, store enough energy to power the school laptop of nearly every student for a month.And yet, in an important way, this isn't all that different from Zūm's original story. The company began with helping children. It still does. Electric buses mean cleaner air for young brains and bodies, while shorter commutes help them show up fresh for class; cheaper transportation gives schools extra dollars for education. And Zūm's more than 1,000 drivers now have their students' names and individual needs at their fingertips and don't have to worry about telling parents they'll be late — including drivers like Marllury Urbina, who used to write X's in chalk at the pickup stop. She left one of the big incumbents to work for Zūm.""I plan to keep driving my bus,"" she says, ""till the wheels come off.""Related: This $12 Billion Startup Nearly Imploded.

88,From Frustrated to Fulfilled: Craig Siegel Shares the Reinvention Formula,"Aug 14, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/from-frustrated-to-fulfilled-craig-siegel-shares-the/457401,"
Self-limiting beliefs will tank your chance of success way before any external obstacles. So how do you remove those beliefs, and replace them with a more useful framework?Good question, and Craig Siegel has the answer.Craig is a value-based and high-energy global keynote speaker. He believes removing limiting beliefs is the key to success in all areas of life. Most people feel unworthy. Craig helps people release the negative beliefs they have cultivated over time and implement positive and constructive thoughts. These thoughts then create powerful and positive beliefs that change your behaviors and ultimately create brand-new results in your relationships, business, and all facets of life.



His work has been endorsed by some of the world's most well-known celebrities, entertainers, athletes, and entrepreneurs, such as Eric Thomas, Ed Mylett, Darryl Strawberry and Tom Bilyeu.In his new book, The Reinvention Formula: How to Unlock a Bulletproof Mindset to Upgrade Your Life, he provides practical strategies and inspiring stories to help you create a life filled with purpose and fulfillment.


I chatted with Craig during a recent episode of the Launch Your Business podcast and shared a few of my key takeaways below.The eulogy exerciseAfter years of work on Wall Street, Craig found himself in a successful career without direction or passion. He was caught in that low-grade miserable that happens when you've backed yourself into a corner of how other people think you ought to live your life.One of the key exercises that helped get him out of the haze was the eulogy exercise. You read that right: A eulogy exercise.Here's what that looks like: You imagine if your funeral is a few weeks into the future. What will people say about you? What's in your obituary? Did you leave a mark?


Craig realized he was not proud of what his eulogy would have looked like. He knew it was time for change.""I woke up one day and realized all I had to change was absolutely everything,"" Craig said, ""And so I started investing in a different story.""After that moment, Craig said it was impossible to go back.Related: Boost Your Productivity and Creativity in 3 Steps


How to reinvent yourselfLike so many things, Craig says that reinvention starts with a list. Two lists, actually.First, you make a list of five or six things that you love. If you didn't have to worry about money, what would you wake up tomorrow and do?Next, make a list of five or six things that you're really good at. Everyone has something that comes naturally to them, while others struggle.Your superpower will be where the venn diagram of what you love, and what you're good at overlaps.""You will absolutely find some commonalities,"" Craig said. ""Then I would marry the two. And right away we are onto something. Now we have some clarity.""Related: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Crafting a Successful FutureThere's a difference between failure and failingCraig defines failure as trying something once, seeing that it didn't work, and throwing up your hands and walking away.Failing, he says, can actually be a positive thing. It means that you tried something, and it didn't work. This happens to everyone, and as long as you keep rolling, you'll be okay. As long as you keep trying and failing, you'll make progress.


""Specifically in entrepreneurship, you gotta have thick skin, you gotta be bold, you gotta be able to take a punch,"" Craig said. You gotta be able to take things, not so personally, and understand that every time you have a setback or you make a ""mistake"", as long as there's a lesson learned that you can extract to make you better, more experienced, more seasoned for the next endeavor, it's actually a win.""Next stepsReady to learn more from Craig?Start by grabbing a copy of his new book, The Reinvention Formula: How to Unlock a Bulletproof Mindset to Upgrade Your Life.For a sneak preview, listen to our full interview on the Launch Your Business podcast.

90,How to Motivate Your Unmotivated Employees and Drive Their Daily Success,"Aug 9, 2023",Eric Watkins,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-motivate-your-unmotivated-employees/456858,"
As a first-time leader, you're expected to do more than manage operations. You're also faced with the responsibility of motivating your direct reports. That's a big ask, given that Gallup's annual worker engagement survey shows that barely three out of 10 employees feel engaged on the job. Yet, it's not a duty you can shirk. The sooner you help your team feel more connected to your department and company mission — and each other — the sooner you can start revving up productivity and showing your leadership moxy.This begs the question: How do you motivate the unmotivated? You can start by understanding why disengagement occurs. When employees feel burned out, unappreciated and devalued, they naturally pull back emotionally and performance-wise. Eventually, they either quietly quit or seek out other work. Either way, that ends up having a negative impact on your business, and it also puts a negative spotlight on your ability to manage.Your job, therefore, is to build camaraderie and cohesion as rapidly as you can. Doing so will inevitably improve productivity, which can further encourage everyone to row in the same direction. It will also put a ""winners"" spotlight on your team as a profit-boosting center. If your leadership efforts can cause those effects at your company, you'll be doing well for both your career and your team's reputation.



To set the right tone and fuel success among your employees, consider these steps.Related: 12 Ways You Can Immediately Start To Motivate Your Employees


1. Iron out your trainingA 2022 jobseeker survey from The Muse showed 72% of respondents regretted accepting a position because it wasn't as advertised. This starts with training. Unfortunately, many organizations underestimate the training needed by newer employees. Often, the process goes like this: The business hires someone, has that person shadow somebody else and calls it a day. This is not training.You have to invest in your employees from the get-go and not expect them to fully ramp up right away. Consider salespeople. Hoping they'll meet their quota too fast — and without training — is a surefire way to demotivate them. You can't expect 100% productivity from anyone if you're giving them minimal training.Having a consistent training system shows that you're putting measures in place to help team members reach success. For maximum efficiency and consistency, the training you give your people needs to be a clockwork process with key results tied to the training. Consistency is key when it comes to unlocking higher morale because it establishes a sense of stability, predictability and fairness within a team or organization. When team members experience consistency in their training and development, their efficiency, productivity and confidence increase exponentially.2. Create A-player scorecardsIt's the everyday activities that separate the best from the rest. Every position can be boiled down to daily standards that need to be met. A-players go through the same processes to do well. But anyone can be a winner if they have a scorecard to follow.


Think about your team's different positions. For each, write down three to five objective, trackable metrics that successful team members should complete on a daily basis. For instance, one of our company's sales metrics is the number of daily appointments made. You can then weigh each activity to develop a final score. For instance, if you had four activities, you might want to weigh each at 25%. An employee who meets two in a day would score 50%, whereas one who meets three would net a 75%.These metrics for each position will become your A-player scorecards. They're clearly defined and simple to evaluate. Someone either reaches the scorecard goals or does not. There's no middle ground. Everything's transparent between you and each of your direct reports. Employees know what you expect of them, which takes away any guesswork. It's easy to see where someone is lagging or leading, which gives you the opportunity to intervene with personalized coaching, upskilling and reskilling.Related: How to Find and Assign a Production Statistic to Every Single Employee — Even the CEO3. Put the spotlight on success storiesSuccess isn't just about reaching scorecard targets. It's about celebrating wins in big and small ways. Showing recognition improves morale and reinforces positive behavior and hard work. It shows you're paying attention, too. Pew found 57% of people who quit jobs reported feeling disrespected. What could be more respectful than putting the spotlight on good people?


Your celebrations don't have to be huge and expensive. Experiment with what works to encourage your team to strive for something a little more. Certainly, you can hand out your version of an Oscar now and then. However, just identifying and thanking top performers who keep exceeding their daily scorecard metrics can be good practice.You can use scorecard results to figure out who wins sales contests. Or you may want to up the bar and add other metrics to sweeten a contest. Never be afraid to celebrate wins just because the same people keep getting kudos. A mid-performing employee may need to see a high-performing colleague receive continual nods to finally up their game.By taking the time to consider how to lead, you'll end up becoming a much stronger leader regardless of your experience. Start by focusing on training, scorecards and celebrations — you and your team will benefit from your investment.Related: Do Your Employees Feel Recognized? 10 Powerful Ways To Set Up Employee Recognition Programs

91,The Price of Excellence: Tim Grover on Winning and Success,"Aug 7, 2023",Jeff Fenster,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-price-of-excellence-tim-grover-on-winning-and-success/456745,"
What separates champions from the ordinary? What is the path that leads to the pinnacle of success? These are questions that endlessly fascinate us, and rightfully so. Tim Grover, renowned performance coach who has transformed great athletes like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant into the legends they are today, dissects these mysteries in a compelling conversation with Jeff Fenster, the force behind everbowl and host of 'The Jeff Fenster Show'.The Solitude of SuccessGrover paints a rather unexpected picture of success: a champion, alone, basking in the glow of victory. This seeming paradox, according to Grover, is integral to achieving greatness. It's the solitude that forces champions to confront the efforts that fuel their triumph and truly appreciate their journey. This nuanced view of success upends the traditional narrative, offering a poignant look at the hidden toll of excellence.Finding Your 'Why'Another essential piece of the success puzzle that Grover emphasizes is the 'why'. Every successful person, whether an athlete, a CEO, or an entrepreneur, has a purpose that serves as the driving force behind their journey. The pursuit of a goal is meaningless without a purpose, a mission, a vision. According to Grover, this 'why' is what keeps one fueled during trying times. It's an interesting perspective that underscores the importance of purpose in any endeavor.Motivation vs Elevation: Understanding the DifferenceMost people believe motivation is the key to success. Grover challenges this notion, drawing a crucial distinction between motivation and elevation. He eloquently states, ""Motivation is the spark that gets you going. Elevation is the fire that keeps you going."" This paradigm shift reminds us that motivation is just the beginning. The fire that propels us forward, keeps us going, is the passion, the drive, the determination, and the relentless will to succeed.Counting the Cost of ExcellenceGrover doesn't sugarcoat the harsh reality of the pursuit of excellence. He lays it bare: ""Winning will cost you everything, but we will reward you with so much more."" This stark reminder underscores the commitment required to reach the pinnacle of greatness. It serves as a wake-up call to those who seek the rewards of success without being willing to pay the price.



The Indispensable Role of a CoachGrover also emphasizes the often-underestimated role of a mentor in the journey to success. He points out that even the best, like Kobe, Jordan, or LeBron, had a coach guiding them through their toughest moments. He argues for the necessity of having a guiding light to navigate the dark and challenging moments in one's journey.In conclusion, Grover's insights into the nature of success force us to question our conventional understanding. His philosophies - the importance of understanding the loneliness of success, finding one's 'why', distinguishing between motivation and elevation, acknowledging the cost of excellence, and recognizing the role of a mentor, provide a thought-provoking narrative on what it truly takes to achieve greatness. As Grover succinctly states, ""Winning will cost you everything, but we will reward you with so much more,"" reminding us of the trials and triumphs inherent in the pursuit of success.

This article originally appeared on Business Insider.In 2021, the average salary in the United States was $60,575, according to the Social Security Administration.While you might expect certain careers to bring in a substantial income because of their prestige, on-the-job demands, or the advanced skills or education they require, you might be surprised by some of the higher-paying jobs we researched.



Insider compiled a list of several of those occupations and their requirements and combed through data to uncover the salaries associated with these positions.Here are eight jobs that come with a much higher salary than you may have expected.


1. Court reporter/simultaneous captionersPeople in these jobs use ""verbatim methods and equipment to capture, store, retrieve, and transcribe pretrial and trial proceedings,"" according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.As of 2022, about 14,200 individuals were employed in this field and the mean annual salary was $70,290, or an average of $33.79 an hour.To enter the field, you must have an associate's degree or complete a two-to-three-year court-reporting program to become certified. During this time, students learn grammar, phonetics, and legal terminology, as well as how to prepare transcripts and how to use tools such as a stenomask and a stenotype machine.Many community colleges or technical schools offer these certification programs to prepare students for the required licensing exam and typing tests. On-the-job training is also an integral part of the job and varies based on employer.


2. Captain at Trader Joe'sTopping Forbes 2019 America's Best Employers list and consistently ranked as a top company to work for, Trader Joe's employs captains who can bag a six-figure base salary of $104,756 with additional pay of about $16,351, for a grand total of $121,107 a year.The captain serves as the leader of a store, directing strategy and developing the crew. Captains are always promoted from within the ranks from the mate, or assistant store leader, level, the Trader Joe's website says.A recent classified ad for an open captain position said a bachelor's degree in hospitality, retail, or a similar field is preferred, and a minimum of two years of managerial experience in a retail setting is required.3. Elevator and escalator installer/repairerTasked with assembling, installing, repairing, and maintaining electric and hydraulic commercial freight and passenger elevators, as well as escalators, this job requires technicians to work in tight, cramped spaces such as elevator shafts and mechanical rooms, often at considerable heights.


Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 24,380 technicians are employed in this field and earn a mean annual salary of $93,960, or an average of $45.17 an hour, more than twice the hourly rate of an emergency medical technician.Candidates must have a high-school diploma or the equivalent to be considered, and nearly all technicians learn the skills of the trade through an apprenticeship. Most states also require techs to be licensed to provide services.4. Car-wash manager at Buc-ee'sEverything at Buc-ee's, the largest gas station in the world, is big, including employee compensation. In fact, it's such a source of pride at this convenience chain, it publicly posts hourly wages and salaries inside the stores for all to see.A car-wash manager earns a $125,000 annual base salary along with a 401k with a match of up to 6%; mental, dental, and vision insurance; and three weeks of PTO that employees have the option of using, cashing in, or rolling over.


All candidates must have at least three years of car-wash-management experience as well as proficiency with both hand and electric tools. A bachelor's degree in business or management is preferred.5. Technical writerTechnical writing is an ideal position for someone who can understand and digest complex technical information and then break it down into simple, manageable steps in paper and digital instruction manuals, how-to guides, FAQ pages, and other supporting materials and resources.These writers are commonly employed in the computer, science, and tech sectors and earn a mean annual salary of $86,760, or an average of $41.71 an hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.While it is not always required, candidates typically need a bachelor's degree to enter the field, and it helps to have a technical background.


6. Bingo managerResponsible for overseeing and managing bingo games at a casino, game hall, or parlor, this individual approves jackpots and payouts in accordance with all local, state, and federal regulations to ensure compliance.According to recent information from Salary.com, bingo managers can earn between $51,965 and $112,599 a year, with a mean salary of $70,241.A high-school diploma or its equivalent may be required, along with three to five years of experience in the field.7. Heavy and tractor-trailer truck driverThese long-haul drivers are responsible for transporting goods, which may include hazardous waste, over intercity routes that often span several states, in trucks that typically weigh more than 26,000 pounds.


In 2022, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics listed the mean annual salary for truck drivers as $53,090, or $25.52 an hour. But Walmart, which was already paying its first-year long-haul drivers a starting salary of $88,000, bumped its base pay to between $95,000 and $110,000 to meet growing demand.Candidates must have a high-school diploma and a commercial driver's license (CDL), which requires a driver-training course that can take up to six months to complete before taking a three-part test.Typically, there's also a period of on-the-job training where new drivers may be shadowed by a more experienced driver.8. MRI technologist/radiologistTechnologists are responsible for monitoring the safety and comfort of patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging. Their duties may include positioning patients in preparation for the scan, shielding exposed areas, explaining procedures, operating the scanner equipment, reviewing and evaluating images, and entering patient data into the computer. They may also be responsible for injecting a dye or contrast media into patients in order for the images to appear on the scanner.


The mean annual salary is $81,530, or $39.20 an hour, and 38,380 individuals were employed in this role in 2022, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.Candidates must have an associate's degree, and most employers require technologists to be certified, which can take up to two years of training in an accredited program.

93,7 Empowering Strategies for Leaders Transitioning to New Roles,"Jul 28, 2023",Tugba Yanaz,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/7-empowering-strategies-for-leaders-transitioning-to-new/455903,"
In the dynamic world of work, more than 50 million workers made a bold move in 2022, breaking records by quitting their jobs for better opportunities amid a hot labor market. Even in the face of economic concerns in 2023, numerous executives stepped away from their long-tenured positions to embrace fresh challenges and greater growth.As a leadership coach and founder of LEAD+VISION, I specialize in fostering unshakable inner confidence and cultivating high-performing team cultures through vision-based coaching. Throughout 2023, a recurring theme in my coaching practice was preparing executives for successful job transitions.Leaving a familiar, long-tenured job can feel like an overwhelming decision. Rebuilding strong relationships with peers and management, understanding new success metrics, fostering a high-performing team and upholding a reputable leadership image become crucial goals upon joining a new company. It's natural for impostor syndrome to rear its head, whispering doubts like, ""What has gotten me here may not get me there.""



But fret not! Armed with the right strategies, you can navigate this change with unwavering confidence and ignite success at every turn. Join me as we delve into seven empowering strategies to help you shine in your new senior executive role:1. Align expectations for success: Setting the foundationFirst, sit down with your manager and clarify what success looks like in the next 6-12 months. Understand the key performance indicators (KPIs) and company goals. This alignment sets the stage for you to lead effectively, with a clear vision of what's expected without getting lost in the noise of the daily business. Here are some guiding questions that can help during your first kick-off meeting:


What would success look like for you related to my team in the next six and 12 months?What are the team's current goals and objectives, and how are they aligned with the company strategy?How is my team's performance measured currently, and what are the key performance indicators or metrics that are used?What are the team's biggest challenges or pain points from your perspective, and how can we work together to address them?Related: How to Engage Employees Through Your Company Vision Statement2. Listen actively, grow exponentiallyEmbrace the power of listening — a skill often underestimated. As you step into your new role, silence that inner critique trying to prove your worth, a fear-driven act I often observe with leaders in transition. Instead, tune in to your employees, peers, management team and cross-functional teams. Every individual's insight is a puzzle that builds a complete picture of your new organization. It's not about you but how well you can orchestrate information and action between these stakeholders.Related: Why Embracing Human Design Will Transform Your Workplace for Success3. Start collecting data and notice patternsListening is not enough; you need to gather data systematically. Keep track of feedback, suggestions and observations from various interactions. Look for response patterns and trends to identify common themes, challenges and opportunities. This data-driven approach will help you make informed decisions as you progress. You are the orchestrator of information without bias coming in with a fresh set of eyes, able to steer the ship in the right direction.

Break down your goals into manageable milestones for the first 30, 60, 90 and 180 days. This will keep you focused, organized and motivated, ensuring steady progress and measurable achievements.5. Own your experience and leverage your strengthsAcknowledge the unique experience and skills you bring to the table. Embrace your expertise and use it to your advantage. At the same time, be open to learning from your new environment. Cultivate a growth mindset, constantly seeking opportunities to develop personally and professionally.Related: How to Build a Strengths-Based Culture by Unlocking the Power of Employee Potential


6. Communicate transparently and clearlyClear and transparent communication is the lifeblood of a thriving organization. As a senior executive, your words carry weight, and as the new leader in an organization, building trust with your team and peers is the foundation for your success. Be honest, open and approachable. Keep your team informed about your learnings, progress, newly formed vision and any changes. Transparent communication fosters trust, camaraderie and a shared sense of purpose. It also empowers your team to challenge your assumptions and help build a high-performing team culture.7. Create a development plan and hire a leadership coachHiring a leadership coach during your transition can be among the most rewarding and empowering investments. The right coach can ask you powerful questions to observe your thoughts and guide you with a broad toolkit of best practices to confidently develop yourself and your team.Ensure that your leadership coach has real-life business experience and can simultaneously act as a coach and mentor. Identify areas where you have room to grow and develop. It's natural to have some gaps in your skills or knowledge. Don't shy away from them or pretend to know, fearing being perceived as incompetent; instead, create a development plan. Seek learning opportunities within the organization, workshops, or mentoring to bridge those gaps actively. Find a work buddy, a long-tenured peer or executive, who can be the conduit for institutional knowledge, best practices or translator for challenges. Leverage your team's expertise to fill in your gaps until you build enough confidence and learn.Stepping into a new role can be both stimulating and challenging. Embrace the opportunities that come with change, and remember that growth happens outside your comfort zone. Trust yourself, trust your team and trust the process. You will thrive in your new role by aligning expectations, actively listening, collecting data, creating a plan, owning your experience, communicating transparently and developing yourself.


As you embark on this transformative journey, remember you are not alone. Every great leader faces new challenges and uncertainties. But with these strategies in your toolkit, you are equipped to soar to new heights. Embrace the possibilities, inspire your team and lead confidently.

94,3 Lies We Need to Stop Telling Ourselves About Work,"Jul 27, 2023",Bruce Feiller,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/lies-that-we-tell-ourselves-about-work-entrepreneur/454707,"
Cornell Thomas lost his police officer father in New Jersey to cancer when he was four, and he grew up watching his dental assistant mother struggle to support her family. ""Once, in sixth grade, I asked if we could order pizza,"" he says. ""Mom gave me a look that said, No. Don't ask again.""To help out, Cornell turned to entrepreneurship. ""My mother had these packs of WeightWatchers cookies that tasted like death,"" he says. Cornell put on his baseball uniform and sold the cookies to his neighbors for 50 cents a pack. ""I made $50. It was like a million bucks.""After his dream of playing pro basketball was cut short, Cornell returned to his entrepreneurial roots, opening a youth academy and giving motivational speeches. But his childhood fear of deprivation still haunted him: ""I was an adult before I realized I had a horrible relationship with money. I would cry rather than ask people to pay me.""

95,How to Improve Your Relationships — Both Personally and Professionally,"Jul 26, 2023",Amy M Chambers,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-improve-your-relationships-both-personally-and/454062,"
Almost everyone I know wants a better relationship with someone. Usually, it's a spouse or significant other, but many of us also want better relationships with our direct reports, boss or peers. At home, we often want better relationships with our parents, kids or friends.Lately, as I've coached clients, I find myself giving some of the same advice repeatedly. Here are the top four practices that have consistently resurfaced in my conversations with clients.Related: How Can Entrepreneurs Improve Their Personal Relationships? 8 Experts Weigh in.



1. Think about ""love"" as a verb, not a nounAll too often, we talk about ""love"" as if it's a noun. Something to be found, something that happens to us. The most successful people I know don't view love as a noun; rather, they treat it as a verb. They practice it. Don't wait for others to do things that make you feel love. Proactively choose love. Act lovingly. When we show others love, it's amazing how much more we simply feel love. Love, like happiness, is something that we can create ourselves. Ask yourself, often, ""what would a loving person do right now?"" Whatever the answer is, do it.Recently, I had a difference of opinion with my partner, David, before we both started our workdays. For most of that day, I didn't feel much love toward him. In the late afternoon, however, I realized that I could simply choose to love him. Typically, David does our grocery shopping. That day, even though I felt angry and frustrated over our discussion that morning, I got in the car and headed to the grocery store myself. I knew David had a busy day planned and doing all our grocery shopping that week would greatly help him. By the time I returned home, I already felt much more love for him.


2. Regularly ask (and talk) about feelingsSo often, when there's a difference of opinion, we forget to both ask about feelings and share our own. Saying: ""I feel alone, hurt, disappointed or surprised because of X"" is much different than saying: ""I don't like it when you do X."" For most of us, talking about our feelings is like emotional oxygen and psychological air. When we get to talk about our feelings, we often feel seen, heard, valued and appreciated. Hearing about someone else's feelings and sharing our own reminds us that we're on the same team, not opposing sides of a battlefield.After hearing the feelings of others, it often makes sense to paraphrase or repeat back what you heard; this is a way of checking for understanding. You might say: ""It sounds like you're feeling betrayed because of this; is that right? Gosh, I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be so difficult."" Don't forget to both ask how others feel and also share your own feelings. Once feelings are on the table, it's amazing how quickly we can move toward solutions.Related: Dealing With Feelings: How to Be an Emotionally-Aware Leader3. When you screw up, apologize authentically and genuinelyWe are human. We all make mistakes. When you do, apologize, but do so genuinely. First, get specific. Don't just say: ""I'm sorry for what happened Saturday night."" Instead, let the other person know you're truly sorry for exactly what happened by stating it, out loud. Also, take the time to (once again) state how you imagine (or know) the other person feels. Acknowledge how your behavior affected them.


Finally, make a point to commit to change. Talk about what you'll do to ensure that the same thing won't happen again. You might say: ""I am so sorry that I was late to our appointment and kept you waiting for 25 minutes. I can see I didn't respect your time, and this made you feel like I don't care about our relationship as much as you do. I value our relationship very much, so that's not going to happen again. Going forward, I'm going to set an alarm before I need to leave for our meetings, and also put a reminder on both my personal and professional calendars."" Additionally, taking the time to apologize in person or over the phone (instead of via email or text) can carry a lot of weight. This shows the relationship really matters to us, and we're serious about our apology.Finally, don't make excuses or blame outside factors for what happened. Sure, the weather or traffic might've helped cause your tardiness, but citing those things in your apology only shifts responsibility away from you, and what you're wanting to show is that you're ready to take accountability and own it. So, remain focused on what more you could've done; not anything else.Related: The 3 Most Important Phrases In the Entrepreneurial Vocabulary4. Recognize and respect your differences with othersAll too often, people say things like: ""She shouldn't have done this. I would never do that."" We tend to think that our way is the right way — or worse, the only way. Don't fall into this trap. Beliefs, values and paradigms are not all universal. Remember that the person you're interacting with probably learned different social norms than you did when you were growing up.


Avoid judging those who don't share your default ways of behaving. Instead, get curious. Take the time to ask questions and learn about why someone does what they do. Then, respectfully talk through your way of doing it (and your why). The best relationships are ones where two people or a group decide together, as a team, what the established norms and rules for the relationship should be.When we practice these four things in relationships, our relationships not only work better and last longer, but we're also able to move through conflict more quickly. Many people who follow these four practices find their relationships can withstand more conflict or confusion, and misunderstandings are easily recoverable.

96,10 Real Ways to Build Self-Discipline and Reach Your Goals,"Jul 23, 2023",Rose Leadem,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/7-ways-to-gain-self-discipline-and-strive-towards-greatness/300212,"
Understanding the path to achieving goals requires recognizing the profound significance of self-discipline. Self-discipline — the ability to control one's feelings and overcome weaknesses — plays an instrumental role in virtually every area of your life.From maintaining healthy habits and managing time effectively to enhancing productivity and fostering personal growth, self-discipline is the cornerstone that supports the architecture of success.However, many individuals grapple with a lack of self-discipline.This can lead to procrastination, impulsive decisions and detrimental habits that impede progress and growth. It can affect personal and professional life, causing missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential.To move from aspiration to achievement, it's important to build and practice self-discipline.Related: Discipline Is What Leads to Success | EntrepreneurWhat is self-discipline?At its core, self-discipline refers to the capacity to pursue what one thinks is right despite temptations to abandon it. It's about aligning your actions with your thoughts and values, even when it's challenging. The ability to discipline yourself is key for reaching your goals.Self-discipline is a catalyst for both success and well-being. It guides you to establish and stick to healthy habits, managing your resources — like time and energy — effectively. A person who has mastered self-discipline can overcome the lure of immediate gratification in pursuit of long-term goals, which is a key trait of successful people.Moreover, self-discipline plays a crucial role in time management and eliminating procrastination. By training yourself to focus on your tasks and responsibilities, you can resist distractions and delay gratification, reducing procrastination significantly. This increased productivity can lead to improved performance, whether in your studies, work or personal projects.Additionally, self-discipline has a positive impact on mental health and overall well-being. Discipline can reduce stress and tension as it promotes a sense of self-control and direction. It fosters resilience and determination, fortifying mental and emotional health.Related: 7 Myths About Discipline You Need to Stop Believing | EntrepreneurHow to build self-disciplineBuilding self-discipline is a journey, not a destination. It's about making a conscious effort to improve each day, acknowledging setbacks as part of the process and celebrating small victories. While the path to self-discipline can be challenging, the rewards are well worth the effort and struggle.Here are 10 different ways to build self-discipline:1. Start smallBuilding self-discipline can be an overwhelming task if approached all at once. Begin by setting small, achievable goals. This could be as simple as waking up ten minutes earlier each day or committing to a daily 15-minute workout.Achieving these goals can create a sense of accomplishment and boost your confidence in your ability to exercise discipline. Self-discipline is doing what needs to be done — even when you don't feel like it. 2. Eliminate bad habitsHabits, especially detrimental ones, play a significant role in our lives and can often undermine self-discipline. Start by identifying your bad habits — perhaps excessive social media browsing, unhealthy snacking or procrastination.Once identified, work on strategies to eliminate them. This could involve setting specific rules (such as no social media during work hours), using apps that track or limit the habit or substituting the bad habit with a more positive one. 3. Develop good habitsOn the flip side, creating and maintaining good habits can substantially boost self-discipline. Incorporate healthy routines into your daily life, like regular exercise, reading or practicing mindfulness.An effective approach is to employ the principles outlined in James Clear's book Atomic Habits. Clear emphasizes the importance of making small changes that add up to significant results over time. A practice as simple as keeping a water bottle at your desk to increase water intake, or reading a page of a book each night before sleep, can make a big difference in the long run.4. Practice self-controlSelf-control is the foundation of self-discipline. Increasing self-control can help reduce impulsivity, making it easier to stick to your goals and avoid distractions.Practical tips to enhance self-control include techniques like the ""pause and plan"" strategy where, when faced with a decision, you take a moment to reflect on the outcomes before acting.Mindfulness practices can also enhance self-control by promoting greater self-awareness. Tools such as meditation apps or guided breathing exercises can help cultivate mindfulness 5. Exercise regularlyRegular physical exercise is not just a boon to your health; it also fosters discipline. The commitment to a consistent workout schedule necessitates self-control and determination, key components of self-discipline.Exercise also generates a sense of accomplishment that can spill over into other areas of your life, promoting the creation of new habits and the achievement of small goals. 6. Establish a specific goal-setting processSelf-discipline thrives on a clear vision. Setting short-term and long-term goals provides direction and focus. Ensure your goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) to make them effective.Short-term goals can act as stepping stones towards your long-term objectives, breaking them down into manageable chunks, which makes the process less daunting and more achievable. 7. Step out of your comfort zoneSelf-discipline involves regularly pushing beyond your comfort zone. Facing new challenges or trying unfamiliar tasks can bolster your mental fortitude and adaptability.Whether it's public speaking, learning a new skill or taking on additional responsibilities at work, stepping out of your comfort zone promotes growth and enhances discipline. 8. Limit social media and junk foodMinimizing distractions and unhealthy choices are essential for self-regulation, an integral part of self-discipline. Spending excessive time on social media can lead to procrastination and time mismanagement.Likewise, frequent consumption of junk food can impact your physical well-being and weaken your self-control. Establish boundaries on social media use and opt for healthier food alternatives to support your self-discipline journey.9. Practice self-awarenessSelf-awareness is the foundation of self-discipline. Being cognizant of your strengths, weaknesses and triggers can guide your behavior and decision-making.Regular introspection or practices like journaling can help you better understand your patterns and reactions, enabling you to make conscious changes that strengthen your self-discipline.10. Use apps and toolsTechnology can be a powerful ally in your quest for self-discipline. Time management apps can help you track and manage your time better, while to-do list tools can assist in organizing and prioritizing tasks.LinkedIn can be used for professional growth and networking, keeping you focused on your career goals. Podcasts offer a wealth of knowledge and motivational content for self-improvement and discipline.Additionally, habit-tracking apps can help you in establishing and maintaining good habits.Related: 14 Ways to Improve Your Self-Discipline (Infographic) | EntrepreneurHow do you overcome obstacles while building self-discipline?Building self-discipline is a gradual process, demanding sustained effort and the capacity to navigate various hurdles. Chief among these obstacles are perfectionism and the fear of failure. Inculcating self-discipline means accepting that mistakes and setbacks are inherent components of the journey, not detours. They're opportunities to learn, refine and grow. Instead of striving for unreachable perfection, it's more pragmatic and productive to aim for continuous progress.Using affirmationsAffirmations can be a crucial tool in combating negative self-talk, a main roadblock in the path to self-discipline.Crafting positive self-dialogue and practicing affirmations can operate as a quick ""pick-me-up"" and help to foster a positive growth mindset. This mindset encourages a belief in your potential to improve, amplifies resilience and sustains motivation even in challenging times.Strategies for boosting self-disciplineWhen the journey becomes steep and you feel a lack of self-discipline, having effective strategies can be a lifesaver.Employing simple techniques like the ""5-second rule,"" where you countdown from five and then compel yourself into action, can initiate momentum. Alternatively, the ""two-minute rule"" suggests that if a task takes two minutes or less, you should accomplish it immediately.These strategies aren't just about getting tasks done; they're about creating a rhythm of action that discourages procrastination and inspires productivity. Over time, these small, consistent actions can build into a robust and resilient habit of self-discipline, transforming your work and every area of your life.Related: 8 Ways to Create the Discipline Habit | EntrepreneurFueling your goalsSelf-discipline is a vital component of achieving life goals. Its significance extends to all areas of life, affecting personal growth, success, mental health and overall well-being.It's important to remember that building self-discipline takes time and requires patience, consistent effort and resilience. It involves overcoming obstacles, facing fears and continually striving for improvement.Embrace the journey of self-discipline today — start small, be consistent and remember that each step you take is a step closer to becoming a more self-disciplined person. Commit to your self-improvement journey and let the power of self-discipline lead you to your goals.If you're interested in learning more about achieving goals, check out the other resources currently available at Entrepreneur.

98,A Simple Practice to Overcome the Fear of Uncertainty and Daily Stress,"Jul 20, 2023",Adam Markel,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/3-steps-to-overcome-the-fear-of-uncertainty-and-daily-stress/455777,"
In times of chaos and uncertainty, we often find ourselves overwhelmed, reacting impulsively to the stresses of the moment. It's only later that we may realize we could have responded with more grace, poise and thoughtfulness. This lack of resilience often stems from depletion — when we are physically, emotionally or mentally drained, we become more likely to lash out or overreact when faced with unexpected challenges.Resilience is the key to responding thoughtfully to unexpected changes. However, depletion can hinder our ability to maintain a calm and collected demeanor in the face of adversity. As exemplified by Will Smith's outburst at the Academy Awards last year, even successful and wealthy individuals can struggle to maintain resilience. Therefore, it is essential to replenish our reserves so that we can navigate whatever struggles come our way.Related: How to Let Go of Fear in Times of Uncertainty



Resilience and daily ritualsThe Resilient Leader Assessment, a survey of over 5,000 business leaders and professionals, revealed that many individuals are operating with depleted reserves of mental, emotional, physical and even spiritual resilience. Of those surveyed, only 6% exhibited what we call ""change-proof resilience,"" with 34% being vulnerable to acute and chronic stress. However, hope remains — by establishing rituals to renew and replenish ourselves in these four resilience zones (physical, mental, emotional and spiritual), we can build our capacity to regenerate our energy reserves incrementally.It is crucial to practice resilience before we need it. We can do so by engaging in daily rituals such as exercising, meditating and taking breaks in the midst of our busy work schedules. With practice, we can also learn to react to unexpected situations in a more collected manner.


Resilience is not just about bouncing back, but embracing change with unwavering strength and adapting to the winds of transformation.Related: 7 Ways to Build Resiliency in Challenging Times3 simple steps to help you overcome the fear of uncertainty and daily stressOur natural response to uncertainty and adversity is often fear-based, leading to a primitive fight-or-flight response that impairs our critical thinking skills. One way to inoculate yourself against fear generated by uncertainty is a strategy I call Pause-Ask-Choose. This is a method to help you reframe and discover opportunities when you are faced with any kind of challenge. When you feel stress and tension rising in your body, use that feeling as a reminder to:Pause: Stop and take several deep breaths. Doing this is like rebooting your computer when it is slogging along under the strain of all the tabs you have open before it freezes. This pause is meant to create space for you to be conscious of this next, very important step.Ask: This is where you can reframe and discover the deeper meaning in whatever challenge you are facing. Reframe the moment for your growth by asking questions like: ""What's the creative opportunity here?"" or ""What don't I see?"" or ""What can I be grateful for?"". These types of questions might not provide the immediate solution or answer you're looking for, but what they will do is provide a new perspective, which will undoubtedly open your mind to see the situation through an entirely new set of lenses. The effect will be cascading, and soon enough, the entire situation will look differently to you — just from pausing and asking.Choose: Choose to ritualize your recovery for higher performance in the future. When we choose, we are consciously ritualizing small, daily practices for our personal recovery to create mental, emotional, physical and spiritual integration and harmony. This choice to deal with our depletion before it becomes a problem is truly a game-changer for our levels of energy and even our attitude and mindset going forward.The more we practice, the easier it becomes to replace our fight-or-flight responses and ritualize Pause-Ask-Choose as our default coping strategy. Taken together, the three steps give us a simple, repeatable formula for becoming a resilient agent of change, instead of a victim to it.Related: Mastering the Art of the Reframe Is the Key to Building Resilience. Here's How to Do It.


It may not happen overnight, but with consistent effort, we can rewire our default reactions and develop a new mindset that embraces change as an opportunity for growth. As we become more adept at pausing to reflect, asking ourselves empowering questions and making conscious choices to recover from depletion before it drags us down, we shift from being passive recipients of change to active agents who shape our own destinies. With each successful implementation of this formula, we build our capacity to navigate the ever-evolving landscapes of work and life and emerge stronger, wiser and more resilient than ever before.Each step in the right direction is one step closer than you were before.By choosing to ritualize our recovery through small, daily practices that promote mental, emotional, physical and spiritual harmony, we grow in our capacity to handle whatever is happening in the moment — resiliently. By prioritizing our well-being and replenishing our energy reserves, we can face unexpected challenges with calm, grace and poise. And in that moment, we have gained a distinct resilience advantage in a world that isn't going to slow down anytime soon.

Bold, assertive self-confidence can be conceptualized as an unshakable faith in one's abilities, skills and competence. It's a firm conviction in one's potential to navigate obstacles, achieve set objectives and make informed decisions. More than simple self-assurance, bold, assertive self-confidence involves proactive action based on your deeply held beliefs, instilling a sense of agency and control over your life's trajectory.This dynamic construct plays a pivotal role in pursuing personal and professional success. Bold, assertive self-confidence shapes how we perceive and react to challenges, transforming potential roadblocks into opportunities for growth and learning. It enables us to take calculated risks, fosters resilience and promotes a growth mindset. When cultivated and harnessed, assertive self-confidence acts as an internal compass, guiding us toward our goals and visions, even amidst uncertainty and change. It's the fuel that powers our journey, empowering us to envision success and actualize it. Hence, assertive self-confidence is not merely an attribute; it's a catalyst that propels us toward our desired future.Related: 6 Actions You Can Take Every Day to Build Your Self-Confidence

However — bold, assertive self-confidence allows individuals to perceive these adversities as opportunities for learning and growth.

This reciprocal dynamic fosters a culture of shared confidence, leading to enhanced team performance, improved problem-solving abilities, and, ultimately, collective success.Promotes calculated risk-taking: Bold, assertive self-confidence enables you to navigate uncertain business terrains and new situations confidently. This mindset encourages informed, calculated risk-taking — a necessary ingredient for significant business breakthroughs and innovation.Fosters a growth mindset: Bold, assertive self-confidence nurtures a growth mindset, a belief in the potential for personal and professional evolution.

This article originally appeared on Business Insider. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hannah Dixon, a 35-year-old founder of the virtual assistant training resource Digital Nomad Kit, from Guanajuato, Mexico about her advice for becoming a six-figure virtual assistant. It's been edited for length and clarity.Becoming a successful virtual assistant — or VA — requires more than a laptop and a dream. In fact, I don't think this career is for just anyone. It's a career that calls into question the traditional way of working.



In my years as a VA myself, I juggled a multitude of admin, tech, and creative tasks for clients all over the globe. It wasn't always easy, but it got easier in time with mentorship and unwavering motivation to achieve a lifestyle that afforded me flexibility and freedom.After living and working in 58 countries and creating six-figure income years, members of an online community I led started asking me how they too could see success as virtual assistants. Through this, I was not only able to create a sustainable and rewarding career for myself but found a passion for helping others navigate the same path.


Here are five steps I recommend every aspiring VA take to pave the way to six-figure success:1. Overcome imposter syndrome to develop an entrepreneurial mindset As a virtual assistant, you're not an employee, you're a business owner — and it's essential to embrace this shift in perspective.This can stir up feelings of imposter syndrome, but this is a call to strengthen your self-trust. Develop confidence in your abilities through learning, applying what you learn, and remembering that you're offering valuable services.Take time to understand your working style, strengths, and weaknesses, and not letting fears — like a fear of failure, or even fear of success — hold you back from doing. Moving forward with ""imperfect action"" is better than standing still.


Someone recently told me they'd applied for over 50 traditional jobs and had no responses, then said that they wanted a job for ""security."" Being a VA is no less secure than a traditional job, and you have so much more space in terms of who you work with, how you work with them, and what types of tasks you do.2. Specialize and design your service stack to command higher ratesWhen breaking into this space, many people try to be everything to everyone, which often leads to engaging no one. The scope of what a VA can offer is broad, and it can be beneficial to specialize — if not right out the gate, then over time.I've seen VAs go from doing okay to creating six-figure incomes once they committed to a niche, and this was my experience as well. There's nothing wrong with having a range of proficiencies in your back pocket, but how you market yourself in terms of your core niche plays a big role in the rates that you can command.If a client wants to grow their email list and run an email marketing campaign, would they hire a general VA or one who specializes in email marketing and is proficient in email marketing software? Clients will pay a premium for that peace of mind and not needing to give you lessons in speaking their language.


When figuring out how to specialize your services, I recommend having a go-to ""service stack."" These are the few (up to five) complementary services you're well-versed in and can lead with. You'll likely offer more services once you start working with clients, but having a small handful of areas identified from the get-go will keep you at the top of potential clients' minds for these particular strengths.You can also choose to niche by the types of people and organizations you work with, such as by industry and/or values; for example, choosing to work with health and wellness professionals, or with people who are passionate about elevating voices of oppressed groups, regardless of industry.3. Create a strong first impression with a killer online portfolioYour online presence is your first impression as a VA, and it's something your potential clients are going to heavily take into account. While you can't shake hands, you can showcase your skills and professionalism in unique and fun ways.In the VA space it's unusual to be asked for a resume, or even formal education. Often a compelling online portfolio and a robust online presence can speak much louder. This low barrier to entry makes it an ideal pathway to working online.


The easiest way to build an online portfolio as a new VA when you have little to no previous experience is to be the portfolio. For example, want to offer writing services as part of your service stack? Building a portfolio of writing examples can be as simple as starting your own blog or newsletter. Your social media posts and captions are equally relevant with the added bonus that potential clients can easily see that you're producing quality writing on a consistent basis. If it gets good engagement, that's a cherry on top.You can get creative with how you showcase your skills and be authentic in how you represent yourself and your work in your portfolio. People work with people, and your creative approaches to your overall online presence will be a feather in your cap as a soft skill that clients will appreciate.As you grow your VA business, use your journey as evidence of your abilities. Every step you take in building your business can become part of your portfolio.4. Do VA-specific networkingIt's not enough to set up a profile on gig sites and wait for clients to come to you. In my VA training programs, I actively advocate against these as a go-to due to their reputation for steeply undervaluing the skilled work of VAs. successful VAs understand the power of networking, as building strong relationships within your industry can lead to valuable opportunities and referrals.


Join online communities, attend relevant events (which can be virtual), seek mentorship, and don't underestimate the power of connecting with other VAs. In the VA world, your peers aren't your competition; they're a supportive network of individuals who understand your journey. If you're not willing to support others, you can't reasonably expect a big turnout for your own efforts.In fact, testament to the power of networking over the years: in my training program, I'm still sharing exclusive jobs from clients, who to this day come to me for VA services. My reputation has expanded over the years through the meaningful networking I've nurtured since day one. Another advantage is sharing high-paying job opportunities.5. Be an ""innovator"" VA, not just an ""executor"" VAThe difference between a hobbyist VA and a six-figure earning VA often comes down to the client experience they provide. I always say there are the ""executor"" VAs who simply complete tasks, and there are ""innovator"" VAs who set themselves apart by becoming an integral part of their client's business. The latter are the ones who become high earners.The number-one thing that contributed to my, and my learners', six-figure success was providing a quality client experience. You want your clients coming back for more, signing longer agreements, upping your pay, and referring you out. This virtuous cycle starts with how you make them feel.


Delivering a VIP client experience comes down to the small details, such as investing time to understand your clients' businesses, goals, challenges, and unique personalities; communicating effectively; and always striving to exceed their expectations.You can boost client experience by making things easier for them. Simplify your interactions and requests from clients at every opportunity, for example, by making it easy for clients to pay you and ensuring they don't have to jump through hoops.Look for opportunities to dazzle and delight! I had a client who loved Shakespeare, so I used a translation website to turn my end of the week reports into Shakespearean English and she was over the moon. Taking a moment to do something special in celebration of a victory or significant date can go a long way too. It doesn't have to be an expensive gift, but bonus points if it's something they need or something that reflects their personality and makes them say, ""They really get me.""Strive to exceed expectations doesn't mean working overtime — it does mean using a high level of awareness to start anticipating a client's needs. Be the VA that when asked for something, you're able to say ""already done!"" because you just knew it was going to be a thing.


It's this level of commitment and service that can elevate you to becoming an indispensable asset to your clients and allow you to not only grow your income independently, but also raise your rates in your longer-term contracts too. Even if it's your first client on a small project, treat them exceptionally well.

This story originally appeared on Business Insider.Before I knew it, I had destroyed my life. I was a rail-thin 19-year-old, and I was so poor, I spent every morning walking through fast food drive-thrus so I could collect enough change to buy a candy bar and a soda to hold me over for the day.I got a job at In-N-Out Burger, and after a year of working there, I asked my boss for a raise. He told me instead that I should join the morning crew. Little did I know that meant I would be scrubbing toilets at 5 a.m. and waiting for the Arizona sun to come up so I could clean the parking lot.



The author when he was working at In-N-Out Burger. Courtesy of Michael ClendenenI found myself scrubbing concrete by day and doing punk-rock shows by night. Meanwhile, my friends were graduating college, getting married, and having kids.By 22, my life was even worse. I was living out of a single motel room with five other people and a chihuahua to save money. I didn't even have an internet connection — let alone a smartphone, a computer, or a car.But I turned it all around, and I'm now a six-figure copywriter and direct-response marketer who's worked with Fortune 100 companies, USA BMX, political campaigns, and more, strategizing marketing and copy. Here's how I did it by teaching myself and sending out letters.In 2017, a friend asked me to write an ad selling his Mustang in exchange for 10% of the saleI'd never written an ad before, so I borrowed my friend's phone and Googled ""how to write a good advertisement."" I discovered a newsletter called ""The Gary Halbert Letter."" I read one of the newsletters, in which he said he could charge a client $15,000 for a letter he wrote in his underwear at his kitchen table.


That was when I knew this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.I read every newsletter Halbert had. When I was done with those, I'd sit on the floor at Barnes & Noble and read all the marketing books in the store because I couldn't afford to buy them.Next, I had to figure out how to find clients.Sending letters changed everythingThe No. 1 strategy I learned from Halbert was to send letters in the mail to businesses to land clients. But it wasn't that easy in the beginning because I didn't have many resources.


I started writing copy at the library. One friend would drop me off in the morning, and another would help me get home. I was writing my letters by hand, and when I ran out of paper, the kind librarian would give me printer paper to write on.I used the Reference USA database — now known as Data Axle — that the library had to find the addresses of businesses I wanted to work with. I landed my first client through a letter. I decided I would work on commission only, and only with businesses that I had a personal vested interest in.My letters were so effective, I didn't feel the need to jump on the social-media trainIn a world of content creators but without consistent internet access at my disposal, letters were my only option, which worked in my favor and made me stand out.One of the first groups of people I started working with was chiropractors because I felt strongly about the work they did. When I was younger, I'd been in several car accidents, and I had scoliosis. My treatment from a chiropractor helped me heal, and that's how I opened my letter.


I didn't talk about all of the things that I could do for them — I told chiropractors in my area why I was passionate about their work and why I was emotionally invested in them, and I gave them the opportunity to explore working together. It was honest and built instant rapport.These are the same principles that I use in my clients' copy now. I still work with chiropractors, but I've expanded to working with relationship coaches, data scientists, and anxiety coaches. I also coach other copywriters on both their copywriting skills and obtaining clients using letters.I now make between $8,000 and $17,000 per month in profitI work around 35 hours a week, and my income has increased as I've brought on more clients. My work brings in between $40,000 and $100,000 per month on average for my clients.I now have my own place filled with furniture that I bought. I have a successful business without spending all of my time on social media, and I just turned 27.


Even to this day, when I want to bring on new clients, I send out a new batch of letters. Snail mail saved my life and completely changed my future.

103,The Entrepreneur's Guide to Crafting a Successful Future,"Jun 28, 2023",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-entrepreneurs-guide-to-crafting-a-successful-future/454849,"
I'm going to tell you a quick story.And although it starts off with my experiences, if you stick around I'll teach you how you can apply the same process to achieving your highest ambitions. I know, that sounds lofty, but you'd be surprised how many successful people use the exact same approach.So, here's my story. A friend of mine recently asked a simple question that led me to an unexpected revelation: ""Why do you always wear black clothing?""My first response wasn't too eloquent. I simply said, ""I dunno, that's just my thing.""But then it made me wonder, why is that my thing? That caused me to go down a rabbit hole to the moment it all began. It was 2007 and I was working out at Crunch Gym in Park Slope, Brooklyn.



I was always in good shape during my college years, but I started to fall off once I moved to New York City. So, I decided to get back in the gym and shake the rust off. Like most guys, the first thing I wanted to do was hit the bench press, which meant I had to wait.And while I was waiting this guy walked by me and he immediately made an impression. He was around my height, 6'4"", and had similar features to me as well. But, there were two big differences. He was at least 15 years older than me, and the dude was in great shape. I'm still impressed just thinking about it. You could tell he took his fitness seriously and had dedicated years to building himself up.At the time I was 29 years old and it was great to have a real example of how I could look at his age if I just stuck with it. So, I used him as a blueprint to copy. I would secretly study his workouts and then do the exact same routine the next day. I also noticed that he was constantly chewing gum as he worked out so I picked up that habit too.Oh, and one last thing: He only wore black clothing.


As you may have guessed, I started buying black workout clothes too. Eventually everything from my shoes to my wristbands were black. It was like a uniform I would put on, and it would instantly get me in the zone to do my best work in the gym.Around the same time I started working at tech companies with a more relaxed dress code. Since I was able to wear t-shirts and hoodies to work it made sense to put on clothes I could wear at the gym too.I could change more quickly when it was time to work out, and I wouldn't need to buy as many outfits. Fast forward to today, and that's why I still primarily wear black clothing. But there's more to the story.Fifteen years later, I'm not just dressing like the guy I saw in the gym. I look like him too. I'm the same age he was back then and have a very similar build.So, why am I telling you this story? It's because I wanted to highlight how important it is to have a vision for your life. Part of my vision was to look like that guy, and I put in the work to make it happen. But what is a vision? Your vision is a mission statement of what you want to accomplish in your life, both personally and professionally. This statement can be used as a guide when determining the career to pursue, making important life decisions, planning how you'll accomplish goals, and realizing your life dreams. If you don't have a vision yet, check out this handy guide that will walk you through the process.Need an example of how a vision can help with your professional life? Take a look at the image below (I posted this on Facebook and declared my intention to write for a well-known business publication).


My first Entrepreneur article was published just seven months later.Right now you could be seven months or fifteen years away from living in the vision you want for your life, but it all starts today.


How to get startedBlock off time to complete your vision exercise and share it with someone you trust for encouragement and accountability. And I know this may sound like fluff, but you'll be amazed at how many successful people got to where they are simply by having a clear vision of who they wanted to be, then putting in the work to make it happen. But if you can tolerate more fluff, here's one of my favorite quotes.""Everything is created twice, first in the mind and then in reality."" ― Robin SharmaSo don't miss out on this opportunity to document the vision for your life. If you block off just 30 minutes to write it down, you can radically shift and improve the next 30 years of your life.And if you like these exercises check out my free LinkedIn Learning course, Developing a High-Performance Entrepreneur Mindset.

105,How (and When) to Be Quiet as a Tactic for Motivating Teams and Negotiating Deals,"Jun 26, 2023","Sherry Walling, PhD",https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-silence-can-be-used-as-a-tactic-for-motivating-teams/453420,"
The world is getting louder. There is enough noise to make silence uncomfortable, and it affects our interactions. In conversation, loudness is perceived as powerful. In meetings, opinions are broadcast at high volumes. But there is a strong case for staying quiet, especially at work, and especially for business leaders looking to motivate teams or negotiate difficult deals.Entrepreneurs often assume their silence will be taken for indecisiveness. To understand the benefits of being quiet, it's helpful to unpack the minds of quiet people, including misperceptions.Related: Making The Case For 'Silent Leadership'



Quiet people are not always introvertsIntroverts are having a moment, with advocates like Susan Cain calling introversion a superpower, making the case that observers can better assess problems and digest information. Introversion and extroversion are personality types that remain fairly consistent throughout our lives. Though introverts focus more on silent contemplation, anyone can be quiet. Most of us manage to stay silent when circumstances call for observation more than outward reactions — in presentations or movie theatres, for instance.Unlike introversion, quietness is context-dependent, which means it can be used as a tactic.


Silence is not the absence of thoughtDuring meetings that call for brainstorming, it's easy to assume that quiet people are just taking up space. The myth that links silence to ineptness is shifting as awareness grows around power dynamics, diversity and inclusion, and psychological safety. When barriers prevent people from speaking, they must be addressed. Additionally, quiet people might need more time. Observers might be internal processors.We absorb information in accordance with our communication and learning styles. External processors speak through ideas as they come to mind. Thinking out loud helps them take in details and make decisions. Internal processors need to sit with all the data before saying anything.Processing styles can also be context-dependent, so consider which style works best for you in any given scenario. You might take more time to digest complicated problems brought to you by direct reports, for instance, but prefer to be vocal and collaborative during strategy sessions with peers.Related: 25 Ways to Lead, Inspire and Motivate Your Team to Greatness


You can become the strong, silent typeThe quiet tactic is most helpful when your thoughts are emotionally nuanced. If you disagree with a colleague's strategic direction, taking more time to percolate before briefing your team is a good idea. Compose yourself so you can appear outwardly positive when you discuss the changes.Stay quiet at times when negotiations will only happen once, like key hiring decisions. Verbal offers are tempting if you get along with the interviewee; it's often wise to wait until they've left to review qualifications from all the top candidates. Being quiet is also helpful when something upsets you, like a pitch that didn't land as you expected or rejected requests for budget increases. Remember the old idiom, ""It's better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt."" Silence allows you to regroup before agreeing to anything prematurely.Finally, stay quiet with your team. As a psychologist, I can vouch for this tactic, used often in classic psychoanalytic therapy. Most people fill uncomfortable silence, and whatever follows a pause is often vital. When leaders wait to speak or react, direct reports tend to blurt out what they are really thinking, add context to an earlier point or clarify something they have been replaying in their minds.Uncomfortable silence is also part of the sales process. When you leave space after pitching, you get the customer's perspective, reaction, and oftentimes, more details about their needs. This becomes data leveraged to close the sale.


Stay quiet as a tactic in your own work habits. Which scenarios call for listening more than talking?

107,Why Meeting Culture is Draining your Employee's Strength and Productivity,"Jun 20, 2023",Gergo Vari,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-meeting-culture-is-sapping-your-employees-strength/453485,"
Many of us treat our work calendars like a game of Tetris, cleanly lining up one meeting block upon the next with no space in between. Every minute counts, right? And ""busy"" tends to feel oh-so-productive.But while it's hard enough to break out of habits that feel how we think they should, it's even harder to break free from a company culture that has bought into the meeting vortex fallacy. Here's a look at why allowing your company culture to give your teams' brains time to digest after each meeting is crucial.Why back-to-back meetings are the straw that will break the camel's backWhen you couple the fast-paced world of startups — or the face-saving world of corporate environments — with the one-click convenience of calendar booking apps, our day-to-day can quickly end up packed without employees having a say. That leaves them gasping for air. What's more, when a growing share of meetings are happening online, time itself takes on a virtual quality as it becomes synonymous with the tools we use to manage it – and we wind up with ""virtually"" no time to do our actual job.



Without offering any resistance to these forces, it almost seems inevitable for companies to experience meeting bloat — often with the best intentions. Unfortunately, these same intentions are detrimental to productivity. It's time to challenge the status quo and offer our brains the breathing room they need.Much like a short period of rest between sets is built into every workout to optimize performance, transitioning from one meeting to the next requires a few minutes of recovery. Leaving out much-needed breaks takes a toll on our well-being. Just like our bodies, our brains need time to process and recharge. When we rush from one meeting to another, our stress levels compound, affecting our mental and physical health.


Related: Got Too Many Meetings? Here's How to Cut BackYou won't necessarily notice at the moment. On the contrary, grabbing a third cup of coffee and riding the stress wave to meeting number four may provide that rush that makes us feel like we're getting things done. Instead, this continuous attention shifting and the non-stop demand of high alertness strain our brain's capacity to adapt and perform optimally.The reason? Stress. Stress triggers the release of cortisol, the infamous stress hormone. Increased cortisol levels impede our ability to think clearly and compromise our immune system, making us more susceptible to illness. The overstimulation caused by unrelenting work schedules pushes us into a danger zone where problem-solving abilities are weakened, fatigue sets in and burnout becomes a haunting reality.Related: Telework Burnout and Zoom Fatigue: Much More Complicated Than They Appear


When meeting cultures are on auto-pilotIt's not just about high alertness and permanent hustle and bustle. The content of the meetings themselves matters too. Unproductive meetings are a significant source of stress, often leaving employees feeling drained and overwhelmed. These meetings, lacking agendas, moderators or clear goals, resemble aimless voyages through murky waters. The lack of structure and purpose eats away energy levels and harms productivity.Without a clear agenda, meetings begin to meander, with participants becoming more interested in their phones than their colleagues. The result is wasted time, missed opportunities for clarity and direction and a downward spiral of employee morale. Unsurprisingly, employees tend to leave such meetings feeling frustrated and unfulfilled. What, then, is the cure for presentations that are overstuffed with text and too long? It's simple: bite-size segments that show an overview of progress are infinitely more engaging.Furthermore, meetings quickly descend into chaos when there's no designated moderator or facilitator. Multiple team members with differing opinions and agendas pull a meeting in a dozen directions. Equally, numerous minutes of silence just waiting for the meeting to pass can turn meetings into a watched pot — and we all know that those never boil. A skilled moderator can steer discussions, keep participants on track and ensure everyone's perspectives are heard.The absence of clear goals in meetings creates ambiguity and confusion. Participants are left wondering why they were invited and what they are expected to contribute. This lack of purpose drains motivation and dampens creativity, leaving attendees feeling like they're going through the motions rather than making meaningful progress. It also makes them feel like they have to make up for lost time. And this, in turn, contributes to squeezing more meetings back into what is left on the calendar. It's a vicious cycle.


Related: Too Many Meetings Suffocate Productivity and MoraleLeaders need to leave their company's comfort zoneIf your work environment resembles a never-ending meeting marathon, and if too many of those meetings sound like people are just thinking out loud, it's time to evaluate these signs of an unproductive and overbooked workplace. The false notion that being busy means being productive is deeply flawed. It's time to shift our perspective and understand that productivity stems from efficiency, motivation, and a well-rested mind.Leaders play a crucial role in reshaping meeting culture within their organizations. By prioritizing their own well-being and assessing the impact of unrelenting schedules, they can set a new standard for healthier work environments. Leaders must have the courage to lead creatively, beyond the ""busy"" playbook — and not by showcasing their brutal schedules.Finally, leaders need to demonstrate the importance of boundaries and respecting everybody's time, prioritizing time for focused and deep work. Every meeting is a potential distraction, after all. Leading by example should mean empowering teams to schedule breaks between meetings — and to allow employees to politely decline meetings where they are not essential. By fostering a culture that values quality over quantity, leaders can create an environment where interests are put before positions and intention is valued over complicity.


Related: 5 Tips for Challenging Yourself to Perform Outside of Your Comfort ZoneInjecting breathing room in the meeting roomWhether it's a breather between meetings or a breath of fresh air in your meeting culture, chances are there are things you can do to improve productivity by tweaking your existing approach to meetings. It's too easy to get sucked into the prevalent meeting culture of back-to-back schedules and arid agendas. It may feel busy. And it may feel safe to avoid trying something new. But it will never amount to treating time with the respect it deserves — which is the real key to getting things done!Indeed, when you're stuck in a work environment where ""productive"" looks a little too much like ""busy"" and where ""booked out"" is considered ""efficient,"" it's time to make a change. Set your default meeting time to 25 minutes, leaving a 5-minute buffer between calls. Block times in your calendar. Say no to unnecessary invites. Ask for agendas upfront. Save meetings for the less energized afternoons. There is a long list of things you can do without much effort to help shield against the inertia of the downward meeting spiral.However, to instill a productive and healthy meeting culture across the organization, leaders must take responsibility for evaluating and prioritizing the well-being of their employees. By challenging the status quo and taking steps to improve meetings, such as setting clear agendas, appointing moderators, and defining goals and time constraints, they can foster a healthier and more efficient work environment.

109,"Junior Staff Are Struggling to Adjust to Flexible Schedules, But Forced In-Office Mandates Are Not The Answer — This Is.","Jun 16, 2023",Gleb Tsipursky,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/junior-staff-are-struggling-to-adjust-to-flexible-schedules/453875,"
In today's fast-paced business world, flexible work schedules have become increasingly popular, allowing employees to balance their professional and personal lives more effectively. However, with the rise of remote and hybrid work environments, one crucial aspect of employee development has taken a hit: mentoring. Recent findings by WFH Research, a group that includes Stanford University economist Nicholas Bloom and other scholars, show that on-site employees devote more time to mentoring and professional development than their remote counterparts. Namely, those who came to the office devoted about 40 more minutes a week to mentoring others, nearly 25 more in formal training and about 15 additional minutes each week doing professional development and learning activities.As a seasoned expert in helping leaders figure out a flexible return to office and hybrid work policy, I can attest that Bloom's research is spot on. When you just let things take their natural course, junior staff suffer. No wonder leaders who previously showed strong support for flexibility like Marc Benioff and Mark Zuckerberg changed their minds, at least about junior staff, pushing them to come to the office for three days a week — but also asking senior staff to come to the office to mentor recent hires.Mentoring: The missing link in flexible workUnfortunately, their proposed solution is wrong-headed. Mandating in-office attendance for most of the workweek is bound to lead to attrition, resistance, disengagement and lowered productivity. And it will not be very effective for mentoring, either. In the context of the return-to-office wars, senior staff especially resent coming to the office with the sole goal of mentoring junior staff by osmosis. They tend to go to their office or cubicle, shut their door and put on their headphones, and try to avoid interacting with anyone else. Junior staff is usually too intimidated by this obviously hostile and standoffish attitude and fails to get mentoring.



Instead, the solution is a structured mentoring program that embraces flexible schedules. Senior staff feels much less resentment about coming to the office once a week for several hours to do in-depth mentoring, along with some virtual mentoring sessions, compared to an obligation to come in three days a week for the weak soup of mentoring by osmosis.Picture a garden with an abundance of diverse and colorful plants. Each plant represents an employee, and the garden as a whole represents your organization. The sun, water, and nutrients these plants receive are akin to the mentoring and professional development opportunities that nourish your employees. Without these essential resources, the garden withers and fails to reach its full potential. Similarly, without a structured mentoring program, your employees' growth may be stunted, leading to a less vibrant and successful organization.


And it's not only the gardening metaphor that illustrates effective mentoring: a study by Charter and Qualtrics of 3,005 desk-based workers in the United States does so as well. They found that ""hybrid work does not limit the potential of mentoring"" and ""Successful mentoring relationships were similarly likely to occur if mentor and mentee met remotely [or in-person.""Similarly, the Harvard Business Review reports that ""many individuals incorrectly presume that physical proximity is essential in developmental relationships. But like work itself, mentoring is defined less by the medium in which it is accomplished than by the outcomes delivered."" If you have ""commitment, trust, relationship quality, and mentor competence,"" these ""are the real ingredients of developmental growth,"" and you can have these in both in-person and ""virtual mentorship.""But what is involved in a structured mentoring program of this sort?Related: CEOs Are Blaming The Need For Mentorship to Justify The Forced Return of All Employees. Reality Calls For a Very Different Approach.


Individual lunch sessions: Planting the seeds of trustOne-on-one in-person interactions with senior professionals serve as the sun in our garden analogy. These meetings foster personal bonding, vulnerability, psychological safety, and trust — the lifeblood of effective mentoring relationships.While these sessions are powerful, senior professionals' time is limited, and most want to minimize their time in the office. That's why it's essential to incorporate other mentoring activities.Virtual coffee meetings: Nurturing connections across the distanceImagine these virtual meetings as the water that sustains our garden. After trust has been established through in-person interactions, virtual coffee meetings with senior professionals offer a convenient and accessible way to maintain relationships.The lower time burden and flexibility of these meetings make them an attractive option for busy senior professionals, no matter where they are in the world. I'm not simply referring to traveling: Many senior professionals at my clients moved to more attractive locales during the pandemic and only came to the office for quarterly retreats. They were too high-value for my clients to pressure them to return to the office.


But, we ended up making arrangements where these senior professionals met their mentees during quarterly retreats and began their relationships in these intense bonding experiences. Then, they continued mentoring in these virtual meetings, having established the trust necessary to do so.Regardless of whether you do in-person or virtual meetings, make sure to do them often. Both my own experience with clients and the research by Charter and Qualtrics found it's key to have frequent check-ins between mentors and mentees. In fact, according to the study, ""Some 51% of very successful mentors meet with their mentees once a week or more often, compared to 37% for somewhat successful mentors.""Group lunch sessions: Cultivating collective wisdomGroup lunch sessions act like the fertile soil that supports the growth of your organization's garden. By engaging small groups of young employees with senior professionals, these sessions facilitate knowledge sharing and relationship building while making efficient use of senior professionals' time. Such gatherings allow the collective wisdom of your organization to flourish.Moreover, much like the pollinators in our garden, group mentoring sessions encourage the cross-pollination of ideas among a cohort of younger employees mentored by a senior employee. This approach fosters a collaborative learning environment of peer-based learning and reduces the burden on senior employees of teaching junior staff, promoting a thriving ecosystem within your organization.


Just like with one-on-one mentoring, group sessions are best started in person. Then, you can transition to remote once trust has built up.Coworking sessions: Encouraging organic knowledge transferImagine coworking sessions as the intertwined roots of plants in a vibrant garden. Just as these roots share nutrients and stabilize each other, coworking sessions present a unique opportunity for senior and junior employees to share knowledge and support each other. This shared workspace provides a fertile ground for collaboration, where ideas can germinate, blossom and bear the fruit of innovation.In-person coworking sessions, in particular, are akin to the roots that delve deep into the soil, drawing essential nutrients and establishing a robust foundation. These sessions offer the invaluable advantage of immediate feedback, allowing for real-time adjustments and refinements. The energy and spontaneity in these physical spaces spark creativity, much like the invigorating feel of the earth between a gardener's fingers.Virtual coworking sessions, on the other hand, are comparable to the surface roots that adapt to their environment, spreading out to absorb rainwater and sunlight. They offer the flexibility of connecting from anywhere, making them an excellent solution for remote work scenarios. These sessions remove geographical boundaries, enabling the exchange of diverse perspectives, much like the rain and sun that nurture a garden's growth. Unlike the one-on-one or group sessions, I haven't observed the need for trust-building through initial in-person coworking, making this activity an especially flexible tool for teams with some members who are fully remote.


What makes coworking sessions a win-win solution is the reduction of burden on senior employees. By encouraging shared workspaces, both physical and virtual, senior staff members can impart their wisdom and experience without overextending themselves. It's much like the way mature plants support the growth of younger ones in a garden without depleting their own resources. Ultimately, coworking sessions cultivate a culture of mutual learning and teamwork, laying the foundation for a thriving, resilient organization.Related: CEOs Are Blaming The Need For Mentorship to Justify The Forced Return of All Employees. Reality Calls For a Very Different Approach.Goal-oriented mentoring: Ensuring a fruitful harvestTo maximize the yield of our metaphorical garden, we must set clear goals and incentives for the mentoring program. This approach ensures that all parties are fully engaged and that the program is effective in fostering employee growth.Just as a gardener regularly prunes and assesses their plants' health, organizations must implement evaluations to monitor the progress and success of their mentoring initiatives. This process enables continuous improvement and helps your garden – or your organization – to flourish.


Again, the findings by Charter and Qualtrics supported these lessons from my work with clients. According to the study, ""Mentors in successful relationships are more likely to have this mentorship supported through compensation (27%, vs. 17% for less successful mentors), recognition in performance reviews (42% vs. 33%), and being provided time by their employer to mentor (39% vs. 33%).""Embrace structured mentoring for a thriving organizationAs the flexible work revolution continues to gain momentum, organizations must recognize the importance of structured mentoring programs. By incorporating a diverse range of mentoring activities, such as individual lunch sessions, virtual meetings, group sessions, coworking initiatives, goal-oriented mentoring, and regular evaluations, your organization can continue to thrive. It's like ensuring your garden has the right balance of sun, water, soil and care — it's not just about planting the seeds, it's about nurturing them to full bloom.Now, dear reader, it's your turn to take action. Consider your organization's current mentoring practices. Are they like a well-tended garden, ripe with the fruits of shared wisdom and mutual growth resulting from a structured mentoring program fit for flexible work? Or are they more like a plot of land full of random weeds resulting from mentoring the natural way — by osmosis? If you let nature take over, you deserve the outcome.As the flexible work landscape continues to evolve, remember that the roots of success lie in a robust mentoring program. Embrace this opportunity and watch your organization bloom. After all, a garden full of thriving plants is much more satisfying and beautiful than a barren field. Nurture your employees like a diligent gardener, and you'll reap the rewards of a vibrant, successful flexible organization.
